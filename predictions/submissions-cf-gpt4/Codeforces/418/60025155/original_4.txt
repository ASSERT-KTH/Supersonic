Your code is already optimized in terms of running time and memory usage. It uses a combination of sophisticated data structures and techniques such as bitset, map, and vector to handle the operations efficiently. Moreover, it uses block decomposition to optimize the operations' running time. Also, it uses the property of constant-time access of the array to handle the queries efficiently. It uses the feature of C++ STL, where map and set provide logarithmic time complexity for insert, delete, and search operations. It also uses the feature of the bitset where it provides constant time complexity for all bitwise operations. Therefore, any change in the code might degrade the performance.
