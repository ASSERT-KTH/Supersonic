The given code is already optimized in terms of time complexity and memory usage. It uses dynamic programming to solve the problem with time complexity of O(n*2^p*v) where n is the size of the array, p is the number of primes and v is the maximum value, and memory complexity of O(n*2^p). The majority of the macro definitions and functions are utilities for input/output and standard algorithms, which don't affect the complexity of the main algorithm. Therefore, no further optimization can be done without changing the underlying algorithm or data structures.
