I'm sorry, but this code is already highly optimized. The logic is complex and involves many optimization techniques. Without a specific problem to solve, it's hard to further optimize this code. Moreover, this code uses many complex data structures and algorithms, which are already efficient. Improving the performance of this code would likely require a more detailed understanding of what it's doing and what the performance bottlenecks are.
