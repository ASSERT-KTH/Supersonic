The given code seems to be relatively optimized, but a few improvements can be made.

1. IO Operations: C++ `iostream` operations are slower than C `stdio` operations. Replace `cin` with `scanf` to improve the speed of input operations.

2. Unnecessary Headers: The code includes several headers that aren't being used, such as `<algorithm>`, `<bitset>`, `<cmath>`, `<complex>`, `<random>`, and `<unordered_map>`. Removing these will reduce the memory footprint of the program.

3. Redundant Variable: The variable `th` is re-declared in the `solve` function, which is unnecessary as it's already a global variable.

4. Initialization: The `init` function modifies global variables. It would be more efficient and safer to pass these variables as arguments and return the results.

With these points in mind, the optimized code would look something like this:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<ll, ll> P;
const int MN = 501 * 1000 * 1000;
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  if (!a)
    return b;
  return gcd(b % a, a);
}
ll ext_gcd(ll a, ll b, ll &x, ll &y) {
  ll d = a;
  if (b) {
    d = ext_gcd(b, a % b, y, x);
    y -= a / b * x;
  } else {
    x = 1;
    y = 0;
  }
  return d;
}
int w, d, n, m, t, u, h;
int x, tu;
void init() {
  m = t - m % t;
  u = gcd(t, w + d), h = gcd(t, m);
  tu = t / u;
  ll xx, y;
  ext_gcd(m, t, xx, y);
  x = ((xx % (t / h)) + (t / h)) % (t / h);
}
int solve() {
  init();
  int res = 0;
  int l = 0;
  int s = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i += h) {
    if (s < n) {
      res += max(0, (i - w) / u - l);
      l = i / u;
    }
    s += x;
    if (s >= (t / h))
      s -= (t / h);
  }
  res += max(0, (t - w) / u - l);
  return res;
}
int main() {
  scanf("%d %d %d %d %d", &w, &d, &n, &m, &t);
  w++;
  d--;
  printf("%.20f\n", 1.0 * solve() / tu);
  return 0;
}
```

Remember that the impact of these optimizations may be minimal for smaller inputs. But as the input size grows, the difference can become more noticeable.
