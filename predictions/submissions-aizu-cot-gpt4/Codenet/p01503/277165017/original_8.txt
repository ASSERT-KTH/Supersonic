The given code seems to be well written without any obvious inefficiencies. However, there are a few minor modifications that can be done to slightly improve the performance of the code. 

1. Avoiding unnecessary computations: In the function solve(), the variable "th" is computed twice, once inside the function and once inside the function init(). By removing the computation of "th" inside the function solve(), we can avoid unnecessary computation.

2. Inline small functions: The functions gcd() and ext_gcd() are small and can be inlined to save the overhead of function calls. The inline keyword is a suggestion to the compiler that it should attempt to generate code (inline) that is equivalent to the function's body instead of generating code that calls the function in the traditional manner.

3. Use cin/cout efficiently: The cin and cout in C++ are slower than scanf and printf in C. This is because cin/cout in C++ are synchronized with the C standard streams stdin and stdout by default, and this makes them slower. We can turn off the synchronization using the statement "ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);".

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <cassert>
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <random>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<ll, ll> P;
const int MN = 501 * 1000 * 1000;
inline ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  if (!a)
    return b;
  return gcd(b % a, a);
}
inline ll ext_gcd(ll a, ll b, ll &x, ll &y) {
  ll d = a;
  if (b) {
    d = ext_gcd(b, a % b, y, x);
    y -= a / b * x;
  } else {
    x = 1;
    y = 0;
  }
  return d;
}
int w, d, n, m, t, u, h;
int x, tu, th;
void init() {
  m = t - m % t;
  u = gcd(t, w + d), h = gcd(t, m);
  tu = t / u;
  th = t / h;
  ll xx, y;
  ext_gcd(m, t, xx, y);
  x = ((xx % th) + th) % th;
}
int solve() {
  init();
  int res = 0;
  int l = 0;
  int s = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i += h) {
    if (s < n) {
      res += max(0, (i - w) / u - l);
      l = i / u;
    }
    s += x;
    if (s >= th)
      s -= th;
  }
  res += max(0, (t - w) / u - l);
  return res;
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cin >> w >> d >> n >> m >> t;
  w++;
  d--;
  printf("%.20f\n", 1.0 * solve() / tu);
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations might not make a noticeable difference in a small program like this. The effectiveness of these optimizations will be more noticeable in larger, more complex programs.
