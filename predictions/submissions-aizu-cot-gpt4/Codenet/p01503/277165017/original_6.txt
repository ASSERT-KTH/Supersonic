The given program is quite optimized, but there are several points where it can be slightly improved. The steps for the optimization are as follows:

1. Only include libraries that you need: There are several libraries included in the program that are not used in the code. Removing these unnecessary includes can reduce the compilation time.

2. Minimize I/O operations: Instead of using cin and cout which are slower, you can use faster I/O methods like scanf and printf.

3. Minimize function calls: The gcd function is called multiple times in the code. Instead of calling gcd separately, you can call it once and store its result in a variable. Then, use this variable whenever needed.

4. Combine variable declarations: Instead of declaring variables separately, you can declare them together if they are of the same type to save memory.

5. Minimize the use of global variables: Global variables consume memory for the whole program's duration. If possible, use local variables instead to save memory.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
typedef long long ll;
const int MN = 501 * 1000 * 1000;

ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  if (!a)
    return b;
  return gcd(b % a, a);
}

ll ext_gcd(ll a, ll b, ll &x, ll &y) {
  ll d = a;
  if (b) {
    d = ext_gcd(b, a % b, y, x);
    y -= a / b * x;
  } else {
    x = 1;
    y = 0;
  }
  return d;
}

int main() {
  int w, d, n, m, t, u, h, x, tu, th, l = 0, s = 0;
  scanf("%d %d %d %d %d", &w, &d, &n, &m, &t);
  w++;
  d--;
  m = t - m % t;
  u = gcd(t, w + d), h = gcd(t, m);
  tu = t / u;
  th = t / h;
  ll xx, y;
  ext_gcd(m, t, xx, y);
  x = ((xx % th) + th) % th;
  int res = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i += h) {
    if (s < n) {
      res += max(0, (i - w) / u - l);
      l = i / u;
    }
    s += x;
    if (s >= th)
      s -= th;
  }
  res += max(0, (t - w) / u - l);
  printf("%.20f\n", 1.0 * res / tu);
  return 0;
}
```

Note: Optimizations can sometimes make the code less readable. Make sure to comment your code to provide clarity.
