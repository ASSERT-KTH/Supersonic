This program is already quite optimized. In this program, the Euclidean algorithm is used to calculate the GCD of two numbers, which is the most efficient algorithm for calculating GCD. However, there are still a few places where we can make minor adjustments to improve the performance of the program.

1. Remove unused include statements: The program has included several libraries that are not used in the program. By removing these unnecessary includes, we reduce the compilation time and memory usage of the program.

2. Avoid unnecessary calculations in the loop: In the solve() function, the value of "th" is calculated twice, once before the loop and once inside the loop. We can calculate it only once and use the value in the loop, which will reduce the number of calculations.

3. Replace printf with cout: printf is a C function while cout is a C++ object. In C++, cout is generally faster than printf. 

Here is the optimized program:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int MN = 501 * 1000 * 1000;
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  if (!a)
    return b;
  return gcd(b % a, a);
}
ll ext_gcd(ll a, ll b, ll &x, ll &y) {
  ll d = a;
  if (b) {
    d = ext_gcd(b, a % b, y, x);
    y -= a / b * x;
  } else {
    x = 1;
    y = 0;
  }
  return d;
}
int w, d, n, m, t, u, h;
int x, tu, th;
void init() {
  m = t - m % t;
  u = gcd(t, w + d), h = gcd(t, m);
  tu = t / u;
  th = t / h;
  ll xx, y;
  ext_gcd(m, t, xx, y);
  x = ((xx % th) + th) % th;
}
int solve() {
  init();
  int res = 0;
  int l = 0;
  int s = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i += h) {
    if (s < n) {
      res += max(0, (i - w) / u - l);
      l = i / u;
    }
    s += x;
    if (s >= th)
      s -= th;
  }
  res += max(0, (t - w) / u - l);
  return res;
}
int main() {
  cin >> w >> d >> n >> m >> t;
  w++;
  d--;
  cout.precision(20);
  cout << static_cast<double>(solve()) / tu << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
