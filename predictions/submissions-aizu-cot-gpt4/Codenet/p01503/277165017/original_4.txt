Here are some optimization steps for the given C/C++ program.

1. Remove Unused Libraries: We can remove unused libraries like `bitset`, `complex`, `random`, `unordered_map`, `vector`, `algorithm`, `cassert`, `cmath` as these libraries are not used in this program. Including unused libraries can slow down the compilation process and increase the size of the executable file.

2. Use Fast Input/Output Methods: Instead of `cin` and `cout`, we can use `scanf` and `printf` which are faster for input and output operations.

3. Avoid Global Variables: Global variables increase the complexity of the program and can lead to memory leaks. In the given program, we don't need all the global variables. We can declare them inside the function where they are used.

4. Avoid Division: Division is slower than multiplication. We can replace division with multiplication by the reciprocal where we can. For example, `1.0 * solve() / tu` can be written as `1.0 * solve() * (1.0 / tu)`.

5. Use Pre-Increment Operator: Pre-increment operator (++i) is faster than post-increment operator (i++) because post-increment involves copying of value which means extra operation.

6. Avoid Expensive Operations Inside Loop: Avoiding expensive operations inside the loop can greatly speed up the program. In the given code, the value of `th = t / h` is calculated inside the loop. We can move it outside the loop as it is a constant value.

Here is the optimized version of the given program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

typedef long long ll;

ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  if (!a)
    return b;
  return gcd(b % a, a);
}

ll ext_gcd(ll a, ll b, ll &x, ll &y) {
  ll d = a;
  if (b) {
    d = ext_gcd(b, a % b, y, x);
    y -= a / b * x;
  } else {
    x = 1;
    y = 0;
  }
  return d;
}

int solve(int w, int d, int n, int m, int t) {
  m = t - m % t;
  int u = gcd(t, w + d);
  int h = gcd(t, m);
  int tu = t / u;
  int th = t / h;
  ll xx, y;
  ext_gcd(m, t, xx, y);
  int x = ((xx % th) + th) % th;
  
  int res = 0;
  int l = 0;
  int s = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i += h) {
    if (s < n) {
      res += max(0, (i - w) / u - l);
      l = i / u;
    }
    s += x;
    if (s >= th)
      s -= th;
  }
  res += max(0, (t - w) / u - l);
  
  return res;
}

int main() {
  int w, d, n, m, t;
  scanf("%d %d %d %d %d", &w, &d, &n, &m, &t);
  
  w++;
  d--;
  
  int result = solve(w, d, n, m, t);
  int u = gcd(t, w + d);
  int tu = t / u;
  
  printf("%.20f\n", 1.0 * result * (1.0 / tu));
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The optimized program assumes that the input values are integers. If the inputs can be floating-point numbers, we need to use `double` instead of `int` and `scanf("%lf", &var)` instead of `scanf("%d", &var)`.
