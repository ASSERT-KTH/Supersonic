The program calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Extended GCD of several numbers. There are several ways to optimize this program:

1. Using the iterative approach for calculating GCD instead of recursive will reduce the risk of stack overflow for large inputs. This will also reduce the overhead of function calls, therefore potentially improving running time.

2. Variables `w`, `d`, `n`, `m`, `t`, `u`, `h`, `tu`, `th`, and `x` are global and are used in multiple functions. Making these variables local and passing them as arguments to functions would make the program safer and potentially faster, because it would reduce the risk of unintended side effects from changing global variables. However, in this case, the program is straightforward, and there are no risks of such side effects. Therefore, for the sake of simplicity, we will keep these variables global.

3. The `ext_gcd` function is used to calculate the extended GCD and two additional values. However, these two additional values are not used in other parts of the program, so it would be more efficient to modify the function to only calculate the extended GCD and return it.

4. The `init` function is called only once, and its result is not used elsewhere. We can merge it with `solve` function to avoid unnecessary function call.

5. The `solve` function calculates the result and then prints it. It would be more efficient to print the result directly to avoid storing it in memory. 

Optimized Program:

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  while (b) {
    a %= b;
    swap(a, b);
  }
  return a;
}

int main() {
  int w, d, n, m, t, u, h;
  int x, tu, th;
  cin >> w >> d >> n >> m >> t;
  w++;
  d--;

  m = t - m % t;
  u = gcd(t, w + d), h = gcd(t, m);
  tu = t / u;
  th = t / h;

  ll xx, y;
  xx = m / gcd(m, t);
  x = ((xx % th) + th) % th;

  int res = 0;
  int l = 0;
  int s = 0;
  th = t / h;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i += h) {
    if (s < n) {
      res += max(0, (i - w) / u - l);
      l = i / u;
    }
    s += x;
    if (s >= th)
      s -= th;
  }
  res += max(0, (t - w) / u - l);

  printf("%.20f\n", 1.0 * res / tu);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program should be faster and use less memory than the original version.
