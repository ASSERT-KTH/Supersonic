Here are the steps of optimization:

1. Remove unused libraries: The first and most immediate optimization that can be done is removing the unused libraries. Unused libraries take up unnecessary space and can slow down the compilation time. In this case, libraries like `<bitset>`, `<cmath>`, `<complex>`, `<random>`, `<unordered_map>` and `<vector>` are not used and can be removed.

2. Variables declaration: Declaring multiple variables of the same type in a single line can make the code more efficient and easier to read. While this does not necessarily optimize memory use or runtime, it does optimize readability and maintainability of your code. 

3. Reuse of computed values: In the `solve()` function, the variable `th` is computed twice. This is unnecessary, and the computed value from the `init()` function can be used.

4. Reducing the scope of variables: Some variables are declared at the global scope where they could instead be declared in a more limited scope. This can make the code more efficient, easier to maintain, and less error-prone.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<ll, ll> P;

const int MN = 501 * 1000 * 1000;

ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  if (!a)
    return b;
  return gcd(b % a, a);
}

ll ext_gcd(ll a, ll b, ll &x, ll &y) {
  ll d = a;
  if (b) {
    d = ext_gcd(b, a % b, y, x);
    y -= a / b * x;
  } else {
    x = 1;
    y = 0;
  }
  return d;
}

int solve() {
  int w, d, n, m, t, u, h, x, tu, th;
  cin >> w >> d >> n >> m >> t;
  w++;
  d--;

  m = t - m % t;
  u = gcd(t, w + d), h = gcd(t, m);
  tu = t / u;
  th = t / h;
  ll xx, y;
  ext_gcd(m, t, xx, y);
  x = ((xx % th) + th) % th;

  int res = 0;
  int l = 0;
  int s = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i += h) {
    if (s < n) {
      res += max(0, (i - w) / u - l);
      l = i / u;
    }
    s += x;
    if (s >= th)
      s -= th;
  }
  res += max(0, (t - w) / u - l);
  return res;
}

int main() {
  printf("%.20f\n", 1.0 * solve() );
  return 0;
}
```

Remember that optimization tends to make code harder to read and maintain, so it's often a trade-off. It's usually a good idea to only optimize when necessary, and to always keep readability and maintainability in mind.
