The given C/C++ program is finding the maximum weight that can be carried in 'k' iterations. It's using binary search to find the optimal weight and function 'check' to validate it. 

Here are the steps to optimize the code:

1. Avoid using Variable Length Arrays(VLA): In C++, VLA is not part of the standard, it is a compiler extension. It's better to use standard compliant code for portability across different compilers. We will replace the VLA with a dynamic array using 'new' keyword.

2. Use Faster I/O: The `scanf` and `printf` are faster than `cin` and `cout`. When dealing with large inputs, it's better to use these for faster I/O operations.

3. Avoid repeated calculations: In the 'check' function, we are checking 'i==n' in every iteration which is not necessary. We can avoid this by checking this condition outside the inner while loop.

4. Use bitwise shift for division: Division operation is slower than bitwise operations. If we are dividing by 2, we can use right shift operation which is faster.

Now let's apply these optimizations to our code.

```
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
int check(int N[], int n, int k, int w) {
  int i = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
    int s = 0;
    while (i < n && s + N[i] <= w) {
      s += N[i];
      ++i;
    }
  }
  return i;
}
int main() {
  int MAX_W = 1000000000;
  int n, k;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);
  int* N = new int[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &N[i]);
  }
  int left = 0;
  int right = MAX_W;
  while (left < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) >> 1;
    if (check(N, n, k, mid) >= n) {
      right = mid;
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", right);
  delete [] N;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code will have a better runtime and memory usage as compared to the original.
