The original program reads a list of integers from the standard input, then calculates and prints a result based on this input. Here are some optimization steps:

1. Pass by reference in the functions: The `vector<int> W` is passed by value to `IsAllLoaded()` and `Calc()` functions which means that a new copy of this vector is created every time these functions are called. This can be optimized by passing the vector by reference to prevent unnecessary copying. It will reduce both running time and memory usage.

2. Reserve memory for the vector: In the `Input()` function, it's possible to reserve memory for the vector `W` before pushing back the elements. It will prevent multiple reallocations of memory when the vector grows, thus improving the running time.

3. Remove unnecessary variable: The `i` counter in the `IsAllLoaded()` function is not really needed, as the `for` loop can work with `auto` and directly iterate over the vector elements.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> Input(const int n) {
  vector<int> W;
  W.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int w;
    cin >> w;
    W.push_back(w);
  }
  return W;
}

bool IsAllLoaded(int P, vector<int>& W, int k) {
  int TrackIndex = 0;
  int CurrentSum = 0;
  for (const auto& w : W) {
    if (w > P) {
      return false;
    }
    if (CurrentSum + w > P) {
      TrackIndex++;
      if (TrackIndex == k) {
        return false;
      }
      CurrentSum = 0;
    }
    CurrentSum += w;
  }
  return true;
}

int Calc(vector<int>& W, int k) {
  int Sum = accumulate(W.begin(), W.end(), 0);
  int P = (Sum + k - 1) / k;
  while (!IsAllLoaded(P, W, k)) {
    P++;
  }
  return P;
}

int main() {
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  vector<int> W = Input(n);
  int P = Calc(W, k);
  cout << P << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations are relatively minor and might not lead to a significant improvement in performance for small inputs. However, for larger inputs, these optimizations could lead to noticeable improvements.
