This program contains several areas that can be optimized for both speed and memory usage:

1. **Passing vectors by reference:** In the functions `Input`, `IsAllLoaded`, and `Calc`, the vector `W` is passed by value, which makes a copy of the entire vector. This can be quite expensive in terms of both time and memory, especially for large vectors. Instead, we can pass the vector by reference, which avoids this copy.

2. **Reserving space for the vector:** In the `Input` function, we know in advance how many elements we are going to add to the vector `W`. We can reserve this space in advance using the `vector::reserve` function. This will prevent multiple reallocations as we add elements to the vector.

3. **Avoiding the use of `vector::push_back`:** In the `Input` function, we use `vector::push_back` to add elements to the vector. However, this function can cause a reallocation of the vector if its capacity is exceeded. Since we know the size of the vector in advance, we can avoid this by using `vector::operator[]` instead.

4. **Avoiding unnecessary calculations:** In the `Calc` function, we calculate the sum of the elements in the vector `W` in order to find the initial value of `P`. However, we can calculate this sum in the `Input` function as we read the elements, which avoids iterating over the vector again.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

pair<vector<int>, int> Input(const int n) {
  vector<int> W(n);
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> W[i];
    sum += W[i];
  }
  return make_pair(W, sum);
}

bool IsAllLoaded(int P, const vector<int>& W, int k) {
  int TrackIndex = 0;
  int CurrentSum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < W.size(); i++) {
    if (W[i] > P) {
      return false;
    }
    if (CurrentSum + W[i] > P) {
      TrackIndex++;
      if (TrackIndex == k) {
        return false;
      }
      CurrentSum = 0;
    }
    CurrentSum += W[i];
  }
  return true;
}

int Calc(const vector<int>& W, int sum, int k) {
  int P = (sum + k - 1) / k;
  while (!IsAllLoaded(P, W, k)) {
    P++;
  }
  return P;
}

int main() {
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  auto [W, sum] = Input(n);
  int P = Calc(W, sum, k);
  cout << P << endl;
  return 0;
}
