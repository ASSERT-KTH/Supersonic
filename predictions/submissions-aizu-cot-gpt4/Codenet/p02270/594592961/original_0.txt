We can optimize this program in several steps:

1. **Passing vector by reference**: In the function `IsAllLoaded()`, the vector `W` is passed by value, which means the whole vector is copied every time the function is called. This can be quite expensive in terms of both memory and time, especially if the vector is large. Therefore, we will modify this function to take the vector by reference instead. This will significantly improve performance if the vector is large.

2. **Reserve vector memory**: In the `Input()` function, the vector starts with a size of 0 and then its size increases each time a new element is added with `push_back()`. Each time the size increases, there might be a need to reallocate the memory, which can be expensive in terms of time. Therefore, we will use the `reserve()` function to preallocate the memory for the vector. This could potentially speed up the program if the vector is large.

3. **Use const where possible**: In the `IsAllLoaded()` function, the arguments `P` and `k` are not modified and should therefore be declared as `const`. This allows the compiler to make some optimizations.

After these optimizations, the code becomes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> Input(const int n) {
  vector<int> W;
  W.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int w;
    cin >> w;
    W.push_back(w);
  }
  return W;
}

bool IsAllLoaded(const int P, const vector<int>& W, const int k) {
  int TrackIndex = 0;
  int CurrentSum = 0;
  int i = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < W.size(); i++) {
    if (W[i] > P) {
      return false;
    }
    if (CurrentSum + W[i] > P) {
      TrackIndex++;
      if (TrackIndex == k) {
        return false;
      }
      CurrentSum = 0;
    }
    CurrentSum += W[i];
  }
  return true;
}

int Calc(vector<int>& W, int k) {
  int Sum = accumulate(W.begin(), W.end(), 0);
  int P = (Sum + k - 1) / k;
  while (!IsAllLoaded(P, W, k)) {
    P++;
  }
  return P;
}

int main() {
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  vector<int> W = Input(n);
  int P = Calc(W, k);
  cout << P << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Note: These optimizations are mainly for performance improvement. The functionality of the program remains the same. The optimized program should run faster and use less memory, especially if the input vector is large.
