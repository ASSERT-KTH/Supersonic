The given C/C++ program is already quite efficient. However, there are still a few small things we can do to optimize it further.

1. In the function "canAlloc", there is a condition "if (alloced_in_one + weight[i] <= capacity)". Instead of adding "alloced_in_one" and "weight[i]" and then comparing it to the capacity, we can directly compare "weight[i]" with "capacity - alloced_in_one". This will save some time in execution as subtraction is faster than addition.

2. Also, in the same function, the decrement of "i" and then incrementing it in the next iteration of the loop is unnecessary and can be removed.

3. The function "scanf" is slower than other input methods. So, if the size of input data is large, we can use faster input methods like "getchar_unlocked()". But this function is not standard and can only be used if the input data size is too large.

4. We can also use "ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)" and "cin.tie(NULL)" to speed up the cin and cout operations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX_PACKET 100000
int num_packet;
int num_track;
int weight[MAX_PACKET];
bool canAlloc(long capacity);
int main(void) {
  scanf("%d %d", &num_packet, &num_track);
  int max_weight = 0;
  long sum_weight = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < num_packet; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &weight[i]);
    if (weight[i] > max_weight) {
      max_weight = weight[i];
    }
    sum_weight += weight[i];
  }
  long low = max_weight;
  long upp = sum_weight;
  while (low < upp) {
    long mid = (low + upp) / 2;
    if (canAlloc(mid)) {
      upp = mid;
    } else {
      low = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%ld\n", low);
  return 0;
}
bool canAlloc(long capacity) {
  long alloced_in_one = 0;
  int track_id = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < num_packet; i++) {
    if (weight[i] <= capacity - alloced_in_one) {
      alloced_in_one += weight[i];
    } else {
      alloced_in_one = 0;
      if (++track_id == num_track) {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```

Remember, these optimizations will only have a noticeable impact on the program's execution time if the input data size is large.
