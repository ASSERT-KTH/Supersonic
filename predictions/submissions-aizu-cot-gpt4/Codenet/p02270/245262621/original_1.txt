The given program is a binary search-based solution for a problem where you have to divide a set of packets into tracks. Here is the optimized version of the original program:

Optimization Steps:
1. Instead of using an array to store the weight of packets, we can use vector which dynamically allocates memory. This will save memory when the number of packets is less than MAX_PACKET.
2. Avoid using global variables. Pass them as arguments to the functions instead.
3. Instead of using division to calculate mid (`long mid = (low + upp) / 2;`), use a bit shift operation. This operation is faster as compared to division.
4. Inside canAlloc function, avoid decrementing "i" (`i--`) when the packet weight does not fit into the current track. Instead, use a while loop to keep adding packet weights to a track until it can't hold more.
5. Use "early return" in canAlloc function. If the capacity of the track is less than the packet's weight at any point, then return false immediately.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool canAlloc(vector<int>& weight, int num_packet, int num_track, long capacity) {
  int i = 0, track_id = 0;
  long alloced_in_one = 0;
  
  while (i < num_packet) {
    if (weight[i] > capacity) {
      return false;
    }
    while (i < num_packet && alloced_in_one + weight[i] <= capacity) {
      alloced_in_one += weight[i];
      i++;
    }
    alloced_in_one = 0;
    if (++track_id > num_track) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

int main(void) {
  int num_packet, num_track;
  cin >> num_packet >> num_track;
  vector<int> weight(num_packet);
  
  int max_weight = 0;
  long sum_weight = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < num_packet; i++) {
    cin >> weight[i];
    if (weight[i] > max_weight) {
      max_weight = weight[i];
    }
    sum_weight += weight[i];
  }
  
  long low = max_weight, upp = sum_weight;

  while (low < upp) {
    long mid = low + ((upp - low) >> 1);
    if (canAlloc(weight, num_packet, num_track, mid)) {
      upp = mid;
    } else {
      low = mid + 1;
    }
  }

  cout << low << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
