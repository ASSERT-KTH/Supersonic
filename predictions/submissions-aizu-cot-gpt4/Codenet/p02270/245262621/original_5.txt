Step 1: Use prefix sum to reduce the time complexity of `canAlloc` function. In the original program, `canAlloc` function has time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of packets. We can use prefix sum to record the total weight of packets from the first packet to the current packet. Then we can find out whether a packet can be allocated in a track by comparing the prefix sum of the current packet and the prefix sum of the last allocated packet.

Step 2: Use binary search in prefix sum to further optimize `canAlloc` function. Instead of linearly searching for the next packet that cannot be allocated in the current track, we can use binary search in the prefix sum to find out the next packet.

Now, let's optimize the program:

```
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX_PACKET 100000
int num_packet;
int num_track;
int weight[MAX_PACKET];
long prefix_sum[MAX_PACKET + 1];
bool canAlloc(long capacity);
int main(void) {
  int i;
  scanf("%d %d", &num_packet, &num_track);
  int max_weight = 0;
  long sum_weight = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < num_packet; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &weight[i]);
    sum_weight += weight[i];
    prefix_sum[i + 1] = sum_weight;
    if (weight[i] > max_weight) {
      max_weight = weight[i];
    }
  }
  long low = max_weight;
  long upp = sum_weight;
  while (low < upp) {
    long mid = (low + upp) / 2;
    if (canAlloc(mid)) {
      upp = mid;
    } else {
      low = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%ld\n", low);
  return 0;
}
bool canAlloc(long capacity) {
  int track_id = 0;
  int last_alloc = 0;
  for (; track_id < num_track; track_id++) {
    int left = last_alloc;
    int right = num_packet;
    while (left < right) {
      int mid = (left + right + 1) / 2;
      if (prefix_sum[mid] - prefix_sum[last_alloc] <= capacity) {
        left = mid;
      } else {
        right = mid - 1;
      }
    }
    if (left == last_alloc) {
      return false;
    }
    last_alloc = left;
  }
  return last_alloc == num_packet;
}
```

This optimized program reduces the time complexity of `canAlloc` function from O(n) to O(log n), thus significantly improving the running time. As for memory usage, it uses an extra array to store the prefix sum, which increases the memory usage slightly. However, since it reduces the time complexity significantly, it can be considered as an overall optimization.
