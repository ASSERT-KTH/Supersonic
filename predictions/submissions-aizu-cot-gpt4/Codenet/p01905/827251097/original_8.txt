The given program is already quite optimized. It's a simple program that reads two integers from the standard input, computes the difference minus one, and writes it to the standard output. 
However, there is a minor optimization that can be done. 

The header file `<bits/stdc++.h>` includes essentially all standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation time. It is better to only include the necessary headers. In this case, we only need `<stdio.h>` for input/output functions.

Here's the optimized version:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
  printf("%d\n", n - m - 1);
}
```

Another thing to note here is that the complexity of this program is already O(1) for time and memory. This is because the number of operations and the amount of memory used do not depend on the size of the input.
