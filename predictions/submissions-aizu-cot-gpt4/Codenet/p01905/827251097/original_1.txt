The provided C++ code is already quite optimal and there isn't much room for further optimization, as it's a direct operation without any loops or recursive calls. However, there are a couple of changes that could be made to slightly optimize it:

1. The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes almost every standard library. Including this entire library can slow down the compilation process. Hence, including only necessary headers, i.e., `stdio.h` could save some compilation time.

2. The use of `scanf` and `printf` for I/O operations is more efficient than using `cin` and `cout`. So, no changes will be made here.

Now let's modify the program accordingly:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, m;
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
    printf("%d\n", n - m - 1);
    return 0;
}
```
Please note that this program is already highly efficient, and these optimizations will only affect the compilation time, not the runtime of the program.
