This program is already quite optimized, but there are still a few small improvements that can be made.

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is quite large and it includes a lot of unnecessary stuff. It's better to include only the specific standard libraries that you need. In this case, we can include `#include <cstdio>` instead, since we are only using `scanf` and `printf`.

2. Remove the newline character in `printf`: It's not a big deal, but if you want to really optimize, you can remove the newline character (`\n`). It takes a little bit of time to print a newline character. If you don't need it, you can remove it.

3. Use `iostream` instead of `cstdio`: This is more of a style preference, but some people find `iostream` to be more modern and easier to use than `cstdio`. If you prefer, you can use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`. However, note that this might not necessarily result in faster execution time. In fact, `scanf` and `printf` are usually faster than `cin` and `cout`.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
  printf("%d", n - m - 1);
}
```
Remember, these optimizations are very minor and will likely not result in a noticeable difference in running time or memory usage. This program is already very simple and efficient.
