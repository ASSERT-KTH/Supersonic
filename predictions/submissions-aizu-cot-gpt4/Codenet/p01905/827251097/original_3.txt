The program is already quite optimized and doesn't provide much room for improvement. It reads two integers from the standard input, calculates the difference minus 1, and prints it to the standard output.

However, one minor point, although not directly related to runtime and memory optimization, is for code quality and portability: the usage of #include <bits/stdc++.h> is not recommended. This header file is not standard, it's actually a GCC extension. It includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can slow down the compilation time. It's better to include only the headers that are actually needed. In this case, we only need <stdio.h> for printf() and scanf().

Here's the slightly improved version:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
  printf("%d\n", n - m - 1);
}
```
This doesn't really optimize running time or memory usage, but it does improve code quality and portability.
