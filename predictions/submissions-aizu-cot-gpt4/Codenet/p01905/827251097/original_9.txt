The program you have given is quite simple and doesn't have much room for optimization in terms of memory or computational performance. It is already performing in O(1) time complexity and using a very small amount of memory. The steps it performs are:

1. Declaring two integer variables.
2. Reading two integers from standard input.
3. Subtracting one from the other, and then subtracting 1.
4. Printing the result.

However, the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` directive is not recommended in most cases because it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can slow down the compilation process. Instead, we should include only the necessary headers: `<stdio.h>` in this case.

Optimization steps:

1. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with `#include <stdio.h>`

Optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
  printf("%d\n", n - m - 1);
}
```

This change will not affect the runtime of the program but can speed up the compilation process, especially for larger projects.
