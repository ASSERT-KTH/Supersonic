The given program is already quite optimized in terms of running time and memory usage. It only performs a few simple operations: reading two integers from standard input, subtracting them, and printing the result.

One tiny improvement we can make is to eliminate the use of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file. This is a non-standard header file that includes nearly all standard C++ headers. Including it may slow down the compilation time, especially in larger programs. It also makes it harder to determine which specific headers are actually needed.

In this case, we only need to include the `<stdio.h>` or `<cstdio>` header for the `scanf` and `printf` functions.

Optimized program:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
  printf("%d\n", n - m - 1);
}
```

This program will compile faster and gives a clear indication of which headers are being used. It should be noted that this optimization is more about good coding practices than improving runtime or memory efficiency, as the original program is already quite efficient in these respects.
