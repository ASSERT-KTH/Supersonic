The given C++ program is quite simple and already optimized in terms of its purpose. It reads two integers from standard input and outputs the difference of the two integers minus one. However, the usage of `<bits/stdc++.h>` is not recommended as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers that will slow down the compilation process. 

Also, we can use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up I/O operations. This line makes input/output more efficient by decoupling `cin` from `cout`.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    cout << n - m - 1 << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

This version of the program will have a faster I/O and a faster compilation time as it only includes the necessary headers. However, the actual execution speed of the program will not change significantly as the algorithm is already as simple as it can be.
