The given C/C++ code is already quite efficient. It reads two integers from the standard input, computes the difference between the two integers and substracts one, and then prints the result to the standard output. 

There is no obvious way to optimize this program in terms of running time or memory usage. The memory usage is already minimal, as only two integers are stored in memory. The running time is also minimal, with only a single subtraction and decrement operation being performed.

The only minor optimization that can be done is to remove the inclusion of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file. This header file is a GCC extension that includes every standard library. Including it can greatly increase compile time, especially for larger projects, and it is generally not recommended for use in production code. Instead, you should include only the headers that you actually need. 

In this case, we only need the headers for the functions that we're using: `scanf` and `printf`. These are both declared in the `<stdio.h>` header in C and the `<cstdio>` header in C++. 

Here is the slightly optimized version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
  printf("%d\n", n - m - 1);
}
```

```c++
#include <cstdio>
int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
  printf("%d\n", n - m - 1);
}
```

This version of the code should compile slightly faster than the original, but the runtime performance and memory usage will be the same.
