There are a few optimizations that can be done to this program. First, the `ac` vector is always initialized with size `n+1`, filled with zeros. We can reduce the memory usage by only allocating the memory that we need. If we declare `ac` inside the while loop, it will be destroyed and reallocated at each iteration, which is more efficient if `n` changes. 

Secondly, instead of calculating all the cumulative sums and storing them in `ac`, we can calculate the sum for the first `k` elements and store it in `res`. Then, as we traverse the array, we subtract the first element of the previous sum and add the next element, updating `res` if the new sum is greater.

Now, let's implement these optimizations.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, k;
  while (cin >> n >> k, n) {
    vector<long long> ac(n);
    long long sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> ac[i];
      if (i < k) {
        sum += ac[i];
      }
    }
    long long res = sum;
    for (int i = k; i < n; ++i) {
      sum = sum - ac[i - k] + ac[i];
      res = max(res, sum);
    }
    cout << res << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This modified program has less memory usage as it doesn't unnecessarily initialize the `ac` vector with an extra zero. It also reduces the number of operations needed to calculate the maximum sum of `k` contiguous elements. The time complexity is still O(n), but the constant factor is smaller.
