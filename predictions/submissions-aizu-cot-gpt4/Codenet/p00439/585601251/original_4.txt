Step 1: Use std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL)
This is used to untie C's standard streams from C++'s standard streams. This will make the program run faster because it reduces the overhead of synchronizing the C and C++ standard streams. It also improves the input/output operations.

Step 2: Declare variables closer to their usage
This improves the readability of the code and slightly optimizes memory usage because variables are only allocated when they are used.

Step 3: Reduce the size of the vector
We can reduce the size of the vector 'ac' by one. We can increment the index when reading the input and adjust the index when calculating the maximum sum.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, k;
  while (cin >> n >> k, n) {
    vector<long long> ac(n, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> ac[i];
      if (i > 0) {
        ac[i] += ac[i - 1];
      }
    }
    long long res = -LLONG_MAX;
    for (int i = k - 1; i < n; ++i) {
      res = max(res, ac[i] - (i >= k ? ac[i - k] : 0));
    }
    cout << res << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program is faster and uses less memory than the original. The speedup comes from the reduced synchronization between C and C++ streams and the avoidance of creating unnecessary variables. The memory usage is reduced by decreasing the size of the vector 'ac'.
