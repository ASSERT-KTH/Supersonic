This C++ program reads two integers, n and k, then reads n integers and calculates the maximum sum of k contiguous elements. The optimization opportunities in this code are minimal because it already uses a cumulative sum array to achieve a time complexity of O(n). However, there are a few small tweaks that could be made to improve its performance:

1. Using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This line will disconnect C++ standard streams from their C counterparts, which can potentially speed up I/O operations.
2. Using `std::cin.tie(NULL)`: This line will untie `cin` from `cout`, which means `cout` won't be flushed before each `cin`, improving the performance of I/O operations.
3. Preallocate memory for the vector: The vector constructor `vector<long long> ac(n + 1, 0);` does not need to allocate memory for each insertion, as the size is known beforehand.
4. Get rid of the usage of `std::endl`: It is generally more computationally expensive than `'\n'` because it causes an output flush.
5. As a minor optimization, the condition `n` in the while loop can be removed because if `n` is zero, the rest of the loop is effectively a no-op.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, k;
  while (cin >> n >> k) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    vector<long long> ac(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      cin >> ac[i];
      ac[i] += ac[i - 1];
    }
    long long res = -LLONG_MAX;
    for (int i = k; i <= n; ++i) {
      res = max(res, ac[i] - ac[i - k]);
    }
    cout << res << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
