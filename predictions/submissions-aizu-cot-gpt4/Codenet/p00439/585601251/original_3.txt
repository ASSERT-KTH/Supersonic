The program doesn't seem to have any unnecessary computations or function calls. It's quite efficient, but there are some small optimizations that can be made:

1. Instead of using a vector to store the sum of the numbers, we can use two variables to store the current sum and the sum of the previous k numbers. This way, we can reduce the space complexity from O(n) to O(1).

2. We don't need to store the input numbers, we can calculate the sums on the fly. This further reduces the space complexity.

3. The line `ac[i] += ac[i - 1];` can be optimized. Instead of calculating the sum from the beginning for every i, we can calculate the sum for the current window of k numbers by adding the current number and subtracting the number that is k positions back.

4. We can use a single for loop to get the input numbers and calculate the maximum sum, instead of using two separate loops.

The optimized code will look like this:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, k;
    while (cin >> n >> k, n) {
        long long sum = 0, prev_sum = 0, num, res = -LLONG_MAX;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            cin >> num;
            sum += num;
            if (i > k) {
                sum -= prev_sum;
            }
            if (i >= k) {
                res = max(res, sum);
                prev_sum = num;
            }
        }
        cout << res << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program does the same thing as the original program, but it uses less memory. Please note that it keeps the same time complexity, which is O(n), because we still need to read the input numbers and calculate the maximum sum.
