This C++ program takes two inputs: 'n' which represents the size of a vector and 'k' which represents a certain number of elements in the vector. It then calculates the maximum sum of 'k' consecutive elements in the vector. The optimization can be done in terms of running time.

1. Instead of using a 'vector' data structure, we can use a 'deque' data structure. Deque offers a faster time complexity of O(1) for insertion and deletion from both ends, while vector has O(n) time complexity for deletion from the front. In this scenario, using a deque can make the running time faster as we are deleting elements from the front in each iteration of the second loop.

2. Rather than recalculating the sum of 'k' consecutive elements in each iteration of the second loop, we can keep track of the current sum and just subtract the first element of the previous 'k' elements and add the next element in the current 'k' elements. This will reduce the number of operations performed in each iteration, which will also reduce the running time.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, k;
  while (cin >> n >> k, n) {
    deque<long long> ac(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      cin >> ac[i];
      ac[i] += ac[i - 1];
    }
    long long res = -LLONG_MAX;
    long long sum = ac[k] - ac[0];
    res = max(res, sum);
    for (int i = k + 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      sum = sum - ac[i - k - 1] + ac[i];
      res = max(res, sum);
    }
    cout << res << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: In the context of this particular program, the usage of deque over vector might not have a significant impact on performance due to the nature of operations being performed. However, the concept is valid in scenarios where we have frequent insertions/deletions at both ends.
