This program is already pretty optimized. It reads in a list of integers from the user, then finds the maximum sum of a subarray of length k. We can, however, make a few minor optimizations:

1. We can make use of `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to disable the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams if it is not necessary to mix calls to i/o functions from both libraries. This can give us a significant performance boost.

2. We can move the declaration of `res` inside the while loop to limit its scope as it is not used outside of the loop. This can make the program more readable and also save a tiny amount of memory.

3. We can also replace the use of `std::vector` with a plain array, which is usually faster due to better memory locality. However, this would significantly change the structure of the program and might not be desired.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, k;
  while (cin >> n >> k, n) {
    vector<long long> ac(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      cin >> ac[i];
      ac[i] += ac[i - 1];
    }
    long long res = -LLONG_MAX;
    for (int i = k; i <= n; ++i) {
      res = max(res, ac[i] - ac[i - k]);
    }
    cout << res << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these changes will not result in a noticeable performance improvement unless the size of the input is extremely large. The original program was already quite efficient.
