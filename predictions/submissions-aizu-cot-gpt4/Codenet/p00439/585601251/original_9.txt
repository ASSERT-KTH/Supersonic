The provided C++ program appears to be already optimized in terms of memory and time complexity. It uses prefix sum to calculate the maximum sum of `k` consecutive numbers in an array in linear time (`O(n)`), which is the best time complexity achievable for this problem. However, there are a few small improvements that can be made:

1. Avoid flushing the output stream with `endl`: Using `std::endl` not only inserts a newline into the output stream, but it also flushes the stream, which can be a costly operation. Instead, you can use `"\n"` to insert a newline without flushing the stream.

2. Reduce the scope of the variable `ac`: Right now, `ac` is defined at the start of the main function and is accessible throughout its entirety. However, it is only used within the while loop. By moving its definition inside the while loop, we can limit its scope and potentially free up memory more quickly.

3. Use faster I/O methods: Standard I/O methods in C++ (`cin` and `cout`) are much slower than those in C (`scanf` and `printf`). We can use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` to speed them up a bit. Note: this makes it unsafe to mix C and C++ I/O in the same program.

Here is the optimized program considering the points above:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    int n, k;
    while (cin >> n >> k, n) {
        long long ac[n + 1], res = -LLONG_MAX;
        ac[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            cin >> ac[i];
            ac[i] += ac[i - 1];
        }
        for (int i = k; i <= n; ++i) {
            res = max(res, ac[i] - ac[i - k]);
        }
        cout << res << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Note that in this optimized version, we've used a C-style array instead of a vector. This might not always be a good idea, especially when dealing with larger inputs because C++ vectors manage memory much more safely than C-style arrays. However, in this specific case, since the size of the array is known at compile time and does not exceed a reasonable limit, it's safe to use a C-style array.
