The program calculates the maximum sum of k consecutive elements in a sequence of integers. The optimization can be done in the following steps:

1. Reduce memory usage: Instead of storing the cumulative sum in a vector, we can keep track of the current sum and the sum of the last k elements. This way, we only need two variables instead of a vector. This reduces the memory usage from O(n) to O(1).

2. Reduce the number of operations: The current program calculates the cumulative sum in the first loop and then calculates the maximum sum in the second loop. We can combine these two operations into a single loop. This reduces the number of operations from 2n to n.

3. Remove unnecessary operations: We can skip the addition operation when i is less than k. This is because the maximum sum can't be calculated until we have k elements.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, k;
  while (cin >> n >> k, n) {
    long long res = -LLONG_MAX;
    long long cur_sum = 0, last_k_sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      int num;
      cin >> num;
      cur_sum += num;
      if (i > k) {
        cur_sum -= last_k_sum;
      }
      if (i >= k) {
        res = max(res, cur_sum);
        last_k_sum = num;
      }
    }
    cout << res << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimization changes the logic of the program slightly. The original program supports a sequence with negative numbers, while the optimized program does not. If you need to support negative numbers, you may need to adjust the logic accordingly.
