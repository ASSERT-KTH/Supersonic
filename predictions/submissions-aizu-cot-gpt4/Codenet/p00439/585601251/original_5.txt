This C++ program calculates the maximum sum of k consecutive elements in an array. The optimization process involves reducing unnecessary computations, memory usage, and improving the program's readability. Here are some steps for optimization:

1. **Reduce Redundancy:** The `vector<long long> ac(n + 1, 0);` allocates memory for n+1 elements initialized to 0. However, we only need to store the current and previous sum of k elements. Therefore, we can replace the vector with two long long variables.

2. **Improve Readability:** We can improve readability by using more descriptive variable names. For example, we can rename `ac` to `current_sum` and `res` to `max_sum`.

3. **Reduce Memory Usage:** We can reduce memory usage by not storing all the elements in the array, but only the required k elements in a queue structure.

Here's the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, k;
    while (cin >> n >> k, n) {
        long long current_sum = 0, max_sum = -LLONG_MAX;
        deque<int> q;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            int num;
            cin >> num;
            current_sum += num;
            q.push_back(num);
            if (i > k) {
                current_sum -= q.front();
                q.pop_front();
            }
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum);
        }
        cout << max_sum << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized version reduces memory usage by not storing all the elements in an array, but only the needed k elements in a queue. It also removes the unnecessary computation of the prefix sum for all elements, which reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(k).

Please note that the queue `q` stores the last k elements read from the input, and `current_sum` maintains the sum of these k elements. When we read a new element, we add it to `current_sum` and `q`. If `q` has more than k elements, we remove the oldest element from `q` and subtract it from `current_sum`. This way, `current_sum` always holds the sum of the last k elements, and we update `max_sum` with `current_sum` if it's greater.
