The given program calculates the distance between two points in a 2D space. It can be optimized in the following ways:

1. **Avoid Repeated Computation**: In the `distance` function, the differences `(p1.x - p2.x)` and `(p1.y - p2.y)` are calculated twice, once for squaring and once for adding them. They can be calculated only once and stored in a variable.

2. **Avoid sqrt function**: The sqrt function is quite expensive in terms of performance. If you are comparing distances, you could compare the squares of the distances instead to avoid using sqrt. However, in this case, as we need to print the distance, we can't avoid sqrt.

3. **Inlining the function**: The function call `distance(p1, p2)` could be a little bit costly. Since the function `distance` is small, we could replace the function call with the function's code itself to eliminate the overhead of the function call. This technique is called function inlining.

4. **Direct Output**: Instead of storing the distance in the variable 'd' and then printing it, we can directly print the distance.

After applying the above optimization techniques, the optimized program will look like this:

```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct point {
  double x;
  double y;
} point;

int main(void) {
  point p1, p2;
  double dx, dy;
  scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf", &p1.x, &p1.y, &p2.x, &p2.y);
  dx = p1.x - p2.x;
  dy = p1.y - p2.y;
  printf("%.5f\n", sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy));
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the readability of the code is slightly compromised in favor of optimization.
