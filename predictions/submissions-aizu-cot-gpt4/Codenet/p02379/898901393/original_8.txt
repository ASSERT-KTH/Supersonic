The given program calculates and prints the distance between two points in a 2D plane.

Optimization Steps:

1. The function "distance" is called just once and is not complicated. We can move its logic inside the main function and remove the function. This will save the overhead of function calling.

2. Instead of using scanf to get the input, we can use faster IO operations to reduce the input time. However, this might not be a significant optimization for small inputs. 

3. In the original program, the variable 'd' is used only once. So, we can avoid declaring it and use the expression directly in the printf statement.

Optimized Program:

```C
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct point {
  double x;
  double y;
} point;

int main(void) {
  point p1, p2;
  scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf", &p1.x, &p1.y, &p2.x, &p2.y);

  double temp = (p1.x - p2.x) * (p1.x - p2.x) + (p1.y - p2.y) * (p1.y - p2.y);
  printf("%.5f\n", sqrt(temp));

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code will perform slightly better than the original one because it avoids the overhead of an extra function call and unnecessary variable declaration. However, the improvement might not be significant for small inputs. For large inputs, a more efficient algorithm or data structure might be required.
