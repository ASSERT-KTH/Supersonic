This program calculates the Euclidean distance between two points. It is already pretty efficient and follows good practices. However, there's a tiny thing we can do to slightly optimize the memory usage and this is to remove the temporary variable `temp`. 

The optimization comes from the fact that modern compilers are able to optimize expressions directly without the need to store the intermediate result in a separate variable. By removing the temporary variable, we reduce the memory footprint of our program by a tiny bit. This also slightly reduces the amount of code we have to write and maintain.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct point {
  double x;
  double y;
} point;

double distance(point p1, point p2) {
  return sqrt((p1.x - p2.x) * (p1.x - p2.x) + (p1.y - p2.y) * (p1.y - p2.y));
}

int main(void) {
  point p1, p2;
  scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf", &p1.x, &p1.y, &p2.x, &p2.y);
  printf("%.5f\n", distance(p1, p2));
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these kind of micro-optimizations will rarely make a noticeable difference in the execution speed or memory usage of your program. In general, you should focus on writing clear, correct, and maintainable code first, and then consider optimizations where they actually matter.
