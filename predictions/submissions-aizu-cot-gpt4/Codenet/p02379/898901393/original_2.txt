The given program calculates the Euclidean distance between two points. Below are the steps to optimize the program:

1. **Pass struct by reference**: In the function `double distance(point p1, point p2)`, p1 and p2 are passed by value, which means the entire struct is copied. This is unnecessary and can be optimized by passing the structs by reference using pointers. This will reduce the memory usage because we are not creating extra copies of structs.

2. **Calculation inside sqrt**: Instead of using a separate variable `temp` to store the result of the calculation inside `sqrt()`, we can do the calculation directly inside `sqrt()`. This will slightly reduce memory usage by not creating an extra variable, and it will also improve readability a bit.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct point {
  double x;
  double y;
} point;

double distance(point* p1, point* p2) {
  return sqrt((p1->x - p2->x) * (p1->x - p2->x) + (p1->y - p2->y) * (p1->y - p2->y));
}

int main(void) {
  point p1, p2;
  double d;
  scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf", &p1.x, &p1.y, &p2.x, &p2.y);
  d = distance(&p1, &p2);
  printf("%.5f\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations are quite minor since the original program was already quite efficient. The real benefit of these changes would only be noticeable for larger structs and/or in a scenario where the `distance` function is called many times.
