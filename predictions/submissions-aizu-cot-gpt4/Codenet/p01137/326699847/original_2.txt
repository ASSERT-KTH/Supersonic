Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The first line "#include "bits/stdc++.h" is not recommended as it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increases the compilation time. Instead, we can include only those libraries which are actually used in the program.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary defines
The ALL(a) macro is not used anywhere in the program so we can remove it. The debug(x) macro is also not used and can be removed.

Step 3: Optimize loops
We can optimize the loops by avoiding the calculation of "val2" and "(e - val2)" multiple times. Instead, we can calculate it once and use it in the inner loop.

Step 4: Use faster input/output methods
The cin and cout operations are slower. If the code is meant for a competitive programming context, we can use faster input/output methods like scanf and printf to speed up the program.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int e;
  while (scanf("%d", &e) == 1 && e) {
    int m = 1000000;
    for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z) {
      int val = z * z * z;
      if (val > e)
        continue;
      for (int y = sqrt(e - val); y >= 0; --y) {
        val += y * y;
        if (val > e)
          continue;
        m = min(m, (e - val) + y + z);
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", m);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the program still has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops, which could cause performance issues for large inputs. If possible, a more efficient algorithm could be used to further optimize the program.
