Step by step optimization:

1. In the inner loop, the variable `val2` is being recalculated again and again for the same `z` and `y` values. This can be avoided by calculating `val2` only once for a given `z` and `y` and storing the result. This will save some computation time.

2. The standard library function `sqrt` is computationally expensive. Instead of calculating the square root each time in the inner loop, we can pre-calculate the square roots and store them in an array. This will save computation time.

3. Initialization of `m` with `1000000` can be avoided if we initialize it with `e` because `e` is always smaller or equal to `1000000`.

4. `bits/stdc++.h` is a non-standard header file and should be avoided. Instead, include the required standard headers individually.

5. `debug(x)` macro is not used in this code, so it can be removed.

Here is the optimized code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int e;
  int val[101];
  int root[1000001];
  for (int i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
    val[i] = i * i * i;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i <= 1000000; i++) {
    root[i] = sqrt(i);
  }
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int m = e;
    for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z) {
      if (val[z] > e)
        continue;
      for (int y = root[e - val[z]]; y >= 0; --y) {
        int val2 = val[z] + y * y;
        if (val2 > e)
          continue;
        m = min(m, (e - val2) + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << m << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that although the memory usage has increased due to the usage of arrays to pre-calculate the cube and square root, the time complexity has improved as we are not calculating them again and again in the inner loop. So, this is a trade-off between time complexity and space complexity.
