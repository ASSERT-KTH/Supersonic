The optimization steps would be:

1. Avoid recomputing the same value again and again: In the original code, `val` and `val2` are re-calculated in every iteration. We can avoid this by pre-computing these values as they are dependent only on `z` and `y`.

2. Efficient use of library functions: We are using `sqrt` function in every iteration of inner loop which is quite expensive. We can avoid this by changing the looping variable from `y` to `val2` (square of `y`), thus eliminating the need of `sqrt`.

3. Avoid unnecessary iterations: In the inner loop, if `val2` is greater than `e`, we continue with the next iteration. But since `val2` is increasing in each iteration, if it's greater than `e` once, it'll be greater in all the subsequent iterations too. So we can break the loop instead of continuing.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
#define ALL(a) (a).begin(), (a).end()
#define debug(x) cout << #x << " : " << (x) << " --------------" << endl;
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int m = 1000000;
    int precomp_z[101];
    for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z)
      precomp_z[z] = z * z * z;
    for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z) {
      if (precomp_z[z] > e)
        continue;
      for (int val2 = e - precomp_z[z]; val2 >= 0; val2--) {
        int y = sqrt(val2);
        if (val2 + precomp_z[z] > e)
          break;
        m = min(m, (e - (val2 + precomp_z[z])) + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << m << endl;
  }
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
In this optimized program, we precompute the cubic values of `z` and store them in `precomp_z` array. Also, we loop over `val2` instead of `y` and calculate `y` as square root of `val2`. This eliminates the need of `sqrt` in each iteration. When `val2` + `precomp_z[z]` is greater than `e`, we break the loop as it'll be greater in all the subsequent iterations too.
