1. The first thing I noticed is that you're using the "bits/stdc++.h" header. It's a non-standard header file and it includes a lot of unnecessary files, which increases the compilation time. You should only include the files that you need. In this case, you need 'iostream', 'cmath', and 'algorithm'.

2. The macro ALL(a) is not used anywhere in the code, so it can be removed.

3. The debug macro used for debugging can be removed if you're not using it, as it's just adding to the clutter.

4. In the inner loop, the computation sqrt(e - val) is performed in every iteration, although the value of 'val' stays the same in all iterations of the inner loop. You can compute the value once before the inner loop and store it in a variable.

5. Since we are optimizing for both running time and memory, using 'auto' keyword for 'val2' can allow the compiler to decide the best data type to use, which can help in saving memory.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int m = 1000000;
    for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z) {
      int val = z * z * z;
      if (val > e)
        continue;
      int max_y = sqrt(e - val);
      for (int y = max_y; y >= 0; --y) {
        auto val2 = val + y * y;
        if (val2 > e)
          continue;
        m = min(m, (e - val2) + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << m << endl;
  }
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
This version of the program should run faster and consume less memory than the original one.
