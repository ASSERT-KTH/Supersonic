There are several ways to optimize the given C/C++ program. Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. **Remove unnecessary include**: The program includes "bits/stdc++.h" which includes all standard library headers. This is unnecessary and slows down the compilation time. We only need a few headers for this program: iostream, cmath, and algorithm.

2. **Avoid using namespace std**: This line of code can potentially lead to name conflicts in larger programs, and it actually increases the size of the compiled code. It's better to use the std:: prefix where needed.

3. **Remove unused macro**: The macro ALL(a) is not used anywhere in the program, so it should be removed.

4. **Remove debug macro**: The debug macro is also not used in the program. It should be removed to clean up the code.

5. **Initialize minimum variable intelligently**: The variable m is initialized with a very large value, 1000000. This value can be reduced to e, as it's the maximum possible value m can have.

6. **Break loop early**: In the loop for y, if val2 > e, not only should we continue to the next iteration, but we can actually break out of this loop because for smaller y, val2 will only get bigger.

Here is the optimized version of the program based on these steps:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

int main(void) {
  int e;
  while (std::cin >> e, e) {
    int m = e;
    for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z) {
      int val = z * z * z;
      if (val > e)
        continue;
      for (int y = std::sqrt(e - val); y >= 0; --y) {
        int val2 = val + y * y;
        if (val2 > e)
          break;
        m = std::min(m, (e - val2) + y + z);
      }
    }
    std::cout << m << std::endl;
  }
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

This optimized version has more efficient loops and cleaner, faster compiling code. It should run faster and use less memory than the original version.
