Step 1: Avoid using "bits/stdc++.h" - This header file includes a lot of unnecessary files which can increase the compile time of the program. It's better to use specific header files.

Step 2: Macros like ALL(a) and debug(x) are not used in the program. Therefore, they must be removed to save memory.

Step 3: Using "std" namespace is not recommended as it might cause name collision problems.

Step 4: The condition "if (val > e)" and "if (val2 > e)" can be removed as it's not possible for the 'val' or 'val2' to be greater than 'e' due to the bounds set on 'z' and 'y'.

Step 5: The 'val' and 'val2' variables can be reused and do not need to be declared in each iteration of the loop.

Step 6: The variable 'm' can be initialized to 'e' instead of '1000000' as it is guaranteed that the minimum value will be less than or equal to 'e'.

After applying these optimizations, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

int main(void) {
    int e;
    while (std::cin >> e, e) {
        int m = e;
        int val, val2;
        for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z) {
            val = z * z * z;
            for (int y = std::sqrt(e - val); y >= 0; --y) {
                val2 = val + y * y;
                m = std::min(m, (e - val2) + y + z);
            }
        }
        std::cout << m << std::endl;
    }
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
