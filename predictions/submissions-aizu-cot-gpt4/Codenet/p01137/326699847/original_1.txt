Here are several steps for optimizing the program:

1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header file includes too many libraries which may increase the compile time of the program. Thus, you should include only the libraries that you need.

2. Avoid using `#define ALL(a) (a).begin(), (a).end()`: This macro is not used in the program, so it can be removed.

3. Avoid using `#define debug(x) cout << #x << " : " << (x) << " --------------" << endl;`: This macro is also not used in the program, so it can be removed.

4. Avoid using `std::endl`: `std::endl` not only inserts a newline into the output stream, but it also flushes the output stream. We can avoid this unnecessary flush by using "\n" instead.

5. Avoid using `std::cin` and `std::cout` directly: We can speed up I/O operations by adding `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` at the start of the program. This will make `cin` and `cout` as fast as `printf` and `scanf`.

6. Avoid repeated computation: In the inner loop, we are computing `val + y * y` in each iteration, where `val` is constant for a specific `z`. We can compute `e - val` outside of the `y` loop and use it inside.

7. Use `std::min` in a more efficient way: Instead of checking `if (val2 > e)` and then computing the minimum, we can just compute the minimum for each `y` and `z`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int m = 1000000;
    for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z) {
      int val = z * z * z;
      if (val > e)
        continue;
      int remaining = e - val;
      for (int y = sqrt(remaining); y >= 0; --y) {
        int val2 = val + y * y;
        m = min(m, remaining - y * y + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << m << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimization does not change the time complexity of the program. If the input values of `e` are large, the program can still take a long time to run. The only way to improve the time complexity would be to change the algorithm, but that would require a larger modification to the program.
