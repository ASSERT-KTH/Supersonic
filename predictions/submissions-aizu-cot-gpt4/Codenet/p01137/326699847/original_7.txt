There are a few things that can be optimized in the given program:

1. The `#include "bits/stdc++.h"` is generally considered bad practice because it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries. Instead, include only the libraries that are used in the program.

2. The macros ALL and debug are not used in this program, so they can be removed.

3. The calculation of `val` and `val2` are independent of the inner loop. Thus, it's better to calculate them before the inner loop to avoid repeated calculations in each iteration. 

4. The calculation of `sqrt(e - val)` is also independent of the inner loop. It's better to calculate it before the inner loop to avoid recalculating it in each iteration.

5. Instead of using `cin >> e, e` in the while loop condition, it's more readable to use `cin >> e && e`.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e && e) {
    int m = 1000000;
    for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z) {
      int val = z * z * z;
      if (val > e)
        continue;
      int max_y = sqrt(e - val);
      for (int y = max_y; y >= 0; --y) {
        int val2 = val + y * y;
        if (val2 > e)
          continue;
        m = min(m, (e - val2) + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << m << endl;
  }
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
