The optimization can be done in following ways:

1. Avoiding unnecessary computation: The value of `z*z*z` and `y*y` is calculated in every iteration which is unnecessary. We can calculate these values beforehand and store them in an array. This will save us time during the computation.

2. Avoiding the use of heavy standard library functions: We are using `sqrt()` function which is heavy and slows down the code. Since we are dealing with integers we can use a simple square root function that uses binary search. This will be faster.

3. Efficient use of iostream: The output operation (`cout`) is slower. To make it faster we can use '\n' instead of `endl`. `endl` forces a flush operation which slows the process, while '\n' doesn't.

4. Avoiding Recalculation of `e-val2`: The expression `(e - val2)` is calculated twice. We can calculate it once and store it in a variable to avoid recalculation.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#define ALL(a) (a).begin(), (a).end()
#define debug(x) cout << #x << " : " << (x) << " --------------" << endl;
using namespace std;

int fastSqrt(int num) {
    int low = 0, high = num, mid;
    while(low <= high) {
        mid = (low + high) >> 1;
        if(mid * mid <= num)
            low = mid + 1;
        else
            high = mid - 1;
    }
    return high;
}

int main(void) {
  vector<int> cube(101), square(100001);
  for(int i = 0; i <= 100; i++)
    cube[i] = i * i * i;
  for(int i = 0; i <= 100000; i++)
    square[i] = i * i;
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int m = 1000000;
    for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z) {
      if (cube[z] > e)
        continue;
      for (int y = fastSqrt(e - cube[z]); y >= 0; --y) {
        int val2 = cube[z] + square[y];
        if (val2 > e)
          continue;
        int diff = e - val2;
        m = min(m, diff + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << m << '\n';
  }
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
