Step 1: Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`

This header file is quite large and includes much more than you likely need, causing your compile time to increase. Instead, include only the libraries that you actually use in your program.

Step 2: Avoid using `ALL(a)` and `debug(x)`

These macros are not used in your code, so there's no need to define them.

Step 3: Avoid using `using namespace std;`

This can cause name collision if the standard library has a function that has the same name as one of your functions. Itâ€™s better to use `std::` before each standard library function.

Step 4: Reduce the number of calculations

The value of `val` is only dependent on `z`, so we can calculate it outside of the `y` loop to reduce redundant calculations. Similarly, instead of calculating `val2` every time in the loop, we can initialize it to `val` and increment it by `y*y` in each iteration.

Step 5: Avoid using `sqrt` function in the loop

The `sqrt` function can be expensive. Instead, we can use a loop from `y = 100` to `y = 0` and break the loop when `y*y > e - val`.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

int main(void) {
  int e;
  while (std::cin >> e, e) {
    int m = 1000000;
    for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z) {
      int val = z * z * z;
      if (val > e)
        continue;
      for (int y = 100; y >= 0; --y) {
        int val2 = val + y * y;
        if (val2 > e)
          break;
        m = std::min(m, (e - val2) + y + z);
      }
    }
    std::cout << m << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
