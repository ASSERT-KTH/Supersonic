Here are the steps to optimize the code:

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is generally avoided in production code because it includes all standard libraries in C++, which can slow down the compile time. It would be better to include only the necessary libraries for your program, in this case, `#include <iostream>` for standard input and output, `#include <algorithm>` for `min()` function and `#include <climits>` for `INT_MAX`.

2. The macro `rep(i, n)` is not used in the program and can be removed.

3. The typedefs that are not used in the program can be removed to make the code cleaner and easier to read. In this case, `ll`, `ull`, `vs`, `vvi`, `vpii`, `pii` and `pll` are not used.

4. The constants `mod`, `eps`, `dx` and `dy` are also not used and can be removed.

5. The `#define` for `all(v)` is not used and can be removed.

6. The macro `mset(a, n)` is not used in the program and can be removed.

7. The macro `each(i, c)` is not used in the program and can be removed.

8. The macros `REP(i, a, b)` and `rer(i, a, b)` are not used and can be removed.

9. The `inf` constant can be replaced with `INT_MAX` from `climits` to better communicate its purpose.

Here is the optimized version of the code.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int ans = INT_MAX;
    for (int z = 0; z * z * z <= e; ++z) {
      for (int y = 0; y * y + z * z * z <= e; ++y) {
        int x = e - (y * y + z * z * z);
        ans = min(ans, x + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
