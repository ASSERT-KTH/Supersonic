Here are a few steps to optimize the given program:

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This line includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increase the compilation time. Instead, we should only include the libraries that we need.

2. The `while (cin >> e, e)` loop in the main function can be replaced by a `while (cin >> e && e)`. It will be more readable and the comma operator may be confusing for some.

3. The usage of `std::min` function in the inner loop is unnecessary. We can declare a variable before the loops and use it to store the minimum value.

4. The inner `for` loop can be optimized. Since `y*y + z*z*z` should be less or equal to `e`, we can calculate the maximum possible `y` for each `z` before the loop, which will reduce the number of iterations.

5. It's better to avoid using `std::endl` because it causes an unnecessary flush operation. Instead, you can use `'\n'`.

6. Instead of using a lot of `typedef`, it is better to use `using` which is more modern and readable.

Here is the optimized version:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int e;
  while (cin >> e && e) {
    int ans = e*3;
    for (int z = 0; z * z * z <= e; ++z) {
      int maxY = sqrt(e - z*z*z);
      for (int y = 0; y <= maxY; ++y) {
        int x = e - (y * y + z * z * z);
        ans = min(ans, x + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
``` 

This optimized program reduces the running time because it decreases the number of iterations in the inner `for` loop and reduces the memory usage because it only includes necessary libraries. The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` will speed up the I/O operations.
