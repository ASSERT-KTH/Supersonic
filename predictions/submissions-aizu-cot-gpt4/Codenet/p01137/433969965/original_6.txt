This program tries to find the minimum of x+y+z where x, y and z are non-negative integers and x + y^2 + z^3 equals to e. It uses a brute force approach, which is not efficient.

Optimization steps:
1. Instead of using "bits/stdc++.h", which includes quite a lot of unnecessary libraries, include only the necessary ones. This will reduce the compilation time.
2. The nested for-loops are inefficient. We can use a binary search to find the optimal y for given z.
3. Avoid using "using namespace std;". It imports all entities in the namespace std. It's better to use specific imports or use the std:: prefix for better code readability and avoiding naming conflicts.
4. Avoid using macros for loops. While it reduces the amount of code, it makes the code harder to read and may cause unintended side effects.

Optimized code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

typedef long long ll;

const int inf = 1000000000;

int main() {
    int e;
    while (std::cin >> e, e) {
        int ans = inf;
        for (int z = 0; z * z * z <= e; ++z) {
            int left = 0, right = e;
            while (left <= right) {
                int y = (left + right) / 2;
                int x = e - (y * y + z * z * z);
                if (x < 0) {
                    right = y - 1;
                } else {
                    ans = std::min(ans, x + y + z);
                    left = y + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        std::cout << ans << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n) and removes unnecessary libraries and macros.
