Optimization Steps:
1. The "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" header file includes quite a lot of libraries which we might not use in this program. Instead, we'll include only those libraries which we are using in this program. This will reduce the compilation time.

2. The first three defines - rep, REP, rer are not used in this program. We can remove those.

3. In the main function, the loop iterates over z and y, where z is raised to the power of 3 and y is raised to the power of 2. This is a costly operation and can be optimized by calculating these values once and storing them, instead of calculating them in each iteration.

4. "const int inf" is assigned a value of 1000000000. We can use INT_MAX which is a more standard and understandable way of representing infinity in integer context.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
const int dx[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
const int dy[] = {0, -1, 0, 1};
int main() {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int ans = INT_MAX;
    for (int z = 0, z3 = 0; z3 <= e; ++z, z3 = z*z*z) {
      for (int y = 0, y2 = 0; y2 + z3 <= e; ++y, y2 = y*y) {
        int x = e - (y2 + z3);
        ans = min(ans, x + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version, we have reduced the unnecessary libraries and defines, and optimized the loops by precomputing the powers of z and y. These changes will reduce both the running time and memory usage of the program.
