The given program can be optimized in several ways:

1. **Efficient I/O** - The cin and cout operations are slower compared to scanf and printf. We can replace cin and cout with scanf and printf respectively.

2. **Optimize inner loop** - In the nested loop, the condition `y * y + z * z * z <= e` doesn't need to be calculated each time. We can calculate `y * y` once for each iteration of the outer loop, save it in a variable, and use that variable in the inner loop. This will reduce the number of multiplications.

3. **Eliminate redundant calculation** - In the inner loop, `z * z * z` is calculated twice for each iteration. We can calculate it once, save it in a variable, and use that variable in both places.

Here is the optimized code incorporating these changes:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (int)n; ++i)
#define REP(i, a, b) for (int i = (int)a; i < (int)b; ++i)
#define rer(i, a, b) for (int i = (int)a; i <= (int)b; ++i)
#define each(i, c)                                                             \
  for (__typeof((c).begin()) i = (c).begin(); i != (c).end(); ++i)
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define mset(a, n) memset(a, n, sizeof(a))
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<string> vs;
typedef vector<vector<int>> vvi;
typedef vector<pair<int, int>> vpii;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<long long, long long> pll;
const int inf = 1000000000;
const int mod = 1000000007;
const double eps = 1e-9;
const int dx[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
const int dy[] = {0, -1, 0, 1};
int main() {
  int e;
  while (scanf("%d", &e), e) {
    int ans = inf;
    for (int z = 0; z * z * z <= e; ++z) {
      int zCubed = z * z * z;
      for (int y = 0; y * y + zCubed <= e; ++y) {
        int ySquared = y * y;
        int x = e - (ySquared + zCubed);
        ans = min(ans, x + y + z);
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that using `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;` are not recommended in production code because they include and import all standard libraries, which can slow down the compilation process and may cause name conflicts. It's better to include and use only what's needed. However, as per the task, I am making minor modifications, so I am not changing these parts.
