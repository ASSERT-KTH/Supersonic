The provided code reads an integer from the input and computes the minimum sum of three numbers x, y, and z such that y*y + z*z*z equals to e minus x. It uses a brute force approach to check all possible values of x, y, and z. This approach, however, is not very efficient, especially for large values of e.

We can optimize the code by removing the innermost loop which calculates x. Since x is always calculated from e, y, and z, we don't need to loop over its possible values. Instead, we just calculate it directly inside the second loop. This reduces the time complexity of the code from O(n^2) to O(n).

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (int)n; ++i)
#define REP(i, a, b) for (int i = (int)a; i < (int)b; ++i)
#define rer(i, a, b) for (int i = (int)a; i <= (int)b; ++i)
#define each(i, c)                                                             \
  for (__typeof((c).begin()) i = (c).begin(); i != (c).end(); ++i)
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define mset(a, n) memset(a, n, sizeof(a))
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<string> vs;

typedef vector<pair<int, int>> vpii;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<long long, long long> pll;
const int inf = 1000000000;
const int mod = 1000000007;
const double eps = 1e-9;
const int dx[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
const int dy[] = {0, -1, 0, 1};
int main() {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int ans = inf;
    for (int z = 0; z * z * z <= e; ++z) {
      for (int y = 0; y * y + z * z * z <= e; ++y) {
        int x = e - (y * y + z * z * z);
        ans = min(ans, x + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" directive is a non-standard GNU extension which includes a lot of unnecessary headers, and it's better to include only what you need. Also, "using namespace std;" is generally not recommended as it can lead to name clashes. For small programs it might be alright, but for larger codebases it's better to avoid it.
