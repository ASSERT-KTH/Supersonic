Optimization Steps:

1. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with specific includes: This header file includes many standard library headers which may not be used in this program. It is better to include only the necessary headers to save compilation time and memory. In this case, we only need `<iostream>`, `<algorithm>` and `<climits>`.

2. Remove unnecessary `#define` and `typedef`: These preprocessor directives and type definitions are not used in this code, removing them will clean up the code and slightly improve compilation time.

3. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(NULL)`: These two lines will make input and output operations faster, which can be a significant performance gain in programs that perform a lot of these operations.

4. Remove unused `const` values: The `const` values `mod`, `eps`, `dx`, and `dy` are not used in this code, removing them will clean up the code and slightly improve compilation time.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int e;
    while (cin >> e, e) {
        int ans = INT_MAX;
        for (int z = 0; z * z * z <= e; ++z) {
            for (int y = 0; y * y + z * z * z <= e; ++y) {
                int x = e - (y * y + z * z * z);
                ans = min(ans, x + y + z);
            }
        }
        cout << ans << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The logic and the functionality of the code remains the same. The optimizations performed were mainly cleaning up unnecessary lines and improving input/output performance.
