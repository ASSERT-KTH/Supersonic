This program appears to be solving a problem that involves finding the minimum sum of three numbers x, y, and z, given that y^2 + z^3 <= e and z^3 <= e. 

Let's perform the following optimizations:

1. **Avoid Unnecessary Recalculations**: The y * y and z * z * z are calculated multiple times. It's better to calculate them once and store the result in a variable.

2. **Early Exit**: If the current z^3 is already greater than e, there's no need to continue testing with greater z. We can break the loop early.

3. **Decrease the Range of For Loop**: The inner loop on y doesn't need to start from 0 for every z. It can continue from the last y because if y was too large for a smaller z, it will be too large for the next z too.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int ans = INT_MAX;
    int y = 0;
    for (int z = 0; ; ++z) {
      int z_cubed = z * z * z;
      if (z_cubed > e) break;
      for (; ; ++y) {
        int y_squared = y * y;
        if (y_squared + z_cubed > e) break;
        int x = e - (y_squared + z_cubed);
        ans = min(ans, x + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The `#define` preprocessor directives and typedefs are not used, so they are removed to reduce the unnecessary memory and to make the code cleaner.
