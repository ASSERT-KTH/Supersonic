Optimizations:

1. The first optimization step would be to replace the C-style I/O `scanf` with the C++-style I/O `cin`. While `scanf` is usually a bit faster than `cin`, `cin` is safer as it does not risk buffer overflow. In competitive programming, the difference in speed is negligible, and the increase in code readability and safety is usually worth the trade-off.

2. Remove the use of Variable Length Arrays (VLA) as they are not part of the C++ standard. It would be better to use `std::vector<int>` instead of `int S[n];` which is a VLA. Vectors are dynamically resizable and are a part of the C++ Standard Library.

3. The binary search is inefficient. Every time it is run, `left`, `right`, and `mid` are being redeclared and initialized. Instead, it would be better to put the binary search section into a separate function. This function should take the array/vector, the value to find, and the size of the array as arguments. This way, the function can be called directly in the loop, making the code cleaner and more efficient.

4. `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` can be used before any I/O operations to untie `cin` and `cout` from their corresponding C streams. This can potentially speed up I/O operations.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool binary_search(vector<int>& S, int n, int T) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = n;
    while (left < right) {
        int mid = (right + left) / 2;
        if (T > S[mid]) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else if (T < S[mid]) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);

    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> S(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> S[i];
    }
    int cnt = 0;
    int q;
    cin >> q;
    for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
        int T;
        cin >> T;
        if (binary_search(S, n, T)) {
            ++cnt;
        }
    }
    cout << cnt << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

The optimizations should make the code run faster and use less memory. However, please note that the optimized version of the program might still need some adjustments depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem at hand.
