The provided program reads an array of numbers, and then for each query it performs a binary search in the array and increments the counter if the query number is found in the array.

The program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. The program uses scanf for input and cout for output. It's better to use cin and cout consistently, or scanf and printf consistently, rather than mixing the two. This is because mixing cin/cout with scanf/printf can cause the program to run slower due to synchronization issues.

2. The size of the array 'S' is determined at runtime. In C++, variable-length arrays are not part of the standard. Instead, we can use a vector, which is safer and more flexible.

3. The program performs a binary search manually, but C++ has a built-in binary search function in the algorithm library, which we can use to simplify and speed up the code.

4. The mid value is calculated at the start of each loop iteration, but it's not necessary when the element is found. We can move this calculation to the end of the loop.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> S(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> S[i];
  }

  int cnt = 0;
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    if(binary_search(S.begin(), S.end(), T)) {
      ++cnt;
    }
  }
  cout << cnt << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized version, first, we disabled the synchronization of C++ and C standard streams and untied cin from cout to make input and output operations faster. Then, we replaced the variable-length array with a vector and used the built-in binary_search function to simplify the code. These changes should make the program faster and more memory-efficient.
