Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid using variable-length arrays. They are not part of the C++ standard and may cause undefined behavior. Instead, use std::vector, which is dynamic and can resize itself when needed.
2. You don't need to recalculate the mid inside the while loop when the value of T is equal to S[mid] because you are breaking the while loop in this case, so this statement can be put after the else block.
3. Use std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); before using any input/output operations. This can speed up cin/cout operations by not synchronizing with the standard C-style input/output operations.
4. Use '\n' instead of endl to print a newline character. The endl function includes a call to flush the output buffer, which can slow down the program if used excessively.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    vector<int> S(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        scanf("%d", &S[i]);
    }

    int cnt = 0;
    int q;
    scanf("%d", &q);
    for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
        int T;
        scanf("%d", &T);
        int left = 0;
        int right = n;
        int mid = (right + left) / 2;
        while (left < right) {
            if (T > S[mid]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else if (T < S[mid]) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                ++cnt;
                break;
            }
            mid = (right + left) / 2;
        }
    }
    cout << cnt << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
