Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. `#include <cstdio>` and `#include <iostream>`: Both these headers aren't necessary, as we only need `iostream` for this program.
2. Variable declarations can be moved closer to where they are used. This makes the program easier to read and understand.
3. While reading elements of array `S`, we can avoid using an intermediate variable and directly read the input into the array.
4. The variables `left`, `right`, `mid`, and `T` are not needed till inside the second for loop. So, they should be declared within the loop to limit their scope and to save memory.
5. Instead of `cout << cnt << endl;`, we can use `printf("%d\n", cnt);` which is faster.

Now let's implement these changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int S[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> S[i];
  }
  int cnt = 0, q;
  cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    int left = 0, right = n;
    while (left < right) {
      int mid = (right + left) / 2;
      if (T > S[mid]) {
        left = mid + 1;
      } else if (T < S[mid]) {
        right = mid;
      } else {
        ++cnt;
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", cnt);
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program reduces the amount of memory used by limiting the scope of variables and also reduces the execution time by using `printf` instead of `cout`. Also, it's more readable because variable declarations are closer to where they are used.
