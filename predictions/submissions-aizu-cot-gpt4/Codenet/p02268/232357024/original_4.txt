The given program is essentially counting the number of elements from a set of queries that are present in an array. 

The array is not sorted before applying binary search which is incorrect, as binary search only works on sorted arrays. So, firstly, we should sort the array.

Secondly, the mid calculation can be done outside the while loop because it's not used before the loop starts.

Thirdly, the output statement `cout << cnt << endl;` can be optimized by using `\n` instead of `endl`, because `endl` flushes the output stream after inserting a new line, which takes more time than simply inserting a new line.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int S[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  }
  sort(S, S+n);
  int cnt = 0;
  int q;
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    int T;
    scanf("%d", &T);
    int left = 0;
    int right = n;
    while (left < right) {
      int mid = (right + left) / 2;
      if (T > S[mid]) {
        left = mid + 1;
      } else if (T < S[mid]) {
        right = mid;
      } else {
        ++cnt;
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", cnt);
  return 0;
}
```
Please make sure to compile this program with C++11 or later, because the variable-length array `S[n]` is not standard in C++. It would be better to replace it with `std::vector<int> S(n);`, but it's not a small modification.
