The given C/C++ program is a binary search program to find the number of elements in an array that match a given query. Here are some optimizations we can perform:

1. Use std::vector instead of arrays: One of the main disadvantages of the array is that the size of the array is fixed. We will use std::vector which is a template class in STL (Standard Template Libraries) and is similar to a dynamic array.

2. Use fast IO operations: cin and cout are slower than scanf and printf. We will add ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL) at the beginning of the main function to make cin and cout as fast as printf and scanf. We will use cin and cout for IO operations instead of scanf and printf.

3. Avoid declaring variables inside loops: Declaring variables inside a loop will lead to memory allocation and deallocation in each iteration which is unnecessary. We will declare the variables outside the loop.

4. Use lower_bound: We will use the in-built function lower_bound instead of writing our own binary search. lower_bound returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the range [first,last) which has a value not less than 'val'. It performs a binary search in logarithmic time.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, q, T, cnt = 0;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> S(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> S[i];
  }
  cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    cin >> T;
    if(binary_search(S.begin(), S.end(), T)) {
      ++cnt;
    }
  }
  cout << cnt << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program should offer significantly better performance while still maintaining the functionality of the original program.
