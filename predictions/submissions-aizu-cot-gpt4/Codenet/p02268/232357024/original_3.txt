This program executes a binary search for multiple queries on an array. Here are few ways to optimize the above code for running time and memory usage:

1. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(NULL)`. The first line makes input/output operations faster by not synchronizing C++ standard streams with C standard streams. The second line unties `cin` from `cout`, meaning `cout` buffer will not be flushed before each `cin` operation, making it faster.

2. Since the size `n` of the array `S` is not known at compile time, using variable-length array (VLA) `int S[n];` is not a good practice as it is not part of the C++ standard. It is better to use `std::vector<int> S(n)`.

3. The variable `mid` is defined inside the second for loop and initialized immediately. It would be better to define it outside the loop to avoid unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation during each iteration.

4. The binary search implementation can be optimized using `std::lower_bound`, a built-in function in the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++. It returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the range [first, last) which does not compare less than `val`.

Here is the optimized version of the given program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::vector<int> S(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> S[i];
  }

  int cnt = 0;
  int q;
  std::cin >> q;
  int T;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    std::cin >> T;
    if(std::binary_search(S.begin(), S.end(), T))
      ++cnt;
  }
  std::cout << cnt << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
Note: This optimized version assumes that the vector `S` is sorted. If the input is not sorted, you should sort it first using `std::sort(S.begin(), S.end())`.
