First, let's analyze the original code and identify the parts that can be optimized:

1. The code uses a recursive function `dfs` which results in a lot of repetitive computation. This can be optimized using dynamic programming, more specifically memoization, where the results of the function calls are stored in a table to avoid repetitive computation.

2. The `main()` function does not have a return type. In C++, every function should have a return type, and for `main()` it should be `int`.

3. The header file `<bits/stdc++.h>` is quite heavy as it includes almost all the standard libraries. Instead, you should only include the necessary libraries, which in this case are `<iostream>` and `<cstdio>`.

4. The code uses global variables, which is not a good practice. These can be passed as function parameters.

5. The `dfs` function calculates `mid` every time it is called. This value can be passed as a parameter to avoid redundant calculations.

Here is the optimized code considering these factors:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

unordered_map<double, double> dp;

double dfs(int K, double L, double R, double P, double E, double T, double mid) {
  if (dp.find(mid) != dp.end()) 
    return dp[mid];
    
  if (!K)
    return dp[mid] = (T - E < mid && mid < T + E) ? 1 : 0;
  if (R < T - E || T + E < L)
    return dp[mid] = 0;
  if (mid >= T)
    return dp[mid] = (1.0 - P) * dfs(K - 1, L, mid, P, E, T, (L + mid) / 2) + P * dfs(K - 1, mid, R, P, E, T, (mid + R) / 2);
  return dp[mid] = (1.0 - P) * dfs(K - 1, mid, R, P, E, T, (mid + R) / 2) + P * dfs(K - 1, L, mid, P, E, T, (L + mid) / 2);
}

int main() {
  int K, R, L;
  double P, E, T;
  cin >> K >> L >> R >> P >> E >> T;
  double mid = (L + R) / 2;
  printf("%.9f\n", dfs(K, L, R, P, E, T, mid));
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the time complexity of the algorithm is not changed, we are just avoiding redundant computations. This technique may not work if the memory is limited because it uses extra space to store the results of computations.
