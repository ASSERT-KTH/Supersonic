Firstly, the program uses recursion to solve a problem, which can lead to stack overflow for large inputs. Moreover, in each recursive call, the function makes 2 new recursive calls and these calls are repeated for the same values of 'd', 'l', and 'r'. This leads to a lot of repeated work. We can optimize this by using Dynamic Programming (DP) to store the results of each unique call so that we don't have to compute them multiple times. This is called Memoization.

Secondly, the program uses 'double' for the variable 'mid', which can be quite memory-intensive for large inputs. We can replace 'double' with 'float' to save memory as it uses half the memory of 'double'.

Thirdly, the program uses 'bits/stdc++.h' which includes a lot of unnecessary libraries. This can slow down the compilation time and increase the program's memory usage. We can include only the necessary libraries to optimize this.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

unordered_map<string, float> dp;

int K, R, L;
float P, E, T;

string make_key(int d, float l, float r) {
    return to_string(d) + "_" + to_string(l) + "_" + to_string(r);
}

float dfs(int d, float l, float r) {
    string key = make_key(d, l, r);
    if (dp.find(key) != dp.end()) {
        return dp[key];
    }

    float mid = (l + r) / 2;
    if (!d)
        return dp[key] = (T - E < mid && mid < T + E) ? 1 : 0;
    if (r < T - E || T + E < l)
        return dp[key] = 0;
    if (mid >= T)
        return dp[key] = (1.0f - P) * dfs(d - 1, l, mid) + P * dfs(d - 1, mid, r);
    return dp[key] = (1.0f - P) * dfs(d - 1, mid, r) + P * dfs(d - 1, l, mid);
}

int main() {
    cin >> K >> L >> R >> P >> E >> T;
    printf("%.9f\n", dfs(K, L, R));
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program uses memoization to avoid repeated calculations, reduces memory usage by using 'float' instead of 'double' and includes only the necessary libraries.
