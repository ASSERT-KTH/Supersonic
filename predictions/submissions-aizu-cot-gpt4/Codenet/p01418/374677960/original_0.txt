The given C++ program is already quite efficient, however, it has some recursion that may cause unnecessary calculations. This might result in a waste of time and memory. This is because the same computations might be done multiple times. This can be addressed by using dynamic programming, specifically by memoization. 

Memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.

Step-by-step optimization:

1. Declare a 2D array to store the computed values for certain states.
2. Inside the dfs function, if the value for the current state is already calculated, return it.
3. If not, calculate and store in the array before returning.

Note: This optimization might increase memory usage slightly due to the storing of computed values, but it will significantly reduce the running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int K, R, L;
double P, E, T;
double dp[1000][1000];  // Assuming the maximum value of d and l is less than 1000.

bool isCalculated[1000][1000];  // To check if a state is already calculated.

double dfs(int d, double l, double r) {
  double mid = (l + r) / 2;
  if (!d)
    return (T - E < mid && mid < T + E) ? 1 : 0;
  if (r < T - E || T + E < l)
    return 0;
    
  // If value is already calculated, return it.
  if(isCalculated[d][l]) 
    return dp[d][l];

  // Else calculate and store it.
  if (mid >= T)
    dp[d][l] = (1.0 - P) * dfs(d - 1, l, mid) + P * dfs(d - 1, mid, r);
  else
    dp[d][l] = (1.0 - P) * dfs(d - 1, mid, r) + P * dfs(d - 1, l, mid);

  // Mark the state as calculated.
  isCalculated[d][l] = true;

  return dp[d][l];
}

int main() {
  cin >> K >> L >> R >> P >> E >> T;
  printf("%.9f\n", dfs(K, L, R));
  return 0;
}
```

Please make sure that the maximum values of `d` and `l` are less than the size of `dp` and `isCalculated` arrays. If not, you need to increase the size of these arrays.
