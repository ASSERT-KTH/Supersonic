This program uses a recursive function to solve a problem, which could result in excessive function call overhead and stack memory usage. Plus, it has a high time complexity due to its recursive nature. It also makes use of floating point comparisons, which are prone to precision issues.

Step by Step Optimization:

1. Avoid using #include <bits/stdc++.h> as it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries. Include only required libraries.
2. Use scanf instead of cin for reading inputs as it can be faster.
3. Use a bottom-up approach instead of recursive approach to reduce function call overhead and stack memory usage. But in this case, it's difficult to use iterative approach, as the recursive function has two recursive calls in every step, one for the left and one for the right part, and it's not easy to convert such functions into iterative ones.
4. Avoid floating point comparisons or at least limit their precision to avoid precision issues.
5. Use early returns to avoid unnecessary calculations.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int K, R, L;
double P, E, T;

double dfs(int d, double l, double r) {
    double mid = (l + r) / 2;

    if (fabs(mid - T) <= E)
        return 1;

    if (!d)
        return 0;

    if (r < T - E || T + E < l)
        return 0;

    if (mid >= T)
        return (1.0 - P) * dfs(d - 1, l, mid) + P * dfs(d - 1, mid, r);

    return (1.0 - P) * dfs(d - 1, mid, r) + P * dfs(d - 1, l, mid);
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d %d %d %lf %lf %lf", &K, &L, &R, &P, &E, &T);
    printf("%.9f\n", dfs(K, L, R));
    return 0;
}
```
Please note that due to the nature of the original code it's not easy to further optimize it without changing the algorithm or making more significant changes.
