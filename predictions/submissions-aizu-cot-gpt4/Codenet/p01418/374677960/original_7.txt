In the provided code, we can optimize the function 'dfs' by memoizing it. The function dfs is called multiple times with the same arguments which leads to redundant computations. Instead, we can store the result of each unique call to dfs and reuse it when needed, which would reduce the running time significantly.

We can use a map to store the result of each unique call to dfs. The key for the map would be a pair of doubles (l and r) and the value would be the result of dfs.

We can also optimize the program for memory usage by avoiding the use of bits/stdc++.h header file. This header file includes a lot of unnecessary header files which consume a lot of memory. Instead, we can only include the necessary header files.

So, the optimized program would look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <map>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;

int K, R, L;
double P, E, T;
map<pair<double, double>, double> memo;

double dfs(int d, double l, double r) {
  if (memo.find(make_pair(l, r)) != memo.end()) {
    return memo[make_pair(l, r)];
  }

  double mid = (l + r) / 2;
  if (!d)
    return (T - E < mid && mid < T + E) ? 1 : 0;
  if (r < T - E || T + E < l)
    return 0;
  if (mid >= T)
    memo[make_pair(l, r)] = (1.0 - P) * dfs(d - 1, l, mid) + P * dfs(d - 1, mid, r);
  else
    memo[make_pair(l, r)] = (1.0 - P) * dfs(d - 1, mid, r) + P * dfs(d - 1, l, mid);

  return memo[make_pair(l, r)];
}

int main() {
  cin >> K >> L >> R >> P >> E >> T;
  printf("%.9f\n", dfs(K, L, R));
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program should run faster and consume less memory compared to the original version.
