The given program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve a problem and prints the result for each input. Here is how we can optimize this program:

1. **Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`:** This will speed up cin and cout. In C++, cin and cout are much slower than scanf and printf. By adding these lines, we can speed up cin and cout to a level where they are as fast as scanf and printf.

2. **Use `endl` sparingly:** `endl` not only moves to the next line, but also flushes the output buffer every time it is called. It is better to replace it with "\n" wherever possible to reduce the number of flushes.

3. **Memory optimization:** The dp array is of size 4001x5, and it seems that only values from dp[i - k][i - 1] are used to calculate dp[i][j]. This suggests that we could potentially reduce the dp array to a 2D array of size 1001x5, reducing the memory footprint of the program.

4. **Use a single loop for initialization:** Instead of using nested loops to initialize the dp array, we can use a single loop and an if condition, which will be faster.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  unsigned long long dp[1001][5];
  for (int j = 0; j < 1001; j++) {
    dp[j][0] = 0;
    dp[j][1] = j <= 1000 ? 1 : 0;
  }
  
  for (int i = 2; i <= 4; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 1001; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k <= j && k <= 1000; k++)
        dp[j][i] += dp[j - k][i - 1];

  int n;
  while (cin >> n)
    cout << dp[n % 1001][4] << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the memory optimization depends on the specific problem that the program is solving. If the input range can exceed 1000 then this optimization is not applicable and can lead to wrong results. So, use it with caution.
