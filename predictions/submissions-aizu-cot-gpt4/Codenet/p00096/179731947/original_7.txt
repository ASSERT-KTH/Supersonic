The primary optimization for this program involves reducing the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) by removing the innermost loop. The result from the previous computation is reused, thereby reducing the need for redundant computations.

Here's the optimization step by step:

1. The innermost loop is a summation operation of the dp array's values. This loop can be removed by introducing a prefix sum array, which stores the cumulative sum of the dp array up to the current index. This allows the sum from dp[0][i-1] to dp[j][i-1] to be computed in constant time.

2. A new prefix sum array, prefixSum[4001][5], is introduced. The prefixSum[j][i] represents the sum from dp[0][i] to dp[j][i]. This array is updated every time dp[j][i] is updated.

3. The dp[j][i] += dp[j - k][i - 1] operation is replaced with dp[j][i] += prefixSum[j][i - 1] - (j - k - 1 >= 0 ? prefixSum[j - k - 1][i - 1] : 0). This gives the same result but in constant time.

Here is the modified optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  unsigned long long dp[4001][5];
  unsigned long long prefixSum[4001][5] = {0};

  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 4001; j++) {
      dp[j][i] = i == 1 && j <= 1000 ? 1 : 0;
      prefixSum[j][i] = j > 0 ? prefixSum[j - 1][i] : 0;
      prefixSum[j][i] += dp[j][i];
    }

  for (int i = 2; i <= 4; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j <= 4000; j++) {
      dp[j][i] += prefixSum[j][i - 1] - (j - 1001 >= 0 ? prefixSum[j - 1001][i - 1] : 0);
      prefixSum[j][i] = j > 0 ? prefixSum[j - 1][i] : 0;
      prefixSum[j][i] += dp[j][i];
    }

  int n;
  while (cin >> n)
    cout << dp[n][4] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program has a lower time complexity, O(n), and the same space complexity, O(n), as the original program.
