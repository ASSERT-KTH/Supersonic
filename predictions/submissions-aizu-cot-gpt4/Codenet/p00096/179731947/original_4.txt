Step by step optimization:

1. The array `dp` is initialized with all zeros using two nested loops at the beginning of the program. However, only the first 1001 elements of the second column are set to 1. Instead of setting all elements to zero first and then setting some of them to 1, we can directly set the first 1001 elements of the second column to 1 and all others to 0 in a single loop. This will reduce the number of operations and thus the running time.

2. The main computation is performed in a loop nesting three times. We are computing `dp[j][i]` by adding `dp[j - k][i - 1]` for all `k` from 0 to `min(j, 1000)`. However, `dp[j][i]` is only dependent on previous values of `dp` and the current value of `j`. So, we can store the sum of `dp[j - k][i - 1]` for all `k` from 0 to `j` in a separate variable and update it each time after computing `dp[j][i]`. This will eliminate the need for the innermost loop and thus reduce the running time.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  unsigned long long dp[4001][5];
  for (int j = 0; j < 4001; j++)
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
      dp[j][i] = (i == 1 && j <= 1000) ? 1 : 0;
  for (int i = 2; i <= 4; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j <= 4000; j++) {
      unsigned long long sum = 0;
      for (int k = 0; k <= j && k <= 1000; k++) {
        sum += dp[j - k][i - 1];
        dp[j][i] = sum;
      }
    }
  int n;
  while (cin >> n)
    cout << dp[n][4] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimization mentioned in point 2 is actually incorrect because the value of dp[j][i] is dependent on the values of dp[j - k][i - 1] for all k from 0 to j, not just the previous one. Therefore, the innermost loop cannot be eliminated.
