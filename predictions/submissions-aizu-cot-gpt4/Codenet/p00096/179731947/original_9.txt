This program seems to be trying to calculate some dynamic programming solution. There are several ways we can optimize this program without making significant changes:

1. Reducing the number of loop iterations: The third loop in the program iterates from 0 to min(j, 1000). However, when j is greater than 1000, the loop is unnecessarily running for extra iterations because dp[j - k][i - 1] for k > 1000 will always be 0 (as initialized at the beginning). So, the condition in the third loop can be simplified to k <= min(j, 1000).

2. Avoiding unnecessary computations: The program is calculating dp[j][i] for all j from 0 to 4000, but it only outputs dp[n][4] where n is input from the user. If n is significantly less than 4000, a large amount of computation is wasted. To solve this, we can dynamically allocate the dp array based on the input n.

3. Optimizing I/O operations: The cin and cout operations are slower. We can speed up these operations by adding ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL) at the beginning of the main function.

Let's apply these optimizations to the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  unsigned long long dp[n+1][5];
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++)
      dp[j][i] = i == 1 && j <= 1000 ? 1 : 0;
  
  for (int i = 2; i <= 4; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k <= min(j, 1000); k++)
        dp[j][i] += dp[j - k][i - 1];
  
  cout << dp[n][4] << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program reduces the size of the dp array and the number of loop iterations, and speeds up the I/O operations.
