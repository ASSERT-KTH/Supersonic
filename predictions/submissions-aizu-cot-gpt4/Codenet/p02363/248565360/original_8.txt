The program is a Bellman Ford algorithm to find shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in the given graph. The original code is quite optimized, but there are still some small parts where we can improve for better performance:

1. The `edges` vector: This data structure is not modified after its creation, so it can be declared as a constant. This can provide some compiler optimizations.

2. The `edge e = edges[j]` line: Instead of creating a copy of the edge on each iteration, we can just get a reference to the edge, which saves memory and time.

3. The `ans` string: Instead of appending to a string on each iteration, it would be faster to use an `ostringstream` then convert it to a string at the end. This is because `ostringstream` is designed for efficient string concatenation, while `string::append()` might cause reallocation and copying of the string.

4. The `fill` function: Instead of casting `d` to an integer pointer, we can use `std::begin()` and `std::end()` to get iterators to the start and end of the `d` array. This is slightly more idiomatic and safe.

5. The `cout << "NEGATIVE CYCLE" << endl;` line: Instead of printing immediately when encountering a negative cycle, we can return a specific error code and print the message in the main function. This is because I/O operations are generally slow and should be minimized.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>
#include <iterator>
using namespace std;
#define MAX 100000
struct edge {
  int s, t, d;
};
const vector<edge> edges;
ostringstream oss;
int d[MAX];
int BellmanFord(int startVertex, int vNum, int eNum) {
  fill(begin(d), end(d), __INT_MAX__);
  d[startVertex] = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    bool update = false;
    for (int j = 0; j < eNum; ++j) {
      const edge& e = edges[j];
      if (d[e.s] != __INT_MAX__ && d[e.t] > d[e.s] + e.d) {
        d[e.t] = d[e.s] + e.d;
        update = true;
        if (i == vNum - 1) {
          return -1;
        }
      }
    }
    if (!update)
      break;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    if (i > 0)
      oss << " ";
    if (d[i] == __INT_MAX__) {
      oss << "INF";
    } else
      oss << d[i];
  }
  return 0;
}
int main() {
  int vNum, eNum;
  cin >> vNum >> eNum;
  int s, t, w;
  for (int i = 0; i < eNum; ++i) {
    cin >> s >> t >> w;
    edges.push_back({s, t, w});
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    if (BellmanFord(i, vNum, eNum) == -1) {
      cout << "NEGATIVE CYCLE" << endl;
      return 0;
    }
    oss << "\n";
  }
  cout << oss.str();
}
```
Please note that the `edges` vector is now a global constant, so it should not be modified after its creation. If you need to modify the `edges` vector during runtime, then you cannot declare it as a constant.
