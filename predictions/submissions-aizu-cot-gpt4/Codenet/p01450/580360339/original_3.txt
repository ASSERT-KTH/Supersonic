The given program is a dynamic programming solution. It uses a three-dimensional array `dp` to keep track of the state of the problem. The main optimization would be to reduce the memory usage as it's the most critical resource being used here.

The program has a dp array of size `2 * 10001 * 202`. The memory usage can be optimized by reducing the size of this array. As we can see from the code, the program uses only the current and previous states of the array `dp`. Therefore, it's not necessary to keep all 2 * 10001 * 202 states, it would be enough to keep only 2 * 202 states.

So, the optimized program becomes like this:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int mod = 1000000007;
int N, W;
int w[201];
ll dp[2][202];
int main() {
  cin >> N >> W;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> w[i];
  for (int j = 0; j <= N; j++) {
    if (j <= W)
      dp[N % 2][j] = 1;
    else
      dp[N % 2][j] = 0;
  }
  for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int cur = (i + 1) % 2;
    int nxt = (i) % 2;
    for (int j = 0; j <= N; j++) {
      dp[nxt][j] = 0;
      int nmwidx = j;
      if (j == N || w[j] > w[i])
        nmwidx = i;
      dp[nxt][j] += dp[cur][nmwidx];
      if (j + w[i] <= W)
        dp[nxt][j] += dp[cur][j + w[i]];
      dp[nxt][j] %= mod;
    }
  }
  cout << dp[0][N] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

But please note that this optimization is only valid if the memory usage is a problem, and the program still fits the problem requirements after the optimization. The code logic and the problem requirements need to be carefully reviewed before applying this optimization.
