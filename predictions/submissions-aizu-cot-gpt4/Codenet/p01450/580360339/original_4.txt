Here are the steps to optimize the code:

1. Reduce the Dimension of the Array: The dp array is very large and consumes a lot of memory. If we observe the usage of the dp array, we can see that in each iteration of the outermost loop, the program only needs the current and previous states, hence we can reduce the size of the dp array by half.

2. Use `memset` to Initialize Array: In the given code, a nested loop is used to initialize the array. Instead, we can use the `memset` function which is faster.

3. Optimize the Modulo Operation: Modulo operation is expensive. It's better to use it only when necessary. We can add the mod value before performing the modulus operation to prevent negative numbers.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int mod = 1000000007;
int N, W;
int w[201];
ll dp[2][10001];

int main() {
  cin >> N >> W;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> w[i];
  
  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));

  for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++)
      dp[N % 2][j] = 1;

  for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int cur = (i + 1) % 2;
    int nxt = (i) % 2;
    for (int j = 0; j < 10001; j++) {
      dp[nxt][j] = dp[cur][j];
      if (j + w[i] <= W)
        dp[nxt][j + w[i]] = (dp[nxt][j + w[i]] + dp[cur][j]) % mod;
    }
  }
  cout << dp[0][0] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code consumes less memory and is faster.
