To optimize the provided C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Memory Usage: The size of the 3-dimensional array `dp` is quite large. We can reduce its size by noting that the first dimension only takes two values. Hence, the first dimension of the array can be reduced from two to one.

2. Running Time: The innermost loop iterates over `k` from 0 to `N` and the outer loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `10001`. But we can see that `k` is only used to find the `nmwidx` and to take modulus of `dp[nxt][j][k]` with `mod`. This value of `dp[nxt][j][k]` is then used in the next `j` loop iteration. But `k` is not used anywhere else. So, there is no need to iterate `k` from `0` to `N`. We can directly use `N` instead.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
const int mod = 1000000007;
int N, W;
int w[201];
ll dp[2][10001];

int main() {
  cin >> N >> W;

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> w[i];

  for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
    if (j <= W)
      dp[N % 2][j] = 1;
    else
      dp[N % 2][j] = 0;
  }

  for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int cur = (i + 1) % 2;
    int nxt = (i) % 2;
    for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
      dp[nxt][j] = 0;
      int nmwidx = N;
      if (w[nmwidx] > w[i])
        nmwidx = i;
      dp[nxt][j] += dp[cur][j];
      if (j + w[i] <= W)
        dp[nxt][j] += dp[cur][j + w[i]];
      dp[nxt][j] %= mod;
    }
  }

  cout << dp[0][0] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This program should run faster and use less memory than the original version.
