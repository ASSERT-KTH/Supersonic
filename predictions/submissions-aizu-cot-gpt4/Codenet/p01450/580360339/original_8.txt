This program uses a 3D dynamic programming (DP) approach to solve a problem. However, it seems that the third dimension of the DP table isn't used effectively, leading to potential excessive memory usage. 

In addition, there are some redundant calculations in the innermost loop that can be avoided. For example, the modulo operation is expensive and is being performed even when not needed.

Here are the steps to optimize the code:

1. We can see that the third dimension of the DP table is not used effectively. Specifically, the value of 'k' is either 'N' or 'i'. Therefore, it is not necessary to allocate an array of size 'N' for 'k'. Instead, we can allocate an array of size '2'. This change reduces the memory usage of the program significantly.

2. We can avoid performing the modulo operation if the sum of 'dp[nxt][j][k]' and 'dp[cur][j + w[i]][k]' is less than 'mod'. This change reduces the number of modulo operations, which in turn reduces the running time of the program.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int mod = 1000000007;
int N, W;
int w[201];
ll dp[2][10001][2]; // Reduce the size of the last dimension of the DP table to 2
int main() {
  cin >> N >> W;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> w[i];
  for (int j = 0; j < 10001; j++) {
    for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++) {
      if (j <= W && (k == 1 || w[k] + j > W))
        dp[N % 2][j][k] = 1;
      else
        dp[N % 2][j][k] = 0;
    }
  }
  for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int cur = (i + 1) % 2;
    int nxt = (i) % 2;
    for (int j = 0; j < 10001; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++) { // Reduce the range of 'k'
        dp[nxt][j][k] = 0;
        int nmwidx = k;
        if (k == 1 || w[k] > w[i])
          nmwidx = i % 2; // Use 'i % 2' instead of 'i'
        dp[nxt][j][k] += dp[cur][j][nmwidx];
        if (j + w[i] <= W)
          dp[nxt][j][k] += dp[cur][j + w[i]][k];
        if (dp[nxt][j][k] >= mod) // Perform the modulo operation only when necessary
          dp[nxt][j][k] %= mod;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << dp[0][0][1] << endl; // Use '1' instead of 'N'
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces both the memory usage and the running time of the original program.
