The given C/C++ program computes a dynamic programming solution for a problem. It uses a 3D array `dp` for storing computed results. The size of this array can be reduced to a 2D array, because it alternates between two states, as shown by the line `int nxt = (i) % 2;`. 

In the current program, the entire 3D array `dp` is kept in memory. However, we only need two 2D arrays at any point in time. Therefore, we can reduce the memory usage by declaring `dp` as a 2D array. This will also improve the running time as we are reducing the size of the nested loop.

Here is the optimized version of the given program:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int mod = 1000000007;
int N, W;
int w[201];
ll dp[2][10001];
int main() {
  cin >> N >> W;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> w[i];
  for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
    dp[N % 2][j] = 1;
  }
  for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int cur = (i + 1) % 2;
    int nxt = (i) % 2;
    for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
      dp[nxt][j] = dp[cur][j];
      if (j + w[i] <= W)
        dp[nxt][j + w[i]] = (dp[nxt][j + w[i]] + dp[cur][j]) % mod;
    }
  }
  cout << dp[0][W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program uses less memory, as it uses a 2D array instead of a 3D array. It also runs faster, as it reduces the size of the nested loop. The logic of the program remains the same.
