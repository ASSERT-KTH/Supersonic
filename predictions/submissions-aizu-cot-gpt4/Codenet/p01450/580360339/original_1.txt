The given C++ code is a dynamic programming solution for a subset sum problem. It has time and space complexities of O(N^2 * W), where N is the number of elements and W is the maximum weight. However, it seems that the 3D dynamic programming table `dp` is too large and may cause memory overflow.

Step by Step Optimization:

1. The first optimization is to reduce the space complexity of the program by removing the third dimension from the dp table. It seems that the third dimension `k` is used to keep track of the minimum weight index. However, the minimum weight index is not necessary for the subset sum problem. We can remove this dimension and simplify the dp transition process.

2. The second optimization is to optimize the time complexity by removing unnecessary computations. In the original program, the dp table is updated for every possible weight from 0 to W, even if the current weight is greater than W. We can optimize this by only updating the dp table for weights that are less than or equal to W.

3. Finally, to further optimize the time complexity, we can use a rolling array technique to reduce the dp table from 2D to 1D. The idea is to update the dp table in reverse order so that the current state only depends on the previous state.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int mod = 1000000007;
int N, W;
int w[201];
ll dp[10001];
int main() {
  cin >> N >> W;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> w[i];
  dp[0] = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = W; j >= w[i]; j--) {
      dp[j] += dp[j - w[i]];
      dp[j] %= mod;
    }
  }
  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program has a time complexity of O(N * W) and a space complexity of O(W), which are significantly better than the original program.
