The given C++ program is a dynamic programming solution and it's hard to optimize it further because dynamic programming itself is an optimization technique. However, there are a few improvements that could be made:

1. Modulo operation: The modulo operation is a costly operation in terms of CPU cycles. In the current program, it is used to alternate between the indices 0 and 1 in the dp array. Rather than calculating it on every iteration, we could calculate it once at the beginning of each outer loop and use the calculated value.

2. Array initialization: The array dp is initialized with 0s in every iteration of the outer loop. This is unnecessary because the array is already initialized with 0s when it is declared.

3. Input optimization: The cin and cout operations are slower in C++. We can use faster input-output methods.

Now let's optimize the program according to these points:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int mod = 1000000007;
int N, W;
int w[201];
ll dp[2][10001][202];
int main() {
  scanf("%d %d", &N, &W);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    scanf("%d", &w[i]);

  for (int j = 0; j < 10001; j++) {
    for (int k = 0; k <= N; k++) {
      if (j <= W && (k == N || w[k] + j > W))
        dp[N % 2][j][k] = 1;
      else
        dp[N % 2][j][k] = 0;
    }
  }

  for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int cur = (i + 1) % 2;
    int nxt = (i) % 2;
    for (int j = 0; j < 10001; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k <= N; k++) {
        int nmwidx = k;
        if (k == N || w[k] > w[i])
          nmwidx = i;
        dp[nxt][j][k] += dp[cur][j][nmwidx];
        if (j + w[i] <= W)
          dp[nxt][j][k] += dp[cur][j + w[i]][k];
        dp[nxt][j][k] %= mod;
      }
    }
  }
  printf("%lld\n", dp[0][0][N]);
  return 0;
}
```

Here, I have replaced cin/cout with scanf/printf for faster input-output. I have removed the unnecessary initialization of dp to 0 inside the loop. And I have used precalculated values of cur and nxt instead of calculating them in every iteration.

Do note that these optimizations may not result in a significant performance boost because the original program is already quite optimized.
