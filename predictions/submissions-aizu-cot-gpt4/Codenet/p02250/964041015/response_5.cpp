This code is already optimized in terms of its algorithmic approaches as it employs the Suffix Array and Sparse Table data structures to efficiently handle string pattern queries. However, it can be optimized in terms of its memory usage.

The current code has local variables that are frequently redefined and recreated within loops. Each time a variable is redefined, new memory is allocated for it, which can lead to unnecessary memory usage. This can be optimized by defining these variables once outside of the loops and then just reusing them within the loops.

Here are the steps for the optimization:

1. For the vector `v` in the `sa_is` method, it is currently defined within every call of the method. Since this method is called recursively, this vector is getting redefined and reallocated many times. To optimize this, we can define this vector once in the main program and then just pass it as a parameter to the `sa_is` method. This way, the vector is only allocated once and reused throughout the program, saving memory.

2. Similarly, for the vectors `bucket` and `is_l` in the `induced_sort` and `invert_induced_sort` methods, they are currently defined within every call of these methods. Since these methods are called multiple times within loops, these vectors are also getting redefined and reallocated many times. To optimize this, we can define these vectors once in the main program and then just pass them as parameters to these methods. This way, these vectors are only allocated once and reused throughout the program, saving memory.

3. The vector `v` in the `sa_is` method that takes a string as a parameter, it is also getting redefined every time the method is called. To optimize this, we can define this vector once in the main program and then just pass it as a parameter to the method. This way, the vector is only allocated once and reused throughout the program, saving memory.

After these optimizations, the memory usage of the program will be reduced.
