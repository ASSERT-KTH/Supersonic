This program appears to be solving some kind of dynamic programming problem. There are several things we can do to optimize this code:

1. **Avoid unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation:** Right now, the program creates and discards a vector<int> for each id. Instead of creating a new vector each time, we can create one vector and clear it after each use.

2. **Avoid unnecessary sorting:** The id vector is sorted, but it is not clear why. If the order of the ids does not matter, we do not need to sort them. However, as we don't know the exact problem statement, we will keep the sorting part as it is.

3. **Avoid unnecessary function calls:** The sort and memset functions are called inside loops. We can reduce the number of function calls by moving them outside the loops.

4. **Use more efficient data structures:** The map and vector data structures have overheads in terms of memory and time complexity. We can replace them with arrays if the maximum sizes are known ahead of time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define REP(i, k, n) for (int i = k; i < n; i++)
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define INF 1 << 30
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
ll d[15][2005], dp[2005][2005];
int main() {
  int n, K;
  cin >> n >> K;
  vector<int> id, v[2005];
  rep(i, n) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    id.push_back(b - 1);
    v[b - 1].push_back(a);
  }
  sort(id.begin(), id.end());
  id.erase(unique(id.begin(), id.end()), id.end());
  memset(d, 0, sizeof(d));
  vector<P> p;
  rep(i, id.size()) {
    int j = id[i];
    sort(v[j].begin(), v[j].end(), greater<int>());
    REP(k, 1, v[j].size() + 1) {
      d[j][k] += d[j][k - 1] + v[j][k - 1] + (k - 1) * 2;
      p.push_back(mp(k, d[j][k]));
    }
  }
  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
  rep(i, id.size()) {
    rep(j, K + 1) {
      ll res = dp[i][j];
      rep(k, v[id[i]].size() + 1) {
        if (j >= k) {
          res = max(res, dp[i][j - k] + d[id[i]][k]);
        }
      }
      dp[i + 1][j] = res;
    }
  }
  cout << dp[id.size()][K] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that in real world scenarios, problem statements, input constraints and other factors would be considered for further optimization.
