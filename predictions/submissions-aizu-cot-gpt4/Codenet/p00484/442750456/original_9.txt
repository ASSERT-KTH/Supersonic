This program seems to be a dynamic programming solution to some problem. There are a couple of optimizations that could be made here:

1. Avoid unnecessary copying: In the program, every time a pair is created using `mp(k, d[j][k])`, it is pushed into vector `p` which is never used in the whole program. So, we can remove that line entirely.

2. Avoid unnecessary sorting: After reading the data into `v[j]`, the program sorts the vector in descending order, but it doesn't seem to be used in that sorted order specifically. The program only uses the sum of the first `k` elements and there's no need to sort the vector for that.

3. Use `reserve()` on vectors: When you know the size of the data that's going to be inserted into the vector, you can use the `reserve()` function to preallocate the space required. This can avoid multiple reallocations as elements are added into the vector.

4. Use prefix sum for `d[j][k]`: Instead of calculating `d[j][k]` in every iteration, we can use the prefix sum concept to calculate it once and use it in the loop. This way, we can reduce the time complexity of this part.

5. Use `std::unordered_map` instead of `std::map`: If we don't need the keys to be sorted, then `std::unordered_map` could be a better choice because it provides an average constant-time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations while `std::map` provides logarithmic time complexity.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#define REP(i, k, n) for (int i = k; i < n; i++)
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define INF 1 << 30
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
ll d[2005], dp[2005][2005];
int main() {
  int n, K;
  cin >> n >> K;
  vector<int> id, v[2005];
  id.reserve(n);
  rep(i, n) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    id.push_back(b - 1);
    v[b - 1].push_back(a);
  }
  sort(id.begin(), id.end());
  id.erase(unique(id.begin(), id.end()), id.end());
  memset(d, 0, sizeof(d));
  rep(i, id.size()) {
    int j = id[i];
    ll sum = 0;
    REP(k, 1, v[j].size() + 1) {
      sum += v[j][k - 1] + (k - 1) * 2;
      d[k] = sum;
    }
  }
  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
  rep(i, id.size()) {
    rep(j, K + 1) {
      ll res = dp[i][j];
      rep(k, v[id[i]].size() + 1) {
        if (j >= k) {
          res = max(res, dp[i][j - k] + d[k]);
        }
      }
      dp[i + 1][j] = res;
    }
  }
  cout << dp[id.size()][K] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the modified code assumes that the input is always valid and doesn't contain any error or corner case that would cause the program to behave incorrectly.
