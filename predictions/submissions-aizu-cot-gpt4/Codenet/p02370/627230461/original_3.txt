This program is about topology sorting. It reads the number of vertices and edges from the input, then reads pairs of vertices to represent the edges. It stores the edges in an adjacency list and counts the incoming edges for each vertex. Then it finds the vertices with no incoming edges and adds them to the solution. Finally, it iterates over all vertices in the solution and removes their outgoing edges, and whenever a vertex has no more incoming edges, it is added to the solution.

Here are some potential optimizations:

1. Use `reserve()` to preallocate memory for `ans` vector. This can avoid extra reallocations and copies when the vector grows.

2. Use `emplace_back()` instead of `push_back()` where possible. `emplace_back()` constructs the element in place and can be more efficient.

3. Avoid calling `size()` in each iteration of the loop. Instead, store the result in a variable before the loop.

4. Avoid accessing `edge[ans[i]]` and `state[t]` multiple times by storing the result in a variable.

5. Use a prefix increment operator (`++i`) instead of a postfix (`i++`) for loop counters, it might be a bit more efficient because it doesn't need to create a temporary copy of the value.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int V, E;
  cin >> V >> E;
  
  vector<vector<int>> edge(V); // Allocate the vector to the exact size needed
  vector<int> state(V, 0);

  for (int i = 0; i < E; ++i) {
    int s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    edge[s].push_back(t);
    state[t]++;
  }
  
  vector<int> ans;
  ans.reserve(V); // Preallocate memory

  for (int i = 0, size = state.size(); i < size; ++i) {
    if (state[i] == 0)
      ans.emplace_back(i);
  }

  for (int i = 0, size = ans.size(); i < size; ++i) {
    for (int t : edge[ans[i]]) {
      if (--state[t] == 0)
        ans.emplace_back(t);
    }
  }

  for (int i : ans) {
    cout << i << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimization may not have a significant impact on the performance as the complexity of the algorithm is still the same. But it can slightly improve the efficiency and readability of the code.
