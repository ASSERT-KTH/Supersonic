This C++ program seems to be implementing a topological sort algorithm. However, there are several areas where we can optimize the program for better running time and memory usage.

Optimization Steps:

1. **Avoid using `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`**: The program uses both `scanf`/`printf` (C-style input/output) and `cin`/`cout` (C++-style input/output). This can lead to slower execution because of synchronization issues. It is better to stick to either one of them. In this case, we will use the C++-style because the rest of the programming style is more C++-like.

2. **Use `pop_back` instead of `erase` for removing the last element**: `vector::erase` typically has a time complexity of O(n) because it may need to shift all the elements after the erased element. On the other hand, `vector::pop_back` only has a time complexity of O(1). Therefore, it is more efficient to use `pop_back` when you want to remove the last element of the vector.

3. **Avoid using `vector::size` in a loop condition**: Calculating the size of a vector is an O(1) operation. However, if it is used in a loop condition, it is recalculated in every iteration. It's better to store the size in a separate variable.

4. **Use `reserve` for vectors if the size is known in advance**: If the maximum size of a vector is known in advance, you can use `reserve` to preallocate memory. This can avoid reallocations later on and improve performance.

5. **Replace `vector<int>::push_back` with `emplace_back`**: `emplace_back` creates the object in-place and can be faster than `push_back`, which creates a temporary object and then copies or moves it into the vector.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define FOR(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
#define REP(i, n) FOR(i, 0, n)
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
int n, m;
vector<int> edge[5000];
int cnt[5000];
int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cin >> n >> m;
    REP(i, m) {
        int a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;
        a--;
        b--;
        edge[a].emplace_back(b);
        cnt[b]++;
    }
    vector<int> ans;
    ans.reserve(n);
    bool flag = false;
    vector<int> next;
    next.reserve(n);
    REP(i, n) if (cnt[i] == 0) next.emplace_back(i);
    REP(i, n) {
        int tar = next.back();
        ans.emplace_back(tar + 1);
        next.pop_back();
        if (!next.empty())
            flag = true;
        for(int to : edge[tar]) {
            if (--cnt[to] == 0)
                next.emplace_back(to);
        }
    }
    for(int i : ans) cout << i << '\n';
    cout << (flag ? "1\n" : "0\n");
    return 0;
}
```
This program should run faster and use less memory than the original one.
