The provided C++ program seems to be implementing a topological sort algorithm. This algorithm is used to sort vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in linear order such that for every directed edge u -> v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

Here are some optimizations you can apply to this code:

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` preprocessor directive includes quite a lot of libraries, many of which you may not need for your program. This can slow down your compile time. It's better to include only the libraries you need. In this case, you can replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with `#include <vector>`, `#include <stack>`, `#include <map>`, `#include <cstdio>`.

2. The usage of the `long long` type is not always necessary. If you're sure that the numbers in your program won't exceed the range of `int`, you can use `int` instead of `long long`. This will reduce memory usage.

3. Instead of creating a new vector `ans` in `main()`, you can directly use `t.ans`.

Here's the optimized version of your program:

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <map>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define pb(x) push_back(x)
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
typedef pair<int, int> P;
class t_sort {
public:
  int n;
  vector<int> ans, deg;
  vector<vector<int>> G;
  void init(int N) {
    n = N;
    deg.resize(n);
    G.resize(n);
  }
  void add_edge(int from, int to) {
    G[from].pb(to);
    deg[to]++;
  }
  void tsort() {
    stack<int> st;
    rep(i, n) if (deg[i] == 0) st.push(i);
    while (!st.empty()) {
      int v = st.top();
      st.pop();
      ans.pb(v);
      rep(i, G[v].size()) if (--deg[G[v][i]] == 0) st.push(G[v][i]);
    }
  }
};
map<P, int> mp;
signed main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%lld%lld", &n, &m);
  t_sort t;
  t.init(n);
  rep(i, m) {
    int x, y;
    scanf("%lld%lld", &x, &y);
    x--;
    y--;
    t.add_edge(x, y);
    mp[P(x, y)] = 1;
  }
  t.tsort();
  rep(i, n) printf("%lld\n", t.ans[i] + 1);
  int res = 1;
  rep(i, n - 1) {
    if (mp[P(t.ans[i], t.ans[i + 1])] == 0)
      res = 0;
  }
  printf("%lld\n", res == 1 ? 0 : 1);
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that choice of `int` vs `long long` depends on the range of the numbers you're working with. If you're unsure, it's safer to stick with `long long`.
