The following optimizations can be made to the provided program:

1. **Avoiding dynamic memory allocation:** In C/C++, the size of an array needs to be a compile-time constant. In the original program, the size of `ans` array is not known at compile time, which is not a good practice. Instead, we can use a maximum possible size for the array.

2. **Avoiding unnecessary calculations:** In the original program, the calculation of `d[0]` includes the use of `pow` and `sqrt` functions. These operations are computationally expensive and can be avoided by comparing the squares of the distances instead of the distances themselves. 

3. **Avoiding repeated use of array indexing:** Array indexing operation is slower as compared to using a pointer or a reference. We can use a single pointer to the array and increment it in each iteration.

Let's now apply these optimizations to the original code:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX_N 1000
int main(void) {
  int k, n;
  double xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb;
  double d[3];
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int ans[MAX_N], *pans = ans;
  for (k = 0; k < n; k++, pans++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &xa, &ya, &ra, &xb, &yb, &rb);
    d[0] = (xb - xa) * (xb - xa) + (yb - ya) * (yb - ya);
    d[1] = (ra + rb) * (ra + rb);
    d[2] = (ra - rb) * (ra - rb);
    if (d[0] > d[1]) {
      *pans = 0;
    } else if (d[2] > d[0]) {
      *pans = 2;
    } else if (d[0] < d[2]) {
      *pans = -2;
    } else {
      *pans = 1;
    }
  }
  for (k = 0, pans = ans; k < n; k++, pans++) {
    printf("%d\n", *pans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, I have used `MAX_N` as the size of `ans` array to avoid dynamic memory allocation. Also, the indices of `d` array have been changed from 0, 1, 2, and 3 to 0, 1, and 2 to avoid the unnecessary `d[3] = rb - ra;` calculation. Finally, the conditions have been modified to compare the squares of distances, and array indexing is replaced with pointer arithmetic. This program should run faster and use less memory than the original program.
