The program calculates the distance between two points in a plane and compares it with the sum and the difference of their radii. The main optimization points are:

1. We don't need an array to store the answers. We can print them immediately after calculating. This will save memory.

2. The pow(x, 2.0) function is computationally expensive. We can use x * x instead.

3. The sqrt() function is also computationally expensive. We can avoid it by comparing the squares of distances instead of the distances themselves.

4. It's not necessary to calculate all distances d[0], d[1], d[2], d[3] before the comparisons. We can calculate d[0] first and stop further calculations if we already know the answer.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int k, n;
  double xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb;
  double d0, d1, d2, d3;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &xa, &ya, &ra, &xb, &yb, &rb);
    d0 = (xb - xa) * (xb - xa) + (yb - ya) * (yb - ya);
    d1 = (ra + rb) * (ra + rb);
    if (d0 > d1) {
      printf("0\n");
    } else {
      d2 = (ra - rb) * (ra - rb);
      if (d2 > d0) {
        printf("2\n");
      } else {
        d3 = (rb - ra) * (rb - ra);
        if (d3 > d0) {
          printf("-2\n");
        } else {
          printf("1\n");
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program has the same logic as the original one, but it avoids unnecessary computations and memory usage.
