Step-by-step optimization:

1. Memory Optimization: Instead of storing the calculations in the array `d[]`, we can store them in separate variables. This way, we don't need to allocate memory for an array. 

2. Power function Optimization: The `pow()` function is computationally expensive. Since we are just squaring the values, we can replace `pow(x, 2.0)` with `x * x`. This will save computation time.

3. Loop Optimization: Instead of using two separate loops to calculate and then to print, we can merge them into a single loop. This will save the overhead of loop initialization, condition checking and increment/decrement operations.

4. Avoiding floating point comparison: Floating point comparison can be avoided by comparing the squares of the distances instead of the actual distances. This will also eliminate the need for the `sqrt()` function, which is computationally expensive.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int k, n;
  double xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb;
  double d, d1, d2, d3;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (k = 0; k < n; k++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &xa, &ya, &ra, &xb, &yb, &rb);
    d = (xb - xa) * (xb - xa) + (yb - ya) * (yb - ya);
    d1 = (ra + rb) * (ra + rb);
    d2 = (ra - rb) * (ra - rb);
    d3 = (rb - ra) * (rb - ra);
    if (d > d1) {
      printf("%d\n", 0);
    } else if (d < d2) {
      printf("%d\n", 2);
    } else if (d < d3) {
      printf("%d\n", -2);
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", 1);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version of the program should run faster and use less memory than the original one.
