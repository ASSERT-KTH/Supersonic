The given program calculates the distance between two points and then checks the relation of the distance with the sum and difference of the radii of the two circles at those points.

The program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Avoiding the usage of the array `d[]` to store temporary variables. This reduces memory usage.
2. Avoiding the usage of `pow()` function for calculating the square of a number. Multiplication is faster than `pow()`.
3. Avoiding the usage of `sqrt()` when not necessary. In this case, we can compare the squares of the distances instead of the actual distances. This can reduce computation time as `sqrt()` is a time-consuming operation.
4. We can avoid storing the results in the `ans[]` array and print the result directly. This reduces memory usage.

Below is the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int k, n;
  double xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb;
  double d, sum, diff1, diff2;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &xa, &ya, &ra, &xb, &yb, &rb);
    d = (xb - xa) * (xb - xa) + (yb - ya) * (yb - ya); // Square of distance
    sum = (ra + rb) * (ra + rb); // Square of sum of radii
    diff1 = (ra - rb) * (ra - rb); // Square of difference of radii (ra>rb)
    diff2 = (rb - ra) * (rb - ra); // Square of difference of radii (rb>ra)

    if (d > sum) {
      printf("%d\n", 0);
    } else if (diff1 > d) {
      printf("%d\n", 2);
    } else if (diff2 > d) {
      printf("%d\n", -2);
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", 1);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program reduces both memory usage and computation time.
