The given C/C++ program seems to be rotating a string based on the input. It takes a string and a number as inputs repeatedly until a "-" is entered as the string. Then, for the number of rotations, it adds up the rotation number to a total rotation. It then prints out the rotated string.

The optimizations that can be made:

1. The 'strlen' function is called once per each string entered. We can eliminate this by storing the length of the string in a variable when the string is entered.

2. The 'printf' function is called in a loop. Instead of calling 'printf' for each character, we can create a new string with the rotated characters and print the entire string at once.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int i, m, h, t, a;
char s[201], new_s[201];

int main() {
  while (scanf("%s%d", s, &m), s[0] != '-') {
    a = strlen(s);
    for (i = t = 0; i < m; scanf("%d", &h), t += h, i++)
      ;
    for (i = 0; i < a; i++)
      new_s[i] = s[(t + i) % a];
    new_s[i] = '\0';
    puts(new_s);
    puts("");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, the length of the string is calculated once when the string is entered and stored in the variable 'a'. This eliminates the need to calculate the string's length over and over again. The 'printf' function is replaced with a 'puts' function that prints the entire string at once after the string rotation is done. This reduces the number of function calls and therefore optimizes the runtime. The 'new_s' character array is used to store the rotated string. The 'new_s' is null-terminated to avoid undefined behavior.
