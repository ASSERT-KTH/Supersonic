This program reads strings and integer pairs from an input until it encounters a string that starts with "-". After reading each pair, it performs a rotation operation on the string. The rotation operation is applied m times, with each rotation step defined by the integer h read from the input. The result of these rotations is then printed. 

The optimization we can do here is to reduce the number of rotations. We can achieve this by summing up all the rotation steps from the input first, then taking the modulus of this sum by the length of the string. This will give us the effective rotation that we need to apply, which will be less than or equal to the length of the string.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Move the `strlen(s)` call outside of the second for loop. This function call is constant for a given string, so we can call it once and store the result, instead of calling it in each iteration of the for loop.

2. Sum the rotation steps first, then take the modulus of this sum by the length of the string. This will give us the effective rotation that we need to apply.

3. Apply the rotation to the string. This can be done by shifting the indices of the characters in the string by the effective rotation.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <string.h>
i, m, h, t, a;
main() {
  char s[201];
  for (; scanf("%s%d", s, &m), s[0] != '-'; puts("")) {
    a = strlen(s);
    for (i = t = 0; i < m; scanf("%d", &h), t += h, i++)
      ;
    t %= a;
    for (i = 0; i < a; printf("%c", s[(t + i) % a]), i++)
      ;
  }
}
```

In this optimized program, the number of iterations in the second for loop is reduced. This reduces the running time of the program. The memory usage is the same because we are not using any extra space.
