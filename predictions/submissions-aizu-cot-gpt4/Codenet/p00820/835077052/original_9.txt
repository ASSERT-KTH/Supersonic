This is a simple dynamic programming problem where we are calculating the number of ways to represent a number as a sum of four or less squares. The program is already quite optimal, but there are a few optimizations we can do.

Optimizations:

1. Reducing the scope of the include statements.
2. Reducing the scope of usings to avoid name clashes.
3. Removing unused types.
4. We can use vector instead of array for dynamic allocation of memory. This will save memory when n is small.
5. I noticed that the tx and ty arrays are not used in the program, so I removed them.
6. The EPS constant is not used as well, so I removed it.
7. Instead of making multiple calls to dp[n][i] in the printf statement, we can store it in a variable and use that.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  while (~scanf("%d", &n)) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n+1, std::vector<int>(5, 0));
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
      for (int k = 1; k <= 4; k++) {
        for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j++) {
          dp[j][k] += dp[j - i * i][k - 1];
        }
      }
    }
    int sum = dp[n][4] + dp[n][3] + dp[n][2] + dp[n][1];
    printf("%d\n", sum);
  }
}
```
Note: These optimizations are minor and might not bring significant improvements in terms of performance, but they make the code cleaner and easier to read. The major computation part of the code cannot be optimized further as it is already using a dynamic programming approach, which is the best approach for this type of problem.
