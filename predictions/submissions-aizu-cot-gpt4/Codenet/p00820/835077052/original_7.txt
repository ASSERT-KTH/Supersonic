The program given is a C/C++ program that uses dynamic programming to solve a certain problem. 

1. Unnecessary includes: The program includes a large number of libraries that it does not use. This can be optimized by removing the unnecessary include statements.

2. Unused variables and macros: There are defined variables and macros that are not used in the program. They can be safely removed.

3. Unnecessary initialization: The dp array is initialized with 0 which is the default value for int array. We can skip this step.

4. Unnecessary computation: The program computes i*i twice in the same iteration. We can compute it once and store it in a variable to avoid recomputing it.

5. Optimization of I/O operations: The program uses scanf and printf for input/output operations. We can replace them with cin and cout and add `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` at the beginning of the main function to speed up the I/O operations.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int dp[1000000][5];

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  while (cin >> n) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;

    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
      int sq = i * i;                  // Compute i*i only once
      for (int k = 1; k <= 4; k++) {
        for (int j = sq; j <= n; j++) {
          dp[j][k] += dp[j - sq][k - 1];
        }
      }
    }
    cout << dp[n][4] + dp[n][3] + dp[n][2] + dp[n][1] << "\n";
  }
}
```
Please note that even though the memset function is removed, the dp array will still be initialized to 0 since it's a global variable. Global and static variables in C++ are automatically initialized to 0.
