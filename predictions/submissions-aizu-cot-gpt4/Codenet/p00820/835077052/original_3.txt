This program is written in C++, and it is used to calculate the number of ways we can represent a number as a sum of squares of four or less other numbers. The program uses dynamic programming for this computation.

Optimizations:

1. Memory allocation for dp array: The 2D array "dp" is declared with a size of [1000000][5] which is quite large. The first dimension's size depends on the input size 'n'. So we can dynamically allocate memory for 'dp' array based on the input size 'n' instead of hard coding it to 1000000. This will save a lot of memory when 'n' is less than 1000000.

2. Include only necessary libraries: The program includes a lot of libraries, some of them are not used. We can remove the unused libraries to make the program cleaner and potentially faster to compile.

3. Combine 'printf' statement: Instead of calculating dp[n][4] + dp[n][3] + dp[n][2] + dp[n][1] in the 'printf' statement, we can calculate it before and store in a variable. This will make the program easier to debug and maintain.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
typedef pair<int, P> PP;
int tx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int ty[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
static const double EPS = 1e-8;
int **dp;
int main() {
  int n;
  while (~scanf("%d", &n)) {
    dp = new int*[n+1];
    for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++){
      dp[i] = new int[5];
    }
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(int)*(n+1)*5);
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
      for (int k = 1; k <= 4; k++) {
        for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j++) {
          dp[j][k] += dp[j - i * i][k - 1];
        }
      }
    }
    int ans = dp[n][4] + dp[n][3] + dp[n][2] + dp[n][1];
    printf("%d\n", ans);
    for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++){
      delete [] dp[i];
    }
    delete [] dp;
  }
}
```

Note: The memory allocated for dp array is also freed after its use. This is a good practice to prevent memory leaks.
