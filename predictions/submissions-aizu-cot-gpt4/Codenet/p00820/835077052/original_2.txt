This program seems to be a dynamic programming solution to a problem involving squares of numbers. The problem appears to be computing the number of ways to represent a number as the sum of up to 4 squares. 

Here are some potential optimizations:

1. Avoid Recalculation: In the innermost loop, the quantity `i * i` is being recalculated for every iteration. This can be avoided by pre-calculating and storing it in a variable. 

2. Reduce Memory Usage: The dp array is declared to have 1,000,000 rows, irrespective of the input number 'n'. This may lead to wasted memory if 'n' is significantly smaller than 1,000,000. We can declare the dp array inside the loop after reading 'n', so it has exactly 'n+1' rows.

3. Optimize I/O Operations: Using faster I/O methods can also improve the runtime. In C++, cin and cout are slower than scanf and printf. However, we can make cin and cout faster by adding `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` at the beginning of the main function.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#define INF 0x3f3f3f3f
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <cctype>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <deque>
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>
#include <list>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <sstream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
typedef pair<int, P> PP;
int tx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int ty[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
static const double EPS = 1e-8;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n;
  while (~scanf("%d", &n)) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    int dp[n+1][5];
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
      int square = i * i;
      for (int k = 1; k <= 4; k++) {
        for (int j = square; j <= n; j++) {
          dp[j][k] += dp[j - square][k - 1];
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", dp[n][4] + dp[n][3] + dp[n][2] + dp[n][1]);
  }
}
```
Please note that the real performance increase from these optimizations will depend on the specific inputs and computing environment.
