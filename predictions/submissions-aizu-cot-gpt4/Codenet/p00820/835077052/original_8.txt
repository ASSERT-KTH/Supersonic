Optimization Steps:

1. The input to the program is read with a `scanf` function in a loop. This can be replaced with faster input reading methods such as `getchar_unlocked`. However, this may not offer a significant performance boost and isn't considered a good practice because of its non-portability.

2. In the nested loops, `i*i` is calculated multiple times. This can be computed once and stored in a variable to avoid repeated calculations.

3. The sum of `dp[n][4] + dp[n][3] + dp[n][2] + dp[n][1]` is calculated in the `printf` statement. It can be calculated in the loop itself and stored in a variable. However, this will not give a significant performance boost.

4. The program includes many libraries that are not used, which can increase the compilation time. Removing these unnecessary includes can speed up the compilation process.

5. The `typedef` for `P` and `PP` and arrays `tx` and `ty` are not used. Removing these can save memory.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
static const double EPS = 1e-8;
int dp[1000000][5];
int main() {
  int n;
  while (~scanf("%d", &n)) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
      int square = i * i;   // Calculate i*i once to avoid repeated calculations
      for (int k = 1; k <= 4; k++) {
        for (int j = square; j <= n; j++) {
          dp[j][k] += dp[j - square][k - 1];
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", dp[n][4] + dp[n][3] + dp[n][2] + dp[n][1]);
  }
}
```
Remember that the biggest performance improvement comes from the algorithmic or architectural changes rather than micro-optimizations.
