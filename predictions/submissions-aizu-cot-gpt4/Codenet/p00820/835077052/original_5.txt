This program seems to be efficiently written already. The time complexity of the main logic is O(n^(3/2)), which is quite optimal for this problem. However, there are few small improvements that we can make.

1. We can remove unnecessary #include statements. We should only include the libraries that are actually needed in the program. This may reduce the compilation time slightly and can make the code cleaner and easier to read.
2. The 'tx' and 'ty' arrays and the typedefs are not used in the program, so we can remove them to clean up the code.
3. The 'EPS' constant is also not used and can be removed.
4. Instead of computing 'i * i' twice in the loop, we can compute it once and store it in a variable.

Here's the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#define INF 0x3f3f3f3f
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
int dp[1000000][5];
int main() {
  int n;
  while (~scanf("%d", &n)) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
      int square = i * i;
      for (int k = 1; k <= 4; k++) {
        for (int j = square; j <= n; j++) {
          dp[j][k] += dp[j - square][k - 1];
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", dp[n][4] + dp[n][3] + dp[n][2] + dp[n][1]);
  }
}
```

Please note that these are minor optimizations and they won't have a significant impact on the performance of the program. The most important part of the program, which is the main loop, is already well optimized.
