This program calculates the number of unique combinations of perfect squares (1, 4, 9, etc.) that can sum up to a certain number `n`. The input is a number `n` and the output is the number of ways `n` can be written as the sum of 1 to 4 perfect squares. The program uses dynamic programming to solve this problem.

Here's how we can optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: Some of the included header files in the program are not used. This may not significantly impact the memory usage, but it can make the code cleaner and more maintainable.

2. Use vector instead of arrays: Using `std::vector` instead of C-style arrays can make the code safer and less prone to errors.

3. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: This is because `std::cin` and `std::cout` are more type-safe.

4. Remove unused variables and definitions: `tx`, `ty`, `P`, `PP`, `EPS`, `_USE_MATH_DEFINES`, `INF`, and other definitions are not used in the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  vector<vector<ll>> dp(1000000, vector<ll>(5, 0));
  int n;
  while (cin >> n) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    memset(dp.data(), 0, dp.size() * sizeof dp[0]);
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
      for (int k = 1; k <= 4; k++) {
        for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j++) {
          dp[j][k] += dp[j - i * i][k - 1];
        }
      }
    }
    cout << dp[n][4] + dp[n][3] + dp[n][2] + dp[n][1] << "\n";
  }
}
```

This refactored code performs the same functionality but is more readable and maintainable due to the removal of unused variables and unnecessary includes. Also, by using `std::vector` instead of arrays and `std::cin`/`std::cout` instead of `scanf`/`printf` we make the code safer and more C++-like.
