The given C++ program calculates the absolute difference between two complex numbers, P1 and P2. However, it has two main issues:

1. The way it reads the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers from the standard input is incorrect. In C++, you cannot use the `cin` operator to change the values of the `real` and `imag` functions of the `std::complex` objects. You need to read the parts into temporary variables first and then use these variables to construct the `std::complex` objects.

2. It uses both the `stdio.h` (`cstdio` in C++) and `iostream` libraries for input and output operations. You should stick to one library to make your code more consistent and slightly more efficient. In this case, we'll use `iostream` because it works better with C++ objects.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  double P1_real, P1_imag, P2_real, P2_imag;
  cin >> P1_real >> P1_imag >> P2_real >> P2_imag;
  complex<double> P1(P1_real, P1_imag), P2(P2_real, P2_imag);
  cout.precision(5);
  cout << fixed << abs(P1 - P2) << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program reads the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers into temporary `double` variables (`P1_real`, `P1_imag`, `P2_real`, `P2_imag`). It then uses these variables to construct the `std::complex` objects (`P1`, `P2`). The program then prints the absolute difference between `P1` and `P2` to the standard output using the `cout` operator from the `iostream` library. It sets the precision of the output to 5 decimal places using the `precision` function and the `fixed` manipulator.
