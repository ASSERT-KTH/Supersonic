This program reads two complex numbers from the input, computes their difference, and then prints the absolute value of the result.

The original program has a number of issues that prevent it from being optimized:

1. The `cin` function is not the fastest way to read data from the input. It is generally slower than `scanf`.
2. The `printf` function should be replaced with `cout` for consistency with the rest of the program.
3. The `complex` class is not the most efficient way to represent complex numbers. Using two `double` variables for the real and imaginary parts would be faster and use less memory.
4. The `abs` function is not necessary. The distance between two points in the complex plane can be computed using the Pythagorean theorem.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```
#include <cstdio>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  double x1, y1, x2, y2;
  scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2);
  printf("%.5f\n", sqrt(pow(x2-x1, 2) + pow(y2-y1, 2)));
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program reads the coordinates of the two points directly into `double` variables using `scanf`, computes the distance using the Pythagorean theorem, and then prints the result using `printf`. This version of the program should be faster and use less memory than the original.
