The program you have given seems to have a logical error. The cin statement is not correctly written because complex has no member functions like real() and imag() that can be assigned to. The correct way to perform this operation is to assign the real and imaginary parts to temporary variables and then use these variables to create the complex numbers. 

However, the code itself is already quite optimized. The only optimization I can see at the moment is to remove the unused includes, namely cmath and cstdio. 

Here is your optimized code:

```cpp
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  double r1, i1, r2, i2;
  cin >> r1 >> i1 >> r2 >> i2;
  complex<double> P1(r1, i1), P2(r2, i2);
  cout << abs(P1 - P2) << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, I removed the unused includes. Then, I modified the cin statement to take in the real and imaginary parts as temporary variables. These temporary variables are then used to create the complex numbers P1 and P2. The printf statement was replaced with a cout statement.
