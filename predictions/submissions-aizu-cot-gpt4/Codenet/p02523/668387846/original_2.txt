This code reads two complex numbers from the standard input, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result to the standard output. However, this code will not compile because std::complex::real() and std::complex::imag() return the real and imaginary parts respectively as rvalues, but here they are being used as lvalues, expecting an input from cin. 

Here is the optimized version:

```
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  double x1, y1, x2, y2;
  std::cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
  std::complex<double> P1(x1, y1), P2(x2, y2);
  std::cout << std::abs(P1 - P2) << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Removed unused include directives: `<cmath>` and `<cstdio>`. They are not necessary for the program, thus removing them reduces the complexity and size of the compiled binary.
2. Instead of inputting directly into complex objects (which is not allowed), I first input the real and imaginary parts into doubles, and then create the complex objects.
3. Replaced the `printf` function with `std::cout`. The `printf` function is a C-style function and can be less efficient and more error-prone than C++ iostreams. Furthermore, `std::cout` automatically formats the output, so there is no need to specify the format string.
4. Removed `using namespace std;`. It's generally considered bad practice to use this statement in global scope in C++ because it can lead to name clashes. I explicitly specified the `std` namespace when needed.
5. The `std::endl` not only inserts a newline character, but also flushes the output buffer. This might be slightly less efficient than simply outputting a newline character. However, in this case, since the program is about to end and the amount of output is small, the difference is negligible. It's also clearer and more idiomatic C++.
