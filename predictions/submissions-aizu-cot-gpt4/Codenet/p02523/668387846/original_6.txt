This given C/C++ program already has good performance. It's very simple and only performs basic operations, such as input/output and computation of the absolute value of the difference between two complex numbers. 

However, there are two small changes we can make to slightly optimize the code:

1. Instead of using the `cin` and `cout` for input and output, we can use the `scanf` and `printf` functions, which are faster because they do not have the overhead of synchronization with the C++ streams.

2. We can avoid using the `complex` library. Instead, we can compute the distance between two points in the Cartesian coordinate system manually. This could have a minor impact on the performance, although it would not be noticeable for this particular code because the number of operations is very low.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  double x1, y1, x2, y2;
  scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2);
  printf("%.5f\n", hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1));
  return 0;
}
```

In this code, we read the coordinates of two points and then we use the `hypot` function from the `cmath` library to calculate the Euclidean distance between them. The `hypot` function is more reliable than manually calculating the square root of the sum of squares because it avoids overflow and underflow in intermediate computations.
