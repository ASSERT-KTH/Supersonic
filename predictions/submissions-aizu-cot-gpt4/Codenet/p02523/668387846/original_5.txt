The given C/C++ program calculates the absolute difference between two complex numbers. It's already quite simple and efficient. However, there are few small optimizations you can make:

1. Instead of using `cin` and `cout`, you can use `scanf` and `printf` for input/output, which are faster.

2. Instead of declaring `P1` and `P2` on two different lines, you can declare them on same line which will reduce the line of code.

3. The `cmath` header is actually not needed here as we are not using any mathematical functions explicitly. The `abs` function for complex numbers comes from the `complex` header.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  complex<double> P1, P2;
  scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf", &P1.real(), &P1.imag(), &P2.real(), &P2.imag());
  printf("%.5f\n", abs(P1 - P2));
  return 0;
}
```

However, please note that using `scanf` may cause some issues with complex numbers as `scanf` requires pointers to variables and `complex::real()` and `complex::imag()` return value, not a reference. Hence, the above code may not work as expected. So, the original code is already optimized and any modification may lead to issues.
