This program seems to be a part of a larger system, and it's difficult to optimize without knowing the context. But there are some general optimizations we can make:

1. Memory Usage: The program unnecessarily includes several libraries, which increases its memory footprint. Include only the libraries needed by the program.
2. Running Time: The function `isso` uses a brute force algorithm to check if a number is prime, which can be slow for large inputs. We can optimize this function by checking for divisibility only up to the square root of the input number.
3. Memory Usage: The program uses a `map` to store group names and member names, and a `vector` to store the groups each member belongs to. We can reduce the memory usage by using a `unordered_map` instead of `map`, as `unordered_map` provides constant time complexity for search, insert and delete operations on average, whereas `map` provides these operations in O(log n) time.
4. Running Time: The function `dfs2` uses recursion to traverse the groups each member belongs to. We can optimize this function by using an iterative approach instead of a recursive one, which can be faster and use less memory.

Optimized code:

```c++
#include <unordered_map>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

bool isso(long long int a) {
  if (a == 1 || a == 0)
    return false;
  for (long long int i = 2; i * i <= a; i++) {
    if (a % i == 0)
      return false;
  }
  return true;
}

long long int powint(long long int a, long long int b) {
  assert(b >= 0);
  if (b == 0)
    return 1;
  if (b == 1)
    return a;
  long long int ans = 1;
  long long int aa = powint(a, b / 2);
  ans *= aa * aa;
  if (b % 2)
    ans *= a;
  return ans;
}

vector<vector<int>> involve;

vector<int> dfs2(const int now, vector<bool> &used) {
  vector<int> ans;
  stack<int> s;
  s.push(now);
  while (!s.empty()) {
    int n = s.top();
    s.pop();
    if (used[n])
      continue;
    used[n] = true;
    ans.push_back(n);
    for (auto i : involve[n]) {
      if (!used[i])
        s.push(i);
    }
  }
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    int num = 0;
    unordered_map<string, int> mp;
    set<int> ed;
    int N;
    cin >> N;
    if (!N)
      break;
    involve.clear();
    involve.resize(100000);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      // ... (rest of the code is the same) ...
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the actual performance gain from these optimizations depends on the specific use cases of this program.
