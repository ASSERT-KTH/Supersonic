The program performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a 2D map. It appears to be finding a path between two points. The program reads a 2D map from the standard input and performs a BFS. The BFS is performed over a 4D array which can be quite memory-intensive especially considering that the actual map is 2D. 

Optimization Steps:

1. Instead of storing the entire 2D map, only store the locations of the important points: 'L', 'R', and '%'. This will save a significant amount of memory if the map is large and sparse. We can use a map or a vector of pairs to store these points.

2. Before performing BFS, check if the two points are already at the target '%'. If they are, return true immediately. This saves unnecessary computations.

3. Instead of checking the boundary conditions and obstacles inside the BFS loop, check them before pushing the points into the queue. This will prevent invalid points from being pushed into the queue in the first place.

Please note that these optimizations will only work if the number of important points ('L', 'R', and '%') is much less than the total number of points in the map. If the map is dense (i.e., most of the points are important), these optimizations may not improve the memory usage and running time.

The optimized program after performing the above optimizations is as follows:

```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
struct po {
  int lx, ly, rx, ry;
};
int w, h;
vector<pair<int, int>> L, R, P;
bool visited[51][51][51][51];
int dx[4] = {0, 0, 1, -1};
int dy[4] = {1, -1, 0, 0};
bool bfs(int lx, int ly, int rx, int ry) {
  queue<po> Q;
  Q.push((po){lx, ly, rx, ry});
  while (!Q.empty()) {
    po t = Q.front();
    Q.pop();
    int cnt = (P.count(make_pair(t.lx, t.ly)) > 0) + (P.count(make_pair(t.rx, t.ry)) > 0);
    if (cnt == 2)
      return true;
    if (visited[t.lx][t.ly][t.rx][t.ry] || cnt == 1)
      continue;
    visited[t.lx][t.ly][t.rx][t.ry] = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      int flg = 0;
      int nlx = t.lx + dx[i], nly = t.ly + dy[i];
      int nrx = t.rx - dx[i], nry = t.ry - dy[i];
      if (nlx < 0 || nly < 0 || nlx >= w || nly >= h || P.count(make_pair(nlx, nly)) == 0)
        nlx = t.lx, nly = t.ly, flg++;
      if (nrx < 0 || nry < 0 || nrx >= w || nry >= h || P.count(make_pair(nrx, nry)) == 0)
        nrx = t.rx, nry = t.ry, flg++;
      if (flg == 2)
        continue;
      Q.push((po){nlx, nly, nrx, nry});
    }
  }
  return false;
}
int main() {
  while (1) {
    cin >> w >> h;
    if (!w && !h)
      break;
    string line;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++) {
      cin >> line;
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        if (line[j] == 'L')
          L.push_back(make_pair(j, i));
        else if (line[j] == 'R')
          R.push_back(make_pair(j, i));
        else if (line[j] == '%')
          P.push_back(make_pair(j, i));
      }
    }
    memset(visited, 0, sizeof(visited));
    if (bfs(L[0].first, L[0].second, R[0].first, R[0].second))
      cout << "Yes" << endl;
    else
      cout << "No" << endl;
    L.clear(); R.clear(); P.clear();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version of the program, instead of storing the entire map, we are only storing the locations of the important points in the vectors `L`, `R`, and `P`. This can save a significant amount of memory if the map is large and sparse. Also, the BFS now checks the boundary conditions and obstacles before pushing the points into the queue, which can prevent invalid points from being pushed into the queue. However, these optimizations may not improve the performance if the map is dense (i.e., if most of the points are important).
