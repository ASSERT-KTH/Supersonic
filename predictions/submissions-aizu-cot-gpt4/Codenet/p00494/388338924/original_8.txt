As an experienced C/C++ developer, I would suggest several steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary `fill` function: We don't need to initialize the entire array `x` with 'A' using `fill` function. It's a waste of time and memory. So, we can remove this line of code.

2. Use `fgets` instead of `scanf`: `scanf` is vulnerable to buffer overflow. `fgets` is safer when reading strings.

3. Avoid multiple `if` conditions: Instead of having multiple `if` conditions, we can use `switch` statement. It makes the code cleaner and easier to understand. 

4. Avoid unnecessary variables: We have variables like `e`, `f`, `i`, `j`, `k` which are not used in the code. We can remove them.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
char x[1000005];
int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0, maxi = 0;
int main() {
  fgets(x, sizeof(x), stdin);
  int leng = strlen(x);
  while (a < leng) {
    switch (x[a]) {
      case 'J':
        while (x[a++] == 'J') b++;
        while (x[a++] == 'O') c++;
        while (x[a++] == 'I') d++;
        if (b >= c && c <= d) maxi = max(maxi, c);
        b = c = d = 0;
        break;
      default:
        a++;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", maxi);
  return 0;
}
```

This code is more efficient in terms of memory and running time since it removes unnecessary operations and uses a better approach to handle character comparison.
