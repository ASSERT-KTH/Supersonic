This code is finding the maximum length of the sequence "JOI" in a given string. It counts the number of consecutive 'J', 'O' and 'I' characters and updates the maximum length of the sequence if it obeys the rule that the number of 'O' characters is less than or equal to the count of both 'J' and 'I' characters.

Optimization steps:

1. Instead of using multiple while loops, we can use switch-case that will improve the readability and also improve the performance slightly as there will be less number of iterations.

2. The fill() function at the start is not needed because you are going to overwrite the array with the input string.

3. The last "scanf("%d", &a);" is not needed, it doesn't contribute to the logic of the program.

4. Unused variables are removed from the code. 

The optimized code is:

```
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
char x[1000005];
int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0, maxi = 0;
int main() {
  scanf("%s", x);
  int leng = strlen(x);
  for (; a < leng; a++) {
    switch(x[a]) {
      case 'J':
        while(x[a] == 'J') { b++; a++; }
        a--;   // As the last increment would have increased 'a' by 1 more than needed
        break;
      case 'O':
        while(x[a] == 'O') { c++; a++; }
        a--; 
        break;
      case 'I':
        while(x[a] == 'I') { d++; a++; }
        a--; 
        break;
    }
    if (b >= c && c <= d) {
      maxi = max(maxi, c);
    }
    b = 0; c = 0; d = 0;
  }
  printf("%d\n", maxi);
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code would reduce the number of iterations and improve memory usage by removing redundant code and variables.
