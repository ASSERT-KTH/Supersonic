The given C/C++ program seems to read a string and then goes through a loop checking for sequences of 'J', 'O', 'I'. It tracks the length of each sequence and stores the minimum length of 'J', 'O', 'I' sequence in the variable maxi.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Avoid calling strlen() function: The strlen() function iterates over the whole string to find its length, which takes linear time. We can avoid this by calculating the length of the string while reading it.

2. Reduce redundant code: The while loops checking for 'J', 'O', 'I' are essentially doing the same thing. This can be reduced to a single function that returns the length of the sequence.

3. Avoid using the fill() function: This function is used to initialize the array with 'A', but this is not necessary as we overwrite it with scanf() immediately after.

4. Remove unnecessary scanf() at the end: The last scanf() seems to serve no purpose here and can be safely removed.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

char x[1000005];
int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0, maxi = 0;

int get_sequence_length(char target){
    int length = 0;
    while (x[a] == target) {
        length++;
        a++;
    }
    return length;
}

int main() {
    a = 0;
    scanf("%s%n", x, &a);
    while (a--) {
        if (x[a] != 'J') {
            a++;
        } else {
            b = get_sequence_length('J');
            c = get_sequence_length('O');
            d = get_sequence_length('I');
            if (b >= c && c <= d) {
                maxi = max(maxi, c);
            }
            b = 0;
            c = 0;
            d = 0;
        }
    }
    printf("%d\n", maxi);
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that the %n format specifier in scanf() returns the number of characters read into the buffer, which is used here to get the length of the string. This avoids the need to use the strlen() function.
