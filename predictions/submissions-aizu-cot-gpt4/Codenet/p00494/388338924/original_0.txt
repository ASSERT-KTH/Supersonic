Optimization Steps:

1. The initialization of `x` to 'A' is unnecessary, and it can be removed. We only need to read the string from the standard input.
2. The condition `if (a == leng)` can be removed because the `while` loop will terminate when `a` reaches `leng`.
3. The `while` loops can be replaced by `for` loops. This can make the intent clearer and possibly save some computations.
4. In the condition of `b >= c && c <= d`, it is better to use `min` function to find the minimum among `b`, `c`, and `d`. This will simplify the condition.
5. We don't need to reset `b`, `c`, and `d` to zero after each iteration. They can be re-initialized inside the loops.
6. The last `scanf("%d", &a);` is unnecessary and can be removed.

Optimized Program:

```C++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
char x[1000005];
int a = 0, b, c, d, maxi = 0;
int main() {
  scanf("%s", x);
  int leng = strlen(x);
  for (a = 0; a < leng; ++a) {
    if (x[a] == 'J') {
      for (b = 0; a < leng && x[a] == 'J'; ++a, ++b);
      for (c = 0; a < leng && x[a] == 'O'; ++a, ++c);
      for (d = 0; a < leng && x[a] == 'I'; ++a, ++d);
      maxi = max(maxi, min({b, c, d}));
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", maxi);
  return 0;
}
```

Note: As the code is written in C++, we can use the `min` function taking an initializer list as an argument, which is not available in C.
