This program counts the maximum number of consecutive 'O's in a string that are surrounded by 'J's and 'I's using a while loop.
 
The program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Remove the fill function as it is not needed. The fill function is used to initialize the array `x` with 'A', but it's not necessary because after that we are reading the input directly into the array `x`. 

2. Use a single loop instead of multiple loops. We can use a single loop to traverse the string, and use if-else conditions inside the loop to check the characters 'J', 'O', and 'I'.

3. There is no need to check `a == leng` for every iteration in the while loop. Use a for loop instead to iterate over the string.

4. The `scanf("%d", &a);` at the end of the program is not needed and can be removed.

5. Remove the unused variables `e`, `f`, `i`, `j`, `k`.

Here is the optimized program:

```C++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
char x[1000005];
int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0, maxi = 0;
int main() {
  scanf("%s", x);
  int leng = strlen(x);
  for (a = 0; a < leng;) {
    if (x[a] != 'J') {
      a++;
    } else {
      while (x[a] == 'J') {
        b++;
        a++;
      }
      while (x[a] == 'O') {
        c++;
        a++;
      }
      while (x[a] == 'I') {
        d++;
        a++;
      }
      if (b >= c && c <= d) {
        maxi = max(maxi, c);
      }
      b = 0;
      c = 0;
      d = 0;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", maxi);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces memory usage by not initializing the array `x` unnecessarily, and improves running time by using a single loop to traverse the string.
