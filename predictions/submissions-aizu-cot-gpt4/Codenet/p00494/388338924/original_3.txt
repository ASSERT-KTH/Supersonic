The given program seems to be counting the maximum number of consecutive 'JOI' strings (with possibly more 'J's before and more 'I's after) in the given input string.

Here are some steps for optimization:

1. The `fill()` function call at the start is unnecessary. It fills the entire array with 'A' which is then immediately overwritten by the `scanf()` function call. So, we can remove it to save both time and memory.

2. The `strlen()` function iterates over the entire string to find its length. However, we can get the length of the string during its input by using the return value of `scanf()` which would save us one full iteration over the string.

3. The inner `while` loops can be replaced with `for` loops. This change will not improve the time complexity but it will make the code more readable, and it slightly improves performance due to the reduction of loop condition checks.

4. The usage of `scanf()` at the end is unnecessary and can be removed.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
char x[1000005];
int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0, maxi = 0;
int main() {
  int leng = scanf("%s", x);
  for (a = 0; a < leng;) {
    if (x[a] != 'J') {
      a++;
    } else {
      for (; x[a] == 'J'; a++, b++);
      for (; x[a] == 'O'; a++, c++);
      for (; x[a] == 'I'; a++, d++);
      if (b >= c && c <= d) {
        maxi = max(maxi, c);
      }
      b = c = d = 0;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", maxi);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code will have the same time complexity as the original one (O(n)), but it will have less memory usage and possibly a slight improvement in performance due to the reduction of loop condition checks and the removal of unnecessary operations.
