First, let's break down the optimization process step by step:

1. The first thing that we can optimize is the initial fill of the array `x`. Filling all the 1000005 array elements with 'A' is unnecessary when we're just going to overwrite it with input from `scanf`.

2. The `while(1)` loops can be replaced with `for` loops. This will make the code cleaner and easier to understand. It also removes the need for the `break` statements, which can sometimes cause a slight performance hit.

3. There is an unused `scanf` at the end of the main function. We can remove it to save some time.

4. The variables `e, f, i, j, k` are declared but never used in the program. We should remove those.

5. The `leng` variable can be declared as `const` because we never modify it after its initial assignment.

Let's put all these changes into the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
char x[1000005];
int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0, maxi = 0;

int main() {
  scanf("%s", x);
  const int leng = strlen(x);
  for (a = 0; a < leng; ++a) {
    if (x[a] == 'J') {
      for (; x[a] == 'J'; ++a, ++b);
      for (; x[a] == 'O'; ++a, ++c);
      for (; x[a] == 'I'; ++a, ++d);
      if (b >= c && c <= d) {
        maxi = max(maxi, c);
      }
      b = c = d = 0;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", maxi);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program should have a faster running time and use less memory than the original program.
