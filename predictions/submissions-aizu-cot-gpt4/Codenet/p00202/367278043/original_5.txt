The given C/C++ program is a prime number finder and dynamic programming solver for a problem. The program could be optimized in several ways for better performance:

1. Prime number calculation can be optimized by skipping multiples of already found non-prime numbers. In the current code, the inner loop starts from "i", but we can start it from "i*i". Because, if 'n' is not a prime, it must have a divisor 'd' such that 1 < d < sqrt(n). So we just need to check until sqrt(n).

2. The dynamic programming part where it is calculating "dp[i]", it breaks the loop when it finds a true value. However, it keeps checking for smaller values in the array "a". We can optimize it by sorting the array "a" in reverse order.

3. The last loop where it checks for the largest prime number can be optimized by breaking the loop when it finds the first prime number because the array "dp" is checked in reverse order. In the current code, it keeps checking even after it finds the first prime number.

Now, let's write the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;
int n, x, a[30];
bool dp[1000001], prime[1000001];
int main() {
  prime[0] = prime[1] = false, prime[2] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i <= 1000000; i += 2)
    prime[i] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= 1000000; i += 2) {
    if (!prime[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i * i; j <= 1000000; j += i * 2)
      prime[j] = false;
  }
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &x), n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    sort(a, a + n, greater<int>());
    fill(dp, dp + x + 1, false);
    dp[0] = true;
    for (int i = 1; i <= x; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n && i >= a[j]; j++) {
        if (dp[i - a[j]]) {
          dp[i] = true;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    for (int i = x; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (dp[i] && prime[i]) {
        printf(i ? "%d\n" : "NA\n", i);
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This should provide a performance boost to the original program.
