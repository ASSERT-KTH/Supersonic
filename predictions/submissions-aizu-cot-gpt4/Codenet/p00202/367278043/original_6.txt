The given C++ code is a Sieve of Eratosthenes implementation for checking prime numbers and then it is using the Dynamic Programming approach to make subsets of given array elements. It then checks if the sum of any subset is prime or not. 

Optimization steps:

1. The program uses scanf and printf for input and output, which is already faster than cin and cout. So, we will retain that.

2. Prime number generation can be optimized. In the current approach, you are traversing every number starting from 3. However, we can start from square of the number as all numbers less than the square would have already been marked by previous numbers.

3. In the prime number generation, the inner loop is traversing by increment of 2 each time. This can be optimized by incrementing by i*2 each time. This is because, a multiple of i that is less than i*2 would have already been marked by a previous number.

4. The dynamic programming approach seems optimal. We are breaking the inner loop as soon as we find a subset sum. This is already a good optimization.

5. Instead of using the sort function, we can use the max_element function from the algorithm library to find the maximum element in the array. Since we only need the maximum element, this will be faster than sorting the array.

6. The dynamic programming array can be defined inside the while loop, this will ensure that memory is freed up after each test case.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;
int n, x, a[30];
bool prime[1000001];
int main() {
  prime[0] = prime[1] = false, prime[2] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i <= 1000000; i += 2)
    prime[i] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= 1000000; i += 2) {
    if (!prime[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i * i; j <= 1000000; j += i * 2)
      prime[j] = false;
  }
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &x), n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    int max_a = *max_element(a, a + n);
    bool dp[1000001] = {true};
    for (int i = 1; i <= x; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n && i >= a[j]; j++) {
        if (dp[i - a[j]]) {
          dp[i] = true;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    for (int i = x; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (dp[i] && prime[i]) {
        printf(i ? "%d\n" : "NA\n", i);
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}
```
