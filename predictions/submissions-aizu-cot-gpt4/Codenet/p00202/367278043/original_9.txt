The given C/C++ program is a prime numbers generator and a sort of dynamic programming solution for a problem. It does a series of tasks, such as generating prime numbers, reading inputs, sorting an array, dynamic programming, and printing the results.

Optimization can be achieved in several ways:

1. Memory Optimization: We can use a vector instead of an array to store only necessary values, this will save memory as vector dynamically allocates memory.

2. Time Optimization: The prime number generation algorithm can be optimized. Instead of checking all numbers, we only check odd numbers and numbers that are not multiples of already discovered primes.

3. We can reduce the time complexity of the dynamic programming part by breaking the loop as soon as we found the solution.

However, it's worth mentioning that the optimization of this code will likely have a minimal impact on performance due to modern compiler optimizations. Also, the code is already quite efficient. But let's apply these changes.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int n, x;
vector<int> a;
bool dp[1000001], prime[1000001];
int main() {
  prime[0] = prime[1] = false, prime[2] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i <= 1000000; i += 2)
    prime[i] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= 1000000; i += 2) {
    if (!prime[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i * i; j <= 1000000; j += 2 * i)
      prime[j] = false;
  }
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &x), n) {
    a.resize(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    sort(a.begin(), a.end());
    fill(dp, dp + x + 1, false);
    dp[0] = true;
    for (int i = 1; i <= x; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n && i >= a[j]; j++) {
        if (dp[i - a[j]]) {
          dp[i] = true;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    for (int i = x; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (dp[i] && prime[i]) {
        printf(i ? "%d\n" : "NA\n", i);
        break;
      }
    }
    a.clear();
  }
}
```
In this optimized code, I have used vector 'a' instead of array 'a', which allocates memory dynamically. This saves memory when 'n' is small. In the prime number generator, I have optimized the inner loop by starting from 'i*i' and incrementing 'j' by '2*i'. This skips even numbers and numbers that are multiples of already discovered primes. In the dynamic programming part, I have used 'fill' function to initialize 'dp' array, which is faster than a for loop. I have also added a 'break' statement to break the loop as soon as we found the solution.
