The given code calculates prime numbers up to 1 million using Sieve of Eratosthenes and then implements a dynamic programming approach to find the largest prime number that can be formed by adding up elements from the array 'a'. 

Optimization Steps:

1. The prime number generation can be optimized by incrementing 'i' in the loop by '2*i' instead of '2'. This is because multiples of 'i' which are less than 'i*i' would have already been marked in previous iterations.

2. Checking 'i' for prime can also be optimized. We don't need to check even numbers as they are not prime (except for 2). 

3. We can avoid sorting the array 'a' as it is not necessary for the given problem. 

4. The array 'dp' is initialized inside the while loop. Instead, we can initialize it once outside the loop and then just reset its values at the start of each loop iteration. This will reduce the time taken for memory allocation.

5. We are using the 'scanf' function for input which is slower compared to cin. We can use 'ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);' to speed up cin.

Optimized Program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int n, x, a[30];
bool dp[1000001], prime[1000001];
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);

  prime[0] = prime[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i <= 1000000; i++) prime[i] = true;
  for (int i = 2; i*i <= 1000000; i++) {
    if (!prime[i]) continue;
    for (int j = i*i; j <= 1000000; j += i) prime[j] = false;
  }

  dp[0] = true;
  while (cin >> n >> x, n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i];
    for (int i = 1; i <= x; i++) dp[i] = false;
    for (int i = 1; i <= x; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n && i >= a[j]; j++) {
        if (dp[i - a[j]]) {
          dp[i] = true;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    for (int i = x; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (dp[i] && prime[i]) {
        cout << (i ? to_string(i) : "NA") << "\n";
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: These optimizations are made with respect to the given code. Depending on the constraints of the problem, there could be other ways to optimize this code.
