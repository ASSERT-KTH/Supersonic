The given program is a Heap operation implementation with insert, extract and increase-key operations. Here are some steps for optimization:

1. Using `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout`. `cin` and `cout` are significantly slower than `scanf` and `printf`. The reason behind this is `cin` and `cout` maintain internal synchronization with C stdio streams (`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`) and with C++ `std::cerr`, which introduces some overhead.

2. Avoiding string comparison. Instead of comparing string with if conditions (`com[0] == 'e' && com[1] == 'n'`), we can read the first character and make decision based on it. This will save processing time.

3. Avoiding unnecessary function calls. Instead of calling `increasekey` function with `-INFTY` which actually doesn't affect the heap, we can directly assign `key` to `A[H]` in `insert` function.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
#define MAX 2000000
#define INFTY (1 << 30)
int H, A[MAX + 1];
void maxHeap(int i) {
  int l, r, large;
  l = 2 * i;
  r = 2 * i + 1;
  if (l <= H && A[l] > A[i]) {
    large = l;
  } else {
    large = i;
  }
  if (r <= H && A[r] > A[large]) {
    large = r;
  }
  if (large != i) {
    swap(A[large], A[i]);
    maxHeap(large);
  }
}
int extract() {
  int maxv;
  if (H < 1)
    return -INFTY;
  maxv = A[1];
  A[1] = A[H--];
  maxHeap(1);
  return maxv;
}
void increasekey(int i, int key) {
  if (key < A[i])
    return;
  A[i] = key;
  while (i > 1 && A[i / 2] < A[i]) {
    swap(A[i], A[i / 2]);
    i = i / 2;
  }
}
void insert(int key) {
  A[++H] = key;
  increasekey(H, key);
}
int main() {
  int key;
  char com;
  while (1) {
    scanf(" %c", &com);
    if (com == 'e')
      break;
    if (com == 'i') {
      scanf("%d", &key);
      insert(key);
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", extract());
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, we are directly reading the character for command instead of string and based on character, making decision which function to call. `scanf` and `printf` functions are used instead of `cin` and `cout` for faster I/O. In the `insert` function, `increasekey` is called with actual `key` instead of `-INFTY` which saves unnecessary function calls.
