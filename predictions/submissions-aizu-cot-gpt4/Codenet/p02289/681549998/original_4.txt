The given C/C++ code is already optimized in terms of algorithmic complexity. However, there are some minor optimizations that we can perform.

1. Using prefix increment (++H) instead of postfix increment (H++): The prefix increment operator is slightly faster than the postfix increment operator because the postfix operator needs to create a temporary copy of the object, increment the value, and then return the temporary copy. This is a micro-optimization and it won't have a noticeable impact on the overall performance, but it is a good practice to use prefix increment when the old value isn't needed.

2. Using bitwise shift operator for division by 2: In general, bitwise operations are faster than arithmetic operations. So, replacing the division operation with a right shift operation might give a very minor speedup. However, modern optimizing compilers are smart enough to convert division by powers of two into shift operations, so this optimization might not have a noticeable impact on the performance.

3. Removing unused variables: The variable 'com' is used only for input. It can be replaced by a string variable. This will not speed up the program, but it will reduce the memory usage slightly.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#define MAX 2000000
#define INFTY (1 << 30)
int H, A[MAX + 1];
void maxHeap(int i) {
  int l, r, large;
  l = 2 * i;
  r = 2 * i + 1;
  if (l <= H && A[l] > A[i]) {
    large = l;
  } else {
    large = i;
  }
  if (r <= H && A[r] > A[large]) {
    large = r;
  }
  if (large != i) {
    swap(A[large], A[i]);
    maxHeap(large);
  }
}
int extract() {
  int maxv;
  if (H < 1)
    return -INFTY;
  maxv = A[1];
  A[1] = A[--H];
  maxHeap(1);
  return maxv;
}
void increasekey(int i, int key) {
  if (key < A[i])
    return;
  A[i] = key;
  while (i > 1 && A[i >> 1] < A[i]) {
    swap(A[i], A[i >> 1]);
    i = i >> 1;
  }
}
void insert(int key) {
  ++H;
  A[H] = -INFTY;
  increasekey(H, key);
}
int main() {
  int key;
  string com;
  while (1) {
    cin >> com;
    if (com == "end")
      break;
    if (com == "insert") {
      cin >> key;
      insert(key);
    } else {
      cout << extract() << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations are minor and may not have a noticeable impact on the performance. The best way to optimize a program is to use efficient algorithms and data structures.
