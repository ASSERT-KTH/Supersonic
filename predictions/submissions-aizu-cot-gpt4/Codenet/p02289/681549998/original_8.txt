This program is implementing a heap and providing basic operations such as insert, extract maximum, and increase key. The optimizations that can be made are:

1. Use more expressive function names: the function names are not very descriptive. While this may not improve the runtime or memory usage, it will make the code easier to understand.

2. Use more efficient I/O operations: "cin" and "cout" are slower than scanf and printf. 

3. Avoid using global variables: Global variables can lead to code that is hard to debug and understand. Instead, encapsulate the heap and its operations in a class or struct.

4. Avoid using magic numbers: In several places, the program uses magic numbers like "1 << 30" (which represents a large number). This could be replaced with a named constant for clarity.

5. Use '\0' instead of 'e' and 'n' to check for end of string: Comparing the first and second character to 'e' and 'n' is less clear than checking for the end of the string with '\0'.

6. Use std::pair with the function insert: The function insert is expected to return an integer, but it doesn't return anything. This can be fixed by using std::pair.

The optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#define MAX 2000000
#define INFTY (1 << 30)

struct Heap {
    int H, A[MAX + 1];
    void maxHeapify(int i) {
        int l = 2 * i;
        int r = 2 * i + 1;
        int largest = (l <= H && A[l] > A[i]) ? l : i;
        if (r <= H && A[r] > A[largest]) largest = r;
        if (largest != i) {
            swap(A[largest], A[i]);
            maxHeapify(largest);
        }
    }
    int extractMax() {
        if (H < 1) return -INFTY;
        int maxVal = A[1];
        A[1] = A[H--];
        maxHeapify(1);
        return maxVal;
    }
    void increaseKey(int i, int key) {
        if (key < A[i]) return;
        A[i] = key;
        while (i > 1 && A[i / 2] < A[i]) {
            swap(A[i], A[i / 2]);
            i = i / 2;
        }
    }
    void insertKey(int key) {
        A[++H] = -INFTY;
        increaseKey(H, key);
    }
};

int main() {
    int key;
    char command[10];
    Heap heap;
    while (1) {
        scanf("%s", command);
        if (strcmp(command, "end") == 0) break;
        if (strcmp(command, "insert") == 0) {
            scanf("%d", &key);
            heap.insertKey(key);
        } else {
            printf("%d\n", heap.extractMax());
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should have the same functionality as the original but is easier to understand and should run faster due to the use of scanf and printf instead of cin and cout.
