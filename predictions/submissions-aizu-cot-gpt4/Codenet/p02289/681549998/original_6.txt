The original program is a heap implementation in C++. Here are some steps to optimize it:

1. The main function has a while loop where it continuously checks for commands. It breaks the loop when the command is 'end'. This could be made more efficient by using a do-while loop instead of a while loop. The condition to break the loop is rare compared to the continuous execution of the loop. The do-while loop checks the condition at the end, which would make it a bit more efficient.

2. The function `increasekey()` uses a while loop for heapifying the elements. This loop could be made more efficient by converting it into a for loop. The values of `i` are predictable and it is halved in every iteration. This could be done in a for loop.

3. There are multiple if conditions in the maxHeap function which can also be converted into ternary operators for more readability and efficiency.

4. The function `extract()` has a condition check for H < 1. If H is less than 1, it returns -INFTY. Instead, you can directly use the max function to return the maximum of A[1] and -INFTY and then perform the subsequent operations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#define MAX 2000000
#define INFTY (1 << 30)
int H, A[MAX + 1];
void maxHeap(int i) {
  int l = 2 * i;
  int r = 2 * i + 1;
  int large = (l <= H && A[l] > A[i]) ? l : i;
  large = (r <= H && A[r] > A[large]) ? r : large;
  if (large != i) {
    swap(A[large], A[i]);
    maxHeap(large);
  }
}
int extract() {
  if (H < 1)
    return -INFTY;
  int maxv = max(A[1], -INFTY);
  A[1] = A[H--];
  maxHeap(1);
  return maxv;
}
void increasekey(int i, int key) {
  if (key < A[i])
    return;
  A[i] = key;
  for (; i > 1 && A[i / 2] < A[i]; i /= 2)
    swap(A[i], A[i / 2]);
}
int insert(int key) {
  H++;
  A[H] = -INFTY;
  increasekey(H, key);
}
int main() {
  int key;
  char com[10];
  do {
    cin >> com;
    if (com[0] == 'i') {
      cin >> key;
      insert(key);
    } else if (com[0] != 'e') {
      cout << extract() << endl;
    }
  } while (com[0] != 'e' || com[1] != 'n');
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that this optimization is minor and it may not significantly improve the performance of your program. The major factors affecting the performance of this program are the algorithmic complexity of the heap operations and the size of the input, which are not addressed by this optimization.
