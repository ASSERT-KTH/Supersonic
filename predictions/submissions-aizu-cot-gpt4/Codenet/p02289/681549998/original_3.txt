The given C++ program is implementing a max heap with operations such as insertion, extraction of max, and increasing key. The original code is already fairly optimized, but there are still a few possible improvements in terms of coding style and efficiency.

Optimization Steps:
1. Avoid using `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. Instead, use `scanf` and `printf` which are faster.
2. Reduce the size of the character array `com` used for command input. The commands are only two characters long, so the array size can be reduced to 3 (including null character).
3. Instead of using the `swap` function from the `algorithm` library, write an inline swap function to avoid the function call overhead. 
4. In the `increasekey` function, the `while` loop uses division to update `i`. Bitwise right shift operation can be used which is faster than division.
5. Similarly, in the `maxHeap` function, the left and right children of a node can be computed using bitwise left shift operation instead of multiplication.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#define MAX 2000000
#define INFTY (1 << 30)
int H, A[MAX + 1];

inline void swap(int &a, int &b){
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}

void maxHeap(int i) {
  int l, r, large;
  l = i << 1;
  r = (i << 1) + 1;
  if (l <= H && A[l] > A[i]) {
    large = l;
  } else {
    large = i;
  }
  if (r <= H && A[r] > A[large]) {
    large = r;
  }
  if (large != i) {
    swap(A[large], A[i]);
    maxHeap(large);
  }
}

int extract() {
  int maxv;
  if (H < 1)
    return -INFTY;
  maxv = A[1];
  A[1] = A[H--];
  maxHeap(1);
  return maxv;
}

void increasekey(int i, int key) {
  if (key < A[i])
    return;
  A[i] = key;
  while (i > 1 && A[i >> 1] < A[i]) {
    swap(A[i], A[i >> 1]);
    i = i >> 1;
  }
}

int insert(int key) {
  H++;
  A[H] = -INFTY;
  increasekey(H, key);
}

int main() {
  int key;
  char com[3];
  while (1) {
    scanf("%s", com);
    if (com[0] == 'e' && com[1] == 'n')
      break;
    if (com[0] == 'i') {
      scanf("%d", &key);
      insert(key);
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", extract());
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program should run faster and use less memory than the original one.
