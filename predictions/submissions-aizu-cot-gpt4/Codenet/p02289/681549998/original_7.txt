Optimizations:

1. We can remove the "cstdio" and "cstring" libraries as they are not being used in this program, reducing the amount of memory the program uses.

2. The function "increasekey" is only used in the "insert" function. We can combine these two functions into one, reducing the function call overheads which can improve the running time.

3. The function "extract" is called only once. We can replace the function call with the function body directly in the main function to save on function call overheads.

4. The use of character array 'com' to take input can be replaced by string which is more reliable and safer.

5. Using "endl" for line breaking forces a buffer flush which can be costly in terms of performance. We can replace "endl" with "\n" to avoid unnecessary buffer flushes.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#define MAX 2000000
#define INFTY (1 << 30)
int H, A[MAX + 1];

void maxHeap(int i) {
  int l = 2 * i;
  int r = 2 * i + 1;
  int large = (l <= H && A[l] > A[i]) ? l : i;
  if (r <= H && A[r] > A[large]) {
    large = r;
  }
  if (large != i) {
    swap(A[large], A[i]);
    maxHeap(large);
  }
}

void insert(int key) {
  H++;
  A[H] = -INFTY;
  if (key < A[H])
    return;
  A[H] = key;
  int i = H;
  while (i > 1 && A[i / 2] < A[i]) {
    swap(A[i], A[i / 2]);
    i = i / 2;
  }
}

int main() {
  int key;
  string com;
  while (1) {
    cin >> com;
    if (com == "end")
      break;
    if (com[0] == 'i') {
      cin >> key;
      insert(key);
    } else {
      if (H < 1)
        cout << -INFTY << "\n";
      else {
        int maxv = A[1];
        A[1] = A[H--];
        maxHeap(1);
        cout << maxv << "\n";
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
