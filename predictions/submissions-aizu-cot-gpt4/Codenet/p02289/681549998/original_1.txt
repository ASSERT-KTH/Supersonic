Here are the steps to optimize the given C++ program:

1. Avoid using global variables: Global variables can lead to code that is hard to debug and understand. Instead, encapsulate the variables needed in a class or pass them as function parameters.

2. Use `std::vector` instead of raw array: This automatically manages the memory for you and it can grow dynamically.

3. Use `std::priority_queue` for heap operations: It provides inbuilt functions for heap operations like push, pop and top. This saves memory and makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

4. Avoid using `std::endl`: `std::endl` not only adds a newline character but also flushes the output stream, which can be a costly operation in terms of time. Use `"\n"` instead.

5. Replace the while loop with a for loop in the `increasekey` function: This will avoid the unnecessary computation of `i/2` two times in each iteration.

6. Use `std::string` instead of raw C-style string (character array): This is safer and easier to handle.

Here's the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

#define INFTY (1 << 30)

class Heap{
public:
    priority_queue<int> pq;

    void insert(int key){
        pq.push(key);
    }

    int extract(){
        if(pq.empty())
            return -INFTY;
        int maxv = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        return maxv;
    }
};

int main() {
    Heap heap;
    int key;
    string com;
    while (1) {
        cin >> com;
        if (com == "end")
            break;
        if (com == "insert") {
            cin >> key;
            heap.insert(key);
        } else {
            cout << heap.extract() << "\n";
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
