This program is a basic implementation of a heap data structure with insert and extract functionalities. Here are a few optimizations that can be made:

1. Avoid Large Static Array: The current implementation uses a large static array of size 2,000,000 which consumes a lot of memory. We can make use of a dynamic data structure like std::vector which handles memory allocation and deallocation efficiently.

2. Use C++ I/O Functions: The program uses a mix of C and C++ I/O functions. It's good practice to stick with one. Here, we will use C++ I/O functions, which are generally considered safer and easier to use.

3. Simplify Input Parsing: The current method of parsing input data is convoluted and can be simplified by using the built-in extraction operator (>>).

4. Use of 'new' for Memory Allocation: In modern C++, it's often recommended to avoid raw new and delete. Instead, consider using a smart pointer, or in this case, a std::vector which handles memory management for you.

After applying these optimizations, the new program would look like this:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Heap {
public:
  void insert(int data) {
    array.push_back(data);
    push_heap(array.begin(), array.end());
  }

  int extract() {
    pop_heap(array.begin(), array.end());
    int maxElement = array.back();
    array.pop_back();
    return maxElement;
  }

private:
  vector<int> array;
};

int main() {
  string cmd;
  int data;
  Heap heap;

  while (cin >> cmd) {
    if (cmd == "end") break;

    if (cmd == "insert") {
      cin >> data;
      heap.insert(data);
    } else if (cmd == "extract") {
      cout << heap.extract() << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This program uses less memory, is simpler, and should be faster due to the use of built-in functions and data structures.
