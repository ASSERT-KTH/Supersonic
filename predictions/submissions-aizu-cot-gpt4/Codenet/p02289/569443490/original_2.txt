The given code is for a Heap data structure with insert and extract operations. The insert operation inserts an element into the heap and the extract operation removes the maximum element from the heap.

The improvements that can be made are:
1. Use `std::vector` instead of a raw pointer: This will automatically handle memory allocation and deallocation, preventing possible memory leaks.
2. Use `std::priority_queue` instead of manually creating a heap: This reduces the possibility of errors and makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
3. Use `std::stoi` to convert string to integer: This simplifies the code and improves clarity.
4. Replace `fgets` with `std::cin` and `printf` with `std::cout` for consistency and ease of use.

Here's the optimized code:
```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::priority_queue<int> heap;
    std::string input;
    while (std::getline(std::cin, input)) {
        if (input[2] == 'd')
            break;
        if (input[0] == 'i') {
            std::string numberAsString = input.substr(2);
            heap.push(std::stoi(numberAsString));
        } else {
            std::cout << heap.top() << std::endl;
            heap.pop();
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
