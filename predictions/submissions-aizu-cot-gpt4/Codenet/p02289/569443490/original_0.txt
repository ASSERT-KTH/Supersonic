The program has a heap data structure with insert and extract operations. It reads commands from the standard input. The command "i" followed by a number will insert the number into the heap. Any other input will extract the maximum element from the heap.

Let's see how we can optimize the code:

1. The size of the heap is fixed to 2000000, which may waste memory if the actual number of elements is much smaller. We could use a dynamic data structure like `std::vector<int>` instead of a raw array. This would automatically manage memory for us, increasing the size when necessary and decreasing it when elements are removed.

2. The `max_heapify` function is called unnecessarily when extracting the maximum element. We could avoid this by maintaining the heap property during the insertion operation.

3. The `fgets` function is used to read commands from the standard input. This function is slower than `std::cin` from the C++ standard library. We could use `std::cin` instead.

4. The loop that converts the number from a string to an integer is inefficient. We could use the `std::stoi` function from the C++ standard library to do this more efficiently.

5. The `printf` function is used to print the extracted maximum element. This function is slower than `std::cout` from the C++ standard library. We could use `std::cout` instead.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
class Heap {
public:
  void insert(int data) {
    array.push_back(data);
    push_heap(array.begin(), array.end());
  }
  int extract() {
    pop_heap(array.begin(), array.end());
    int ret = array.back();
    array.pop_back();
    return ret;
  }

private:
  vector<int> array;
};
int main() {
  int insert_data;
  string command;
  Heap heap;
  while (true) {
    cin >> command;
    if (command[0] == 'd')
      break;
    if (command[0] == 'i') {
      insert_data = stoi(command.substr(1));
      heap.insert(insert_data);
    } else {
      cout << heap.extract() << '\n';
    }
  }
}
```

In the optimized code, we use `std::vector<int>` to store the heap elements and `std::push_heap` and `std::pop_heap` from the C++ standard library to maintain the heap property. We also use `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input and output, and `std::stoi` to convert the number from a string to an integer.
