The given program receives commands from the user. If the user enters "insert" followed by a number, it adds the number to a priority queue. If the user enters anything else (except "end"), it removes the maximum number from the queue and prints it. The program runs until the user enters "end". 

The optimization can be done by reducing the number of I/O operations which are usually time-consuming. The "pop_and_print" function can be modified to not print the value immediately, but to return it instead. We will then store these values in a vector and print them all at once at the end. This will reduce the number of I/O operations, which should speed up the program.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int pop_and_return(priority_queue<int> &qu) {
  int top = qu.top();
  qu.pop();
  return top;
}

int main() {
  string s;
  int inp;
  priority_queue<int> qu;
  vector<int> result;
  while (1) {
    cin >> s;
    if (s == "end") {
      break;
    } else if (s == "insert") {
      cin >> inp;
      qu.push(inp);
    } else {
      result.push_back(pop_and_return(qu));
    }
  }

  for (const auto &i : result) {
    cout << i << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the above code, the function "pop_and_return" pops the top element from the queue and returns it. In the main function, we collect all the popped values in a "result" vector. Finally, we print all the values at once after the end of the main loop.
