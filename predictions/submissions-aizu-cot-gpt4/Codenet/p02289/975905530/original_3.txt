The given program is quite efficient, but there are a few minor improvements that can be made.

1. Pass by Reference: The function `pop_and_print` already takes a priority_queue by reference, which is good because it avoids copying the entire queue. It is already optimized.

2. Avoiding Unnecessary `std::endl`: `std::endl` not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output stream. If you're writing a lot of data at once, this can slow down your program. Use `"\n"` instead when you don't need the flush.

3. Use of `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This can make I/O operations faster in some cases. 

4. Unnecessary `return 0;` in `int main()`: The C++ standard guarantees that the `main` function will return 0 if control reaches the end of `main` without encountering a return statement. So, we can remove the `return 0;` line at the end of `main`.

5. Use `const char*` instead of `std::string`: Instead of using `std::string` for `s`, we can use `const char*`. Comparisons with string literals are faster with `const char*` than with `std::string`.

6. Avoid `using namespace std;`: It's generally considered bad practice to use the `std` namespace globally, as it can cause name collisions. Instead, specify where you're using things from the `std` namespace.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits.h>
#include <queue>

int pop_and_print(std::priority_queue<int> &qu) {
  std::cout << qu.top() << "\n";
  qu.pop();
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  const char* s;
  int inp;
  std::priority_queue<int> qu;
  while (1) {
    std::cin >> s;
    if (strcmp(s, "end") == 0) {
      break;
    } else if (strcmp(s, "insert") == 0) {
      std::cin >> inp;
      qu.push(inp);
    } else {
      pop_and_print(qu);
    }
  }
}
```
