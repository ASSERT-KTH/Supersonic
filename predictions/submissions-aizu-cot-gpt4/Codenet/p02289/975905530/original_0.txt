The given program primarily uses a priority_queue data structure to insert integers, and pop and print the top element when required. It keeps running until the user inputs "end".

Here are the potential optimizations:

1. **Pass by Reference**: The function pop_and_print is already optimized by passing the queue by reference. This avoids unnecessary copying of the queue which can be expensive in terms of memory and time if the queue is large.

2. **Avoiding endl**: `endl` not only inserts a newline, but it also flushes the output buffer. This can make your output operations significantly slower. It's usually better to use "\n" instead of `endl` if you don't need to flush the buffer.

3. **ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)**: This can speed up the I/O operations. It disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. But, once you have used it, you must not use the C standard streams. 

4. **cin.tie(NULL)**: This unties cin from cout. Tied streams ensure that one stream is flushed automatically before each I/O operation on the tied stream. Untying them may also increase I/O operation speed. 

After applying these optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits.h>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int pop_and_print(priority_queue<int> &qu) {
  cout << qu.top() << "\n";
  qu.pop();
  return 0;
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  string s;
  int inp;
  priority_queue<int> qu;
  while (1) {
    cin >> s;
    if (s == "end") {
      break;
    } else if (s == "insert") {
      cin >> inp;
      qu.push(inp);
    } else {
      pop_and_print(qu);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Remember that these optimizations might not always result in noticeable improvements, especially for small programs, but they can make a difference in larger, more complex programs.
