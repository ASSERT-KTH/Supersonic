Here are some optimizations we can perform on the given C/C++ program:

1. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` - This line will help to speed up the I/O operations which can save a lot of time in a program with a lot of I/O operations.

2. Use `cin.tie(NULL);` - This unties `cin` from `cout`. Tied streams ensure that one stream is flushed automatically before each I/O operation on the other stream. 

3. Instead of using `endl` to end the line, you can use "\n". The `endl` not only ends the line but also flushes the output which can result in a slower program compared to "\n". 

4. Pass `priority_queue<int>` by reference to `pop_and_print` function to avoid copying.

Let's apply these changes to your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

void pop_and_print(priority_queue<int> &qu) {
  cout << qu.top() << "\n";
  qu.pop();
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  string s;
  int inp;
  priority_queue<int> qu;
  while (true) {
    cin >> s;
    if (s == "end") {
      break;
    } else if (s == "insert") {
      cin >> inp;
      qu.push(inp);
    } else {
      pop_and_print(qu);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: These optimizations are specific to the standard C++ libraries. And it's worth mentioning that these changes may not result in noticeable performance improvement if the program is small and/or does not perform many I/O operations.
