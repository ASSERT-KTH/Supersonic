This program reads four integers from the standard input, checks if the first integer is zero and if not, prints 110000 parentheses followed by the sum of the four integers. If the first integer is zero, it breaks the loop. 

Here're some possible optimizations:

1. Variable Placement: Instead of declaring the array `a` at the beginning of `main()`, we can declare it inside the while loop. This is because `a` is not used outside the loop and this placement can help in reducing the scope of the variable.

2. Combine Output Operations: The program uses `putchar()` in a loop to output 110000 parentheses, and then uses `printf()` to output the sum of the four integers. We can combine these two operations into a single `printf()` call. This reduces the number of function calls and can help improve the program's performance.

3. Use `return 0`: Although modern compilers add it implicitly, it's good practice to add `return 0` at the end of `main()` to indicate successful termination of the program.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  while (1) {
    int a[4];
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
      scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    }
    if (a[0] == 0) {
      break;
    }
    printf("%*s%d+%d+%d+%d\n", 110001, "(", a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In the `printf` function, `%*s` is used to print a string of a specific width. The width is provided by the number before the string. So `printf("%*s", 110000, "(");` will print 110000 parentheses. Using this, we can print the parentheses and the sum of the four integers in a single `printf` call.
