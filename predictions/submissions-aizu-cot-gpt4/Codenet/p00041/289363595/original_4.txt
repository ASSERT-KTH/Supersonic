The given program can be optimized in several ways:

1. **Minimize the use of the `putchar` function**: In the given code, the `putchar` function is used 110000 times to print the character '('. This can be quite inefficient. A faster approach would be to use the `printf` function to print the character '(' 110000 times in one go.

2. **Output buffering**: To minimize the overhead of multiple `printf` calls, we can use a buffer to store the output, and then print it out at once. 

3. **Reorganizing the loop condition**: Instead of the infinite while loop with a break condition inside, we can use the condition directly in the loop statement. This will make the code easier to read and maintain.

4. **Using `puts` instead of `putchar('\n')`**: The `puts` function adds a newline character at the end of the output, so we can use it instead of `putchar('\n')`. This will also make the code cleaner.

Here's the optimized version of the code based on these suggestions:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a[4];
  char buffer[110001] = {0};  // buffer to store the output
  for (int i = 0; i < 110000; ++i) buffer[i] = '(';  // fill the buffer with '('

  while (scanf("%d%d%d%d", &a[0], &a[1], &a[2], &a[3]) == 4 && a[0] != 0) {
    printf("%s", buffer);  // print the buffer
    printf("%d+%d+%d+%d", a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);
    puts("");  // print a newline character
  }
}
```

This optimized program should run faster and use less memory than the original one.
