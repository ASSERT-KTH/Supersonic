This program reads four integers in an infinite loop, checks if the first integer is zero, and if it's not, it prints 110000 '(' characters, then the four integers separated by '+', and finally a newline character. If the first integer is zero, it breaks the loop.

To optimize this program, we can consider the following points:

1. Using a constant for the array size and the number of '(' characters to be printed. This can improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

2. Instead of using a for loop to print the '(' character 110000 times, we can use the printf function with a width specifier to print the character a certain number of times. This can reduce the time complexity of the program.

3. We can check if the first number is 0 right after reading it, and if it is, we can break the loop immediately without having to read the rest of the numbers. This can save some I/O operations and thus improve the performance.

4. We can also use the 'return 0' statement at the end of the main function to indicate that the program has ended successfully. Although this is not necessary in modern C standards, it is still a good practice to include it for the sake of completeness and compatibility with older standards.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define SIZE 4
#define NUM_BRACKETS 110000

int main() {
  int a[SIZE];
  
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d", &a[0]);
    if (a[0] == 0) {
      break;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i < SIZE; ++i) {
      scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    }
    
    printf("%*c", NUM_BRACKETS, '(');
    printf("%d+%d+%d+%d\n", a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

The printf function with the width specifier "%*c" prints the character '(' NUM_BRACKETS times. The '*' in the format specifier tells printf to take the width from an additional integer argument preceding the argument to be printed.
