The given code is a C++ program that reads an integer input, checks for factors of the input number in the 'lists' vector, and outputs these factors. The 'lists' vector is populated with numbers from 2 to 300000 that are not multiples of any smaller number in the 'lists' vector and the remainder of the number divided by 7 is either 1 or 6.

Here are some optimizations that can be made:

1. Avoid unnecessary checks: The 'checked' array is used to track which numbers have been checked and added to the 'lists' vector. Once a number is added to 'lists', all its multiples are marked as checked. However, the current approach unnecessarily checks the multiples of numbers that are not added to 'lists'. We can modify the code so that it only marks multiples of numbers as checked if the number is added to 'lists'. 

2. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The 'ans' vector is used to store the factors of the input number. However, it is re-allocated for every input number. We can declare 'ans' outside of the loop, and simply clear the vector at the start of each iteration, reducing the overhead of memory allocation.

3. Use 'reserve' function for vectors: The 'reserve' function can be used to pre-allocate memory for vectors. This can potentially reduce the number of memory reallocations and copies when elements are added to the vectors.

4. Use '\n' instead of 'endl': The 'endl' command in C++ performs a newline operation and then a flush operation on the output buffer. If the program outputs frequently but flushing is not necessary until the program is done, using '\n' can be faster.

5. Use 'emplace_back' instead of 'push_back': The 'emplace_back' function constructs the new element in-place at the end of the vector, potentially providing performance benefits by eliminating the need for a temporary object and extra copy or move operations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define rep2(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
signed main() {
  cin.tie(0);
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  vector<int> lists;
  lists.reserve(300000);
  bool checked[300000 + 1] = {};
  rep2(i, 2, 300000 + 1) {
    if (checked[i])
      continue;
    if (i % 7 == 1 || i % 7 == 6) {
      lists.emplace_back(i);
      for(int j = i; j <= 300000; j += i) {
        checked[j] = true;
      }
    }
  }
  vector<int> ans;
  ans.reserve(300000);
  while (true) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    if (n == 1)
      break;
    ans.clear();
    for (auto p : lists) {
      if (n % p == 0) {
        ans.emplace_back(p);
      }
    }
    cout << n << ':';
    for(auto a : ans) { cout << " " << a; }
    cout << '\n';
  }
}
```
