This program seems to be checking for numbers that are relatively prime to 7 (i.e., numbers that when divided by 7 give a remainder of 1 or 6). It then stores these numbers in a list and for each input number, it checks if it is divisible by these stored numbers. The optimization steps can be as follows:

1. Remove unnecessary library inclusions: The program includes several libraries which are not used. These can be removed to reduce compile time.

2. Efficient use of memory: The array "checked" is of size 300001 and is used to mark if a number is relatively prime to 7. However, this can be optimized by using a bitset which is more memory efficient.

3. Avoiding unnecessary recalculation: The loop checking for divisibility can be optimized by breaking the loop once a number greater than the input number is reached.

4. Reuse of vector space: Instead of creating a new vector "ans" for each input number, we can reuse the same vector by clearing it after the output is printed.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define rep2(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
vector<int> lists;
bitset<300001> checked;
signed main() {
  cin.tie(0);
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  rep2(i, 2, 300000 + 1) {
    if (checked[i])
      continue;
    if (i % 7 == 1 || i % 7 == 6) {
      lists.push_back(i);
      int k = 1;
      while (i * k <= 300000) {
        checked[i * k] = true;
        k++;
      }
    }
  }
  vector<int> ans;
  while (true) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    if (n == 1)
      break;
    for (auto p : lists) {
      if (p > n)
        break;
      if (n % p == 0) {
        ans.push_back(p);
      }
    }
    cout << n << ':';
    for (auto p : ans) cout << " " << p;
    cout << endl;
    ans.clear();
  }
}
```
