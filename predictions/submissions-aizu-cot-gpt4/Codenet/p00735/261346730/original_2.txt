The given program is a simple number factorization program, where it checks for the factors of a number 'n' and prints them out. The factors are only the numbers that are either 1 or 6 (mod 7) and are less than or equal to 300000. However, there are several areas where this program could be optimized.

Step 1: Avoid unnecessary memory usage
The program is using a boolean array 'checked' of size 300001 to mark the checked numbers. However, it's not necessary to keep all the checked numbers, we can just skip the non-required numbers (the numbers which are not 1 or 6 mod 7) in the loop.

Step 2: Avoid push_back operation on vector
The 'push_back' function on vector involves memory reallocation if the size exceeds the current capacity. It's better to calculate the number of required elements beforehand and allocate the memory at once.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary loop for factor checking
The program checks for factors of 'n' in each loop. However, since 'n' is not changing in the loop, it's not necessary to do it in each iteration. We can just check the factors once and store them in a list.

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary I/O operations
The program prints out the factors in each loop. However, since the factors are not changing in the loop, it's not necessary to print them in each iteration. We can just store them in a string and print out the string at the end of the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (n); i++)
#define rep2(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
#define pb push_back

signed main() {
  cin.tie(0);
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);

  // Pre-calculate the list of required numbers
  vector<ll> lists;
  lists.reserve(60000);
  rep2(i, 2, 300000 + 1) {
    if (i % 7 == 1 || i % 7 == 6) {
      lists.pb(i);
    }
  }

  // Read the input number and calculate the factors
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> ans;
  ans.reserve(60000);
  for (auto p : lists) {
    if (n % p == 0) {
      ans.pb(p);
    }
  }

  // Prepare the output string
  string output = to_string(n) + ':';
  for (auto i : ans) {
    output += " " + to_string(i);
  }

  // Print out the result
  cout << output << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code reduces the memory usage by avoiding the unnecessary boolean array, optimizes the vector operations by pre-allocating the memory, and reduces the number of I/O operations by preparing the output string in advance.
