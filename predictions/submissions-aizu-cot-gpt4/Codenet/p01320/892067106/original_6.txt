This program is a bit complex to optimize as it is already written with performance in mind. However, there are still a few minor changes that can be made to slightly enhance its performance:

1. Remove unnecessary `#include` statements: The program includes many libraries that are not used in the code. Removing these unnecessary includes can speed up the compilation time. For instance, `<complex>`, `<bitset>`, `<deque>`, `<list>`, `<queue>`, `<stack>`, `<valarray>` headers are not used in the code.

2. Avoid using `std::endl`: The `std::endl` not only inserts a new line, but it also flushes the stream. This can be inefficient if you are writing to the stream many times in a row and the stream doesn't need to be flushed. Use "\n" instead.

3. Avoid unnecessary type casting: The program uses a lot of type casting that is not needed. For instance, `(int)(x)` is used in the macro definitions. Since `x` is already an `int`, there's no need to cast it.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <assert.h>
#include <climits>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <ctime>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int ll;
typedef unsigned int uint;
typedef unsigned char uchar;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pll;
typedef vector<int> vi;
#define REP(i, x) for (int i = 0; i < (x); i++)
#define REPS(i, x) for (int i = 1; i <= (x); i++)
#define RREP(i, x) for (int i = ((x)-1); i >= 0; i--)
#define RREPS(i, x) for (int i = ((x)); i > 0; i--)
#define FOR(i, c) for (__typeof((c).begin()) i = (c).begin(); i != (c).end(); i++)
#define RFOR(i, c) for (__typeof((c).rbegin()) i = (c).rbegin(); i != (c).rend(); i++)
#define ALL(container) (container).begin(), (container).end()
#define RALL(container) (container).rbegin(), (container).rend()
#define SZ(container) container.size()
#define mp(a, b) make_pair(a, b)
#define UNIQUE(v) v.erase(unique(v.begin(), v.end()), v.end());

// Rest of the program...

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  while (cin >> n >> m >> k, n) {
    MSQ temp(m, k);
    vector<P> shoolack(n);
    REP(i, n) cin >> shoolack[i];
    R best = 2000;
    REP(i, n) REP(j, m) {
      if (!check(temp, best - EPS, shoolack, i, j))
        continue;
      R l = EPS, r = best;
      REP(itr, 50) {
        R m = (l + r) * .5;
        if (check(temp, m, shoolack, i, j))
          r = m;
        else
          l = m;
      }
      best = r;
    }
    printf("%.10f\n", (double)best);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations are very minor and may not result in any noticeable difference in performance. The major factors affecting performance in this code are likely to be the algorithms used and the efficiency of the mathematics library functions, which are already pretty well optimized by the compiler and the standard library.
