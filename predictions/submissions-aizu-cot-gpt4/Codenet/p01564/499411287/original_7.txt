This is an intricate C++ program with complex operations. The major improvements that can be applied for optimization are:

1. **Memory optimization**: The program uses a lot of dynamic memory allocation with new keyword which is costly in terms of memory and performance. The program could benefit from using `std::make_shared` or `std::make_unique` (from C++11 onwards) instead of `new` as it adds a level of safety by preventing memory leaks and reduces the overhead of using raw pointers.

2. **Code Readability**: The program doesn't have many comments. Adding comments to explain the purpose of the code will make it easier for other developers to understand. 

3. **Avoiding unnecessary copies**: In some functions like `merge` and `rev`, the Node objects are passed by value. This causes unnecessary copies of the objects. We can pass these objects by reference to avoid costly copy operations, especially when these objects are large.

4. **Avoiding unnecessary computations**: In the `merge` function, max operations are performed multiple times. We could store the results of these operations in temporary variables and reuse them, instead of performing the same operations again.

5. **Avoiding raw pointers**: The Tree structure uses raw pointers for 'l' and 'r'. It would be more optimal to replace these with smart pointers like `std::shared_ptr` or `std::unique_ptr` as these automatically deallocate memory when they go out of scope, thus preventing memory leaks.

Here's the optimized code with the changes suggested above:

```cpp
//... rest of the code remains same
struct Tree {
typedef shared_ptr<Tree> NP;
NP l, r;

struct Node {
    Node(int sz = 0) : sz(sz), lzf(false) {}
    int sz;
    int d, sm, lz;
    int lsm, rsm, ma, mv;
    bool lzf;
} n;

Tree() {}

Tree(int sz, int hev[], int hevsm[], int data[]) : n(sz) {
    //... rest of the code remains same
    l = make_shared<Tree>(md, hev, hevsm, data);
    r = make_shared<Tree>(sz - md, hev + md, hevsm + md, data + md);
    n = merge(l->n, r->n);
}

//... rest of the code remains same

static Node merge(const Node &l, const Node &r) {
    if (l.sz == 0)
        return r;
    if (r.sz == 0)
        return l;
    Node res(l.sz + r.sz);
    res.sm = l.sm + r.sm;
    int l_sm_plus_r_lsm = l.sm + r.lsm;
    int r_sm_plus_l_rsm = r.sm + l.rsm;
    res.lsm = max(l.lsm, l_sm_plus_r_lsm);
    res.rsm = max(r.rsm, r_sm_plus_l_rsm);
    res.ma = max({l.ma, r.ma, l.rsm + r.lsm});
    res.mv = max(l.mv, r.mv);
    return res;
}

static Node rev(Node &u) {
    swap(u.lsm, u.rsm);
    return u;
}

//... rest of the code remains same

};
