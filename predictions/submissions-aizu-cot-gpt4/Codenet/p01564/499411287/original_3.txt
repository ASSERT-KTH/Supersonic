This C++ code is quite complex and already highly optimized, but there are a few small improvements that could be made:

1. Unnecessary `#include` statements: There are a lot of `#include` statements at the top of the code and not all of them are needed. We can remove the unnecessary ones based on the code usage to make the code cleaner.

2. The use of `getchar_unlocked()`: This method is faster than `getchar()`, but it's not thread-safe. If you're sure that there's no multithreading happening, it's fine to use. Otherwise, you might want to replace it with `getchar()`.

3. The use of `putchar_unlocked()`: Similar to `getchar_unlocked()`, this method is also not thread-safe. If you're sure that there's no multithreading happening, it's fine to use. Otherwise, you might want to replace it with `putchar()`.

4. The use of `malloc()`: `malloc()` does not initialize the memory it allocates, causing potential issues with uninitialized variables. It might be better to use `new` instead, which also has the advantage of being type-safe.

5. The use of `__asm__ volatile`: Inline assembly can make code hard to read and maintain, and it's not portable between different compilers or architectures. This is not something we can easily change, but it's something to be aware of.

With those changes, the optimized code will look as followed:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <cassert>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <random>
#include <set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
//... rest of the code remains unchanged ...

inline int getint() {
  char c;
  int res = 0;
  bool neg = false;
  while (true) {
    c = getchar();
    //... rest of the code remains unchanged ...
}

inline void putint(int d) {
  static char buf[10];
  int c = 0;
  bool neg = false;
  if (d < 0) {
    putchar('-');
    //... rest of the code remains unchanged ...
}

signed main() {
//... rest of the code remains unchanged ...
}
```
