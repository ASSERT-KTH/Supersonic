This program is relatively complex, involving heavy usage of tree structures, template functions, and low-level memory operations. It's already quite efficient, but there are a few potential areas we can look at for optimization:

1. Use Forward Declarations: Forward declarations can reduce compilation time by not including header files unnecessary. If you just need to tell the compiler that a certain class or function exists without having to know all the details, a forward declaration can be used. This is not going to affect the runtime, but it is a good practice to speed up the compilation process.

2. Minimize use of dynamic memory: Dynamic memory allocation is an expensive operation in terms of time complexity. In this code, dynamic memory allocation is used for creating new nodes in the tree. If the number of nodes is known in advance or has an upper limit, consider using a pool of pre-allocated nodes.

3. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The functions `getint()` and `putint()` are called multiple times. If these functions are not inlined by the compiler, each function call introduces some overhead. Consider using `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")` to allow the GCC compiler to make further optimizations, including function inlining.

4. Use bitwise operators when possible: In `getint()` and `putint()`, multiplication and division by 10 can be replaced with bitwise shift operators for performance improvement.

5. Optimize IO operations: In the main function, getchar_unlocked() and putchar_unlocked() are used, which are already faster than the standard versions. But still, you can use fread() and fwrite() for faster bulk input/output operations.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <cassert>
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <random>
#include <set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <valarray>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
struct Tree;
struct Node;
typedef Tree* NP;
...
// Rest of the code remains the same
...
inline int getint() {
  char c;
  int res = 0;
  bool neg = false;
  while (true) {
    c = getchar_unlocked();
    if (c == '-') {
      neg = true;
      break;
    }
    if ('0' <= c && c <= '9') {
      res = (c - '0');
      break;
    }
  }
  while (c = getchar_unlocked(), '0' <= c && c <= '9') {
    res <<= 1; // multiply by 2
    res += (c - '0');
  }
  if (neg)
    res = ~res + 1; // multiply by -1
  return res;
}
inline void putint(int d) {
  static char buf[10];
  int c = 0;
  bool neg = false;
  if (d < 0) {
    putchar_unlocked('-');
    d = ~d + 1; // multiply by -1
  }
  if (!d) {
    putchar_unlocked('0');
    return;
  }
  while (d) {
    buf[c++] = (d & 1); // get remainder of division by 2
    d >>= 1; // divide by 2
  }
  while (c--) {
    putchar_unlocked(buf[c] + '0');
  }
}
...
// Rest of the code remains the same
...
```
Please note that these optimizations may not provide significant improvements in runtime and memory usage as the original code is already quite efficient. The actual impact of these changes may vary depending on the specific inputs and the system where the code is run.
