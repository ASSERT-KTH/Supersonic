The program provided is quite complex and involves a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms, particularly heavy-light decomposition of a graph, segment trees and such. The optimization in this scenario is challenging due to the nature of the problem the code is trying to solve. 

However, there are few minor optimizations that could be noted:

1. Unnecessary includes: The program includes more headers than it seems to use. Only include the headers that are necessary for the program. This can save some memory.

2. Unnecessary using statement: The 'using namespace std' can cause namespace pollution. It's better to use the std:: prefix when needed.

3. Use of 'typedef': The use of 'typedef' is not wrong, but it's more common in C. In C++, it's more idiomatic to use 'using' for aliasing.

4. Use of 'tie' function: The use of 'tie' to unpack the pair can be replaced with structured bindings which are more readable and efficient.

5. Use of 'getchar_unlocked' and 'putchar_unlocked': These functions are not standard C++ and can be replaced by cin and cout respectively which are more standard and portable.

6. Use of 'getint' and 'putint': These functions can be replaced with 'cin' and 'cout'. The performance difference is negligible and it increases readability.

7. Magic numbers: There are numbers in the code like 220100 which are known as magic numbers. It's better to define them as constants with meaningful names.

Here is an optimized version based on the above points:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <cassert>
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <random>
#include <set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <valarray>
#include <vector>

using ll = long long;
using P = std::pair<int, int>;

// Rest of your code

// Replace getchar_unlocked() and putchar_unlocked() with cin and cout
int getint()
{
    int res;
    std::cin >> res;
    return res;
}

void putint(int d)
{
    std::cout << d;
}

// Replace tie() with structured bindings
void path_set(int u, int v, int d)
{
    auto [xl, xp] = n2l[u];
    auto [yl, yp] = n2l[v];
    // Rest of your code
}

// More replacements of tie() with structured bindings in other functions
``` 

Please note that the optimizations are very minor and the actual running time and memory usage are mainly determined by the algorithm and data structures used in the program. For any significant optimization, the algorithm and data structures would need to be reviewed and possibly changed.
