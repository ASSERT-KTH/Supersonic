The given code is complex and utilizes advanced C++ data structures and techniques. It's also optimized in many ways, such as using buffer arrays and `getchar_unlocked()` for faster I/O operations. However, there is a potential optimization by reducing the number of dynamic memory allocations.

In the `Tree` struct, memory is dynamically allocated for its left and right children. This could potentially lead to a high number of memory allocations and deallocations, thus impacting performance. A memory pool can be utilized to improve this, which is a set of preallocated chunks of memory that can be used by the program, avoiding the overhead of frequent memory allocations.

Due to the complexity of the provided code, it's hard to do minor changes without heavily rewriting the program itself. But as a concept, here is how a memory pool can be implemented:

```c++
// Define a memory pool with a fixed size.
#define MAX_POOL_SIZE 200000
Tree pool[MAX_POOL_SIZE];
int poolCnt = 0;

// In the Tree struct, replace 'new Tree(...)' with a function that gets a Tree from the memory pool.
Tree* getTreeFromPool(int sz, int hev[], int hevsm[], int data[]) {
    Tree* tree = &pool[poolCnt++];
    // Initialize tree with the provided parameters...
    return tree;
}

// Replace 'new Tree()' with 'getTreeFromPool()'.
l = getTreeFromPool(md, hev, hevsm, data);
r = getTreeFromPool(sz - md, hev + md, hevsm + md, data + md);
```

This optimization reduces the time spent on dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. However, it comes with its own set of problems. The programmer now has to manage the memory manually, which can lead to more bugs if not handled correctly. 

Also, remember that such low-level optimizations are often unnecessary and can make the code harder to read and maintain. It's generally better to focus on high-level optimizations such as choosing better algorithms or data structures.
