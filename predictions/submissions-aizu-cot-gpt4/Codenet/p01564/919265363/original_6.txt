The program you've provided seems to be implementing a link-cut tree to perform various operations. The optimization of such a complex data structure based program should be handled with care to avoid breaking the logic of the program. 

Here are few steps that can be taken to optimize the given code:

1. Removing Unused Libraries: The program includes several libraries that aren't being used, such as `<algorithm>`, `<array>`, `<climits>`, `<functional>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<stdlib.h>`, `<type_traits>`, `<utility>`, `<map>`, `<math.h>`, and `<time.h>`. Removing these unnecessary inclusions will not improve the run-time performance, but it will decrease the compile-time.

2. Optimizing I/O Operations: The program is using cin and cout for input and output respectively. It can be further optimized by disabling the synchronization of the C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams.

3. Precomputing Constant Values: The program contains nested loops where some computations are being repeated. If these computations yield constant values, they can be precomputed and stored in a variable to save computational time. However, this program does not seem to have such cases.

4. Removing Unused Function: The `scan()` function in the `link_cut_tree` class seems to be unused, as it just returns without doing anything. This function can be removed.

The optimized code incorporating these optimizations is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>
#include <string>
using int32 = std::int_fast32_t;
using int64 = std::int_fast64_t;
using uint32 = std::uint_fast32_t;
using uint64 = std::uint_fast64_t;
using intl32 = std::int_least32_t;
using intl64 = std::int_least64_t;
using uintl32 = std::uint_least32_t;
using uintl64 = std::uint_least64_t;

// Rest of the code remains the same, just remove the unused libraries and scan function

int main(void) {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  uint32 n, q;
  std::cin >> n >> q;
  std::vector<douse> a(n);
  int32 t1;
  for (uint32 i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> t1;
    a[i] = douse(t1, t1, t1, t1, 1);
  }
  link_cut_tree<douse, ass> L(a);
  uint32 t2, t3;
  for (uint32 i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
    std::cin >> t2 >> t3;
    L.link(t2 - 1, t3 - 1);
  }
  uint32 t4;
  for (uint32 i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    std::cin >> t2 >> t3 >> t4 >> t1;
    if (t2 == 1) {
      L.update(t3 - 1, t4 - 1, ass(t1));
    } else {
      std::cout << L.path(t3 - 1, t4 - 1).all << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: Full optimization of the code could require a deeper understanding of the program logic and the data structure used. The above suggestions should help to some extent, but for a significant improvement, one might need to revise the algorithms and data structures used.
