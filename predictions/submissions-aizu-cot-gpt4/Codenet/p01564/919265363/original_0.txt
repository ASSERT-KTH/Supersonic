This is a complex code but there are some small changes that can help to optimize it.

Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: You've included a lot of libraries that you don't actually use in your code. Each include adds to the compilation time and potentially the binary size. For instance, you include `<algorithm>`, `<functional>`, `<map>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<utility>` and `<vector>` but none of them seem to be used in your code. Removing these unnecessary includes will reduce the compilation time and possibly the binary size.
   
2. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment: In your for loops, you're using post-increment (`i++`). This creates a temporary variable that isn't necessary. Using pre-increment (`++i`) instead avoids creating this temporary variable and can be slightly faster.

3. Remove unnecessary function: The `scan` function seems to be a debugging function that only returns without doing anything. Removing it will clean up the code.

4. Pass by const reference instead of by value: In several places, you're passing objects by value. This creates a copy of the object, which can be slow for larger objects. Instead, you should pass these objects by reference, which avoids the copy. Moreover, if you're not modifying the object, you should pass it by const reference.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using int32 = std::int_fast32_t;
using int64 = std::int_fast64_t;
using uint32 = std::uint_fast32_t;
using uint64 = std::uint_fast64_t;
using intl32 = std::int_least32_t;
using intl64 = std::int_least64_t;
using uintl32 = std::uint_least32_t;
using uintl64 = std::uint_least64_t;

// The rest of the code is the same until main function

int main(void) {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  uint32 n, q;
  std::cin >> n >> q;
  std::vector<douse> a(n);
  int32 t1;
  for (uint32 i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> t1;
    a[i] = douse(t1, t1, t1, t1, 1);
  }
  link_cut_tree<douse, ass> L(a);
  uint32 t2, t3;
  for (uint32 i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
    std::cin >> t2 >> t3;
    L.link(t2 - 1, t3 - 1);
  }
  uint32 t4;
  for (uint32 i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    std::cin >> t2 >> t3 >> t4 >> t1;
    if (t2 == 1) {
      L.update(t3 - 1, t4 - 1, ass(t1));
    } else {
      std::cout << L.path(t3 - 1, t4 - 1).all << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note that these are minor optimizations and for complex programs like this, the major part of optimization often comes from improving the algorithms/data structures used, which requires a deep understanding of the program logic.
