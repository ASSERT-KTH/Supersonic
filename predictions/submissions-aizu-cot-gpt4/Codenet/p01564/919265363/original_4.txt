The given code is already quite well optimized, but there are still some areas where it could be improved.

1. **Unnecessary headers:** The code includes several headers that are not used anywhere in the program. We can remove these to make the code cleaner and potentially speed up compilation.

2. **Unused typedefs:** There are several typedefs for integer types that are not used in the code. Removing these can make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

3. **Useless scan function call:** The scan function seems to be used for debugging purposes, but it's currently disabled with the return statement at the beginning. These calls to the scan function can be removed.

4. **Use of magic numbers:** The code contains several instances of "magic numbers" (hard-coded values with no obvious meaning). It's generally better to define these as constants with meaningful names to make the code easier to understand.

5. **Unused variable in main:** There is an unused variable `t1` in the main function. This should be removed to reduce memory usage and make the code cleaner.

6. **Unnecessary use of std::endl:** std::endl not only inserts a newline character, but also flushes the output stream. If you don't need to flush the stream, using "\n" is faster.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using int32 = std::int_fast32_t;
using uint32 = std::uint_fast32_t;

template <typename Monoid, typename Operand> class link_cut_tree {
  // ... keeping the class definition as it is ...
};

struct ass {
  int32 data;
  ass(int32 a = 0) : data(a) {}
  ass operator*(const ass &other) { return other; }
};

struct douse {
  // ... keeping the structure definition as it is ...
};

int main(void) {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  uint32 n, q;
  std::cin >> n >> q;
  std::vector<douse> a(n);
  int32 temp;
  for (uint32 i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> temp;
    a[i] = douse(temp, temp, temp, temp, 1);
  }
  link_cut_tree<douse, ass> L(a);
  uint32 t2, t3, t4;
  for (uint32 i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
    std::cin >> t2 >> t3;
    L.link(t2 - 1, t3 - 1);
  }
  for (uint32 i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    std::cin >> t2 >> t3 >> t4 >> temp;
    if (t2 == 1) {
      L.update(t3 - 1, t4 - 1, ass(temp));
    } else {
      std::cout << L.path(t3 - 1, t4 - 1).all << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program is cleaner and should compile and run slightly faster than the original.
