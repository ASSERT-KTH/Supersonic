This program is quite complex, but there are a few steps we can take to optimize it:

1. Remove Unused Includes: The first noticeable thing is that there are many unused include statements in the code. The unused include statements can slow down the compile time of the program. You should only include the headers that you need. 

2. Minimize usage of std::endl: Using `std::endl` will cause a flush operation, which can slow down your program if you're performing a lot of output operations. Instead, use `"\n"` to insert a newline character. We can replace this in the program's output statements.

3. Reserve vector memory: When you know the size of a vector upfront, it can be beneficial to reserve memory for it in advance using the `reserve()` function. This will prevent the vector from needing to reallocate memory as elements are added, which can improve performance.

4. Using cin/cout efficiently: We can avoid the overhead caused by synchronization of C and C++ standard streams by adding `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` at the beginning of the main function. This can provide a speedup to I/O operations with cin and cout. 

5. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The function `scan` is called multiple times in the program, but it seems like it's not doing anything. If it's not needed, it can be removed to optimize the program.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp

#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <vector>

using int32 = std::int_fast32_t;
using int64 = std::int_fast64_t;
using uint32 = std::uint_fast32_t;
using uint64 = std::uint_fast64_t;

// ... Rest of the code is same ...

int main(void) {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);

  uint32 n, q;
  std::cin >> n >> q;

  std::vector<douse> a(n);
  a.reserve(n);

  int32 t1;
  for (uint32 i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> t1;
    a[i] = douse(t1, t1, t1, t1, 1);
  }

  // ... Rest of the code is same ...

  uint32 t4;
  for (uint32 i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    std::cin >> t2 >> t3 >> t4 >> t1;
    if (t2 == 1) {
      L.update(t3 - 1, t4 - 1, ass(t1));
    } else {
      std::cout << L.path(t3 - 1, t4 - 1).all << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}

```
