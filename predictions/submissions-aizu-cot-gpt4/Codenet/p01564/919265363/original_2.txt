The given code is already quite optimized in terms of memory and performance. However, there are some minor improvements that can be made to further enhance its efficiency. Here are a few of them:

1. **Avoid using namespace std:** Although it is not a performance optimization, it is generally recommended to avoid `using namespace std;` in C++. This can prevent naming conflicts that can occur due to different libraries using the same names for different things.

2. **Optimize I/O operations:** I/O operations are typically time-consuming. To speed up these operations, you can use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(0);`. This code is already present in your program, which is a good thing.

3. **Avoid unnecessary function calls:** The function `scan()` is being called multiple times in your code but its implementation is just a return statement. You should remove these unnecessary function calls to save some execution time.

4. **Reduce usage of dynamic memory:** Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation are costly operations. If you can reduce the usage of `new` and `delete`, it can further optimize your code. 

Let's apply these changes to the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <climits>
#include <cstdint>
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <math.h>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <stack>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string>
#include <time.h>
#include <type_traits>
#include <utility>
#include <vector>
using int32 = std::int_fast32_t;
using int64 = std::int_fast64_t;
using uint32 = std::uint_fast32_t;
using uint64 = std::uint_fast64_t;
using intl32 = std::int_least32_t;
using intl64 = std::int_least64_t;
using uintl32 = std::uint_least32_t;
using uintl64 = std::uint_least64_t;
//... rest of the code remains the same

int main(void) {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  uint32 n, q;
  std::cin >> n >> q;
  std::vector<douse> a(n);
  int32 t1;
  for (uint32 i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> t1;
    a[i] = douse(t1, t1, t1, t1, 1);
  }
  link_cut_tree<douse, ass> L(a);
  uint32 t2, t3;
  for (uint32 i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
    std::cin >> t2 >> t3;
    L.link(t2 - 1, t3 - 1);
  }
  uint32 t4;
  for (uint32 i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    std::cin >> t2 >> t3 >> t4 >> t1;
    if (t2 == 1) {
      L.update(t3 - 1, t4 - 1, ass(t1));
    } else {
      std::cout << L.path(t3 - 1, t4 - 1).all << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, I removed the unnecessary `scan()` function calls.
