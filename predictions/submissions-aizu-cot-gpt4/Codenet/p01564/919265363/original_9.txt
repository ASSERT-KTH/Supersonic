This is quite a complex program, and most of the optimization that can be done here involves improving the efficiency of the link-cut tree data structure used. 

1. **Data Structure Optimization**: The link-cut tree is a type of balanced binary search tree data structure. Optimization of such a complex data structure requires a deep understanding of the specific use case and the principles of data structure design. That said, one possible area for optimization is in the use of splay operations. Splaying is a self-adjusting operation that moves a node to the root of the tree, helping to maintain balance but at a potential cost in performance. By carefully managing when and how often splay operations are performed, it may be possible to reduce unnecessary operations and thus improve performance.

2. **Memory Optimization**: The use of `std::vector` for storing nodes in the tree might not be the most efficient choice for this specific usage. If the size of the tree is known in advance and does not change frequently, it might be more efficient to use a simple array (`std::array`), which could save memory and potentially improve cache performance. However, if the size of the tree can change frequently, then `std::vector` might still be the best choice.

3. **Function Inlining**: There are several small functions (`isroot()`, `reflect()`, `assign()`, `push()`, etc.) that are called frequently. These functions can be inlined to potentially improve performance by avoiding the function call overhead. This can be done by using the `inline` keyword before the function definition.

4. **Unused Code Removal**: There's a method `scan()` that is called multiple times but it's body is just a `return;` statement. This method should be removed if it's not serving any purpose.

5. **IO Operations**: Use `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout` for faster input and output.

The optimized version of the main function would look like this:

```cpp
int main(void) {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  uint32 n, q;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &q);
  std::vector<douse> a(n);
  int32 t1;
  for (uint32 i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &t1);
    a[i] = douse(t1, t1, t1, t1, 1);
  }
  link_cut_tree<douse, ass> L(a);
  uint32 t2, t3;
  for (uint32 i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
    scanf("%d %d", &t2, &t3);
    L.link(t2 - 1, t3 - 1);
  }
  uint32 t4;
  for (uint32 i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    scanf("%d %d %d %d", &t2, &t3, &t4, &t1);
    if (t2 == 1) {
      L.update(t3 - 1, t4 - 1, ass(t1));
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", L.path(t3 - 1, t4 - 1).all);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations depend greatly on the specific characteristics of the data and the usage patterns of the program. Therefore, the effectiveness of these optimizations can vary significantly in different contexts.
