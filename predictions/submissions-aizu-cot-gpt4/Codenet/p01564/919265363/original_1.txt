This program is quite large and it's already been written in a performance-oriented way. However, there are a few minor changes that could be made to slightly optimize its performance.

1. Unnecessary headers: This program includes a large number of headers. Some of these are not used anywhere in the program and can be removed. This will reduce the compilation time of the program.

2. Unnecessary using declarations: The code defines several type aliases that are not used anywhere in the code, such as int32, int64, uint32, etc. These can be removed.

3. Unnecessary function calls: The scan() function is called multiple times in the code but it doesn't do anything (the function body is simply return;). These calls can be removed.

4. Use of std::endl: std::endl not only inserts a newline character, but also flushes the output stream. This can be inefficient if you're writing a lot of data to the stream. It would be better to use '\n' instead.

5. Use of std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false) and std::cin.tie(0): These disable the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams and untie cin and cout. However, in this program, only cin and cout are used, not the C standard streams (stdio.h). Therefore, these lines don't really do anything and could be removed.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

template <typename Monoid, typename Operand> class link_cut_tree {
  // ... (same as before) ...
};

template <typename Monoid, typename Operand>
typename link_cut_tree<Monoid, Operand>::node_t *
    link_cut_tree<Monoid, Operand>::nil = [] {
      nil = new link_cut_tree<Monoid, Operand>::node_t;
      nil->left = nil;
      nil->right = nil;
      nil->per = nullptr;
      nil->sum = Monoid();
      nil->b = 0;
      return nil;
    }();

struct ass {
  int data;
  ass(int a = 0) : data(a) {}
  ass operator*(const ass &other) { return other; }
};

struct douse {
  int all, r, l, sum, siz;
  bool id;
  douse() : id(1) {}
  douse(int a, int lef, int rig, int s, int si)
      : all(a), l(lef), r(rig), sum(s), siz(si), id(0) {}
  douse operator~() {
    douse ret = *this;
    std::swap(ret.l, ret.r);
    return ret;
  }
  douse operator+(const douse &other) {
    if (id)
      return other;
    if (other.id)
      return *this;
    douse ret;
    ret.all = std::max(std::max(all, other.all),
                       std::max(r + other.l, std::max(r, other.l)));
    ret.r = std::max(other.r, r > 0 ? r + other.sum : other.sum);
    ret.l = std::max(l, other.l > 0 ? sum + other.l : sum);
    ret.sum = sum + other.sum;
    ret.siz = siz + other.siz;
    ret.id = 0;
    return ret;
  }
  douse operator*(const ass &other) {
    douse ret;
    ret.all = ret.r = ret.l = other.data > 0 ? other.data * siz : other.data;
    ret.sum = other.data * siz;
    ret.siz = siz;
    ret.id = id;
    return ret;
  }
};

int main(void) {
  uint32_t n, q;
  std::cin >> n >> q;
  std::vector<douse> a(n);
  int t1;
  for (uint32_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> t1;
    a[i] = douse(t1, t1, t1, t1, 1);
  }
  link_cut_tree<douse, ass> L(a);
  uint32_t t2, t3;
  for (uint32_t i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
    std::cin >> t2 >> t3;
    L.link(t2 - 1, t3 - 1);
  }
  uint32_t t4;
  for (uint32_t i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    std::cin >> t2 >> t3 >> t4 >> t1;
    if (t2 == 1) {
      L.update(t3 - 1, t4 - 1, ass(t1));
    } else {
      std::cout << L.path(t3 - 1, t4 - 1).all << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: These optimizations are very minor and might not have a noticeable effect on the program's performance. The original code is already quite efficient.
