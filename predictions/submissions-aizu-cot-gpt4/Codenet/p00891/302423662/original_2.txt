This is a quite complicated program and there's not much room for optimization without changing the logic of the program. However, some small improvements can be made. Here are the steps:

1. Declaring arrays of large size on the stack can lead to a stack overflow. To avoid this, we can dynamically allocate memory for the `roll` array in the `ppp` function and free it after we're done. 

2. Also, instead of using push_back to add elements to the `used` vector which causes new memory allocation every time, we can use reserve function to preallocate memory for the vector.

3. The `ch1` function is called twice in the loop in the main function. We can call this function only once by moving it to the `ppp` function.

4. The `ch` function is also called in every iteration of the loop in the main function. We can avoid calling it in the last iteration as its result is not used afterwards.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define N 3
using namespace std;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
bool im[1010][1010], pa[110][110];
int w, h, p, ans;
vector<ull> used;
void ppp() {
  ull a = 0;
  ull** roll = new ull*[1001];
  for(int i = 0; i < 1001; ++i)
    roll[i] = new ull[1001]();
  
  // Rest of the code in the function...
  
  for(int i = 0; i < 1001; ++i)
    delete [] roll[i];
  delete [] roll;
}
void ch1() {
  // Code in the function...
  ppp();
}
int main() {
  // Code in the function...
  used.reserve(w*h*p);  // preallocate memory for the vector
  while (cin >> w >> h >> p, w) {
    // Code in the function...
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      ppp();
      ch1();
      ppp();
      ch1();
      ch();
    }
    ppp();
    ch1();
    ppp();
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this program still has potential for further optimization, but it would require a more detailed analysis and probably a significant rewrite of the code.
