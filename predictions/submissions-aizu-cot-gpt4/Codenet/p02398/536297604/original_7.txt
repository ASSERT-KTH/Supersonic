The program calculates how many integers between `a` and `b` (inclusive) are divisors of `c` and prints the count. Here are a few steps to optimize the program:

1. Initialize `t`: In the given code, the variable `t` is not initialized before incrementing it inside the loop. This can lead to unexpected results as the initial value of `t` is garbage. So, `t` should be initialized to `0` before the loop.

2. Reduce unnecessary modulus operations: The modulus operation (`c % s == 0`) is a relatively expensive operation. We can reduce the number of modulus operations by skipping the numbers that are definitely not divisors of `c`. If `s` is more than `c`, then `s` cannot be a divisor of `c`. So, in the loop, `s` should run from `a` to `min(b, c)` instead of `b`.

3. Make use of `const` keyword: If we know that the variables `a`, `b`, `c` are not going to change in the program, we should make them `const`. It helps in optimizing the program as the compiler can do better optimizations when it knows that a value won't change.

4. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This can speed up the I/O operations in some cases. It is especially useful when you do a lot of small I/O operations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL); 
  int t = 0;
  int a, b, c;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  const int min_bc = min(b, c);
  for (int s = a; s <= min_bc; s++) {
    if (c % s == 0) {
      t++;
    }
  }
  cout << t << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
