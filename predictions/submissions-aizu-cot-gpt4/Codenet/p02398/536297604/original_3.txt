This program reads three integers from the standard input. Then for each integer 's' in the range from 'a' to 'b' (inclusive), it checks if 'c' is divisible by 's' and increments the counter 't' if it is. Finally, it prints the value of 't'. 

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. The variable `t` is not initialized. We should always initialize variables before using them. This can result in undefined behavior. We should initialize `t` to zero.
2. If `c` is less than `a`, then `c` cannot be divisible by any of the numbers from `a` to `b`. So we can check this condition and skip the loop entirely in this case.
3. If `a` is zero, then the program will crash because it performs a division by zero. We can add a check to prevent this.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b, c, s, t = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  if (c >= a && a > 0) {
    for (s = a; s <= b; s++) {
      if (c % s == 0) {
        t++;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << t << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the program is safe from division by zero and undefined behavior. Also, it may run faster in case `c` is less than `a` because it skips the entire loop in this case.
