This program checks how many divisors of the number 'c' are found in the range from 'a' to 'b' (both included). 

Optimizations:

1. Variable Initialization: The variable 't' is not initialized before being used. This can lead to undefined behavior. Initializing the variable t to zero before using it is both safer and more efficient.

2. Input/Output operations: The 'std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio' function offers a significant speed increase for cin and cout commands. Also, it's a good idea to use '\n' instead of 'endl' to avoid unnecessary flush of the buffer.

3. Using a prefix increment (++t) instead of a postfix increment (t++). In some complex cases, prefix increment can be more efficient than postfix increment.

Let's apply these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int a, b, c, t = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  
  for (int s = a; s <= b; s++) {
    if (c % s == 0) {
      ++t;
    }
  }

  cout << t << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```
Overall, the optimizations used here mainly improve the program's performance and reliability. They're simple yet effective ways to get the most out of the C++ language.
