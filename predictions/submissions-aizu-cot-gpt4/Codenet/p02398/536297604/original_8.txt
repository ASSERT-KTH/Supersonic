The given program counts the number of divisors of the integer 'c' in the range [a, b]. 

There are a few areas where the program can be optimized.

1. Variable Initialization: The variable 't' is not initialized in the program. This can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect outputs because uninitialized variables might hold any value.

2. iostream vs cstdio: The usage of iostream for input/output operations is generally slower compared to cstdio (i.e., scanf and printf). If the execution speed is crucial, using cstdio can be a better choice.

3. The operator % (modulus) is computationally expensive. We can't avoid it in this case, but it's good to keep it in mind.

Let's implement these optimizations:

```
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int a, b, c, s;
  int t = 0;
  scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
  for (s = a; s <= b; s++) {
    if (c % s == 0) {
      t++;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", t);
  return 0;
}
```

With these changes, the program will run faster and will not have the risk of undefined behavior due to uninitialized variables.
