Firstly, the variable `t` is used without initialization. Although this does not affect the performance of the program, it could potentially lead to undefined behavior. 

Secondly, the for loop that checks if `c` is divisible by `s` could be optimized. The division operation is costly in terms of CPU time, so we want to minimize the number of division operations. 

In the original code, you start to check from `s=a` to `s=b` whether `c` is divisible by `s`. If `c` is a large number and `a` is a small number, it will take a lot of time to check all divisors.

Instead, if we start from `s = c/b`, which is the maximum possible divisor of `c` within the range `[a,b]`, and decrease `s` till `a`, we can break the loop as soon as `s < a`. This way we can potentially skip a large number of division operations.

Now, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b, c, s, t = 0; // Initialize 't' to 0
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  for (s = min(c/b, b); s >= a; s--) { // Start from the maximum possible divisor
    if (c % s == 0) {
      t++;
    }
  }
  cout << t << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Note that `min(c/b, b)` is used instead of `c/b` as `s`'s initial value to ensure `s` does not exceed `b`. If `c/b` is larger than `b`, it means `b` is the largest possible divisor. This does not affect performance but it prevents `s` from starting with a value larger than `b`.
