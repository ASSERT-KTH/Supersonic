Firstly, we initialize the variable 't' to 0. In the given code, 't' is used without being initialized which could lead to unpredictable results or a crash.

Secondly, if 'c' is 0, then the condition (c % s == 0) will always be true for all 's' from 'a' to 'b' (unless 'a' is 0, in which case the program will crash). So, we should handle this situation separately.

Thirdly, if 'c' is not 0, we could skip some values of 's' which are obviously not divisors of 'c' to make the program run faster. We start 's' from the max value of 'a' and 'c / b' (because any number larger than 'c / b' obviously cannot be a divisor of 'c'). And we stop 's' at the min value of 'b' and 'c' (because any number larger than 'c' obviously cannot be a divisor of 'c').

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b, c, s, t = 0; // initialize 't' to 0
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  if (c == 0) { // if 'c' is 0
    if (a <= 0) { // if 'a' is 0, output 'b - a + 1' directly and return
      cout << b - a + 1 << endl;
      return 0;
    } else { // if 'a' is not 0, output 'b - a' directly and return
      cout << b - a << endl;
      return 0;
    }
  }
  // if 'c' is not 0, start from the max value of 'a' and 'c / b', stop at the min value of 'b' and 'c'
  for (s = max(a, c / b); s <= min(b, c); s++) {
    if (c % s == 0) {
      t++;
    }
  }
  cout << t << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
