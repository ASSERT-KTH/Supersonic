Step 1: Initialize the variable 't' to zero. This is because using uninitialized variables can cause undefined behavior.

Step 2: To optimize the program further, the division operation inside the loop can be minimized. The division operation is computationally expensive, so it's best to do it as little as possible. To do this, we can check if 'c' is less than 'a'. If it is, then we can't have 'c' be divisible by any numbers in the range from 'a' to 'b'. Therefore, we can skip the loop entirely and print '0'.

Step 3: If 'c' is not less than 'a', then we can start the loop from 'a', or from 'c' if 'c' is within the range from 'a' to 'b'. This will prevent unnecessary iterations of the loop, which improves the efficiency of the program.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b, c, s, t=0; // Initialize 't' to 0
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  if (c < a) { // If 'c' is less than 'a', print '0' and return
    cout << 0 << endl;
    return 0;
  }
  // Otherwise, start the loop from 'a', or from 'c' if 'c' is within the range from 'a' to 'b'
  for (s = max(a, c); s <= b; s++) {
    if (c % s == 0) {
      t++;
    }
  }
  cout << t << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
It should be noted that the above optimization is only applicable in cases where 'c' is less than 'a'. In other cases, the optimization doesn't affect the program's efficiency.
