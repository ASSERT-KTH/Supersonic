The given C/C++ program reads three integers a, b, and c from the input, then count the number of integers from a to b (inclusive) that are divisors of c. 

There are a few ways to optimize this program:

1. Initialize the integer `t` to 0. In the original program, `t` is not initialized, which means it could contain any value (usually a random one). Thus, the count could be incorrect.

2. The `std::endl` not only inserts a new line, but it also flushes the stream. This can be an expensive operation in terms of performance. If we just need a newline, we can replace it with `'\n'`.

3. The loop is iterating from `a` to `b`, and for each iteration, it checks whether `c` is divisible by the current iteration value `s`. This could be optimized because for any number `c`, the potential divisors cannot be larger than `c / 2`. So the upper limit of the loop can be `min(b, c / 2)` instead of `b`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b, c, t = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  for (int s = a; s <= min(b, c / 2); s++) {
    if (c % s == 0) {
      t++;
    }
  }
  cout << t << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program will have the same functionality as the original one, but it will run faster and use less memory.
