This program is counting the number of divisors of `c` in the range `[a, b]`. The optimizations that can be done here are:

1. Initialize `t` to 0: In the given program `t` is not initialized. It might contain garbage value initially, so results can be unreliable. So, it is better to initialize `t` to 0.

2. Avoid unnecessary mod operations: If `c` is 0, then all `s` in the range `[a, b]` (assuming `a` > 0) are divisors, so we can directly assign `t` the value `b - a + 1`. If `c` is not 0, then we continue as usual.

3. Reduce the range of the loop: If `c` is not 0, and `c` is less than `b`, then there will be no divisors greater than `c`, so we can reduce the upper limit of the loop to `min(b, c)`.

Let's incorporate these changes into the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm> // for std::min
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b, c, s, t = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  if (c == 0) {
    t = b - a + 1;
  } else {
    for (s = a; s <= min(b, c); s++) {
      if (c % s == 0) {
        t++;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << t << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations are assuming that `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative and `a` <= `b`. If the input can have other values, further checks might be needed.
