The given C++ program reads three integers from the input, then it increments a counter `t` for each integer `s` between `a` and `b` (inclusive) that is a divisor of `c`. The counter `t` is then output. 

1. First, we can see that the variable `t` is not initialized. This is a serious issue because using an uninitialized variable leads to undefined behavior. We should initialize `t` to 0.

2. Secondly, the code could potentially be improved for running time. Currently, the code checks if `c` is divisible by every integer between `a` and `b`, inclusive. This can be very slow if `b-a` is large. However, if `c` is less than `a`, we know that `c` cannot have any divisors in the range `[a, b]`, so we could skip the loop entirely in this case. Similarly, if `c` is less than `b`, we only need to check divisors up to `c`, not up to `b`.

3. Lastly, to reduce memory usage we can remove the unnecessary variable `s` and use the loop variable directly.

After applying these optimizations, we get the following code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b, c, t = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  if(c >= a) {
    for (int s = a; s <= min(b, c); s++) {
      if (c % s == 0) {
        t++;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << t << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized program, we initialize `t` to 0 to avoid undefined behavior. We also add a conditional to skip the loop if `c < a`, and we use `min(b, c)` as the upper limit of the loop to avoid unnecessary iterations if `c < b`. We removed the variable `s` and used the loop variable directly. This program should have the same output as the original for all valid inputs, but with improved running time and slightly reduced memory usage.
