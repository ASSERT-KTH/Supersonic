1. Optimize `printf` and `scanf`: `printf` and `scanf` are slower than `cin` and `cout` in C++. To optimize this, we can use `ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);` at the beginning of the main function. This will make the input/output faster.

2. Optimize the use of `std::priority_queue`: When we use `q.top()` then `q.pop()`, it's slower than `auto top = q.top(); q.pop();`. Because `q.top()` and `q.pop()` are two separate operations, each with its own overhead. We can combine these two into a single operation by first storing the top of the queue in a variable then popping it.

3. Use `std::vector` instead of C-style array: We can optimize the use of C-style array `d[v]` by using `std::vector<int> d(v, INF);`. This will initialize the vector with `v` elements, each with the value of `INF`. This is not only more readable but also safer than C-style arrays.

After making these optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 1000000000;
struct edge {
  int to, cost;
};
vector<edge> G[100000];
int v, e, r;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
priority_queue<P, vector<P>, greater<P>> q;
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);
  cin >> v >> e >> r;
  for (int i = 0; i < e; i++) {
    int s, t, d;
    cin >> s >> t >> d;
    edge tmp;
    tmp.to = t;
    tmp.cost = d;
    G[s].push_back(tmp);
  }
  vector<int> d(v, INF);
  d[r] = 0;
  q.push(P(0, r));
  while (!q.empty()) {
    auto p = q.top(); q.pop();
    int nv = p.second;
    if (p.first > d[nv])
      continue;
    for (int i = 0; i < G[nv].size(); i++) {
      if (d[nv] + G[nv][i].cost < d[G[nv][i].to]) {
        d[G[nv][i].to] = d[nv] + G[nv][i].cost;
        q.push(P(d[G[nv][i].to], G[nv][i].to));
      }
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < v; i++) {
    if (d[i] == INF)
      cout << "INF\n";
    else
      cout << d[i] << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note that this is still a minor optimization. The main performance cost of your program lies in its algorithmic complexity, which appears to be O(E log E) due to the use of a priority queue in a graph with E edges. If performance is still an issue after applying the above optimizations, you may need to consider a more efficient algorithm.
