This program is trying to find the maximum size of three elements in a given array such that the sum of any two is greater than the third one. The optimization can be achieved in two steps:

1. Remove the repetition of array elements: The original program doubles the size of the input array `A` by repeating the elements. This is unnecessary and increases the memory usage. We can achieve a similar effect by using a modular operator `%` when accessing elements in the array.

2. Use binary search algorithm to optimize the search process: The binary search algorithm can significantly reduce the time complexity of the search process from O(n) to O(log(n)).

Here's the optimized code with above optimizations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
const int64 INF = 1LL << 58;
int N, A[200000];
int64 sum[200000];
bool Find(const int &pos, const int64 &size) {
  int hoge = distance(
      sum, lower_bound(sum + pos + 1, sum + N, sum[pos%N] + size));
  if (hoge == N)
    return false;
  int fuga = distance(
      sum, lower_bound(sum + hoge + 1, sum + N, sum[hoge%N] + size));
  if (fuga == N)
    return false;
  int foo = distance(
      sum, lower_bound(sum + fuga + 1, sum + N, sum[fuga%N] + size));
  return (foo != N);
}
bool calc(int64 size) {
  for (int pos = 0; pos < N; pos++) {
    if (Find(pos, size))
      return true;
  }
  return false;
}
int main() {
  scanf("%d", &N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    scanf("%d", A + i);
  }
  sum[0] = A[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + A[i];
  }
  int64 low = 0, high = INF;
  while (high != low) {
    int64 mid = (low + high + 1) >> 1;
    if (calc(mid))
      low = mid;
    else
      high = mid - 1;
  }
  printf("%lld\n", low);
}
```

Please note that the `bits/stdc++.h` header is not a standard C++ header and it can lead to slower compilation time. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers in your program.
