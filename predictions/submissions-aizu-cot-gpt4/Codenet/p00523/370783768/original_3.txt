This C++ program is already quite optimized, but we can still make some improvements to it.

1. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with specific headers. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is not standard C++, and it includes a lot of unnecessary headers that can slow down compilation time.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`. This can cause name collisions, which can lead to bugs. It's better to use `std::` before standard library components.

3. The `Find` function can be simplified. Instead of calling `distance` three times, you could call `lower_bound` three times and compare the results directly. This will improve the readability of the code and may also improve performance, as `distance` can be an expensive operation.

4. The `Find` function uses `sum + pos + 1` and `sum + N + pos + 1` multiple times. We can store these values in variables to avoid calculating them repeatedly.

5. The `calc` function is called in a binary search loop. Therefore, it might be helpful to add an early return in the `calc` function to stop the loop as soon as a `true` value is found.

6. The `scanf` and `printf` functions can be replaced with `std::cin` and `std::cout`, which are more idiomatic in C++.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

typedef long long int64;
const int64 INF = 1LL << 58;
int N, A[200000];
int64 sum[200000];

bool Find(const int &pos, const int64 &size) {
  auto begin = sum + pos + 1;
  auto end = sum + N + pos + 1;
  
  auto hoge = std::lower_bound(begin, end, sum[pos] + size);
  if (hoge == end)
    return false;
  
  auto fuga = std::lower_bound(hoge + 1, end, *hoge + size);
  if (fuga == end)
    return false;
    
  return std::lower_bound(fuga + 1, end, *fuga + size) != end;
}

bool calc(int64 size) {
  for (int pos = 0; pos < N; pos++) {
    if (Find(pos, size))
      return true;
  }
  return false;
}

int main() {
  std::cin >> N;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    std::cin >> A[i];
    A[N + i] = A[i];
  }
  sum[0] = A[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < 2 * N; i++) {
    sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + A[i];
  }
  int64 low = 0, high = INF;
  while (high != low) {
    int64 mid = (low + high + 1) >> 1;
    if (calc(mid))
      low = mid;
    else
      high = mid - 1;
  }
  std::cout << low << '\n';
}
```
This optimized version should have the same functionality as the original, but with potentially improved performance and readability.
