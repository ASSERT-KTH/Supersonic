This program seems to be a segment-based search over an array, where it checks for certain values in the summed array to be within a specific interval. Here are a few ways we can optimize it:

1. Avoiding Repeated Lower Bound Searches: Currently, the program repeatedly performs lower bound searches within the same segment, which could be avoided through keeping track of the last position.

2. Reducing Redundant Array Duplication: The program currently duplicates the original array and computes sum array based on it. Instead, we can avoid this duplication and directly calculate the sum array.

3. Replacing `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`: This is more of a C++ oriented optimization. `cin` and `cout` are considered to be safer and more efficient than `scanf` and `printf`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
const int64 INF = 1LL << 58;
int N;
int64 A[200000];
int64 sum[400000];
bool calc(int64 size) {
  for (int pos = 0; pos < N; pos++) {
    int64 target = sum[pos] + size;
    auto it = lower_bound(sum + pos + 1, sum + 2 * N, target);
    if (it == sum + 2 * N) continue;
    target = *it + size;
    it = lower_bound(it + 1, sum + 2 * N, target);
    if (it == sum + 2 * N) continue;
    target = *it + size;
    it = lower_bound(it + 1, sum + 2 * N, target);
    if (it != sum + 2 * N) return true;
  }
  return false;
}
int main() {
  cin >> N;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
    sum[i + N] = sum[i] = (i == 0 ? 0 : sum[i - 1]) + A[i];
  }
  for (int i = N; i < 2 * N; i++) {
    sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + A[i - N];
  }
  int64 low = 0, high = INF;
  while (high != low) {
    int64 mid = (low + high + 1) >> 1;
    if (calc(mid))
      low = mid;
    else
      high = mid - 1;
  }
  cout << low << "\n";
}
```

Please note that the code uses `lower_bound` to find the position of the next segment. `lower_bound` is more efficient than manually searching the array because it can find the position in log(n) time complexity.
