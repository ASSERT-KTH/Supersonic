The code is already quite optimized. However, there are few small modifications that can be made to further improve the performance:

1. Replace C-style IO with C++-style IO: The C-style IO functions (scanf and printf) are slightly slower than their C++ counterparts (cin and cout). Although the difference is not significant, it can add up in programs that perform a lot of IO operations.

2. Replace 'typedef' with 'using': In C++, 'using' is the more modern and recommended way to make an alias for a data type. It is easier to read and understand, especially for complex types.

3. Avoid multiple calls to distance and lower_bound: The Find function calls std::distance and std::lower_bound three times each. We can reduce this by storing the result of the first call to lower_bound in a variable and then using this variable in the subsequent calls.

4. Avoid using 'const' for 'INF': Although it is a good practice to use 'const' for variables that should not be modified, in this case, it may prevent some compiler optimizations. We can replace 'const' with 'constexpr', which tells the compiler that the value of 'INF' can be computed at compile time.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using int64 = long long;
constexpr int64 INF = 1LL << 58;
int N, A[200000];
int64 sum[200000];
bool Find(const int &pos, const int64 &size) {
  auto first_bound = lower_bound(sum + pos + 1, sum + N + pos + 1, sum[pos] + size);
  if (first_bound == sum + N + pos + 1)
    return false;
  auto second_bound = lower_bound(first_bound + 1, sum + N + pos + 1, *first_bound + size);
  if (second_bound == sum + N + pos + 1)
    return false;
  auto third_bound = lower_bound(second_bound + 1, sum + N + pos + 1, *second_bound + size);
  return (third_bound != sum + N + pos + 1);
}
bool calc(int64 size) {
  for (int pos = 0; pos < N; pos++) {
    if (Find(pos, size))
      return true;
  }
  return false;
}
int main() {
  cin >> N;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
    A[N + i] = A[i];
  }
  sum[0] = A[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < 2 * N; i++) {
    sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + A[i];
  }
  int64 low = 0, high = INF;
  while (high != low) {
    int64 mid = (low + high + 1) >> 1;
    if (calc(mid))
      low = mid;
    else
      high = mid - 1;
  }
  cout << low << '\n';
}
```
