This program seems to be a part of a binary search application with some array manipulations. The optimizations we can make are:

1. We can optimize the `Find` function. Instead of doing three binary searches, we can do it in single pass. Use two pointers, start from the beginning, move the right pointer until the sum becomes larger than `size`, then move the left pointer until the sum becomes smaller than `size`. This way, we are doing a single pass over the array instead of three binary searches.

2. We are duplicating the array `A` which is unnecessary. Instead, we can just wrap around the array, by taking the modulo of the index with `N`.

3. Instead of using `scanf` and `printf`, use `cin` and `cout`. This is more a C++ style and it's generally safer and easier to use.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
const int64 INF = 1LL << 58;

vector<int> A;
vector<int64> sum;

bool Find(int64 size, int N) {
  int l = 0, r = 0;
  int64 current_sum = 0;
  while (l < N) {
    while (r < N * 2 && current_sum < size) {
      current_sum += A[r % N];
      r++;
    }
    if (current_sum == size) return true;
    current_sum -= A[l];
    l++;
  }
  return false;
}

int main() {
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  A.resize(N);
  sum.resize(N * 2);

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  sum[0] = A[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < 2 * N; i++) {
    sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + A[i % N];
  }
  int64 low = 0, high = INF;
  while (high != low) {
    int64 mid = (low + high + 1) >> 1;
    if (Find(mid, N))
      low = mid;
    else
      high = mid - 1;
  }
  cout << low << endl;
}
```

In this program, the `Find` function's time complexity is reduced from O(n log n) to O(n). Also, by using modulo operator to wrap around the array, the memory usage is reduced almost by half as we no longer duplicate array `A`.
