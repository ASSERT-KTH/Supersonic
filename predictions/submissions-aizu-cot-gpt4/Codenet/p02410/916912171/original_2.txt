The current program has several areas that can be optimized:

1. Initialization of inact, act, and ans arrays: The current program initializes arrays for a maximum size of 100 regardless of the actual size needed. This can be optimized by initializing only the required size.

2. Unnecessary multiplication: The code currently does a multiplication operation for each element in the inact[][] and act[] arrays. This can sometimes be optimized by precomputing results if the same multiplication is done multiple times.

However, in this specific example, there's no clear way to optimize the multiplication as each multiplication is unique, i.e., inact[i][j] * act[j] is not repeated with the same i and j. 

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```C++
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int row, col;
  scanf("%d %d", &row, &col);
  int inact[row][col];
  int act[col];
  int ans[row] = {0};
  
  for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      scanf("%d", &inact[i][j]);
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < col; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &act[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      ans[i] += inact[i][j] * act[j];
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", ans[i]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized version, the memory usage is improved by initializing arrays based on the actual row and col sizes. Also, the initialization of the ans array to zero is done in one line using an initializer list. The time complexity is not significantly improved here as the major operations are the same. However, the code is more concise and uses less memory for small input sizes. 

Note: The optimized program uses variable length arrays, which are not part of the C++ standard, but are supported as a compiler extension in some compilers, such as GCC. If variable length arrays are not supported, you may need to dynamically allocate memory for the arrays based on the row and col sizes.
