The given program seems to be doing matrix-vector multiplication. Here are some optimizations we can do:

1. Initialization: The program is initializing all the elements of the matrix `inact`, vector `act` and `ans` to 0. However, the elements of `inact` and `act` are overwritten by the input and the elements of `ans` are overwritten in the multiplication loop. Therefore, this initialization is unnecessary and removing it will save some running time.

2. Memory: The memory size is fixed to 100x100 for `inact` and 100 for `act` and `ans` regardless of the actual `row` and `col` values. This could potentially waste a lot of memory if the matrix is small. We can use dynamic memory allocation to allocate exact memory required based on `row` and `col` values.

Here is the optimized version:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int row, col;
  scanf("%d %d", &row, &col);

  int** inact = (int**)malloc(row * sizeof(int*));
  int* act = (int*)malloc(col * sizeof(int));
  int* ans = (int*)calloc(row, sizeof(int)); // calloc initializes to 0

  for (int i = 0; i < row; ++i) {
    inact[i] = (int*)malloc(col * sizeof(int));
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < row; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < col; ++j) {
      scanf("%d", &inact[i][j]);
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < col; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &act[i]);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < row; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < col; ++j) {
      ans[i] += inact[i][j] * act[j];
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < row; ++i) {
    printf("%d\n", ans[i]);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < row; ++i) {
    free(inact[i]);
  }
  free(inact);
  free(act);
  free(ans);

  return 0;
}
```

Remember to free the allocated memory at the end of the program to avoid memory leaks.
