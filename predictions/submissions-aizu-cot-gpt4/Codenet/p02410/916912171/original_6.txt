The original program initializes all elements of an array `inact` of 100x100, and arrays `act` and `ans` of size 100 to 0 using two nested loops. Later, it takes input for `row` and `col`, and based on these inputs, it fills the necessary elements of arrays `inact` and `act`. 

The first optimization can be done by initializing only necessary elements in these arrays. Rather than initializing all 100x100 elements of `inact` and 100 elements of `act` and `ans`, we can initialize only those elements which we are going to use, i.e., `row`x`col` elements in `inact` and `row` elements in `act` and `ans`. However, since we don't know the values of `row` and `col` before runtime, we would need to initialize these arrays after taking `row` and `col` as input. 

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int inact[100][100];
  int act[100];
  int ans[100];
  int row, col;
  int i, j;

  scanf("%d %d", &row, &col);
  
  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      inact[i][j] = 0;
    }
    ans[i] = 0;
  }
  
  for (i = 0; i < col; i++) {
    act[i] = 0;
  }

  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      scanf("%d", &inact[i][j]);
    }
  }
  for (i = 0; i < col; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &act[i]);
  }
  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      ans[i] += inact[i][j] * act[j];
    }
  }
  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", ans[i]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In the above optimized program, we first take the input for `row` and `col`, and then initialize the necessary elements of `inact`, `act`, and `ans` arrays. This way, we are only initializing the elements that we need to use and avoid unnecessary initialization of all elements, reducing the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).
