This program reads in two arrays, `a` and `b`, of dimensions `n x m` and `m` respectively. It then computes the dot product of each row in `a` with `b` and prints the result.

Step-by-step optimization:

1. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables `x` and `y` are not necessary and can be removed. They are used only to read from `cin` and then immediately stored into `a` and `b`. Instead, we can read directly into `a` and `b`.

2. Initialize array `b` earlier: Since array `b` does not depend on the values of array `a`, we can initialize it earlier. By doing this, we are reducing the total number of loops from 3 to 2, which will reduce the running time of the program.

3. Use prefix increment: Instead of using postfix increment (i++ or j++), use prefix increment (++i or ++j) as they are generally faster in C++ due to not needing to store a temporary variable.

4. Utilize `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This unties `cin` from `cout`, which may speed up I/O operations. This should only be used if we don't need to mix C-style and C++-style I/O in the program.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n, m;
  int a[100][100], b[100];
  int c = 0;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  
  for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
    std::cin >> b[j];
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
      std::cin >> a[i][j];
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    c = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
      c += a[i][j] * b[j];
    }
    std::cout << c << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` line can actually slow down I/O operations in some cases, so it's always a good idea to do some benchmarking with and without it.
