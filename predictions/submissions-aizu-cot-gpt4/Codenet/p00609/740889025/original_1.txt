This program has several opportunities for optimization. Here are the steps for optimizing this program:

1. Reduce unnecessary calls to vector clear() method: The vectors in the array v[] are being cleared at the beginning of every loop, regardless of whether they are used or not. This can consume unnecessary resources. Instead, we can keep track of the indices used and clear only those vectors.

2. Avoid unnecessary calls to vector sort() method: Similar to the first optimization, the vectors are being sorted regardless of whether they are used or not. We can sort a vector only when we have completed pushing elements into it.

3. Use faster I/O methods: cin and cout are slower compared to scanf and printf. Also, we can use ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL) at the beginning of the main function to make input and output faster.

4. Avoid unnecessary computations: The value of sqrt((D - p) * (D + p)) is computed for every iteration of the for loop. Since the result of this computation depends only on the value of p, we can compute these values once and store them in an array for quicker access.

5. Use a more efficient data structure: Instead of using vector to store the values, we can use a set which maintains the elements in a sorted order. This way, we do not need to sort the elements each time.

Here's the optimized version of the code incorporating all these steps:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
set<int> v[10000];
vector<int> usedIndices;
int preComputed[4*10000+1];
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int aN, bN, R;
  while (scanf("%d%d%d", &aN, &bN, &R), aN) {
    for (int i : usedIndices)
      v[i].clear();
    usedIndices.clear();
    for (int i = 0; i < aN; i++) {
      int x, y;
      scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);
      v[y].insert(x);
      usedIndices.push_back(y);
    }
    int D = 4 * R;
    for(int p=-D;p<=D;p++)
      preComputed[p+D] = sqrt((D - p) * (D + p));
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < bN; i++) {
      int x, y;
      scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);
      for (int p = -D; p <= D; p++) {
        if (y + p < 0 || y + p >= 10000)
          continue;
        int m = preComputed[p+D];
        ans += upper_bound(v[y + p].begin(), v[y + p].end(), x + m) -
               lower_bound(v[y + p].begin(), v[y + p].end(), x - m);
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
  }
}
```
Note that this optimization assumes that the order of input pairs does not matter. If the order does matter, we would need to use a data structure that maintains order, like multiset.
