Here are the steps I would take to optimize the given program:

1. Use fast I/O:

   The `cin` and `cout` objects in C++ are much slower compared to the `scanf` and `printf` functions in C. You can use `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout` for faster I/O.

2. Avoid unnecessary operations:

   The calculation of `D` is performed in each iteration of the outer loop. But since `R` doesn't change within the loop, you can calculate `D` only once before the loop.

3. Avoid unnecessary memory clear:

   You are clearing all 10000 vectors in each iteration of the outer loop, regardless of whether they were used in the previous iteration or not. Instead, you can keep track of the used vectors and only clear them.

4. Avoid unnecessary sort:

   You are sorting all 10000 vectors in each iteration of the outer loop, regardless of whether they were used in the previous iteration or not. Instead, you can keep track of the used vectors and only sort them.

Here is the optimized program:

```C++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
vector<int> v[10000];
bool used[10000] = {false};
int main() {
  int aN, bN, R;
  while (scanf("%d%d%d", &aN, &bN, &R) != EOF, aN) {
    int usedCount = 0;
    int usedIndices[10000];
    for (int i = 0; i < aN; i++) {
      int x, y;
      scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);
      if (!used[y]) {
        used[y] = true;
        usedIndices[usedCount++] = y;
      }
      v[y].push_back(x);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < usedCount; i++)
      sort(v[usedIndices[i]].begin(), v[usedIndices[i]].end());
    int D = 4 * R, ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < bN; i++) {
      int x, y;
      scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);
      for (int p = -D; p <= D; p++) {
        if (y + p < 0 || y + p >= 10000)
          continue;
        int m = sqrt((D - p) * (D + p));
        ans += upper_bound(v[y + p].begin(), v[y + p].end(), x + m) -
               lower_bound(v[y + p].begin(), v[y + p].end(), x - m);
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
    for (int i = 0; i < usedCount; i++) {
      v[usedIndices[i]].clear();
      used[usedIndices[i]] = false;
    }
  }
}
```

In the optimized program, I have replaced `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for faster I/O. I have also moved the calculation of `D` outside of the loop. I have added a `used` array to keep track of the used vectors. The vectors are only cleared and sorted if they were used in the previous iteration. This prevents unnecessary memory clear and sort operations.
