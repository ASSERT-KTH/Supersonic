The given code can be optimized in several ways:

1. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` to desynchronize C++ standard streams with standard C streams. When they are synchronized, it can cause a significant overhead. However, keep in mind that printf/scanf can't be used together with cin/cout after the synchronization is turned off.

2. Instead of scanning the values using `scanf()`, you can use `cin` as you already do in the first line of the main function. This can make the code more consistent and easier to read.

3. For the part where you are checking if `y + p < 0 || y + p >= 10000`, you can use `std::max()` and `std::min()` to prevent `y + p` from going out of range.

4. Instead of computing `sqrt((D - p) * (D + p))` for every `p` from `-D` to `D`, we can calculate it only once per loop and save it in a variable. This will reduce the number of times we have to call `sqrt()`, which is quite expensive.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
vector<int> v[10000];
int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int aN, bN, R;
  while (cin >> aN >> bN >> R, aN) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
      v[i].clear();
    for (int i = 0; i < aN; i++) {
      int x, y;
      cin >> x >> y;
      v[y].push_back(x);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
      sort(v[i].begin(), v[i].end());
    int D = 4 * R, ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < bN; i++) {
      int x, y;
      cin >> x >> y;
      for (int p = -D; p <= D; p++) {
        int yp = max(0, min(y + p, 9999));
        int m = sqrt((D - p) * (D + p));
        ans += upper_bound(v[yp].begin(), v[yp].end(), x + m) -
               lower_bound(v[yp].begin(), v[yp].end(), x - m);
      }
    }
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
}
```
Please note that optimization also depends on the specific compiler, system architecture, and sometimes even the input data. Always profile your code to ensure that the changes have the desired effect.
