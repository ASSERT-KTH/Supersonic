The given program is a C++ program that uses Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph. Here are the steps to optimize this program:

1. Remove unnecessary calculations: In the inner loop where the distance between two points is calculated, there is a repeated calculation of "(v[i][k] - v[j][k]) * (v[i][k] - v[j][k])". This can be replaced with a local variable.

2. Use reserve for vectors: The vector, v, is resized each time an element is pushed back. It would be more efficient to reserve the maximum necessary space in the vector beforehand.

3. Optimize the unite function: The unite function is called in two places: one inside the loop and one outside the loop. The one inside the loop can be avoided if we check the condition 'x<=0' before calling the unite function.

4. Avoid using sqrt function: 'sqrt' function is quite expensive in terms of time complexity. As we are only comparing the distances, we can compare the square of the distances to avoid using 'sqrt'.

5. Use 'printf' and 'scanf' instead of 'cout' and 'cin': 'printf' and 'scanf' are faster than 'cout' and 'cin' in C++.

Given these steps, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define M 9999
int parent[M], a[M], b[M];
pair<double, int> node[M];
int root(int a) { return parent[a] == a ? a : parent[a] = root(parent[a]); }
int unite(int a, int b) {
  int x = root(a), y = root(b);
  if (x == y)
    return 0;
  parent[x] = y;
  return 1;
}
int main() {
  int i, j, k, m, n;
  double x, y, z, r, dist;
  for (; scanf("%d", &n), n;) {
    vector<vector<double>> v;
    v.reserve(n);
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf", &x, &y, &z, &r), v.push_back({x, y, z, r});
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
      parent[i] = i;
    for (m = i = 0; i < n; i++)
      for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
        for (x = dist = k = 0; k < 3; k++)
          dist = (v[i][k] - v[j][k]) * (v[i][k] - v[j][k]), x += dist;
        x = x - (v[i][3] + v[j][3]) * (v[i][3] + v[j][3]);
        if (x <= 0)
          unite(i, j);
        else
          a[m] = i, b[m] = j, node[m].first = x, node[m++].second = m;
      }
    sort(node, node + m);
    for (x = i = 0; i < m; i++)
      if (unite(a[node[i].second], b[node[i].second]))
        x += sqrt(node[i].first);
    printf("%.3f\n", x);
  }
}
```
Please note that the original program seems to be already highly optimized, and these changes may only bring marginal improvements. In many cases, the performance highly depends on the underlying hardware, the compiler and its options.
