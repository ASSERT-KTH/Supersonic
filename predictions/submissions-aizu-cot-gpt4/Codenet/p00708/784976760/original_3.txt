The given code can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Reduce the number of iterations: The calculation of distance between points is done in a nested loop, which results in a high time complexity. The calculation can be done in a single loop.

2. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code calculates the square root of the distance between points, but then compares this value with 0. This comparison can be done without the square root calculation, which is computationally expensive.

3. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The code creates a 2D vector to store the input values, but these values are only used once. The input values can be stored in simple variables, thus avoiding the creation of the 2D vector.

4. Preallocate memory for vectors: The code uses the push_back function to add elements to the vector, which can cause multiple reallocations. If the size of the vector is known in advance, the memory can be preallocated, which can improve performance.

5. Use fast input/output methods: The scanf and printf functions are slower than cin and cout. Using cin and cout with ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL) can improve the input/output speed.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
#define M 9999
int parent[M], a[M], b[M];
pair<double, int> node[M];
int root(int a) { return parent[a] == a ? a : parent[a] = root(parent[a]); }
int unite(int a, int b) {
  int x = root(a), y = root(b);
  if (x == y)
    return 0;
  parent[x] = y;
  return 1;
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int i, j, m, n;
  double x, y, z, r;
  for (; cin >> n, n;) {
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
      parent[i] = i;
    for (m = i = 0; i < n; i++)
      for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
        cin >> x >> y >> z >> r;
        double d = (x - y) * (x - y) + (z - r) * (z - r);
        if (d <= 0)
          unite(i, j);
        else
          a[m] = i, b[m] = j, node[m].first = d, node[m++].second = m;
      }
    sort(node, node + m);
    for (x = i = 0; i < m; i++)
      if (unite(a[node[i].second], b[node[i].second]))
        x += node[i].first;
    cout << x << "\n";
  }
}
```
Note: The changes made are assuming the correctness of the original code and the given input format. The optimized code may not work correctly if the input format or the logic of the original code is different.
