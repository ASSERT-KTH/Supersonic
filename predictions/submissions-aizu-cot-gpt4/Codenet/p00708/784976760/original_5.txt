This program uses a union-find data structure to solve the problem, but it also has a secondary array storing the distances between nodes. This program could be optimized by reducing the number of computations performed in the innermost loop and by removing unnecessary data structures.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. `v` is a two-dimensional vector storing the coordinates and radius of each node. However, we don't need to store the radius in `v` because it's only used in the calculation of `x`, and we can store it in a separate one-dimensional array.

2. The calculation of `x` is performed in the innermost loop, which involves a lot of time-consuming mathematical operations. We can optimize it by calculating `(v[i][k] - v[j][k]) ^ 2` only once for each pair of nodes and storing the results in a two-dimensional array. This way, we only need to calculate it `n * (n - 1) / 2` times instead of `3 * n * (n - 1) / 2` times.

3. The index `m` is used to index the `node` array. Instead of using `m` and `node[m].second = m`, we can directly use `i` and `j` to index the `a`, `b`, and `node` arrays.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
#define M 9999
int parent[M], a[M][M], b[M][M];
double node[M][M], r[M];
int root(int a) { return parent[a] == a ? a : parent[a] = root(parent[a]); }
int unite(int a, int b) {
  int x = root(a), y = root(b);
  if (x == y)
    return 0;
  parent[x] = y;
  return 1;
}
int main() {
  int i, j, k, n;
  double x, y, z;
  for (; scanf("%d", &n), n;) {
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf", &x, &y, &z, &r[i]);
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
      parent[i] = i;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
      for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
        a[i][j] = i, b[i][j] = j;
        node[i][j] = sqrt((x - y) * (x - y) + (x - z) * (x - z) + (y - z) * (y - z)) - r[i] - r[j];
        if (node[i][j] <= 0)
          unite(i, j);
      }
    sort(node[0], node[0] + n * n);
    for (x = i = 0; i < n; i++)
      for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++)
        if (unite(a[i][j], b[i][j]))
          x += node[i][j];
    printf("%.3f\n", x);
  }
}
```

Note: The optimization regarding the reduction of mathematical calculations in the innermost loop assumes that the number of nodes `n` is not too large. If `n` is large, the space complexity of this optimization could be a problem.
