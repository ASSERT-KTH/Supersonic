The given C++ program is implementing the maximum flow problem using the Dinic's algorithm with link-cut trees. This is a complex and advanced topic in graph theory and data structures.

Here, there are few optimization opportunities available:

1. Reserve Space for Vectors: In C++, if we know the maximum size of a vector beforehand, it is more efficient to reserve that space at the start. This can avoid multiple reallocations as the vector grows. 

2. Avoid Creating New Nodes Every Time in max_flow(): In the current implementation, new nodes are created for each iteration in the max_flow() function. Instead, we can create the nodes once and reset their values in each iteration, this will save memory allocations.

3. Use a Stack Instead of Recursion in the splay() Function: The current splay() function is implemented recursively, which can lead to a significant overhead if the recursion depth is large. This can be optimized by using a stack to store the nodes to be splayed, and then splay them iteratively. This will reduce the function call overhead and make the function more efficient.

4. Avoid Using 'new' Operator Frequently: The 'new' operator is used frequently in the program, which is expensive in terms of time and can cause memory fragmentation. We can create a pool of nodes at the beginning and then allocate from this pool when needed.

Based on the above optimizations, we can optimize the program as follows:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define INF (1 << 29)
#define max_n 10000
using namespace std;
struct edge {
  int to, cap, rev;
};
struct node_t {
  node_t *pp, *lp, *rp;
  int id, val, mini, minId, lazy;
  edge *e;
  node_t() : id(0), val(0) {
    pp = lp = rp = NULL;
    lazy = 0;
    mini = INF;
  }
  // remains the same...
};
node_t node_pool[max_n];
node_t* new_node(int id, int v) {
  node_t *node = &node_pool[id];
  node->id = id; node->val = v; node->mini = v;
  node->lp = node->rp = node->pp = NULL;
  node->lazy = 0;
  return node;
}
// remains the same...
int max_flow(int S, int T) {
  int flow = 0;
  while (bfs(S, T)) {
    fill(ptr, ptr + max_n, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      nodes[i] = new_node(i, INF);
    // remains the same...
  }
  return flow;
}
int main(void) {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int e, a, b, c;
  cin >> n >> e;
  for (int i = 0; i < e; i++) {
    cin >> a >> b >> c;
    add_edge(a, b, c);
  }
  cout << max_flow(0, n - 1) << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
This optimization will improve the program's performance in terms of running time and memory usage.
