The provided code is a complex implementation of the Max-Flow problem using Splay Trees and Dinic's Algorithm. It's quite optimized in terms of the approach to the problem.

However, there are some minor optimizations that can be made:

1. Use of iostream instead of bits/stdc++.h: While bits/stdc++.h is a convenience header file to include all the standard libraries, it's not standard and can slow down the compilation process. We'll replace it with the specific libraries that are needed (iostream, vector and queue in this case).

2. Avoid using namespace std: This can prevent naming conflicts and is generally a best practice to follow.

3. Use of reserve() for vectors: If you know the size of the vector beforehand, using reserve() can prevent unnecessary reallocations and copying of the vector elements, leading to better memory usage and possibly faster code.

4. Initialize vectors with size: This can also improve performance when the size is known.

Here is the optimized code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

#define INF (1 << 29)
#define max_n 10000

struct edge {
  int to, cap, rev;
};

struct node_t {
  // ... same as before
};

// ... same as before

std::vector<edge> g[max_n];
void add_edge(int from, int to, int cap) {
  g[from].push_back((edge){to, cap, g[to].size()});
  g[to].push_back((edge){from, 0, g[from].size() - 1});
}

// ... same as before

int max_flow(int S, int T) {
  // ... same as before
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    lists[i].reserve(max_n);
  // ... same as before
}

int main(void) {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int e, a, b, c;
  std::cin >> n >> e;
  for (int i = 0; i < e; i++) {
    std::cin >> a >> b >> c;
    add_edge(a, b, c);
  }
  std::cout << max_flow(0, n - 1) << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This code should perform slightly better than the given one. However, the main optimizations have to do with the algorithm itself, which is quite complex and optimized in this case. For more significant improvements, we would need to look into alternative algorithms or parallel computing, which would involve a larger rewrite of the code.
