The given program is a C++ implementation of Dinic's algorithm for finding the maximum flow in a directed graph. The program already has a good level of optimization, however, some improvements can be made to further improve its performance. 

Optimization Steps:
1. The use of "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" is discouraged as it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increases compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary libraries.
2. In the BFS function, the initialization of the queue and the level vector can be done in a single line, which can make the code cleaner and slightly more efficient.
3. In the DFS function, we can use a reference to the edge in the for loop instead of using its index, which can make the code cleaner and potentially faster.
4. The use of "ios::sync_with_stdio(false)" and "cin.tie(0)" improves cin/cout efficiency but it makes cin/cout unsynchronized with scanf/printf or gets/puts. If the program does not use scanf/printf or gets/puts, these lines are fine. But if the program does, these lines can cause issues. 
5. Changing the type of the Edge's weight from a dynamic Weight type to int could make the program faster, as it's less flexible and thus more efficient.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <limits>

using namespace std;

class Dinic {
public:
  Dinic(int n) : n(n), g(n), INF(numeric_limits<int>::max()) {}
  
  void add_edge(int src, int dst, int cap) {
    g[src].emplace_back(Edge(src, dst, cap, g[dst].size()));
    g[dst].emplace_back(Edge(dst, src, 0, g[src].size() - 1));
  }
  
  int MaximumFlow(int s, int t) {
    int flow = 0;
    while (true) {
      vector<int> level(n, -1), iter(n);
      Bfs(s, level);
      if (level[t] == -1)
        break;
      for (int f = 0; (f = Dfs(level, iter, s, t, INF)) > 0;)
        flow += f;
    }
    return flow;
  }

private:
  struct Edge {
    int src, dst, rev, weight;
    Edge(int f, int t, int cap, int rev = 0) : src(f), dst(t), rev(rev), weight(cap) {}
  };
  
  int n;
  vector<vector<Edge>> g;
  const int INF;
  
  void Bfs(int s, vector<int> &level) {
    queue<int> que({s});
    level[s] = 0;
    while (!que.empty()) {
      int v = que.front();
      que.pop();
      for (Edge &e : g[v]) {
        if (e.weight > 0 && level[e.dst] == -1) {
          level[e.dst] = level[v] + 1;
          que.push(e.dst);
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  int Dfs(vector<int> &level, vector<int> &iter, int v, int t, int flow) {
    if (v == t)
      return flow;
    for (Edge &e : g[v]) {
      if (e.weight > 0 && level[v] < level[e.dst]) {
        int d = Dfs(level, iter, e.dst, t, min(flow, e.weight));
        if (d > 0) {
          e.weight -= d;
          g[e.dst][e.rev].weight += d;
          return d;
        }
      }
    }
    return 0;
  }
};

int main() {
  int n, m, u, v, c;
  cin >> n >> m;
  Dinic flow(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    cin >> u >> v >> c;
    flow.add_edge(u, v, c);
  }
  cout << flow.MaximumFlow(0, n - 1) << endl;
  return 0;
}
