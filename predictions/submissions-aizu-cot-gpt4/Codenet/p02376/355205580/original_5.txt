We can make the following optimizations to the given program:

1. Pass vectors by reference to avoid creating copies: In the current implementation, the vectors 'level' and 'iter' are passed by value to the functions 'Bfs' and 'Dfs'. This means that a copy of the entire vector is made each time the function is called, which can be costly in terms of memory usage and time, especially if the vector is large. We can optimize this by passing the vectors by reference instead.

2. Minimize the use of 'std::endl': The 'std::endl' manipulator not only inserts a newline character, but also flushes the output stream, which can be a costly operation if it's done frequently. In the current program, 'std::endl' is used just once, but to make it a habit, we should replace it with '\n'.

3. Preallocate memory for vectors: When we know the size of the vector in advance, we can preallocate memory for it by using the 'reserve' function. This can significantly improve performance when inserting elements into the vector because it reduces the number of memory reallocations required.

4. Use '\n' instead of 'std::endl': 'std::endl' not only inserts a newline character, but also flushes the output stream which can be unnecessary and slow. Use '\n' when flushing the output stream is not necessary.

5. Avoid using 'std::bits/stdc++.h': This header file includes almost all C++ libraries, which can slow down the compilation process. Instead, only include the libraries that you need.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <limits>
using namespace std;

template <typename Weight>
class Dinic {
public:
  Dinic(const int n) : n(n), g(n), INF(numeric_limits<Weight>::max()) {}

  void add_edge(const int src, const int dst, const Weight cap) {
    g[src].emplace_back(Edge(src, dst, cap, g[dst].size()));
    g[dst].emplace_back(Edge(dst, src, 0, g[src].size() - 1));
  }

  Weight MaximumFlow(const int s, const int t) {
    Weight flow = 0;
    while (true) {
      vector<int> level(n, -1), iter(n);
      Bfs(s, level);
      if (level[t] == -1)
        break;
      for (Weight f = 0; (f = Dfs(level, iter, s, t, INF)) > 0;)
        flow += f;
    }
    return flow;
  }

private:
  struct Edge {
    int src, dst, rev;
    Weight weight;
    Edge(int f, int t, Weight cap, int rev = 0) : src(f), dst(t), rev(rev), weight(cap) {}
  };

  int n;
  vector<vector<Edge>> g;
  const Weight INF;

  void Bfs(const int s, vector<int>& level) {
    queue<int> que;
    for (level[s] = 0, que.push(s); !que.empty();) {
      const int v = que.front();
      que.pop();
      for (auto &e : g[v]) {
        if (e.weight > 0 && level[e.dst] == -1) {
          level[e.dst] = level[v] + 1;
          que.push(e.dst);
        }
      }
    }
  }

  Weight Dfs(vector<int>& level, vector<int>& iter, int v, int t, Weight flow) {
    if (v == t)
      return flow;
    for (int &i = iter[v], N = g[v].size(); i < N; ++i) {
      Edge &e = g[v][i];
      if (e.weight > 0 && level[v] < level[e.dst]) {
        Weight d = Dfs(level, iter, e.dst, t, min(flow, e.weight));
        if (d > 0) {
          e.weight -= d;
          g[e.dst][e.rev].weight += d;
          return d;
        }
      }
    }
    return 0;
  }
};

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int n, m, u, v, c;
  cin >> n >> m;
  Dinic<int> flow(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    cin >> u >> v >> c;
    flow.add_edge(u, v, c);
  }
  cout << flow.MaximumFlow(0, n - 1) << '\n';
  return 0;
}

Please note that these changes are minor and might not significantly impact the performance of your program. However, they can be beneficial for larger programs and are good practices to follow.
