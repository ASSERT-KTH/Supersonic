This program is already quite optimized, as it's simple and doesn't involve any complex operations or memory consuming data structures. But there are still a few micro-optimizations that we can apply:

1. `PI` as a constant: Since the value of PI is not changing, we can declare it as a constant. This can slightly improve the performance as the compiler knows that this value will not change and can make some optimizations based on that.

2. Direct usage of `std::cout` instead of `printf`: There is a mix of C (`printf`) and C++ (`cin`) style I/O operations in your program. It is better to stick with one. Since we are using C++, we can use `std::cout` for output. This won't necessarily make program faster, but it's better for code consistency and maintainability. Also, it can be a bit safer than printf, because it doesn't require you to specify the type of the variable you're printing.

Here is the optimized program with above changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const double PI = 3.141592653589;
  double r;
  cin >> r;
  cout << PI * r * r << " " << 2 * PI * r << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these are really minor improvements and in practice, you won't notice any difference in performance or memory usage. It's always good to follow best practices and write clean, consistent, and maintainable code.
