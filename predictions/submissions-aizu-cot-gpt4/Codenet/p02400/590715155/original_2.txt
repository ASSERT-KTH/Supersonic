This program is already highly optimized in terms of both time and space complexity. However, there are a few small changes we can make to further optimize it:

1. We can use 'constexpr' keyword for PI which tells the compiler to evaluate the value of PI at compile time instead of run time. This will save a little bit of run time. 

2. The 'std::endl' not only inserts a newline, but it also flushes the output buffer. This can be quite slow. It's better to use '\n' instead.

3. We can use 'std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);' to untie C++'s standard streams from their corresponding C streams. This can significantly improve the I/O performance in some cases.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  constexpr double PI = 3.141592653589;
  double r;
  cin >> r;
  cout << PI * r * r << ' ' << 2 * PI * r << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
Remember that you should only use 'std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);' if you're sure you won't be using any C-style I/O (like 'printf' or 'scanf') afterwards. It's good here because we're not using any C-style I/O after this line.
