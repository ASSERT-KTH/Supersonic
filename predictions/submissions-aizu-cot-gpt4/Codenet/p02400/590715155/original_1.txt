First, the constant PI can be declared as a constant variable. This can save some memory because the value of a constant variable will not be modified during the runtime of the program. The compiler can make some optimizations knowing that this variable's value will not change.

Second, for the calculation of the area and the circumference, the PI * r part is common in both formulas. It can be calculated once and stored in a variable. This can save some computation time because the program does not have to calculate PI * r twice.

Optimized program:

```C++
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  const double PI = 3.141592653589;
  double r;
  cin >> r;
  double pi_r = PI * r;  // Calculate PI * r once and store it in a variable.
  printf("%lf %lf\n", pi_r * r, 2 * pi_r);  // Use the stored value in the calculations.
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized program, the constant PI is declared as a constant variable and the common part PI * r in the formulas is calculated once and stored in a variable. The stored value is used in the calculations of the area and the circumference. This can save both memory and computation time.
