The given program is quite optimized in terms of both running time and memory usage. However, there are a few minor modifications that can be done to make it more efficient.

1. The variable `PI` is not changing throughout the program. So, we can declare it as `const` so that the compiler can do some optimizations.

2. We are using `printf` function which belongs to `cstdio` library. Instead, we can use `cout` to print the output which belongs to `iostream` library. This is because we already included `iostream` library and `cout` is more type safe.

3. We are using `double` which is 8 bytes, it provides high precision. If we don't need that much precision, we can use `float` which is 4 bytes and it can help reduce memory usage.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const float PI = 3.141592653589f;
  float r;
  cin >> r;
  cout << PI * r * r << " " << 2 * PI * r << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimization in step 3 may lead to less precision. If you need high precision, you should keep using `double`.
