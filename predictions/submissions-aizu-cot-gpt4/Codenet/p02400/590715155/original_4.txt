The given program is fairly optimal, but there are a few minor changes you could make to potentially improve its performance:

1. The value of PI is a constant and will not change. It would be better to declare it as a constant which might allow the compiler to make certain optimizations.

2. Using `std::cin` and `printf` together in the same program could potentially slow down the program due to synchronization issues. It would be better to stick to either C-style or C++ style I/O throughout the program. Since we are using C++, we will use `std::cin` and `std::cout`.

3. Moreover, using `endl` to end the line can also impact the performance. `endl` is slower because it causes a flushing of the stream's buffer, which means it's forced to perform its output immediately, that's why we will use `"\n"` instead.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const double PI = 3.141592653589;
  double r;
  cin >> r;
  cout << PI * r * r << " " << 2 * PI * r << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Remember, these optimizations are very small and may not make a noticeable difference in the execution time or memory usage for this particular program. However, in larger and more complex programs, these kind of optimizations can be beneficial.
