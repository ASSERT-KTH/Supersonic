This is a very simple and efficient C++ program. It takes the radius of a circle as input and calculates the area and circumference of the circle. The program is already quite optimized, but there are a few minor improvements that could be made:

1. The `PI` value is a constant, so it should be declared as `const` for better readability and to prevent it from being accidentally modified.

2. `printf` is slower than `cout` because `printf` needs to parse the format string. Using `cout` can slightly improve the performance.

3. The `std::endl` causes the output buffer to flush. This could be inefficient if the program is running inside a loop. Therefore, it's better to use `'\n'` to print a new line.

4. `using namespace std;` is generally considered bad practice because it can lead to name clashes. It's better to use the `std::` prefix when needed.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
const double PI = 3.141592653589;
int main() {
  double r;
  std::cin >> r;
  std::cout << PI * r * r << " " << 2 * PI * r << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

Remember that these are very minor optimizations. In most cases, the original program would perform just as well.
