This program is quite efficient but there are a few small optimizations that can be made:

1. The variable `x` (which represents the value of pi) is not necessary to be calculated every time the program runs. It can be defined as a constant variable, which can also increase the readability of the code.

2. `l = x * (r + r);` Here, we are calculating `r + r` which is equivalent to `2*r`. A multiplication operation is faster than an addition operation in CPU, so we can change it to `2*r`.

3. Use `std::cout` instead of `printf`. In C++, using `std::cout` is safer and more flexible than `printf`, and it is recommended to use the C++ style of I/O.

Here is the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

const double PI = 3.141592653589;

int main() {
  double r, s, l;
  cin >> r;
  s = r * r * PI;
  l = 2 * PI * r;
  cout.precision(8);
  cout << fixed << s << " " << l << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This program should run slightly faster and use slightly less memory than the original.
