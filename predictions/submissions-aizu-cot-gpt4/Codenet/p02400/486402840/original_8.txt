The given program calculates the area (s) and circumference (l) of a circle given its radius (r). Here are some possible optimizations:

1. Calculation of `l` can be simplified. Instead of `x * (r + r)`, we can write `2 * x * r`. This might be a minor optimization, but it simplifies the equation and also avoids the unnecessary addition operation.

2. The value of `x` can be directly used in the calculations instead of assigning it to a variable. This would save memory as we will be using one less variable. But it will also reduce the readability of the code. We need to balance between optimization and readability. Here, I will keep the variable `x` for readability.

3. We can also avoid the use of `cstdio` by using `cout` for output. This would make the code more consistent as we are using `cin` for input.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  double r, s, l;
  double x = 3.141592653589;
  cin >> r;
  s = r * r * x;
  l = 2 * x * r;
  cout.precision(8);
  cout << s << " " << l << "\n";
}
```

In this optimized version, we have used `cout` with precision set to 8 for output, which is equivalent to `printf("%.8lf %.8lf\n", s, l);`. The formula for circumference has been simplified and an unnecessary addition operation has been eliminated.
