This program calculates the area and circumference of a circle based on user input. The optimization can be done in the following ways:

1. You are using both iostream and cstdio. While this won't directly affect performance, it's generally a good practice to stick to one. Since you're using cin for input, using cout for output would be more consistent.

2. The constant π is redefined every time the function is called. This should be defined as a constant outside the function. This is beneficial because the preprocessor will replace the identifier PI everywhere in the code. This way, the PI value is stored only once in memory.

3. The variable 'x' used for π is not necessary. You can use the constant directly in your calculations. This will save memory.

4. The calculation for circumference (l = x * (r + r)) can be optimized. The expression (r + r) can be replaced with (2 * r) which is faster to compute.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const double PI = 3.141592653589;

int main() {
  double r, s, l;
  cin >> r;
  s = r * r * PI;
  l = 2 * PI * r;
  cout.precision(8);
  cout << s << " " << l << "\n";
}
```
