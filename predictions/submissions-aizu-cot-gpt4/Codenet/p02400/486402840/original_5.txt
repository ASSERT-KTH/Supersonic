The given C++ code is already quite optimized, but there are a few minor improvements we can make:

1. Use the M_PI constant from the cmath library instead of assigning the value of pi manually. This will provide more precision and also save some memory.

2. The expression `r + r` for calculating the circumference can be replaced with `2 * r`. While most modern compilers will optimize this kind of expression themselves, explicitly using multiplication can sometimes be a bit faster.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  double r, s, l;
  cin >> r;
  s = r * r * M_PI;
  l = 2 * r * M_PI;
  printf("%.8lf %.8lf\n", s, l);
}
```

This program reads a radius from the input, calculates the area and the circumference of a circle with that radius, and prints the results with a precision of 8 decimal places. The optimization does not change the functionality but may improve the performance slightly.
