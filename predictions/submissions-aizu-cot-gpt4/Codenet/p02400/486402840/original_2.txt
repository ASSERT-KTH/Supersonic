The given C++ program calculates the area and the circumference of a circle given its radius.

Here are my optimization suggestions:

1. You don't need to include both `<cstdio>` and `<iostream>`. You are using `cin` from `<iostream>` for input and `printf` from `<cstdio>` for output. You can use `cout` from `<iostream>` for output too, which makes the inclusion of `<cstdio>` unnecessary.

2. The value of `x` is basically `pi`. Instead of declaring and using a variable `x` to store `pi`, you can use the `M_PI` constant from `<cmath>`.

3. You're calculating `(r + r)` in the circumference formula. Instead, you can use `2 * r` which is more straightforward and slightly faster.

4. You're using `double` for the radius, area and circumference. If you don't need very high precision, consider using `float` which uses less memory.

Step-by-step, here is the optimized version of the program:

1. Replace the inclusion of `<cstdio>` with `<cmath>`.
2. Replace `x` with `M_PI`.
3. Replace `(r + r)` with `2 * r`.
4. Change `double` to `float` if high precision is not required.

And here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  float r, s, l;
  cin >> r;
  s = r * r * M_PI;
  l = M_PI * 2 * r;
  cout.precision(8);
  cout << s << " " << l << "\n";
}
```

Remember that the `float` change is optional and depends on your precision needs. If you need the high precision of `double`, keep the `double` type.
