The given C/C++ program calculates the area (s) and circumference (l) of a circle given its radius (r). These calculations are straightforward and don't have much room for runtime optimizations. 

However, there are a few small modifications we can make to improve the code's readability and efficiency:

1. We can replace the magic number 3.141592653589 with the predefined constant M_PI from the cmath library. This will improve the accuracy of our calculations and make our code more readable.

2. The expression (r + r) can be replaced with (2 * r). Although modern compilers should optimize this automatically, it's better to be explicit.

3. We don't need to use both cstdio and iostream for input/output. We could stick with just iostream for both input and output, which may slightly reduce the memory footprint of our program.

4. We can avoid the usage of the namespace std. It's generally considered a bad practice to use the entire namespace. We can use std::cin and std::cout instead.

Here's how you can optimize the program:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  double r, s, l;
  std::cin >> r;
  s = r * r * M_PI;
  l = 2 * r * M_PI;
  std::cout.precision(8);
  std::cout << std::fixed << s << " " << l << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that even though we've made these changes, the running time and memory usage of the program will not change significantly, because the original program was simple and didn't have any expensive operations or large memory allocations.
