This C/C++ program calculates the area "s" and circumference "l" of a circle given its radius "r". The circle's area is calculated as Pi*r^2 and the circumference as 2*Pi*r. 

The original program is quite efficient, but there are still a few minor improvements to be made:

1. You are using both iostream (cin) and cstdio (printf) to manage input and output. This is unnecessary and can be slightly inefficient. Choose one and stick with it. In this case, I'll choose iostream for both input and output because it is more C++ standard and offers more flexibility.

2. The variable "x" is used to store the value of Pi. Although this makes the code easier to read, it also means that an extra double precision floating point variable is being used. You can eliminate this variable by using a constant for Pi. This will save a tiny bit of memory.

3. The calculation for the circumference of the circle (l = x * (r + r)) can be simplified to (l = 2.0 * Pi * r), allowing for one less addition operation.

4. Variables r, s, l are not initialized. It's a good practice to initialize variables when they are declared. This can prevent errors and undefined behaviors.

5. You can use "const" keyword for Pi since its value never changes. This allows the compiler to do more optimization.

Here's your optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const double Pi = 3.141592653589;
  double r = 0.0, s = 0.0, l = 0.0;
  cin >> r;
  s = Pi * r * r;
  l = 2.0 * Pi * r;
  cout.precision(8);
  cout << fixed << s << " " << l << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The difference in performance between the original and the optimized version will be negligible for most purposes. The real benefit of these changes is to improve readability and maintainability.
