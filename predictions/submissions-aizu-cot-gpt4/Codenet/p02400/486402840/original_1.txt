This code takes a radius as input and calculates the area and circumference of a circle using this radius. The code is quite optimized already, but there are a few minor improvements we can make.

1. Avoid using both cstdio and iostream: This program includes both cstdio and iostream, which are two different ways of handling input and output in C++. In this case, it's unnecessary to have both. Since the program already uses cin from iostream for input, we can use cout for output as well to maintain consistency. This won't have a significant impact on performance, but it will make the code cleaner and more consistent.

2. Use of const for π: The value of π is constant, so it would be more appropriate to declare it as a const variable. This can potentially allow the compiler to make further optimizations. Plus, it is a good practice to use const for values that don't change.

3. Avoid unnecessary calculation: The code calculates `r + r` to find the diameter of the circle. This can be simplified to `2*r`, which is a bit cleaner.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    double r, s, l;
    const double PI = 3.141592653589;
    cin >> r;
    s = r * r * PI;
    l = 2 * PI * r;
    cout.precision(8);
    cout << s << " " << l << "\n";
}
```

Please remember, this program is already quite optimized. The modifications made are minor and more about good practices and cleaner code than significant performance improvements. In general, premature optimization should be avoided in programming. It's usually more important to write clear, correct code than to make minor optimizations, especially before you've identified that a particular piece of code is a performance bottleneck.
