The given C++ program is converting seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds. The program is taking the number of seconds as input from the user and then calculating the hours, minutes, and seconds.

Optimization Steps:
1. We can avoid multiple subtractions and assignments to the 'is' variable that is currently being done twice (for hours and minutes). Instead, we can use the modulus operator (%) to directly find the remaining seconds after extracting hours and minutes.
2. In the original program, the 'is' variable is being used for two different purposes: first, for taking the input, and then for storing the remaining seconds after each calculation. We can avoid this by using a separate variable for input, which would make the code more readable and less error-prone.
3. The 'std' namespace is being imported globally which is generally not a good practice as it could lead to name clashes. We can use 'std::' before each standard library object to avoid this.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int input_seconds;
  int h, m, s;
  std::cin >> input_seconds;
  h = input_seconds / 3600;
  m = (input_seconds % 3600) / 60;
  s = (input_seconds % 3600) % 60;
  std::cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << s << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This code should run faster and use slightly less memory due to the reduced number of operations and variables. The code is also more readable which can help with maintenance and debugging.
