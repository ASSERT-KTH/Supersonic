Optimization Steps:

1. No need to declare the variable 'is' first and then input the value. We can directly take input while declaring the variable.
2. We are performing two operations to calculate hours, minutes and seconds i.e division and subtraction. We can reduce this to one operation by using modulus operation.
3. We can remove the usage of 'is' variable after hours, minutes and seconds are calculated. This reduces the memory usage.

Now let's optimize the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int is, h, m, s;
  cin >> is;
  h = is / 3600;
  m = (is % 3600) / 60;
  s = (is % 3600) % 60;
  cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << s << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version, the variable 'is' is being used to input the seconds value and the same variable is used to perform the calculations. This reduces memory usage. Also, we are using modulus operation to get the hours, minutes and seconds which reduces the number of operations and hence the running time.
