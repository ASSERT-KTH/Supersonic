The given program takes an input in seconds and converts it into hours, minutes, and seconds. 

The program can be optimized by reducing the number of operations:

1) It's not necessary to subtract `h*3600` and `m*60` from `is`. Instead, the modulus operator can be used, which will directly give the remaining seconds after converting to hours and minutes.

2) The variable `is` is used to store both the input seconds and the final seconds. It's better to use different variables for different purposes. However, in this particular case, we can stick with `is` as it reduces the memory usage.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int is;
  int h, m;
  cin >> is;
  h = is / 3600;
  is %= 3600;
  m = is / 60;
  is %= 60;
  cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << is << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
