Optimizations:

1. We can use modulus operation (%) to directly get the remaining seconds after calculating hours and minutes. This will reduce the number of mathematical operations in our program. 

2. We can also remove the "using namespace std;" line and prefix the necessary functions with "std::". This is because using the whole std namespace can lead to naming conflicts in larger code bases.

3. Variable 'is' can be directly used without reassigning it to 's' and then printing 'is'. We can simply use 'is' in the cout statement.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int is;
  int h, m;
  std::cin >> is;
  h = is / 3600;
  m = (is % 3600) / 60;
  is = is % 60;
  std::cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << is << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program performs the same task as the original program but with less memory usage and better running time.
