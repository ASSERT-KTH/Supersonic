The given code is already quite efficient, but we can make a small optimization by using the modulus operator to reduce the number of calculations. This would replace the subtraction of hours and minutes converted to seconds from the total input seconds.

Here are the steps for the optimization:

1. The input time in seconds is divided by 3600 to get hours. The division result is assigned to the variable 'h'. This step is already optimal and will remain the same.

2. Instead of subtracting the hours (converted into seconds) from the total seconds, we can use the modulus operator to directly get the remaining seconds after extracting the hours.

3. Similar to step 2, after getting the remaining seconds, we can directly get the minutes by dividing the remaining seconds by 60 and use the modulus operator again to get the remaining seconds.

4. The remaining seconds after extracting hours and minutes is assigned to the variable 's'.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int is;
  int h, m, s;
  cin >> is;
  h = is / 3600;
  is %= 3600;
  m = is / 60;
  s = is % 60;
  cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << s << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimized code assumes that the input will always be in the form of total seconds. If the input can vary, additional code would be required to handle those cases.
