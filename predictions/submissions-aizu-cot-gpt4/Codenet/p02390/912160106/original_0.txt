The given program takes an input of seconds and converts it into hours, minutes, and seconds format. The current program is fairly optimized, but there are a few places where we can make minor improvements.

1. The variable 'is' is used for two different purposes which can lead to confusion. Initially, it's used for storing the input from the user, and later it's used for storing the remaining seconds after hours and minutes are calculated. We could use separate variables to make the code more readable.

2. Instead of calculating the remaining seconds using subtraction, we can use the modulus operator. This will give us the remainder of a division operation, which is exactly what we're looking for. This should also be slightly faster.

3. We can eliminate the 'using namespace std;' line and use 'std::' prefix where required. This is a good practice to avoid name clashes.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int totalSeconds, remainingSeconds;
  int h, m, s;
  
  std::cin >> totalSeconds;
  
  h = totalSeconds / 3600;
  remainingSeconds = totalSeconds % 3600;
  
  m = remainingSeconds / 60;
  s = remainingSeconds % 60;
  
  std::cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << s << std::endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimization doesn't significantly improve the performance because the original program is already simple and well-optimized. But it does improve readability and maintainability.
