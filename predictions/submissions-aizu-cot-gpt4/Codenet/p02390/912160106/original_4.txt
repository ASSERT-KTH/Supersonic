This is a simple C++ program that takes an integer representing seconds and converts it into hours, minutes, and seconds format. The program is pretty optimized, but there are a few things that could be tweaked for even better performance.

1. Change the variable 'is' to 'sec' for better readability.
2. Use the modulus operator (%) for the remainder calculation instead of subtracting the calculated hours and minutes from 'is'. This will reduce the number of arithmetic operations in the program, hence optimizing the runtime.
3. Remove 'using namespace std;' to limit the scope and prevent naming conflicts. Instead, we can use 'std::' before cin, cout, and endl. Although this doesn't directly optimize the program, it's a best practice to avoid potential issues in larger programs.

The optimized code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int sec;
  int h, m, s;
  std::cin >> sec;
  h = sec / 3600;
  m = (sec % 3600) / 60;
  s = sec % 60;
  std::cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << s << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimization may not have a significant impact on the performance for this specific program due to its simplicity. However, these practices can be beneficial when applied to larger, more complex programs.
