This C++ program takes an input as the number of seconds and converts it into hours, minutes, and seconds. The current code is already pretty efficient, however, there are a few small modifications that could be done to further improve it:

1. Use the modulus operator (%): Instead of subtracting the already calculated value from the total number of seconds, we can use the modulus operation to directly get the remaining seconds. This will reduce the number of mathematical operations in the program.

2. Combine declaration and assignment: We can combine the declaration and the assignment of 'h', 'm', and 's' into single lines. This makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.

The optimized program would look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int is;
  cin >> is;
  int h = is / 3600;
  int m = (is % 3600) / 60;
  int s = is % 60;
  cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << s << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version uses fewer operations, making it slightly faster. It also looks cleaner and is easier to maintain.
