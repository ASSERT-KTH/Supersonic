The given code is converting input seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds. The program is already quite efficient, but there are still a few small tweaks that can make it slightly more optimized:

1. Combine declaration and initialization: It's generally a good practice to combine the declaration and initialization of variables. This is because it prevents variables from being uninitialized, which can lead to undefined behavior.

2. Use modulus operator (%): Instead of subtracting hours and minutes from the total seconds, one can use the modulus operator (%) to directly get the remaining seconds. This reduces the number of arithmetic operations and makes the code cleaner.

3. Use endl sparingly: 'endl' not only moves the cursor to the next line, but also flushes the stream. This can be quite expensive in terms of performance. In this code, there's really no need to flush the stream, a newline character ('\n') would be enough.

Here is the optimized code:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int is;
  cin >> is;
  int h = is / 3600;
  int m = (is % 3600) / 60;
  int s = is % 60;
  cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << s << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the number of arithmetic operations has been reduced and the stream is only flushed once, at the end of the program. This should make the program slightly faster and more memory efficient.
