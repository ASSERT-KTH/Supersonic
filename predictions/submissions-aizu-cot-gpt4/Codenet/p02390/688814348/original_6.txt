First, we can start by optimizing the computation of the `S % 3600` operation. This operation is performed twice, which is unnecessary. We can compute it once and store it in a variable, then use this variable in the following computations. This will save CPU cycles.

Second, the `using namespace std;` line is generally considered bad practice because it can lead to name clashes. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix when needed.

Let's make these two changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(void) {
  int S;
  std::cin >> S;
  int rem = S % 3600;
  std::cout << S / 3600 << ":" << rem / 60 << ":" << rem % 60 << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we calculate the `S % 3600` operation only once and store the result in `rem`. Then we use `rem` for further calculations. We also removed the `using namespace std;` line and used `std::` where needed.
