The given program is already quite compact and efficient, but we can make small optimizations to improve the running time slightly. 

First, we can see that the operation `S % 3600` is being done twice in the program. We can optimize this by storing the result in a variable so that the calculation only needs to be done once.

Second, we can also remove `using namespace std;` and prefix `cin`, `cout`, and `endl` with `std::`. This is because using the whole namespace `std` can lead to name clashes, which is generally considered bad practice.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main(void) {
  int S, rem;
  std::cin >> S;
  rem = S % 3600;
  std::cout << S / 3600 << ":" << rem / 60 << ":" << rem % 60 << std::endl;
}
```

This program should have slightly better performance as it has to calculate `S % 3600` only once, and it also avoids potential name clashes by not using the `std` namespace globally.
