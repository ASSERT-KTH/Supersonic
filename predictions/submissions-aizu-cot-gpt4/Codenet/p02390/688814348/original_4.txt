The given program reads an integer (S) that represents the total number of seconds and then prints the equivalent time in hours, minutes, and seconds. The program is already quite optimal, but there is a small room for improvement.

The current program uses `(S % 3600)` twice. The modulus operation is a bit heavier than other arithmetic operations, and it's unnecessary to perform it twice. You can calculate `(S % 3600)` once and store it in a variable. Then you can use this variable to calculate the minutes and seconds, which can save a bit of computation.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int S;
  cin >> S;
  int remainder = S % 3600;
  cout << S / 3600 << ":" << remainder / 60 << ":" << remainder % 60 << endl;
}
```

This change doesn't have a significant impact on the runtime, but it's still a good practice to avoid unnecessary calculations.
