This program seems to be calculating time in hours, minutes, and seconds from a total number of seconds. The optimizations I can suggest are:

1. We can avoid the two calculations of `S % 3600` by storing this in a variable.
2. Instead of using `std::endl`, we can use `\n` to avoid the unnecessary flushing of the output stream.

Let's apply these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int S;
  cin >> S;
  int remainder = S % 3600;
  cout << S / 3600 << ":" << remainder / 60 << ":" << remainder % 60 << "\n";
}
```

This program will yield the same output as the original, but it will perform fewer operations and avoid unnecessary flushing of the output stream, making it more efficient both in terms of running time and memory usage.
