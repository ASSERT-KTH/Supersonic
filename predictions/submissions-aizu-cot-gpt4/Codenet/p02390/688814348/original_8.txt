The current program receives an integer `S` as input, which is assumed to represent seconds. It then calculates hours, minutes, and seconds, and prints them in the format `h:m:s`. The calculations are done three times (`S / 3600`, `(S % 3600) / 60`, `(S % 3600) % 60`) which is unnecessary and inefficient. 

Optimization Steps:

1. The first optimization we can do here is to reduce redundancy by calculating the modulus `S % 3600` only once and storing it in a variable. This way, we avoid doing the same calculation twice.

2. Similarly, we can compute `S / 3600` once and store the result in a variable, rather than computing it twice.

After these steps, we'll have an optimized version of the program that avoids unnecessary calculations, thus reducing running time and (minimally) memory usage.

The optimized code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int S;
  cin >> S;
  int mod = S % 3600;
  int hours = S / 3600;
  cout << hours << ":" << mod / 60 << ":" << mod % 60 << endl;
}
```

This program does the same work as the original, but it avoids redundant calculations, which makes it more efficient.
