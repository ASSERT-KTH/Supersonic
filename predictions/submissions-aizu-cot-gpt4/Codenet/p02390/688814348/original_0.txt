The program above reads an integer S from the standard input, which represents seconds. Then it converts these seconds into HH:MM:SS format and prints it.

There is one optimization that can be applied here, which is the avoidance of duplicate calculations. The program calculates S % 3600 twice. In the optimization process, we will calculate it only once and store it in a variable.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int S;
  cin >> S;
  int remainder = S % 3600; // add this line
  cout << S / 3600 << ":" << remainder / 60 << ":" << remainder % 60 << endl;
}
```

This optimization reduces the time complexity slightly by removing the need for an extra modulo operation. It is beneficial if S is a very large number. The memory usage optimization is not significant here because we only added one extra integer variable.
