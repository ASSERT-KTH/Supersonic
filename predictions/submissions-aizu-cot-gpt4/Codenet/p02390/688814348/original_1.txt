The C++ program you provided takes an integer S as input and outputs it in the format of hh:mm:ss. The optimization can be done in the following ways:

1. Reducing the number of computations: The current program is computing `S % 3600` twice. It's better to store this value in a variable and use it in the following computations. This reduces the number of modulo operations.

2. Reducing memory usage: The program is using an integer `S` which consumes 4 bytes of memory. If the input is known to be within a certain range, we could optimize memory usage by using a smaller data type.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int S;
  cin >> S;
  int rem = S % 3600;
  cout << S / 3600 << ":" << rem / 60 << ":" << rem % 60 << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the memory optimization is not applied here as it requires more specific information about the possible range of input values.
