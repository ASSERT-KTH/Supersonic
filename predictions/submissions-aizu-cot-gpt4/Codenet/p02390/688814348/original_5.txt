This program takes an integer input representing the total number of seconds and converts it into a time format of hours, minutes, and seconds. 

The program is already pretty efficient, but there's a minor optimization that can be done to reduce the number of modulo operations.

The first optimization is to eliminate the repeated modulo operation `(S % 3600)`. We can store the result of this operation in a variable and use it again, it helps to reduce CPU usage because modulo operation is a bit costly.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int S, mod;
  cin >> S;
  mod = S % 3600;
  cout << S / 3600 << ":" << mod / 60 << ":" << mod % 60 << endl;
}
```

This version of the program performs the same task but does the modulo operation only once, storing the result in `mod`. This small adjustment can reduce CPU usage and improve running time.
