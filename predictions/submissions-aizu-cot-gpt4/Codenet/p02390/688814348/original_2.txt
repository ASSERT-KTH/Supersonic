This C++ program is already quite efficient. It reads an integer from the standard input and then outputs the equivalent time in hours, minutes, and seconds. However, minor optimizations can be done.

Optimization Steps:

1. The operation `S % 3600` is repeated twice. This is a relatively expensive operation, so we can store its result in a variable and use it twice.
2. Instead of using `std::endl`, which effectively performs a newline (`\n`) and a flush operation on the stream, we can use `'\n'` directly if we don't need to flush the stream. This could result in a minor speed increase, especially in loops, but in this simple case, it doesn't make much of a difference.
3. We can explicitly declare `main()` to return `0` at the end to indicate successful termination of the program. Although in C++, the compiler implicitly assumes `return 0;` at the end of `main()`, it's a good practice to include it for readability.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int S;
    std::cin >> S;
    int remainder = S % 3600;
    std::cout << S / 3600 << ':' << remainder / 60 << ':' << remainder % 60 << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

Note: In C++ programs, optimization is often more about design and algorithmic choices than micro-optimizations like these. These micro-optimizations can sometimes make the code less readable.
