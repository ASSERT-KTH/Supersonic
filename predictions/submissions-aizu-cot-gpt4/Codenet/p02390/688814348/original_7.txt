The given C++ program reads an integer S from standard input and prints it out as an hours:minutes:seconds format.

The program can be optimized for running time. The same calculation S % 3600 is done twice. We can store the result of S % 3600 in a variable and use that variable in the next two calculations. This will reduce the computation time.

Here is the optimized code:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int S;
  cin >> S;
  int remainder = S % 3600;
  cout << S / 3600 << ":" << remainder / 60 << ":" << remainder % 60 << endl;
}
```

This optimized code performs fewer calculations. The result of S % 3600 is stored in the 'remainder' variable and this value is used in the next two calculations, instead of performing the same calculation twice. This reduces the computation time, and thus optimizes the program for running time. The memory usage is also reduced slightly because we are storing the result of S % 3600 in a variable instead of calculating it twice.
