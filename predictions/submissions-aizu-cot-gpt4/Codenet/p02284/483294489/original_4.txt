The given C++ program is a simple implementation of Binary Search Tree (BST). However, it can be optimized in a few ways:

1. Memory Optimization: In the current version, each time an insert operation is performed a new node is created using the new operator. This may lead to frequent memory allocations which can be expensive. 

2. Time Optimization: Certain operations like find and insert can benefit from tail recursion optimization. To do this, we can convert the recursive function into a loop with the help of auxiliary stack.

3. Use of `printf` and `cout` together: The program uses both `printf` and `cout` to print output. It's better to stick with one of them, preferably `cout` as it is more C++ style and also provides type safety.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
  int key;
  Node *parent, *left, *right;
  Node(int k): key(k), left(nullptr), right(nullptr), parent(nullptr) {}
};

Node *root = nullptr;

void insert(int k) {
  Node *y = nullptr;
  Node *x = root;
  Node *z = new Node(k);
  while (x != nullptr) {
    y = x;
    if (z->key < x->key) {
      x = x->left;
    } else {
      x = x->right;
    }
  }
  z->parent = y;
  if (y == nullptr) {
    root = z;
  } else {
    if (z->key < y->key)
      y->left = z;
    else
      y->right = z;
  }
}

bool find(int k) {
  Node *v = root;
  while (v != nullptr) {
    if (k == v->key)
      return true;
    if (k < v->key) {
      v = v->left;
    } else {
      v = v->right;
    }
  }
  return false;
}

void inorder(Node *u) {
  if (u == nullptr)
    return;
  inorder(u->left);
  cout << " " << u->key;
  inorder(u->right);
}

void preorder(Node *u) {
  if (u == nullptr)
    return;
  cout << " " << u->key;
  preorder(u->left);
  preorder(u->right);
}

int main() {
  int n, x;
  string com;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> com;
    if (com == "insert") {
      cin >> x;
      insert(x);
    } else if (com == "print") {
      inorder(root);
      cout << endl;
      preorder(root);
      cout << endl;
    } else if (com == "find") {
      cin >> x;
      if (find(x))
        cout << "yes" << endl;
      else
        cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program uses a constructor in the `Node` struct to initialize the values, reducing the number of lines in the insert function. `NULL` is replaced with `nullptr` which is more type-safe. It also uses `cout` instead of `printf` for printing, which is more C++ style and type safe.
