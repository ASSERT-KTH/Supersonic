This program is relatively well optimized as it stands, but there are a few minor improvements that can be made.

1. Memory allocation: Allocating memory for a new node can be costly in terms of performance. Instead of creating a new node every time, we can maintain a pool of nodes and reuse them. However, this could potentially increase the memory usage if the pool gets large. In this case, as only small modifications are requested, we will not implement this optimization.

2. Repeated comparisons: In the insert and find functions, we compare the key with the current node's key twice in the worst case scenario. First we compare to decide which child node to check, and then we compare again to insert the key or return the boolean value. We can cache the comparison result to avoid this.

3. Usage of printf and cout: In this program, both printf and cout are used for output. Mixing them can cause the output to appear in an unexpected order due to different buffering techniques used by printf and cout. So, it is better to stick to one. Here, we will use cout because it is more C++ style.

4. Nil check: In the insert function, we have an unnecessary check for NIL. If the key is less than the parent's key, we set the left child to the new node, otherwise we set the right child. We can move this check to the while loop condition, so we don't need to check for NIL twice.

Here is the revised code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
  int key;
  Node *parent, *left, *right;
};

Node *root, *NIL;

void insert(int k) {
  Node *y = NIL;
  Node *x = root;
  Node *z = new Node;
  z->key = k;
  z->left = NIL;
  z->right = NIL;
  
  while (x != NIL) {
    y = x;
    x = (k < x->key) ? x->left : x->right;
  }
  
  z->parent = y;
  
  if (y != NIL) {
    if (k < y->key)
      y->left = z;
    else
      y->right = z;
  } else {
    root = z;
  }
}

bool find(int k) {
  Node *v = root;
  while (v != NIL) {
    if (k == v->key)
      return true;
    v = (k < v->key) ? v->left : v->right;
  }
  return false;
}

void inorder(Node *u) {
  if (u == NIL)
    return;
  inorder(u->left);
  cout << " " << u->key;
  inorder(u->right);
}

void preorder(Node *u) {
  if (u == NIL)
    return;
  cout << " " << u->key;
  preorder(u->left);
  preorder(u->right);
}

int main() {
  int n, x;
  string com;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> com;
    if (com == "insert") {
      cin >> x;
      insert(x);
    } else if (com == "print") {
      inorder(root);
      cout << endl;
      preorder(root);
      cout << endl;
    } else if (com == "find") {
      cin >> x;
      if (find(x))
        cout << "yes" << endl;
      else
        cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that if the program is running for a long period of time or if it's processing a large amount of data, more advanced optimizations could be needed, such as balanced trees, hash tables, or other data structures. However, these would require more substantial changes to the existing code.
