The original program is quite complex, but there are a few potential areas for optimization.

1. Replace `std::vector` with a `std::array`: Vectors are dynamically allocated and can be resized. However, if the size of the array is known at compile time, we can use `std::array` instead, which is allocated on the stack and can be faster.

2. Memory optimization: The original program uses a three-dimensional array `memo2[60][60][4]` which contains a lot of redundant data. If the array is sparsely populated, we can use a map or a sparse array to save memory.

3. Use of `std::priority_queue`: This data structure is used to store and retrieve elements based on their priority. The retrieval of the highest priority element is a costly operation and is done multiple times in the program. If the queue is not needed, it can be replaced by a more suitable data structure.

4. Avoid unnecessary computation: In the original program, the operator `^` is used several times. This operator is computationally expensive. If it's possible to avoid this computation, it will speed up the program.

5. Use of `std::min`: This function is used several times in the original program. If it's possible to avoid this computation or replace it with a more efficient operation, it will speed up the program.

Here is the optimized version of the provided code:

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

const int dx[4] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
const int dy[4] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
const int dx2[4] = {-1, 0, 2, 1};
const int dy2[4] = {0, 2, 1, -1};

struct aa {
  int x;
  int y;
  int turn;
};

struct bb {
  int kx;
  int ky;
  int opway;
  int turn;
};

int getdis(const array<array<int, 64>, 64>& field, int fx, int fy, int gx, int gy)
{
  int ans = 999999;
  queue<aa> que;
  array<array<int, 64>, 64> memo;
  que.push(aa{fx, fy, 0});
  
  // Other code remains the same.
}

class Compare {
public:
  bool operator()(const bb &l, const bb &r) { return l.turn > r.turn; }
};

array<array<array<int, 4>, 60>, 60> memo2;

int main() 
{
  // Other code remains the same.
}
```

In the optimized program, I have replaced `std::vector` with `std::array` where possible. I have also replaced the three-dimensional `std::vector` with a three-dimensional `std::array`. The rest of the program remains the same. 

Note: This optimization might not significantly improve the performance of the program as the original program is quite complex and involves many computations and operations. To properly optimize such a program, a deeper understanding of the problem being solved and the logic of the program is required.
