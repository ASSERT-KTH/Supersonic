This C++ program is quite complex and encompasses a range of different functions and data structures. It seems to involve some sort of pathfinding or puzzle-solving algorithm. The primary areas for optimization would be in reducing redundant operations, avoiding unnecessary memory usage, and improving computational efficiency. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Use of Constants:** The program uses a large number of constant values repeatedly. Assigning these to named constants can improve readability and maintainability. For example, you could define a constant for 999999 and 4, which are used repeatedly in the program.

2. **Avoid Excessive Memory Usage:** The program uses a lot of memory to store intermediate results in the memo2 and field arrays. If possible, try to reduce the size of these arrays, or avoid storing intermediate results if they are not necessary.

3. **Avoid Redundant Operations:** The program contains many similar calculations and operations that are repeated in different parts of the code. Try to identify these and see if they can be replaced with a function or a loop.

4. **Streamline the Main Loop:** The main loop of the program is quite complex and contains a lot of nested loops and conditionals. Try to simplify this as much as possible, and avoid unnecessary computations.

Here is an optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;

const int dx[4] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
const int dy[4] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
const int dx2[4] = {-1, 0, 2, 1};
const int dy2[4] = {0, 2, 1, -1};
const int MAX_VALUE = 999999;
const int MAX_SIZE = 60;

struct aa {
  int x, y, turn;
};
struct bb {
  int kx, ky, opway, turn;
};

class Compare {
public:
  bool operator()(const bb &l, const bb &r) { return l.turn > r.turn; }
};

int memo2[MAX_SIZE][MAX_SIZE][4];

int getdis(const vector<vector<int>> &field, const int fx, const int fy, const int gx, const int gy) {
  int ans = MAX_VALUE;
  queue<aa> que;
  vector<vector<int>> memo(field.size(), vector<int>(field[0].size(), MAX_VALUE));
  que.push(aa{fx, fy, 0});
  // Remainder of getdis function...
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    // Reset memo2 array to MAX_VALUE
    fill(&memo2[0][0][0], &memo2[0][0][0] + sizeof(memo2), MAX_VALUE);
    int H, W;
    cin >> H >> W;
    if (!H) break;

    vector<vector<int>> field(H + 2, vector<int>(W + 2, true));
    priority_queue<bb, vector<bb>, Compare> que;

    // Remainder of main function...
    while (!que.empty()) {
      bb atop(que.top());
      que.pop();
      const int fkx = atop.kx;
      const int fky = atop.ky;
      const int fway = atop.opway;
      const int fturn = atop.turn;

      // Remainder of main function...
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program introduces a few key optimizations:

1. Introduced constants for repeated values to improve readability and maintainability.
2. Used the fill function from <algorithm> to reset the memo2 array to MAX_VALUE, which is more efficient and readable than the nested for-loops in the original code.
3. Removed the redundant initialization of the fkx, fky, fway, and fturn variables in the while loop in the main function. These variables are immediately overwritten by the values from the atop object, so the initial assignment is unnecessary.
4. Other parts of the code remain the same. Further optimization would require a deeper understanding of the logic and purpose of the program. Note that any optimization should be tested thoroughly to ensure it does not adversely affect the program's functionality.
