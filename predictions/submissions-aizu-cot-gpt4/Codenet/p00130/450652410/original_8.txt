The given program reads an input line and performs a certain operation based on the input. If it encounters "<-", it shifts the train array to the left and if it encounters "->", it shifts the train array to the right. It then prints the train array from the smallest index updated during the shifts.

The optimization which can be applied to this program is removing the redundant getchar() calls. The getchar() function reads the next available character from the screen and returns it as an integer. This number is then passed to the calling function. This function requires a lot of overhead and there are multiple calls to it in the program which can be reduced.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

const char NUL = '\0';

bool ope_line() {
  char train[52];
  int t = 25, s = 25;
  for (int i = 0; i < 52; ++i)
    train[i] = NUL;
  int a = getchar();
  int b, c;
  train[t] = a;
  while ((a = getchar()) != '\n' && a != EOF) {
    b = getchar();
    c = getchar();
    if (a == '<' && b == '-') {
      train[--t] = c;
      if (t < s)
        s = t;
    } else if (a == '-' && b == '>')
      train[++t] = c;
  }
  printf("%s\n", &train[s]);
  if (a == EOF)
    return false;
  return true;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int n;
  scanf("%d\n", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!ope_line())
      break;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization:
- Combined the assignment of 'a' and the while loop condition to reduce a getchar() call.
- Removed the redundant getchar() call after assignment of 'b' and 'c'. The next 'a' can be read directly in the while loop condition in the next iteration.
