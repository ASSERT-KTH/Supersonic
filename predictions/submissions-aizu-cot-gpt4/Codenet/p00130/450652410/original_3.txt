Here are a few optimization steps:

1. The getchar() function is slow and it takes a lot of time to read input from the buffer. Instead, we can use fgets() which is much faster as it reads a line at once.

2. The program uses a lot of getchar() calls which are not necessary. We can reduce them by using fgets() and then process the line character by character.

3. The printf() function is also slow compared to fputs().

4. We should avoid unnecessary memory allocation. In this case, the array "train" is allocated with 52 bytes, but it's possible that not all the space is used. So instead of initializing the array with NUL, we could just initialize the first element of the array with NUL and expand it as needed.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

bool ope_line() {
    char train[52];
    train[0] = '\0';
    int t = 25, s = 25;
    char line[1024];
    fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);
    char *ptr = line;
    char c = *ptr++;
    train[t] = c;
    char a = *ptr++;
    while (a != '\n' && a != EOF) {
        char b = *ptr++;
        c = *ptr++;
        if (a == '<' && b == '-') {
            train[--t] = c;
            if (t < s)
                s = t;
        } else if (a == '-' && b == '>') {
            train[++t] = c;
        }
        a = *ptr++;
    }
    fputs(&train[s], stdout);
    fputc('\n', stdout);
    if (a == EOF)
        return false;
    return true;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int n;
    scanf("%d\n", &n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (!ope_line())
            break;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Note: fgets() reads the newline character too, so you have to check for it when you process the line.
