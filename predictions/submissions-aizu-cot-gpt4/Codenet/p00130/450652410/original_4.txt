The given program seems to be simulating a train of characters moving along a one-dimensional track. The program reads a set of commands from the input and executes them. The commands are of the form "<-X" and "-X>", which move the train one step to the left or right respectively and append a character X to the train.

Here are some steps we can take to optimize the code:

1. We can remove the initialization of the 'train' array to '\0'. This is not necessary if we print only the valid segment of the array. This will save some time.

2. To avoid calling 'getchar()' so many times, we can read the entire line at once into a buffer using 'fgets()'. This could speed up the program by reducing the number of I/O operations.

3. We can use a pointer to keep track of the start of the valid segment of the 'train' array, instead of using the integer 's'. This will simplify the code and potentially speed it up slightly.

4. The 'if' statement inside the 'while' loop checks 'a' against '\n' and 'EOF' in every iteration even though 'a' does not change within the loop. We can move this check outside the loop to potentially speed up the program slightly.

5. Finally, we can make some minor changes to simplify the code and improve readability, such as removing the unnecessary 'NUL' constant.

Here is the optimized code:

```C
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

bool ope_line() {
  char train[52];
  char *start = &train[25];
  char *t = start;
  char line[5];
  while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin) && line[0] != '\n') {
    if (line[0] == '<' && line[1] == '-') {
      *(--t) = line[2];
      if (t < start)
        start = t;
    } else if (line[0] == '-' && line[1] == '>')
      *(++t) = line[2];
  }
  *++t = '\0'; // ensure null-termination
  printf("%s\n", start);
  return line[0] != '\n';
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int n;
  scanf("%d\n", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!ope_line())
      break;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimized code assumes that the input is well-formed and does not contain any invalid commands. If this is not the case, additional error checking code would be needed.
