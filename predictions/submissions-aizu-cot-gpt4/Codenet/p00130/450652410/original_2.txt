This code reads a series of commands from the input and modifies a "train" string based on these commands. The commands are either "<-" or "->", and they append a character to the left or right of the "train". After all commands for a line are processed, the resulting "train" string is printed.

Optimization Steps:

1. The first observation is that the 'train' array is always initialized with the null character. This is not necessary, as we only print the string starting from the first non-null character. Thus, we can remove the initialization loop.

2. The second optimization is about the use of getchar() function. This function is slow because it makes a system call every time it is invoked. Instead, we can read the whole line at once into a buffer using fgets() function, and then process the commands from this buffer.

3. The third optimization is regarding the if condition inside the while loop. Instead of checking the conditions (a == '<' && b == '-') and (a == '-' && b == '>') separately, we can merge them into a single condition by using bitwise operations. This can save some cycles because we do not need to evaluate both conditions every time.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#define MAX_COMMANDS 1000

bool ope_line() {
  char train[52], commands[MAX_COMMANDS];
  int t = 25, s = 25;
  if (fgets(commands, MAX_COMMANDS, stdin) == NULL) return false;
  int i = 0;
  char a = commands[i++];
  train[t] = a;
  while (true) {
    a = commands[i++];
    if (a == '\n' || a == EOF) break;
    int b = commands[i++];
    char c = commands[i++];
    if ((a ^ b) == ('<' ^ '-')) {
      if (a == '<') {
        train[--t] = c;
        if (t < s) s = t;
      } else train[++t] = c;
    }
  }
  printf("%s\n", &train[s]);
  return a != EOF;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int n;
  scanf("%d\n", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!ope_line())
      break;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that this optimized version assumes that the maximum number of commands per line is 1000 (defined by MAX_COMMANDS). If this is not the case, you should adjust this value accordingly.
