The program can be optimized as follows:

1. Buffer input: Instead of calling getchar() multiple times, buffer the input to reduce the number of system calls.

2. Avoid unnecessary assignments: In the original code, train[t] = c is executed before the while loop. However, it is also executed within the while loop. We can remove the first assignment to reduce redundancy. 

3. Use post-increment: In the original code, --t and ++t are used before assigning value to the array. This leads to an extra operation. Instead, we can use t-- and t++.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

const int BUF_SIZE = 1024;
const char NUL = '\0';

bool ope_line() {
  char train[52];
  int t = 25, s = 25;
  for (int i = 0; i < 52; ++i)
    train[i] = NUL;

  char buffer[BUF_SIZE];
  fgets(buffer, BUF_SIZE, stdin);

  int i = 0;
  while (buffer[i] != '\n' && buffer[i] != EOF) {
    if (buffer[i] == '<' && buffer[i+1] == '-') {
      train[t--] = buffer[i+2];
      if (t < s)
        s = t;
    } else if (buffer[i] == '-' && buffer[i+1] == '>')
      train[t++] = buffer[i+2];
    i+=3;
  }

  printf("%s\n", &train[s]);
  if (buffer[i] == EOF)
    return false;
  return true;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int n;
  scanf("%d\n", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!ope_line())
      break;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, fgets() is used to read the entire line from stdin at once and store it in buffer. Then we iterate over this buffer in the while loop. This reduces the number of system calls, which can be expensive in terms of time. The redundant assignment is removed, and post-increment and post-decrement are used to reduce the number of operations.
