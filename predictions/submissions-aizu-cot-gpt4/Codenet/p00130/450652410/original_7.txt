This program seems to be implementing a string editing mechanism using a train array to hold the characters. The optimization of this code can be done in several ways.

1. Reduce the number of calls to getchar(): The getchar() function is used multiple times in the program. Each call to getchar() performs a system call which is expensive in terms of time. Instead, we can read the entire line at once using fgets() and then process it.

2. Avoid repeated checks for EOF: It's better to check EOF once after reading the line. If EOF is encountered, you can break from the loop.

3. Avoid unnecessary checks in main(): There is a check in the main function to see if ope_line() returns false. This is unnecessary as we already handle the EOF case inside ope_line().

4. Avoid unnecessary printf(): To print the final result, we don't need to print each character individually. We can print the whole string at once using printf().

Now, let's implement these optimizations in the code.

```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

const char NUL = '\0';

bool ope_line() {
  char train[52];
  int t = 25, s = 25;
  for (int i = 0; i < 52; ++i)
    train[i] = NUL;
  char line[1024];
  if(fgets(line, 1024, stdin) == NULL)
    return false;
  int i = 0;
  while (line[i] != '\n' && line[i] != EOF) {
    if (line[i] == '<' && line[i+1] == '-') {
      train[--t] = line[i+2];
      if (t < s)
        s = t;
    } else if (line[i] == '-' && line[i+1] == '>')
      train[++t] = line[i+2];
    i+=3;
  }
  printf("%s\n", &train[s]);
  return true;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int n;
  scanf("%d\n", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    ope_line();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that fgets() reads until a newline character or EOF is encountered or until it has read one less than the number of characters specified by the second argument, whichever comes first. So if a line is more than 1024 characters, it will only read the first 1023 and leave the rest in the buffer. If this is not acceptable, you would need to add code to handle long lines.
