The program provided seems to be reading and processing a number of strings, using special symbols to determine how to build the output. The `ope_line` function is responsible for the main logic, and the `main` function drives the program.

Optimizations are possible in few places:

1. Avoiding unnecessary calls to `getchar()`. Instead of calling `getchar()` for each character, read an entire line into a buffer using `fgets()` and then iterate over the buffer. This can significantly reduce I/O operations and improve the program's speed.

2. The current program uses a fixed-size buffer `train[52]`, which might be larger than needed for most inputs. Dynamic memory allocation can be used to only allocate as much memory as needed.

3. Instead of using `printf` to print the result, we can use `puts`, which doesn't need to parse the format string and is generally faster.

Let's apply these optimizations to the program:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

bool ope_line() {
  char line[256];
  fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);
  
  int len = strlen(line);
  char *train = (char*)malloc(len);
  int t = len / 2, s = len / 2;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < len; i += 2) {
    char a = line[i];
    char b = line[i + 1];
    char c = line[i + 2];
    
    if (a == '<' && b == '-') {
      train[--t] = c;
      if (t < s)
        s = t;
    } else if (a == '-' && b == '>') {
      train[++t] = c;
    }
  }
  puts(&train[s]);
  free(train);
  
  if (feof(stdin))
    return false;
  return true;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int n;
  scanf("%d\n", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!ope_line())
      break;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Remember to always free dynamically allocated memory to avoid memory leaks. In this case, we allocate memory for `train` using `malloc` and free it after we're done using `free`.
