Firstly, it's important to note that `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` already includes the entire C++ Standard Library which includes `<algorithm>` and `<vector>`, so there's no need to include them separately. It'll save memory to remove these unnecessary includes. However, usage of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is also not recommended for production code due to its heavy load time and portability issues. It is preferred to include only those libraries which are actually used.

Secondly, variable `pai` is declared and assigned a value but is not used anywhere in the program, so we can remove it to save memory.

Thirdly, to improve the runtime efficiency, we can use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf()` and `printf()`, because `std::cin` and `std::cout` are faster and more type-safe.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;

    if (a > b)
        cout << "a > b\n";
    else if (a < b)
        cout << "a < b\n";
    else
        cout << "a == b\n";

    return 0;
}
```

This version of the program does the same as the previous one but uses less memory and should run faster.
