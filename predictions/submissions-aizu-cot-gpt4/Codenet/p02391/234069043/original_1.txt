Here are a few optimizations you can make:

1. Remove unused headers: You've included `<algorithm>`, `<bits/stdc++.h>`, and `<vector>` and are not using any of their functionalities. Removing these will reduce the memory usage.

2. Use `std::cout` and `std::cin` instead of `printf` and `scanf`: While `printf` and `scanf` are not inherently bad, it is generally considered better practice to use `std::cout` and `std::cin` in C++ for I/O operations.

3. Remove unused variable: You've declared the variable `pai` but it's never used in the program. So, you can remove this.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    
    if (a > b) {
        cout << "a > b\n";
    } else if (a < b) {
        cout << "a < b\n";
    } else {
        cout << "a == b\n";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimization doesn't impact the performance of this program significantly because the original program is very simple and doesn't contain any heavy computations or memory usage. These optimizations are mostly about following good practices and clean coding.
