The given program is fairly optimized already, but there are a few modifications that could be made:

1. The variable `pai` is declared but not used anywhere in the program. So, removing it would save memory.
2. Including the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library is generally not a good practice as it includes all standard libraries, which may affect the compile time. It's better to include only the libraries that you need.
3. The `<vector>` library is included but not used, so we can remove it.
4. The comparison of `a` and `b` can be done directly with `scanf` to save some memory.
5. We could use `puts` instead of `printf` for printing the string as no formatting is required. This could offer minor performance benefits.

Here is the optimized code:

```
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  if (a > b)
    puts("a > b");
  else if (a < b)
    puts("a < b");
  else
    puts("a == b");
  return 0;
}
```
