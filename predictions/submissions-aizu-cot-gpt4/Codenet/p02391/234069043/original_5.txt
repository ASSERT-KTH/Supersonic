Your program is quite efficient as it is, but I can suggest some minor improvements.

1. Remove unnecessary includes: You are including both <algorithm> and <vector>, but you do not use them in your code. So you can remove them.

2. Use <iostream> instead of <cstdio>: Although the difference in performance is practically negligible, <iostream> is generally considered more C++-like and it provides type safety.

3. Remove unused variable: You declare and initialize the variable "pai", but you do not use it in your code. Removing it would save a tiny amount of memory.

4. Use else without condition: At the end of your if-else chain you know that if the execution reaches that point, a must be equal to b, so you do not need to check it again.

Optimized code:
```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  if (a > b)
    cout << "a > b\n";
  else if (a < b)
    cout << "a < b\n";
  else
    cout << "a == b\n";
  return 0;
}
```
