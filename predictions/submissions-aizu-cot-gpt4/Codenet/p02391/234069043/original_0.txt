The program given is quite efficient, but there are still a few small optimizations that can be done:

1. The variable 'pai' is declared but not used anywhere in the program. We can remove it to save memory.

2. The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file includes almost all C++ standard libraries. Including this header file will increase the compile time, especially if your program doesn't use most of it, so it's better to only include what you need.

3. We can replace the multiple calls to `printf()` with a single call.

4. As a good coding practice, it's better to use `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input/output operations in C++, instead of `scanf()` and `printf()`.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  if (a > b)
    cout << "a > b\n";
  else if (a < b)
    cout << "a < b\n";
  else
    cout << "a == b\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program performs the same function as the original but is more efficient in terms of memory usage and compile time. It also follows better coding practices for C++.
