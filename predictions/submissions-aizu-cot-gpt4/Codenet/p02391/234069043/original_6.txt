The program is simple and quite efficient. However, there are a few possible optimizations:

1. "bits/stdc++.h" is a header file in GCC, and it includes almost all the standard libraries. This is redundant as we already have included "algorithm" and "vector". Including unnecessary headers increases the compilation time. Since we only use basic input/output functions, we can include "stdio.h" instead. 

2. 'pai' variable is declared but not used, we can remove that.

3. Instead of using multiple printf statements, we can use a single printf statement with a variable string in it.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  const char *result = (a > b) ? "a > b\n" : (a < b) ? "a < b\n" : "a == b\n";
  printf("%s", result);
  return 0;
}
```

In this version, we removed the unused variable 'pai' and the unnecessary headers and replaced the multiple print statements with a single one. The ternary operator (?:) provides a concise way to select one of two expressions based on the result of a condition. This can result in a minor speed improvement because it avoids the jump instructions associated with if-else constructs.
