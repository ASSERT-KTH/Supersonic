The current program is quite efficient, but there are a few steps we can take to make it slightly more optimal:

1. Remove `#include <algorithm>` and `#include <vector>`. These two libraries are not being used in the program and including them unnecessarily increases the compile time.
2. Remove `double pai = 3.141592653589;`. The variable `pai` is declared but not used anywhere in the program, which is a waste of memory.
3. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`. Although the speed difference is not significant, `cin` and `cout` are safer to use because they automatically check the type of the variables, reducing the chance of errors.
4. The `bits/stdc++.h` header file is a GCC specific library that includes most of the standard C++ libraries. While it is convenient for contests, it's not portable and can slow down the compilation process because it includes many unnecessary libraries. It's better to include only the necessary libraries. In this case, we only need `iostream`.

Now, let's modify the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  if (a > b)
    cout << "a > b\n";
  else if (a < b)
    cout << "a < b\n";
  else
    cout << "a == b\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program is a bit more efficient because it only includes the necessary libraries, doesn't declare unused variables, and uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output.
