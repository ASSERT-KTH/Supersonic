There are few things that can be optimized in this program:

1. The header files: `<algorithm>` and `<bits/stdc++.h>` are included but never used in the program. Removing unnecessary includes can speed up compile time and reduce the program's memory footprint.

2. The variable `pai` is declared but never used in the program. Removing unused variables can also reduce the memory footprint of the program.

3. The way we are comparing `a` and `b` can be simplified by using a ternary operator.

4. Instead of using `printf` and `scanf`, we can use `cout` and `cin` which are more C++ style and are safer.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  cout << (a > b ? "a > b" : (a < b ? "a < b" : "a == b")) << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, all unnecessary includes and unused variables have been removed. The comparison of `a` and `b` has been simplified using the ternary operator. This makes the program easier to read and understand. And finally, `cin` and `cout` are used for input and output respectively.
