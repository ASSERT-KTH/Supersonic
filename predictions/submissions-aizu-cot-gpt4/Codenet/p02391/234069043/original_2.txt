This program doesn't have a lot to optimize, as it's a quite simple and straightforward program. However, there are a few points that can be optimized:

1. The `<algorithm>` header isn't used in this program. It can be removed to reduce the compilation time.

2. The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header is a GCC-specific library that includes all standard C++ libraries. It can be replaced by only including the necessary headers, which should reduce both the compilation time and memory usage.

3. The `<vector>` library isn't used in this program. It can be removed as well.

4. The variable `pai` is defined but not used, so it can be removed to save space.

5. The standard function `scanf` and `printf` can be replaced by `cin` and `cout` for better type safety and simplicity.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  if (a > b)
    cout << "a > b\n";
  else if (a < b)
    cout << "a < b\n";
  else
    cout << "a == b\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program removes unnecessary library includes, takes advantage of C++ streams for input/output, and removes the unused variable, making it slightly more efficient in terms of both running time and memory usage.
