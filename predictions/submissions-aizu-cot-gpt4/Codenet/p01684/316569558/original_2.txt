This program has complex mathematical operations and several loops. Here are some suggested optimizations:

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is generally considered bad practice because it includes basically all standard library headers, which increases compilation time significantly. Instead, you should include only what you need. In this case, you can replace it with `#include <cmath>`, `#include <cstdio>`, and `#include <iostream>`.

2. The `REP` macro is not needed, it's better to use the for loop directly for better readability.

3. The `sq` function is used to calculate squares. This function can be inlined to reduce the overhead of function calls. 

4. The `judge` function checks if a circle is within a rectangle. This function can also be inlined to reduce the overhead of function calls.

5. For the `printf` statements, you are using the same format string twice. You can declare it as a constant to avoid duplication and optimize memory usage.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#define EPS 1e-4
using namespace std;

inline double sq(double x) { return x * x; }
inline bool judge(double x, double y, double r, double W, double H) {
  return x - r > -EPS && x + r < W + EPS && y - r > -EPS && y + r < H + EPS;
}

double calc(double ra, double rb, double s) {
  double lb = abs(ra - rb);
  double ub = ra + rb;
  for (int _ = 0; _ < 80; ++_) {
    // code unchanged
  }
  return ub;
}

bool solve(double W, double H, double sa, double sb, double sc, bool reversed) {
  // code unchanged
}

int main() {
  double W, H, sa, sb, sc;
  const char* format = "%.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f\n";
  while (cin >> W >> H >> sa >> sb >> sc && W > 0) {
    if (solve(W, H, sa, sb, sc, false)) {
      printf(format, xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb);
      continue;
    }
    if (solve(W, H, sb, sa, sc, true)) {
      printf(format, xb, yb, rb, xa, ya, ra);
      continue;
    }
    cout << "impossible" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations might not significantly improve the overall performance of this program because the main computational burden comes from the complex mathematical operations and iterative searching methods. Furthermore, the performance of a program also depends on the underlying hardware and operating system, so the actual performance improvement may vary.
