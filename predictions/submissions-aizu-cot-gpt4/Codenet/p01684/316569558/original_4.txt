First, let's examine the code and identify potential optimization points:

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` directive is generally discouraged as it includes all the standard library files which can increase compile time significantly.

2. The `REP` macro is used to replace a for loop. However, it's generally advisable to avoid macros in C++ as they are processed by the preprocessor and can cause hard-to-find bugs and reduce readability.

3. The `calc` function has a loop that runs 80 times. If this number is not strictly required, reducing it would decrease the running time.

4. The `judge`, `solve`, and `calc` functions are called repeatedly in the main function and within themselves. If the input to these functions doesn't change between calls, the results of these function calls could be stored and reused to save time. This technique is known as memoization.

5. The `solve` function uses a for loop to iterate over a small, fixed-size array. This could be unrolled to reduce the overhead of the loop.

6. The `printf` function is called multiple times with the same format string. This format string could be stored in a constant variable to avoid duplication.

7. The `assert` statements are used for debugging. If the program is thoroughly tested and confirmed to work as expected, these assert statements can be removed to improve performance.

8. In the `main` function, there are two `if` statements that check the result of `solve` function. If we can ensure that if the first call to `solve` is true, the second call will always be false, we can use an `else if` statement instead to avoid the unnecessary second call.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

const double EPS = 1e-4;

double calc(double ra, double rb, double s) {
  double lb = abs(ra - rb);
  double ub = ra + rb;
  for (int _ = 0; _ < 80; ++_) {
    double d = (lb + ub) / 2;
    double tha = acos((ra * ra + d * d - rb * rb) / (2.0 * d * ra));
    double thb = acos((rb * rb + d * d - ra * ra) / (2.0 * d * rb));
    double sum = ra * ra * tha + rb * rb * thb - ra * d * sin(tha);
    if (sum > s) {
      lb = d;
    } else {
      ub = d;
    }
  }
  return ub;
}

double sq(double x) { return x * x; }

bool judge(double x, double y, double r, double W, double H) {
  return x - r > -EPS && x + r < W + EPS && y - r > -EPS && y + r < H + EPS;
}

bool solve(double W, double H, double sa, double sb, double sc, bool reversed) {
  double ra = sqrt(sa / M_PI);
  double rb = sqrt(sb / M_PI);
  if (2.0 * ra > min(W, H) + EPS)
    return false;
  if (2.0 * rb > min(W, H) + EPS)
    return false;
  double D = calc(ra, rb, sc);
  double xa = ra;
  double ya = ra;
  double xb[] = {ra, rb, W - rb};
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    double dy = sqrt(sq(D) - sq(xa - xb[i]));
    for (int sign = -1; sign <= 1; sign += 2) {
      double yb = ya + sign * dy;
      if (judge(xb[i], yb, rb, W, H)) {
        if (!reversed) {
          printf("%.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f\n", xa, ya, ra, xb[i], yb, rb);
        } else {
          printf("%.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f\n", xb[i], yb, rb, xa, ya, ra);
        }
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  double yb[] = {ra, rb, H - rb};
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    double dx = sqrt(sq(D) - sq(ya - yb[i]));
    for (int sign = -1; sign <= 1; sign += 2) {
      double xb = xa + sign * dx;
      if (judge(xb, yb[i], rb, W, H)) {
        if (!reversed) {
          printf("%.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f\n", xa, ya, ra, xb, yb[i], rb);
        } else {
          printf("%.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f\n", xb, yb[i], rb, xa, ya, ra);
        }
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}

int main() {
  double W, H, sa, sb, sc;
  while (cin >> W >> H >> sa >> sb >> sc && W > 0) {
    if (solve(W, H, sa, sb, sc, false))
      continue;
    else if (solve(W, H, sb, sa, sc, true))
      continue;
    else
      cout << "impossible" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
