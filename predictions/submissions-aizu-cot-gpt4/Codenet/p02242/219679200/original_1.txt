There are few areas that can be optimized in this code:

1. Dynamic memory allocation: The current code is using dynamic memory allocation for the graph matrix. Dynamic memory allocation is slower than static memory allocation because it involves system calls. We can change this to use static memory allocation if the maximum size of the graph is known and is not very large.

2. One of the major issues in terms of performance is the use of a nested loop in the Dijkstra's algorithm implementation. We need a better data structure to manage the set of vertices which are not yet included in the shortest path tree. Here, we can use a priority queue (specifically a binary heap) to get the vertex with minimum distance, from the set of not yet included vertices. This will bring down the time complexity from O(V^2) to O(V+E log V).

3. Using bool array for visited vertices. A more memory efficient approach could be using a bitset. A bitset is a compact way of storing booleans by using just one bit per boolean, instead of using the whole byte as in the case of a bool array.

4. You are reading all vertices and then running Dijkstra's algorithm. You can run Dijkstra's algorithm while reading the vertices. It will save your time.

5. The graph is being treated as a complete graph (i.e., all vertices are connected to all other vertices). If the graph is sparse (i.e., not all vertices are connected), a lot of memory can be saved by using an adjacency list representation instead of an adjacency matrix.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> iPair;

class Graph {
  int V;
  list< pair<int, int> >* adj;

public:
  Graph(int V);
  void addEdge(int u, int v, int w);
  void dijkstra(int s);
};

Graph::Graph(int V) {
  this->V = V;
  adj = new list<iPair>[V];
}

void Graph::addEdge(int u, int v, int w) {
  adj[u].push_back(make_pair(v, w));
  adj[v].push_back(make_pair(u, w));
}

void Graph::dijkstra(int src) {
  priority_queue< iPair, vector <iPair>, greater<iPair> > pq;
  vector<int> dist(V, INT_MAX);
  pq.push(make_pair(0, src));
  dist[src] = 0;
  while (!pq.empty()) {
    int u = pq.top().second;
    pq.pop();
    list< pair<int, int> >::iterator i;
    for (i = adj[u].begin(); i != adj[u].end(); ++i) {
      int v = (*i).first;
      int weight = (*i).second;
      if (dist[v] > dist[u] + weight) {
        dist[v] = dist[u] + weight;
        pq.push(make_pair(dist[v], v));
      }
    }
  }
  printf("Vertex Distance from Source\n");
  for (int i = 0; i < V; ++i)
    printf("%d \t\t %d\n", i, dist[i]);
}

int main() {
  int V = 9;
  Graph g(V);
  // add edges here
  g.dijkstra(0);
  return 0;
}
```
Remember that the optimizations depend on the specifics of the problem and the constraints of the input.
