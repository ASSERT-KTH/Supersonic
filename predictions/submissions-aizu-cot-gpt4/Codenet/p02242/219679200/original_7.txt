This program is a representation of a graph data structure and its operations. It uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path to all vertices from the vertex at position 0. It uses dynamic memory allocation to create a 2D matrix of the graph and an array for distances from the initial vertex.

Optimization steps:

1. Use `std::vector<uint>` instead of dynamically allocated array for `g_` and `dist`. Using `std::vector` is safer and easier to manage than a raw pointer. They automatically deallocate memory when they are no longer in use, reducing the chance of memory leaks. Also, it reduces the amount of code you write, thus making it more maintainable.

2. Declaration of a bool array `visited` in the `dijkstra` method uses Variable Length Array (VLA) feature which is not a standard C++ feature. It is better to replace the bool array with `std::vector<bool>`. This will make the code portable across different compilers.

3. Use `std::vector<bool>::iterator` instead of `unsigned int` for the variable `i` in the `dijkstra` method. This iterator will point to the next unvisited node with the minimum distance. It is more efficient to use an iterator instead of an index for traversing and manipulating elements in a container.

4. Use `std::min_element` and `std::distance` functions to find the index of the next unvisited node with the minimum distance. This will eliminate the need for the inner loop, making the code more readable and slightly faster.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using uint = unsigned int;
class Graph {
  const uint n_;
  std::vector<uint> g_;
  const uint INFINIT;

public:
  Graph(uint n)
      : n_(n), g_(n*n_, 100000 * (n - 1) + 1), INFINIT(100000 * (n - 1) + 1) {
  }
  uint *operator[](uint i) { return &g_[n_ * i]; }
  void dijkstra(std::vector<uint>& dist) {
    dist.assign(n_, INFINIT);
    std::vector<bool> visited(n_, false);
    auto i = 0u;
    visited[i] = true;
    dist[i] = 0u;
    for (auto n = 0u; n < n_ - 1; ++n) {
      auto base_dist = dist[i];
      for (auto j = 0u; j < n_; ++j) {
        if (!visited[j])
          dist[j] = std::min(dist[j], base_dist + g_[i*n_ + j]);
      }
      auto min_itr = std::min_element(dist.begin(), dist.end());
      i = std::distance(dist.begin(), min_itr);
      visited[i] = true;
      dist[i] = *min_itr;
    }
  }
};
int main() {
  uint n;
  std::scanf("%u", &n);
  Graph g(n);
  uint u, k, c, v;
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    std::scanf("%u %u", &u, &k);
    for (auto j = 0u; j < k; ++j) {
      std::scanf("%u %u", &c, &v);
      g[u][c] = v;
    }
  }
  std::vector<uint> dist;
  g.dijkstra(dist);
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    std::printf("%u %u\n", i, dist[i]);
  }
}
```
The optimized code uses standard C++ features and libraries, making it portable and efficient.
