The given code is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. While the code is generally efficient, there are a few small improvements that could be made:

1. Avoid unnecessary calculations: In the dijkstra function, the calculation of the base distance (`base_dist + es[j]`) is performed for every node, even if the node has already been visited. However, this is redundant for visited nodes, because their distance will never be updated again. So, we should move this calculation inside the condition that checks if the node has not been visited.

2. Reuse variables: The variable `cur_min` is recalculated in each iteration of the outer loop in the dijkstra function. However, this variable could be reused from one iteration to the next, because it is always set to the minimum distance found in the previous iteration.

3. Use faster input/output methods: The `std::scanf` and `std::printf` functions are slower than their counterparts in the `iostream` library. We can replace them with `std::cin` and `std::cout` for faster input/output.

Here's how the optimized code would look:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using uint = unsigned int;
class Graph {
  const uint n_;
  uint *const g_;
  const uint INFINIT;

public:
  Graph(uint n)
      : n_(n), g_(new uint[n_ * n_]), INFINIT(100000 * (n_ - 1) + 1) {
    std::fill_n(g_, n_ * n_, INFINIT);
  }
  ~Graph() { delete[] g_; }
  uint *operator[](uint i) const { return g_ + (n_ * i); }
  void dijkstra(uint *dist) {
    std::fill_n(dist, n_, INFINIT);
    bool visited[n_];
    std::fill_n(visited, n_, false);
    auto i = 0u;
    visited[i] = true;
    dist[i] = 0u;
    for (auto n = 0u; n < n_ - 1; ++n) {
      auto cur_min = INFINIT;
      auto es = (*this)[i];
      auto base_dist = dist[i];
      for (auto j = 0u; j < n_; ++j) {
        if (!visited[j]) {
          dist[j] = std::min(dist[j], base_dist + es[j]);
          if (cur_min > dist[j]) {
            cur_min = dist[j];
            i = j;
          }
        }
      }
      visited[i] = true;
      dist[i] = cur_min;
    }
  }
};
int main() {
  uint n;
  std::cin >> n;
  Graph g(n);
  uint u, k, c, v;
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> u >> k;
    for (auto j = 0u; j < k; ++j) {
      std::cin >> c >> v;
      g[u][c] = v;
    }
  }
  uint dist[n];
  g.dijkstra(dist);
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cout << i << " " << dist[i] << "\n";
  }
}
```
Please note that the optimization might not be significant as the Dijkstra algorithm itself has a time complexity of O(n^2) which could be improved using priority queue with time complexity being O((n+m)logn) where m is the number of edges. But the changes would be significant and not comply with the small modification requirement.
