Firstly, the input arrays S and T are being read from standard input. This process could be slow if the data is large. If the data is not required to be read from the standard input, we could use faster methods of inputting data such as reading from a file.

Secondly, the code uses a naive approach to count the number of elements in T that are present in S, which has a time complexity of O(n*q). This is not efficient if both n and q are large. We can use a hash table to store the elements of S, and then for each element in T, check if it's in the hash table. This approach reduces the time complexity to O(n + q).

Thirdly, the program uses two large arrays S and T to store the input data. If the data is not required to be stored in arrays, we can save memory by reading the input data one by one and processing them immediately instead of storing them in arrays.

Lastly, the program uses a lot of global variables, which can make the program harder to understand and maintain. We can reduce the number of global variables by moving them into the functions where they are used.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  int n, q, i, cnt = 0;
  std::unordered_set<int> S;

  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int s;
    scanf("%d", &s);
    S.insert(s);
  }

  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    int t;
    scanf("%d", &t);
    if (S.find(t) != S.end()) {
      cnt++;
    }
  }

  printf("%d\n", cnt);
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized program reads the input data one by one and processes them immediately instead of storing them in arrays, uses a hash table to count the number of elements in T that are present in S, and reduces the number of global variables.
