This program is reading two arrays from input, then counting how many elements in the second array are found in the first array. The time complexity of the program is O(n*q), where n is the size of the first array and q is the size of the second array. This is because for each element in the second array, it checks all elements in the first array.

Optimization steps:

1. We could sort the first array. This will take O(n*log n) time.

2. Then for each element in the second array, we could use binary search to look for it in the first array. Binary search takes O(log n) time. So this step will take O(q*log n) time.

3. Therefore, the total time complexity will be O(n*log n + q*log n), which is better than the original O(n*q) if n and q are large and roughly equal.

4. Memory usage is not optimized in this case, as the original program already has optimal memory usage.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int n, S[10000], q, T[500], i, j, cnt = 0;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (j = 0; j < q; j++)
    scanf("%d", &T[j]);
  std::sort(S, S+n);
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++)
    if (std::binary_search(S, S+n, T[i]))
      cnt++;
  printf("%d\n", cnt);
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, the `std::sort` function is used to sort the first array, and the `std::binary_search` function is used to check if an element is in the sorted array. Note that the `<algorithm>` header is included to use these functions.
