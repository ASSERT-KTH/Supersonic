The given program reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` integers into array `S`, then an integer `q`, followed by `q` integers into array `T`. It then counts how many elements in `T` are also in `S`.

Here's a few optimizations that we can do to the program:

1. **Use `bool` array to mark the presence of a number in `S`**: Instead of iterating through `S` for each element in `T`, we can use a `bool` array `exists` of size `max_num+1` (`max_num` is the maximum possible number that can be in `S` or `T`). For each number `num` in `S`, we can mark `exists[num] = true`. Then, for each number `num` in `T`, if `exists[num]` is `true`, increment `cnt`.

2. **Remove unnecessary array `T`**: We can read each number `num` in `T` and immediately check if `exists[num]` is `true`. We don't need to store all numbers in `T` in an array and process them later.

3. **Use `fast I/O` methods instead of `scanf` and `printf`**: `scanf` and `printf` are slower than some alternative methods of input and output. We can use `getchar_unlocked` for input and `putchar_unlocked` for output.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX_NUM 1000000

bool exists[MAX_NUM+1] = {false};

inline void fastRead_int(int &x) {
    register int c = getchar_unlocked();
    x = 0;
    for (; ((c<48 || c>57)); c = getchar_unlocked());
    for (; c>47 && c<58; c = getchar_unlocked()) {
        x = (x<<1) + (x<<3) + c - 48;
    }
}

inline void fastWrite_int(int x) {
    register char buffor[35];
    register int i=0;
    do {
       buffor[i++]=(x%10)+'0';
       x/=10;
    } while(x);
    i--;
    while (i >= 0) putchar_unlocked(buffor[i--]);
    putchar_unlocked('\n');
}

int main() {
  int n, num, q, cnt = 0;

  fastRead_int(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    fastRead_int(num);
    exists[num] = true;
  }

  fastRead_int(q);
  for (int j = 0; j < q; j++) {
    fastRead_int(num);
    if (exists[num]) cnt++;
  }

  fastWrite_int(cnt);
  return 0;
}
```

However, please note that this optimization assumes that the maximum possible number that can be in `S` or `T` is not too large (defined by `MAX_NUM`), otherwise the `exists` array would be too large. The `fast I/O` methods also may not work properly on some IDEs or online judges that do not support `getchar_unlocked` and `putchar_unlocked`.
