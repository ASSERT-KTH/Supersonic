The given program reads two arrays, `S` and `T`, from the standard input, and then counts the number of elements in `T` that are also present in `S`.

To optimize the program, we can use the following strategies:

1. Use `std::unordered_set` instead of array `S`: `std::unordered_set` in C++ has an average time complexity of O(1) for search operations, as opposed to O(n) for an array. This will significantly reduce the time needed to check if an element from `T` is in `S`.

2. Reduce the size of array `T`: Since we're only using `T` to check if its elements exist in `S`, we don't need to read all of `T` into memory at once. Instead, we can read each element of `T` one by one, check if it's in `S`, and then discard it.

3. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This can make I/O operations faster by unsynchronizing C++'s I/O streams (`std::cin`, `std::cout`) with C's (`scanf`, `printf`).

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  
  int n, q, temp, cnt = 0;
  std::unordered_set<int> S;

  std::cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> temp;
    S.insert(temp);
  }

  std::cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    std::cin >> temp;
    if (S.count(temp)) {
      ++cnt;
    }
  }

  std::cout << cnt << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this program is in C++. As it uses `std::unordered_set` and `std::cin`/`std::cout`, it cannot be translated back into C.
