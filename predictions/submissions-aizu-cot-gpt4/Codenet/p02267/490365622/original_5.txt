This program is a simple one that reads two arrays of integers from the input and then counts how many elements in the second array are present in the first array. The optimization can be done by reducing the time complexity of the program.

Currently, the program has a time complexity of O(n*q) because it uses a nested loop to search for each element of T in S. This can be optimized by using a different data structure to hold the elements of S, such as a hash set, which allows for O(1) lookups on average.

However, since you asked for small modifications and not to entirely rewrite the code, we can improve the inner loop by adding a flag variable. When we find a match, we break the loop, but we don't know whether a match was found or not in the outer loop. By using a flag, we can break the outer loop as well if a match is found, avoiding unnecessary iterations.

Optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int n, S[10000], q, T[500], i, j, cnt = 0, flag = 0;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (j = 0; j < q; j++)
    scanf("%d", &T[j]);
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    flag = 0;
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      if (T[i] == S[j]) {
        cnt++;
        flag = 1;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (flag == 1) {
      break;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", cnt);
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this optimization will improve the program's performance in the cases where a match is found, but if no match is found, the program will still have a time complexity of O(n*q). If you want to optimize this further, consider using a data structure like a hash set or sorted array for S which would allow faster searching.
