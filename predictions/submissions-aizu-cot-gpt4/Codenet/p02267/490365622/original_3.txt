Optimization Steps:

1. Use a data structure better suited for searching: The nested loop structure suggests that for each element in array T[], the program is searching for it in the array S[]. This operation takes O(n) time for each element in T[], resulting in O(n*q) time complexity in total. This can be optimized by using a data structure better suited for search operations. A hash set (in C++ STL, `unordered_set`) is a good choice here. It has O(1) average time complexity for search operations.

2. Avoid unnecessary memory usage: The program is currently storing all the elements of T[] in an array before starting the search operation. This is unnecessary and can be optimized by directly searching for the element in the hash set immediately after reading it.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
int main() {
  int n, q, temp, cnt = 0;
  std::unordered_set<int> S;
  std::cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> temp;
    S.insert(temp);
  }
  std::cin >> q;
  for (int j = 0; j < q; j++) {
    std::cin >> temp;
    if (S.find(temp) != S.end()) {
      cnt++;
    }
  }
  std::cout << cnt << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program has O(n+q) time complexity and O(n) space complexity, which is a significant improvement over the original program. 

Please note that this solution uses C++ Standard Template Library (STL), which is not available in C. In C, implementation of hash set requires more complex code using structures and hashing functions.
