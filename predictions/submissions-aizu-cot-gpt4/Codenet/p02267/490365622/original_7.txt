This program counts how many numbers in array T are also in array S. The nested loop is the main problem here, it has a time complexity of O(n*q). We can optimize it using a different approach.

Step 1: Instead of using arrays, we can use a data structure called unordered_set. This data structure has an average time complexity of O(1) for search, insert, and delete operations.

Step 2: We insert all numbers in array S into the set.

Step 3: We iterate over the array T and for each number, we check if it exists in the set. If it does, we increase the counter.

Step 4: The time complexity of this approach is O(n + q), which is much better than the previous one.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
    int n, q, cnt = 0;
    std::unordered_set<int> S;
    std::cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int x;
        std::cin >> x;
        S.insert(x);
    }
    std::cin >> q;
    for (int j = 0; j < q; ++j) {
        int x;
        std::cin >> x;
        if (S.find(x) != S.end()) {
            ++cnt;
        }
    }
    std::cout << cnt << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

This code is now optimized for running time. However, keep in mind that while unordered_set has a better average time complexity, it might use more memory than arrays. This is a trade-off between time and space.
