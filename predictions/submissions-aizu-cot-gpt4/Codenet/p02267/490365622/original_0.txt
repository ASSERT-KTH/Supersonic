The program above is a simple C/C++ program that reads two arrays from input and counts the number of elements in the second array that also exist in the first array.

The main performance issue here is in the nested loops that compare each element of the second array against each element of the first array. This results in a time complexity of O(n*q), which is suboptimal.

One way to optimize this program is to sort the first array S[] and then use binary search for each element of the second array T[]. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), which would make the overall time complexity of the program O(q log n) instead of O(n*q). This is a significant improvement if n and q are large.

The space complexity of the program is not an issue here, as it only uses a fixed amount of space to store the input arrays. The size of these arrays is determined by the input, so we can't optimize it without changing the problem.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <algorithm>

int binarySearch(int arr[], int l, int r, int x) {
  while (l <= r) {
    int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
    if (arr[m] == x)
      return 1;
    if (arr[m] < x)
      l = m + 1;
    else
      r = m - 1;
  }
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  int n, S[10000], q, T[500], i, j, cnt = 0;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  std::sort(S, S+n);  // sort the array S
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (j = 0; j < q; j++)
    scanf("%d", &T[j]);
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++)
    if (binarySearch(S, 0, n-1, T[i]))  // binary search for each element of T in S
      cnt++;
  printf("%d\n", cnt);
  return 0;
}
```

Note that this optimization assumes that the sort operation and the binary search operation are faster than the original nested loop operation for the input sizes you're dealing with. For very small inputs, the overhead of the sort and binary search operations may actually make this version slower. However, for large inputs, this version should be significantly faster.
