Ok, we can optimize the given C++ program by taking the following steps:

1. Avoid Creating Multiple Keys: In the current implementation, you're creating the same key multiple times when you call `mp.count(make_pair(vi, used))` and `mp[make_pair(vi, used)]`. We can optimize this by creating the key once and reusing it.

2. Avoid Creating Unnecessary Vectors: In the `search` function, we create new vectors `a` and `b` in each iteration of the loop that searches for elements in `vi`. Instead, we can just count the number of '0's and '1's without actually storing the elements in new vectors.

3. Reserve Vector Space: When we know the possible size of a vector beforehand, we can use the `reserve` function to preallocate the required memory. This can significantly speed up the program by avoiding reallocations.

4. Pass Vector by Reference, not by Value: In the current implementation, the vector `vi` is passed by value to the `search` function, which means a new copy of the vector is created each time the function is called. By passing the vector by reference, we can avoid this unnecessary copying.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
map<pair<vector<int>, int>, int> mp;
string qes[128];
int search(vector<int> &vi, int depth, int used, int m, int n) {
  pair<vector<int>, int> key = make_pair(vi, used);
  if (mp.count(key))
    return mp[key];
  if (vi.size() > (1 << (m - depth)))
    return 100;
  if (vi.size() == 1)
    return depth;
  int res = 100;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    if ((used >> i) & 1)
      continue;
    int a_count = 0, b_count = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < vi.size(); j++) {
      if (qes[vi[j]][i] == '0')
        a_count++;
      else
        b_count++;
    }
    if (a_count == 0 || b_count == 0)
      continue;
    vector<int> a, b;
    a.reserve(a_count);
    b.reserve(b_count);
    for (int j = 0; j < vi.size(); j++) {
      if (qes[vi[j]][i] == '0')
        a.push_back(vi[j]);
      else
        b.push_back(vi[j]);
    }
    res = min(res, max(search(a, depth + 1, used | (1 << i), m, n),
                       search(b, depth + 1, used | (1 << i), m, n)));
  }
  return mp[key] = res;
}
int main() {
  int m, n;
  while (cin >> m >> n, m) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> qes[i];
    vector<int> vi(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      vi[i] = i;
    mp.clear();
    cout << search(vi, 0, 0, m, n) << endl;
  }
}
```

This optimized code performs the same task as the original but is more efficient in terms of memory usage and running time.
