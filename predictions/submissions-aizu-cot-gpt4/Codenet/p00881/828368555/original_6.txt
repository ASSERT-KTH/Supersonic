The given code is a C++ program that uses recursion and backtracking to solve a problem. It seems to perform some sort of search operation on a decision tree, where each node represents a vector of indices and a bitmask representing which decisions have been made.

Here are the possible optimizations:

1. Avoid repeated computation: The current program computes `make_pair(vi, used)` twice if the pair is not found in `mp`. This can be optimized by storing the result in a variable and reusing it.

2. Reduce the number of vector construction: The code constructs two vectors, `a` and `b`, for each iteration of the inner loop and they are used only in the recursive calls. We can optimize this by reusing the same vectors and clearing them before use.

Here is the optimized code with the above suggestions applied:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

map<pair<vector<int>, int>, int> mp;
string qes[128];

int search(vector<int> &vi, int depth, int used, int m, int n) {
  pair<vector<int>, int> p = make_pair(vi, used);
  if (mp.count(p))
    return mp[p];
  if (vi.size() > (1 << (m - depth)))
    return 100;
  if (vi.size() == 1)
    return depth;
  int res = 100;
  vector<int> a, b;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    if ((used >> i) & 1)
      continue;
    a.clear(); b.clear();
    for (int j = 0; j < vi.size(); j++) {
      if (qes[vi[j]][i] == '0')
        a.push_back(vi[j]);
      else
        b.push_back(vi[j]);
    }
    if (a.empty() || b.empty())
      continue;
    res = min(res, max(search(a, depth + 1, used | (1 << i), m, n),
                       search(b, depth + 1, used | (1 << i), m, n)));
  }
  return mp[p] = res;
}

int main() {
  int m, n;
  while (cin >> m >> n, m) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> qes[i];
    vector<int> vi(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      vi[i] = i;
    mp.clear();
    cout << search(vi, 0, 0, m, n) << endl;
  }
}
