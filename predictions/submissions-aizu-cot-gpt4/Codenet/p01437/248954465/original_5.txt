This program seems to be solving some sort of pathfinding problem. The goal of the optimization here would be to reduce unnecessary memory usage and improve the running speed of the program.

Here are the points for optimization:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: It includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which increases the compilation time. Include only those headers which are required.

2. Avoid global variables if they can be passed as parameters: It's generally a bad practice to use global variables as they can lead to confusing and hard-to-debug code. In this case, `H`, `W`, `L`, `C`, `nxt`, `tmp`, `vy`, `vx`, `sx`, `sy`, `sv` are defined globally but it seems like they could be passed as parameters or defined where needed.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std`: It's also generally considered bad practice because it can lead to name conflicts.

4. Replace `endl` with `\n`: `endl` flushes the output buffer every time it's used, which can make a program run slower. Using `\n` instead can improve the speed of the program.

5. Replace recursive function with iterative one if possible: Recursive functions may cause stack overflow for large inputs. Instead, you can use a stack or queue to implement a non-recursive (iterative) version of the function.

6. Use `std::vector` instead of C-style arrays: C-style arrays can lead to memory overflow issues, while `std::vector` manages memory automatically.

7. Avoid calling expensive functions inside a loop: Here, `std::find` is called inside a nested loop. It can be optimized.

8. Use `std::array` instead of C-style arrays for `vy` and `vx`.

Please note that the degree of optimization implemented depends on your specific requirements and constraints. For example, if memory usage is a more critical consideration than running time, it might be necessary to limit the use of data structures like `std::vector` that use more memory for the sake of convenience and safety.

Here is the optimized code after considering the above points:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <array>
#include <cstring>

typedef long long int64;

void dfs(int x, int y, int v, int64 step, const std::array<int, 4>& vx, const std::array<int, 4>& vy,
         const std::string& tmp, std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<int64>>>& nxt, 
         const std::vector<std::string>& C, int H, int W) {
  int nx = x + vx[v], ny = y + vy[v], nv = (v + 1) % 4;
  if (step == 0) {
    std::cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << " " << tmp[v] << '\n';
    return;
  } else if (0 <= nx && 0 <= ny && nx < W && ny < H && C[ny][nx] != '#') {
    int64 loop = ~nxt[nx][ny][v] ? nxt[x][y][v] - nxt[nx][ny][v] + 1 : step;
    nxt[nx][ny][v] = nxt[x][y][v] + 1;
    return (dfs(nx, ny, v, (step - 1) % loop, vx, vy, tmp, nxt, C, H, W));
  } else {
    nxt[x][y][nv] = nxt[x][y][v];
    return (dfs(x, y, nv, step, vx, vy, tmp, nxt, C, H, W));
  }
}

int main() {
  const std::array<int, 4> vy = {-1, 0, 1, 0}, vx = {0, 1, 0, -1};
  const std::string tmp = "NESW";
  int H, W, sx, sy, sv;
  int64 L;
  while (std::cin >> H >> W >> L, H) {
    std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<int64>>> nxt(W, std::vector<std::vector<int64>>(H, std::vector<int64>(4, -1)));
    std::vector<std::string> C(H);
    for (int i = 0; i < H; i++) {
      std::cin >> C[i];
      for (int j = 0; j < W; j++) {
        int p = tmp.find(C[i][j]);
        if (p != std::string::npos)
          sx = j, sy = i, sv = p;
      }
    }
    nxt[sx][sy][sv] = 0;
    dfs(sx, sy, sv, L, vx, vy, tmp, nxt, C, H, W);
  }
}
```
Please note that the full optimization (for example replacing recursion with iteration) may require a complete rewrite of the code which is not asked for in this task.
