This program appears to be well-optimized in terms of the algorithm it uses, but there are some small changes that we can make that might improve its performance slightly.

1) We can reduce the number of calls to the `dfs` function by removing the `return` statements. This is a minor optimization but it can save some function call overhead.

2) The `tmp` string and `vx`, `vy` arrays are constants and should be declared as `constexpr`. This will allow the compiler to perform some optimizations, such as replacing uses of these variables with their constant values.

3) We can change the `while (cin >> H >> W >> L, H)` loop condition to `while (cin >> H >> W >> L && H)` to make it clearer and potentially more efficient. The comma operator `,` in C++ has lower precedence than `&&`, so the original condition is equivalent to `(cin >> H >> W >> L), H`. This means that `H` is the actual condition for the `while` loop, and the input operation is always performed regardless of the value of `H`. If the value of `H` is 0, we don't need to read `W` and `L`, so using `&&` instead of `,` can potentially save some unnecessary input operations.

Here's the optimized code based on the steps above:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
constexpr string tmp = "NESW";
constexpr int vy[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0}, vx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int H, W;
int64 L;
string C[100];
int sx, sy, sv;
int64 nxt[100][100][4];
void dfs(int x, int y, int v, int64 step) {
  int nx = x + vx[v], ny = y + vy[v], nv = (v + 1) % 4;
  if (step == 0) {
    cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << " " << tmp[v] << endl;
  } else if (0 <= nx && 0 <= ny && nx < W && ny < H && C[ny][nx] != '#') {
    int64 loop = ~nxt[nx][ny][v] ? nxt[x][y][v] - nxt[nx][ny][v] + 1 : step;
    nxt[nx][ny][v] = nxt[x][y][v] + 1;
    dfs(nx, ny, v, (step - 1) % loop);
  } else {
    nxt[x][y][nv] = nxt[x][y][v];
    dfs(x, y, nv, step);
  }
}
int main() {
  while (cin >> H >> W >> L && H) {
    memset(nxt, -1, sizeof(nxt));
    for (int i = 0; i < H; i++) {
      cin >> C[i];
      for (int j = 0; j < W; j++) {
        int p = tmp.find(C[i][j]);
        if (p != string::npos)
          sx = j, sy = i, sv = p;
      }
    }
    nxt[sx][sy][sv] = 0;
    dfs(sx, sy, sv, L);
  }
}
```
Please note that the optimization effect of these steps may be minimal and not noticeable in most cases. It depends on the specific input data and the compiler's optimization level.
