The code you posted is quite complex, but there are several areas that could be optimized.

1. Using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is quite heavy as it includes all the standard C++ libraries which increases the compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Using `using namespace std;`: This line is generally considered bad practice as it introduces the entire std namespace into your program which could potentially lead to name conflicts. It's better to use the std:: prefix when needed.

3. Using `typedef long long int64;` and `int64 L;`: This could be replaced with `long long L;` for simplicity and clarity.

4. Global variables: The use of global variables should be minimized as they can lead to code that is hard to understand and debug. In your code, the variables `H`, `W`, `L`, `C`, `sx`, `sy`, `sv`, `nxt` are all global. It would be better to pass these as parameters to the functions that need them or wrap them in a class.

5. Using `memset(nxt, -1, sizeof(nxt));`: This is a C-style way to initialize the array. In C++, it's better to use std::fill or std::fill_n.

6. Variable naming: The variable names are not descriptive which makes the code hard to read and understand. Itâ€™s better to use descriptive names for variables.

7. The `dfs` function is a recursive and doesn't have a base case which can lead to stack overflow for large inputs. It would be better to implement it in an iterative way.

Here's the optimized version of your code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

void dfs(int x, int y, int v, long long step, std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<long long>>>& nxt, const std::vector<std::string>& C, const std::vector<int>& vx, const std::vector<int>& vy, const std::string& tmp, int H, int W) {
  int nx = x + vx[v], ny = y + vy[v], nv = (v + 1) % 4;
  if (step == 0) {
    std::cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << " " << tmp[v] << std::endl;
    return;
  } else if (0 <= nx && 0 <= ny && nx < W && ny < H && C[ny][nx] != '#') {
    long long loop = ~nxt[nx][ny][v] ? nxt[x][y][v] - nxt[nx][ny][v] + 1 : step;
    nxt[nx][ny][v] = nxt[x][y][v] + 1;
    return dfs(nx, ny, v, (step - 1) % loop, nxt, C, vx, vy, tmp, H, W);
  } else {
    nxt[x][y][nv] = nxt[x][y][v];
    return dfs(x, y, nv, step, nxt, C, vx, vy, tmp, H, W);
  }
}

int main() {
  const std::string tmp = "NESW";
  const std::vector<int> vy = {-1, 0, 1, 0}, vx = {0, 1, 0, -1};
  int H, W, sx, sy, sv;
  long long L;
  while (std::cin >> H >> W >> L, H) {
    std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<long long>>> nxt(100, std::vector<std::vector<long long>>(100, std::vector<long long>(4, -1)));
    std::vector<std::string> C(H);
    for (int i = 0; i < H; i++) {
      std::cin >> C[i];
      for (int j = 0; j < W; j++) {
        int p = tmp.find(C[i][j]);
        if (p != std::string::npos)
          sx = j, sy = i, sv = p;
      }
    }
    nxt[sx][sy][sv] = 0;
    dfs(sx, sy, sv, L, nxt, C, vx, vy, tmp, H, W);
  }
  return 0;
}
