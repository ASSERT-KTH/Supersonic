This program is already heavily optimized. It uses complex numbers, typedefs, macros, and pre-defined constants for optimization. However, there are still some minor areas where we can optimize it:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: It includes more than we need, which slows down the compilation process. We should only include the necessary libraries, like `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`, `#include <cmath>`, etc.

2. Use `constexpr` instead of `const` for constant expressions: `constexpr` tells the compiler to evaluate the value of the expression at compile time.

3. Use prefix increment `++k` instead of postfix `k++` for non-primitive types as it avoids unnecessary temporary object creation.

4. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to turn off synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams, which can significantly speed up input/output operations.

5. Avoid using `using namespace std;` because it includes the entire `std` namespace, which may lead to name collision.

The optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <complex>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (n); ++i)
typedef double D;
typedef std::complex<D> P;
typedef std::pair<P, P> L;
typedef std::vector<P> VP;
typedef std::vector<VP> Vcon;
constexpr D EPS = 1e-7;
#define X real()
#define Y imag()
#define LE(n, m) ((n) < (m) + EPS)
#define GE(n, m) ((n) + EPS > (m))
#define EQ(n, m) (std::abs((n) - (m)) < EPS)

// Rest of the code
```

Note: The optimization mentioned above is mainly for improving the compilation time and code quality, not for the runtime optimization. The runtime optimization heavily depends on the algorithm used in the code. For runtime optimization, you need to focus on algorithmic optimization like using efficient data structures, avoiding unnecessary computations, etc. The provided code is complex and it's hard to suggest runtime optimization without knowing the problem it solves.
