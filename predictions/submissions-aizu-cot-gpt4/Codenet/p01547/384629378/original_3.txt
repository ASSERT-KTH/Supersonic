The given program seems to be a part of a computational geometry library. It contains a lot of functions for dealing with points, lines, and polygons in 2D space. The main part of the program is the 'main' function, where some input is received, computations are performed, and results are outputted.

One simple but effective optimization is to reduce the number of redundant computations by storing results of repeated function calls. For instance, the function 'inPolygon' is called twice for the same arguments in the 'main' function. This function is potentially time-consuming, as it involves a loop over all the points of a polygon. The results of these function calls can be stored in variables, so that the function needs not be called again with the same arguments.

Another possible optimization is to reduce the number of memory allocations. For instance, the 'convex' vector is initialized with four points, and then passed to the 'divide_convex' function, which may create new vectors. Instead, the 'divide_convex' function could modify the 'convex' vector in-place, avoiding the need to create new vectors.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
// ... (the same until the main function)

signed main() {
  vector<P> s1, s2;
  int n, m, q;
  cin >> n;
  VP V[n];
  rep(i, n) {
    cin >> m;
    D x[m], y[m];
    rep(j, m) {
      cin >> x[j] >> y[j];
      V[i].push_back(P(x[j], y[j]));
    }
    rep(j, m) {
      s1.push_back(P(x[j], y[j]));
      s2.push_back(P(x[(j + 1) % m], y[(j + 1) % m]));
    }
  }
  VP convex;
  convex.push_back(P(-200000, -200000));
  convex.push_back(P(200000, -200000));
  convex.push_back(P(200000, 200000));
  convex.push_back(P(-200000, 200000));
  Vcon v;
  divide_convex(convex, s1, s2, v);
  vector<vector<int>> a = Convex_arrangement(v);
  int cnt[v.size()] = {};
  rep(i, v.size()) {
    rep(j, n) {
      if (con_in_con(V[j], v[i])) {
        cnt[i]++;
      }
    }
  }
  rep(i, v.size()) {
    rep(j, v.size()) {
      if (i == j)
        a[i][j] = 0;
      if (a[i][j] == 1) {
        a[i][j] = abs(cnt[i] - cnt[j]);
      }
    }
  }
  rep(k, v.size()) rep(i, v.size()) rep(j, v.size()) a[i][j] =
      min(a[i][j], a[i][k] + a[k][j]);
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    int A = 1e9, B = 1e9;
    D a1, a2, b1, b2;
    cin >> a1 >> a2 >> b1 >> b2;
    int inPolyA, inPolyB;
    rep(i, v.size()) {
      inPolyA = inPolygon(v[i], P(a1, a2));
      if (inPolyA) {
        A = i;
        if (inPolyA == 1)
          break;
      }
    }
    rep(i, v.size()) {
      inPolyB = inPolygon(v[i], P(b1, b2));
      if (inPolyB) {
        B = i;
        if (inPolyB == 1)
          break;
      }
    }
    cout << a[A][B] << endl;
  }
}
```

In this optimized version, the 'inPolygon' function is only called once for each pair of arguments, and the results are stored in the 'inPolyA' and 'inPolyB' variables. This reduces the computational time. The 'divide_convex' function could also be optimized to modify the 'convex' vector in-place, but this would require a more significant modification of the function and is not included in the above code.
