This program is a complex geometrical computation program, and it's pretty optimized in terms of its geometric calculations. However, there are still several improvements that could be made:

1. **Remove unnecessary #include <bits/stdc++.h>:** This is a GCC extension that includes most of the standard library. It's convenient for competitive programming, but it's not portable and includes a lot of unnecessary stuff, slowing down the compilation time. We should include only the necessary headers.

2. **Use std::vector::reserve() to avoid unnecessary reallocations:** When we know the size of the vector in advance, we can reserve memory for it to prevent multiple reallocations.

3. **Avoid using 'using namespace std':** It's a bad practice because it can lead to name conflicts if the program gets larger or if part of it is used in another project.

4. **Avoid global variables:** They can lead to hard-to-diagnose bugs and make the code harder to understand.

5. **Avoid the use of goto statement:** Goto statement makes the program hard to understand and maintain. It is recommended to avoid using goto statement in C/C++.

6. **Avoid magic numbers:** Magic numbers are basically numbers that occur multiple time in your code without any explanation. They make your code less maintainable and harder to understand.

7. **Use of pre-increment instead of post-increment when the result is not used:** Pre-increment (++i) could be more efficient than post-increment (i++) in C++ because post-increment needs to make a copy of the value before incrementing, while pre-increment does not.

8. **Avoid using signed main():** It's better to use int main() as it's more standard and provides better portability.

However, due to the complexity of the program, these changes should be made with a good understanding of the underlying algorithm to prevent introducing bugs. The optimizations mentioned above are general good practices in C/C++ programming.
