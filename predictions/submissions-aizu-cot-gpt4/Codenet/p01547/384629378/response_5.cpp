The given code is quite complex and seems to be handling geometric computations such as determining if points are on a line, if lines are parallel, if lines intersect, etc.

For optimizing this code we can consider the following points:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This is really a bad practice to include this header file as it includes literally everything, most of which we don't even use in our code. Instead, we should include only those header files which we are actually using in our code.

2. Avoid `using namespace std`: This can cause naming conflicts, as it includes all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. It's better to use `std::` prefix when needed.

3. Avoid macros for loops: Using `#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (n); i++)` can lead to unexpected behavior, because macros are simply text replacements done by the preprocessor, and don't understand C++ syntax.

4. Don't use global variables unless absolutely necessary: Global variables can make the code hard to understand and debug. They should be avoided if possible.

5. Make functions inline if they are not too big: This can help to increase the speed of your program.

6. Avoid using `typedef` for basic datatypes: This can make the code more confusing and it's typically not necessary.

7. Use `const` for variables that don't change: This can help the compiler optimize your code.

8. Avoid using `throw` in functions: This can cause unexpected behavior, because exceptions can be caught and handled by any part of the code. It's better to use return values to indicate errors.

9. Use `std::array` or `std::vector` instead of C-style arrays: They are safer and more feature-rich.

10. Don't use magic numbers: Numbers like `1e8`, `1e7`, `1000007`, `41321` etc. are sprinkled throughout the code. It's better to use named constants for these.

11. Precompute some values if possible: If there are some computations that are done multiple times with the same input, it might be possible to compute them once and store the result.

Here's the optimized version of the code with the points mentioned above:
