Here are the steps to optimize the code:

1. The unordered maps in the damerau_levenshtein_distance function use a lot of memory and time, since they require hashing and provide no locality of reference. We can replace them with 2D vectors, which will be much faster.

2. The cin and cout operations in the solve function could be slowed down by synchronization with stdio. We can disable this synchronization to speed it up.

3. In the solve function, the count variable is incremented for every pair of strings that meet a certain condition. Instead of checking the condition for every pair, we could sort the strings in advance and only increment the count for unique pairs.

4. In the solve function, the strings are sorted and then read into the name vector. We can avoid this unnecessary sorting by reading the strings directly into a set, which keeps its elements sorted.

5. The damerau_levenshtein_distance function is called for every pair of strings. This function could be quite slow for long strings, so we can avoid calling it when the lengths of the strings differ by more than d.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int inf = 1e9;
const int64_t inf64 = 1e18;
const double eps = 1e-9;

int damerau_levenshtein_distance(const string &a, const string &b) {
  vector<vector<int>> d(a.size()+1, vector<int>(b.size()+1));
  int maxdist = a.size() + b.size();
  d[0][0] = maxdist;
  for (int i = 1; i <= a.size(); ++i) d[i][0] = i;
  for (int i = 1; i <= b.size(); ++i) d[0][i] = i;
  for (int i = 1; i <= a.size(); ++i) {
    int db = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j <= b.size(); ++j) {
      int cost = (a[i - 1] != b[j - 1]);
      d[i][j] = min({d[i - 1][j - 1] + cost, d[i][j - 1] + 1, d[i - 1][j] + 1});
    }
  }
  return d[a.size()][b.size()];
}

void solve(int n) {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);

  int d;
  cin >> d;
  set<string> names;
  for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    string name;
    cin >> name;
    names.insert(name);
  }
  int count = 0;
  for(auto i = names.begin(); i != names.end(); ++i) {
    for(auto j = next(i); j != names.end(); ++j) {
      if(abs((int)(i->size() - j->size())) <= d && 
         damerau_levenshtein_distance(*i, *j) <= d) {
        ++count;
        cout << *i << "," << *j << endl;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << count << endl;
}

int main() {
  for (;;) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    if (!n)
      break;
    solve(n);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations will make the code run faster and use less memory, but they will not change the complexity of the algorithm. The time complexity of the program is still O(n^2 * m), where n is the number of strings and m is the length of the strings.
