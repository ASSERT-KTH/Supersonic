The given program calculates the Damerau-Levenshtein distance between strings to find similar words. The program seems to be well structured, but there are still a few optimizations that can be applied to improve its running time and memory usage.

Step 1: Avoid using `std::unordered_map` for the 2D array `d`. Instead use a 2D vector or a 2D array. This is because `unordered_map` has a higher overhead due to its hashing mechanism. The 2D vector/array has a constant access time which will speed up the program.

Step 2: The Damerau-Levenshtein distance function can be further optimized. The `da` map is used to hold the last encountered position of a character. Instead of using a map, we can use an array of size `alphabet_size` to store this information. This will reduce the lookup time from O(log n) to O(1).

Step 3: The `solve` function can be optimized by breaking the inner loop when the Damerau-Levenshtein distance is greater than `d`. Currently, the loop continues to the end even if the condition is not satisfied. By breaking the loop, we can save unnecessary computation.

Step 4: The `sort` function inside `solve` function can be removed if the input strings are guaranteed to be sorted. However, if it's not the case, we can't remove it, as it is essential for the correct functionality of the program.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, x, y) for (int i = (x); i < (y); ++i)
#define debug(x) #x << "=" << (x)
#ifdef DEBUG
#define _GLIBCXX_DEBUG
#define print(x) std::cerr << debug(x) << " (L:" << __LINE__ << ")" << std::endl
#else
#define print(x)
#endif
const int inf = 1e9;
const int64_t inf64 = 1e18;
const double eps = 1e-9;

int damerau_levenshtein_distance(const string &a, const string &b, const int alphabet_size) {
  vector<int> da(alphabet_size, -1);
  vector<vector<int>> d(a.size() + 1, vector<int>(b.size() + 1));
  int maxdist = a.size() + b.size();
  d[0][0] = maxdist;
  for (int i = 0; i <= a.size(); ++i) {
    d[i][0] = i;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i <= b.size(); ++i) {
    d[0][i] = i;
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= a.size(); ++i) {
    int db = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j <= b.size(); ++j) {
      int k = da[b[j - 1]], l = db, cost;
      if (a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]) {
        cost = 0;
        db = j;
      } else
        cost = 1;
      d[i][j] = min({d[i - 1][j - 1] + cost, d[i][j - 1] + 1, d[i - 1][j] + 1,
                     d[k][l] + (i - k - 1) + 1 + (j - l - 1)});
    }
    da[a[i - 1]] = i;
  }
  return d[a.size()][b.size()];
}

void solve(int n) {
  int d;
  vector<string> name(n);
  cin >> d;
  rep(i, 0, n) cin >> name[i];
  sort(name.begin(), name.end());
  int count = 0;
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    rep(j, i + 1, n) {
      if (damerau_levenshtein_distance(name[i], name[j], 26) > d)
        break;
      ++count;
      cout << name[i] << "," << name[j] << '\n';
    }
  }
  cout << count << '\n';
}

int main() {
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cout.setf(ios::fixed);
  cout.precision(10);
  for (;;) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    if (!n)
      break;
    solve(n);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that `bits/stdc++.h` is not a standard header file and it should be avoided as it includes a lot of unnecessary stuff and can slow down the compilation process. Also, using `endl` can slow down the output, so it's better to use '\n' instead. However, these changes may not be considered as small modifications, so they are not included in the optimized code.
