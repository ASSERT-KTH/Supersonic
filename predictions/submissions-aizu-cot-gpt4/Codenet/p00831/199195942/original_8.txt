This C++ program calculates the Damerau-Levenshtein distance between pairs of strings and counts the number of pairs that have a distance less than or equal to a given threshold. The Damerau-Levenshtein distance is a measure of the difference between two strings, defined as the minimum number of insertions, deletions, substitutions, and transpositions of adjacent characters required to transform one string into the other.

Here are some possible optimization steps:

1. Avoid unnecessary computations: The Damerau-Levenshtein distance is symmetric, meaning that the distance between strings `a` and `b` is the same as the distance between `b` and `a`. We can therefore avoid computing the distance twice for each pair of strings. Specifically, in the nested loop inside the `solve` function, we can start the inner loop (`j`) at `i + 1` instead of `0`.

2. Use an array instead of a map for the `da` variable: This program uses an unordered map `da` to keep track of the last occurrence of each character in string `a`. This map is indexed by characters, so we could use an array instead, which would be faster. The size of this array would be the size of the alphabet, which is a constant. 

3. Preallocate memory for the `d` variable: The `d` variable is a two-dimensional map used to store intermediate results of the Damerau-Levenshtein distance computation. We can preallocate memory for this map, which can reduce the time spent on memory allocation during the computation.

Here is the optimized program with these changes:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define rep(i, x, y) for (int i = (x); i < (y); ++i)
#define debug(x) #x << "=" << (x)
#ifdef DEBUG
#define _GLIBCXX_DEBUG
#define print(x) std::cerr << debug(x) << " (L:" << __LINE__ << ")" << std::endl
#else
#define print(x)
#endif

using namespace std;
const int inf = 1e9;
const int64_t inf64 = 1e18;
const double eps = 1e-9;

template <typename T> ostream &operator<<(ostream &os, const vector<T> &vec) {
  os << "[";

  return os;
}

int damerau_levenshtein_distance(const string &a, const string &b) {
  vector<int> da(alphabet_size, -1);
  vector<vector<int>> d(a.size() + 1, vector<int>(b.size() + 1));
  int maxdist = a.size() + b.size();
  d[0][0] = maxdist;
  for (int i = 0; i <= a.size(); ++i) {
    d[i][0] = i;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i <= b.size(); ++i) {
    d[0][i] = i;
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= a.size(); ++i) {
    int db = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j <= b.size(); ++j) {
      int k = da[b[j - 1] - 'a'], l = db, cost;
      if (a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]) {
        cost = 0;
        db = j;
      } else
        cost = 1;
      d[i][j] = min({d[i - 1][j - 1] + cost, d[i][j - 1] + 1, d[i - 1][j] + 1, d[k][l] + (i - k - 1) + 1 + (j - l - 1)});
    }
    da[a[i - 1] - 'a'] = i;
  }
  return d[a.size()][b.size()];
}

void solve(int n) {
  int d;
  vector<string> name(n);
  cin >> d;
  rep(i, 0, n) cin >> name[i];
  sort(name.begin(), name.end());
  int count = 0;
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    rep(j, i + 1, n) {
      if (damerau_levenshtein_distance(name[i], name[j]) > d)
        continue;
      ++count;
      cout << name[i] << "," << name[j] << endl;
    }
  }
  cout << count << endl;
}

int main() {
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cout.setf(ios::fixed);
  cout.precision(10);
  for (;;) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    if (!n)
      break;
    solve(n);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the alphabet size is hardcoded as `26` assuming the input strings only contain lower case letters. If the input strings can contain other characters, you would need to adjust the size of the `da` array accordingly.
