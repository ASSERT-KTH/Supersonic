This is a complex piece of code, and the optimization can be challenging. However, there are a few areas where it can be improved.

First, there's a significant amount of preprocessor macro definitions that could be replaced with constexpr or in-place code. Using macros can lead to confusing and hard-to-debug code because they don't respect the usual rules of scope, and they aren't type-safe. 

Second, there are some arrays, like gha[6000], vis[1 << 12][100], and po[1000], which seem to be quite large. If these arrays aren't fully utilized, reducing their size could save memory.

Third, the solve() function is very long, which makes it difficult to understand and optimize. If possible, it should be broken down into smaller functions. It's also worth noting that there are two pieces of code that read in a string 'a' and calculate its hash. This could be encapsulated into a function to avoid code duplication.

Lastly, there seem to be a lot of operations on complex numbers, but the standard library's complex number class is used. While this class is very feature-rich, it's also quite heavy. If only a small subset of its functionality is used, a custom complex number class could be more efficient.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <numeric>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <stack>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
using PI = pair<int, int>;

constexpr double EPS = 1e-6;

template <class T> 
constexpr int SZ(const T& a) {
    return static_cast<int>(a.size());
}

template <typename T, typename U>
ostream &operator<<(ostream &out, const pair<T, U> &val) {
  return out << "(" << val.first << ", " << val.second << ")";
}

template <class T> ostream &operator<<(ostream &out, const vector<T> &val) {
  out << "{";
  for(size_t i = 0; i < val.size(); ++i) 
    out << (i ? ", " : "") << val[i];
  return out << "}";
}

// ... rest of the code remains same ...

void solve() {
  // ... rest of the code remains same ...

  int ans = 0;
  string text;
  for(int jjj = 0; jjj < m; ++jjj) {
    string a;
    cin >> a;
    text += a;
  }

  // ... rest of the code remains same ...

  for(size_t i = 0; i < text.size() + 1; ++i) {
    int cur = i % 250;

    // ... rest of the code remains same ...

    ans += vis[cur][(1 << n) - 1];
    for(size_t i = 0; i < (1 << n); ++i) 
      vis[cur][i] = 0;
    vis[cur][0] = 1;
  }

  // ... rest of the code remains same ...
}

// ... rest of the code remains same ...
```
In this optimized version, I replaced the preprocessor macros with constexpr and in-place code, replaced the use of rep macro with the more conventional for loop, and used the size_t type for indexing in vectors, which is more suitable and safe for this purpose.
