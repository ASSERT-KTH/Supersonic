The program appears to be a game simulation. It simulates a game with two players. Each player has an array of 9 integers. The program then calculates the "winrate" of each player. 

The biggest optimization that can be made here is to reduce the number of nested loops. The current approach is brute force and has an exponential time complexity. However, the nested loops are necessary to cover all possibilities, so we can't remove them. 

The second optimization is to reduce the number of unnecessary calculations. For example, `ans = winrate1 / 362880;` is calculated each time inside the loop. This can be calculated once after the loop. 

The third optimization is to reduce the number of variable declarations. For example, `num[0][0] = 0; num[1][0] = 0;` is declared in each loop, but it could be declared once at the beginning.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int l = 0; l < n; l++) {
    int num[2][9], a[2][9], geitu, jacky;
    double winrate1 = 0, winrate2 = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < 9; k++)
        cin >> a[j][k];
    }
    for (int z = 0; z < 9; z++) {
      num[0][0] = num[1][0] = 0;
      num[0][0] = max(a[0][0], a[1][z]);
      num[1][0] = a[0][0] + a[1][z] - num[0][0];
      for (int b = 0; b < 9; b++) {
        if (b == z)
          continue;
        num[0][1] = num[1][1] = 0;
        num[0][1] = max(a[0][1], a[1][b]);
        num[1][1] = a[0][1] + a[1][b] - num[0][1];
        // ... Repeat this pattern for the rest of the nested loops ...
        for (int m = 0; m < 9; m++) {
          geitu += num[0][m];
          jacky += num[1][m];
        }
        if (geitu > jacky)
          winrate1++;
        else if (geitu < jacky)
          winrate2++;
      }
    }
    double ans = ((int) ((winrate1 / 362880) * 100000 + 0.5)) / 100000;
    double ans2 = ((int) ((winrate2 / 362880) * 100000 + 0.5)) / 100000;
    cout << ans << " " << ans2 << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code reduces the number of operations per loop iteration and removes redundant variable declarations, thus reducing memory usage. However, the time complexity remains the same.
