The given code is quite complex and highly nested, making it difficult to optimize without knowing the exact purpose of the code. However, there are a few general adjustments that can be made to improve readability and potentially efficiency:

1. Reducing Variable Scope: Several variables are defined at the beginning of the loop over 'l' that are only used within the deeply nested loops. By reducing the scope of these variables, we can potentially reduce the memory footprint of the program.

2. Avoiding Repeated Computations: The code contains many repeated calculations, such as 'a[0][x] + a[1][y]' where x and y are loop indices. By storing the result of these calculations in a temporary variable, we can potentially reduce the number of computations the program must perform.

3. Reducing Redundant Initialization: The 2D array 'num' is initialized to zero multiple times within nested loops, which is unnecessary. We can initialize it once at the beginning of each iteration over 'z'.

4. Use Increment operator: Instead of writing 'num[0][x] = (a[0][x] + a[1][y])', we can use the increment operator: 'num[0][x] += (a[0][x] + a[1][y])'. This may provide a slight performance improvement.

Here is an optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int l = 0; l < n; l++) {
    int a[2][9];
    double winrate1 = 0, winrate2 = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < 9; k++) {
        cin >> a[j][k];
      }
    }
    for (int z = 0; z < 9; z++) {
      int num[2][9] = {0};
      for (int b = 0; b < 9; b++) {
        if (b == z) continue;
        for (int c = 0; c < 9; c++) {
          if (c == z || c == b) continue;
          for (int d = 0; d < 9; d++) {
            if (d == z || d == b || d == c) continue;
            for (int e = 0; e < 9; e++) {
              if (e == z || e == b || e == c || e == d) continue;
              for (int f = 0; f < 9; f++) {
                if (f == z || f == b || f == c || f == d || f == e) continue;
                for (int g = 0; g < 9; g++) {
                  if (g == z || g == b || g == c || g == d || g == e || g == f) continue;
                  for (int h = 0; h < 9; h++) {
                    if (h == z || h == b || h == c || h == d || h == e || h == f || h == g) continue;
                    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
                      if (i == z || i == b || i == c || i == d || i == e || i == f || i == g || i == h) continue;
                      int geitu = 0, jacky = 0;
                      for (int m = 0; m < 9; m++) {
                        if (a[0][m] > a[1][m]) {
                          num[0][m] += a[0][m] + a[1][m];
                          geitu += num[0][m];
                        } else {
                          num[1][m] += a[0][m] + a[1][m];
                          jacky += num[1][m];
                        }
                      }
                      if (geitu > jacky) {
                        winrate1++;
                      } else if (geitu < jacky) {
                        winrate2++;
                      }
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    cout << winrate1 / 362880 << " " << winrate2 / 362880 << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimization might not significantly improve performance due to the complexity of the nested loops. This code would benefit from being refactored to reduce the number of nested loops or utilize parallel processing.
