Looking at this program, it's quite clear that the nested loops are the major source of inefficiency. This program is essentially computing permutations of 9 elements and then comparing them. However, it's doing so in a very inefficient manner, with deep nested loops and repeated code.

Since we're not allowed to completely rewrite the program, the first step we can take to optimize it is to eliminate the repeated assignments of num[0][x] and num[1][x] to 0. We can see that, in each loop, these assignments are made regardless of the condition, so they can be moved outside the conditions. This will reduce the number of assignments made, which can have a significant impact on performance for large inputs.

Also, the variables geitu and jacky are being reset to 0 in every iteration of the innermost loop, and then incremented by num[0][m] and num[1][m] for m from 0 to 8. We can replace this with a direct assignment to the sum of the elements of num[0] and num[1] respectively.

Finally, the variables ans and ans2 are being multiplied by 100000, then incremented by 0.5, then cast to an int, then divided by 100000 again. This is unnecessary and can be simplified.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int l = 0; l < n; l++) {
    int num[2][9], a[2][9];
    double winrate1 = 0, winrate2 = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < 9; k++)
        cin >> a[j][k];
    }
    for (int z = 0; z < 9; z++) {
      for (int b = 0; b < 9; b++) {
        if (b == z)
          continue;
        for (int c = 0; c < 9; c++) {
          if (c == z || c == b)
            continue;
          for (int d = 0; d < 9; d++) {
            if (d == z || d == b || d == c)
              continue;
            for (int e = 0; e < 9; e++) {
              if (e == z || e == b || e == c || e == d)
                continue;
              for (int f = 0; f < 9; f++) {
                if (f == z || f == b || f == c || f == d || f == e)
                  continue;
                for (int g = 0; g < 9; g++) {
                  if (g == z || g == b || g == c || g == d || g == e || g == f)
                    continue;
                  for (int h = 0; h < 9; h++) {
                    if (h == z || h == b || h == c || h == d || h == e ||
                        h == f || h == g)
                      continue;
                    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
                      if (i == z || i == b || i == c || i == d || i == e ||
                          i == f || i == g || i == h)
                        continue;
                      int geitu = accumulate(num[0], num[0] + 9, 0);
                      int jacky = accumulate(num[1], num[1] + 9, 0);
                      if (geitu > jacky)
                        winrate1++;
                      else if (geitu < jacky)
                        winrate2++;
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    double ans = winrate1 / 362880;
    double ans2 = winrate2 / 362880;
    cout << ans << " " << ans2 << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This should reduce the execution time of the program, but the program is inherently complex due to the high number of nested loops. For further optimization, a different approach should be considered.
