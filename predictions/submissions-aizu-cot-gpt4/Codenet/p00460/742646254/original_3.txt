The given program appears to be solving some kind of dynamic programming problem, with `dp[i][j]` storing some state-dependent result for some parameters `i` and `j`. The main performance issue here is that the entire `dp` array is being reset to zero for each new set of inputs `N`, `M`, `S`.

There are a few ways to optimize this code:

1. Use `std::fill` instead of the double loop to reset the `dp` array. This is more idiomatic in modern C++, and potentially more efficient because it can take advantage of vectorized operations.

2. Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output. This is a common optimization in competitive programming. 

3. The modulo operation `%` is quite expensive. There is a trick to reduce the number of modulo operations. Notice that `(dp[currIndex][currSum] += dp[currIndex - 1][currSum - add]) %= MOD;` can be converted to `dp[currIndex][currSum] += dp[currIndex - 1][currSum - add]; if (dp[currIndex][currSum] >= MOD) dp[currIndex][currSum] -= MOD;`
This will reduce the number of modulo operations.

4. Instead of using `REP` and `rep` macros, we can use simple for loops as they are more readable.

Here is the optimized version of the code with the above improvements:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
int const inf = 1 << 29;
int dp[55][3030];
int main() {
  int const MOD = 100000;
  int N, M, S;
  while (scanf("%d %d %d", &N, &M, &S) && (N | M | S)) {
    fill(&dp[0][0], &dp[0][0] + sizeof(dp) / sizeof(int), 0);
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int add = 1; add <= M; add++) {
      for (int currIndex = N * N; currIndex >= 1; currIndex--) {
        for (int currSum = add; currSum <= S; currSum++) {
          dp[currIndex][currSum] += dp[currIndex - 1][currSum - add];
          if (dp[currIndex][currSum] >= MOD) dp[currIndex][currSum] -= MOD;
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", dp[N * N][S]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that some of these optimizations are more effective in certain contexts (like competitive programming). In other contexts, code readability and maintainability should usually be prioritized over performance.
