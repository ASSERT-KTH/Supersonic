This program is already pretty optimized in terms of algorithmic complexity. But we can make a few modifications to reduce memory usage and potentially improve running time.

1. Remove unnecessary macros and includes: 
   The `#include<bits/stdc++.h>` is generally considered bad practice as it includes more libraries than needed, which can increase compilation time. We replace it with specific includes. Macros like `REP`, `rep`, `all`, `zero`, `minus`, `watch` are not used in this program, we can safely remove them.

2. Optimizing array size:
   The dp array is quite large and may not be completely used in every iteration of the for loop. We can reduce the size of the dp array by understanding the maximum size it can take.

3. Use of const for variables that don't change: 
   The value of `MOD` is constant and doesn't change. It's better to define it as a global constant which can potentially optimize the program.

4. Use of `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:
   This can potentially speed up I/O operations in some cases.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
const int MOD = 100000;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  vector<vector<int>> dp(55,vector<int>(3030,0));

  int N, M, S;

  while (cin >> N >> M >> S && (N | M | S)) {
    for(int i = 0; i<55; i++)
      for(int j = 0; j<3030; j++)
        dp[i][j] = 0;

    dp[0][0] = 1;

    for (int add = 1; add <= M; add++) {
      for (int currIndex = N * N; currIndex >= 1; currIndex--) {
        for (int currSum = add; currSum <= S; currSum++) {
          (dp[currIndex][currSum] += dp[currIndex - 1][currSum - add]) %= MOD;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << dp[N * N][S] << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the optimization of the array size (dp array) has not been done here, as it requires an understanding of the problem and the inputs it receives. If the problem guarantees that the values of N, M, and S are within a certain limit, the size of dp array can be adjusted accordingly.
