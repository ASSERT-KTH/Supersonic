Before diving into the optimization, it's important to understand the code first. The code is a Dynamic Programming (DP) problem. It's calculating the number of ways to pick some numbers from 1 to M (inclusive), each number can be picked multiple times, such that the sum of the numbers exactly equals S, and the total number of picked numbers exactly equals N*N.

Here are some steps we can optimize:

1. The size of the dp array is unnecessarily large. It's initialized with a size of [55][3030] but it only uses up to [N*N][S]. We can initialize the dp array dynamically with the size of [N*N+1][S+1].
2. The memset function is not used in the program, so the macro "minus(a)" and "zero(a)" can be removed.
3. The macros "all(c)" and "watch(a)" are not used, so they can be removed as well.
4. It's considered bad practice to include <bits/stdc++.h> because it includes more than necessary. We can replace it with the specific libraries we are using.
5. "typedef long long ll" and "int const inf = 1 << 29" are not used in the program, we can remove them.
6. The template functions minimize() and maximize() are not used, we can remove them.

The optimized code will look like this:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int const MOD = 100000;
  for (int N, M, S; cin >> N >> M >> S && (N | M | S);) {
    vector<vector<int>> dp(N * N + 1, vector<int>(S + 1, 0));
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int add = 1; add <= M; add++) {
      for (int currIndex = N * N; currIndex >= 1; currIndex--) {
        for (int currSum = add; currSum <= S; currSum++) {
          (dp[currIndex][currSum] += dp[currIndex - 1][currSum - add]) %= MOD;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << dp[N * N][S] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code is more concise and efficient. It reduces memory consumption by dynamically allocating the DP table, and also removes unnecessary code that is not used in the program.
