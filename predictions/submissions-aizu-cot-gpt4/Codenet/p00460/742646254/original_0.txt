The existing program is already quite optimized, but there are a couple of possible modifications which can be made to improve performance slightly:

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This is a non-standard header file which includes a large number of standard C++ libraries. Including this file can slow down the compilation process, as it includes many libraries that may not be used in the code. We can replace it with the specific libraries that are actually being used: `<iostream>`, `<cstring>` and `<vector>`.

2. `cin` and `cout` are slower than `scanf` and `printf`. We can replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for faster I/O operations. 

3. `memset`: As we know, `memset` initializes the block of memory with the same value. But in the given code, it is used in a loop which is not necessary. We can replace it with an if condition to initialize only when required.

4. The modulus operation is a bit costly. We can avoid it by using the if condition only when the dp value is greater than MOD.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define REP(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < (int)b; i++)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define all(c) (c).begin(), (c).end()
#define zero(a) memset(a, 0, sizeof a)
#define minus(a) memset(a, -1, sizeof a)
#define watch(a)                                                               \
  { cout << #a << " = " << a << endl; }
template <class T1, class T2> inline bool minimize(T1 &a, T2 b) {
  return b < a && (a = b, 1);
}
template <class T1, class T2> inline bool maximize(T1 &a, T2 b) {
  return a < b && (a = b, 1);
}
typedef long long ll;
int const inf = 1 << 29;
int dp[55][3030];
int main() {
  int const MOD = 100000;
  int N, M, S;
  while(scanf("%d %d %d", &N, &M, &S) && (N | M | S)){
    if(N*M*S == 0)
      zero(dp);
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    REP(add, 1, M + 1) {
      for (int currIndex = N * N; currIndex >= 1; currIndex--) {
        for (int currSum = add; currSum <= S; currSum++) {
          dp[currIndex][currSum] += dp[currIndex - 1][currSum - add];
          if(dp[currIndex][currSum] >= MOD)
            dp[currIndex][currSum] -= MOD;
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", dp[N * N][S]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
