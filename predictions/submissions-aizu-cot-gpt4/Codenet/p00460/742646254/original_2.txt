The optimizations that can be made to the provided program are:

1. Remove unused macros: The provided program has several macros that are not used in the code, such as "all(c)", "zero(a)", "minus(a)", "watch(a)", "minimize(T1 &a, T2 b)", "maximize(T1 &a, T2 b)". Removing these unused macros can make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

2. Avoid using "bits/stdc++.h": Using this header file includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which can impact the compilation time. Instead, include only required header files. In this program, we only need "iostream".

3. Avoid using "using namespace std": This brings all names from the std namespace into the global namespace, which can possibly lead to name conflicts. It's better to use std:: before every standard library object.

4. Avoid using "typedef": In modern C++, using "using" is preferred over "typedef". Here, "typedef long long ll;" is not used anywhere, so we can remove it.

5. Avoid using MOD as a local constant: The program uses "MOD" as a local constant inside the main function. We can define it as a global constant to avoid redefinition.

6. Avoid using magic numbers: The program uses numbers like 55 and 3030 directly in the code. We can define them as constants with meaningful names to make the code more readable.

The optimized program after applying these modifications is:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

const int MOD = 100000;
const int MAX_INDEX = 55;
const int MAX_SUM = 3030;

int dp[MAX_INDEX][MAX_SUM];

int main() {
    for (int N, M, S; std::cin >> N >> M >> S && (N | M | S);) {
        for(int i = 0; i < MAX_INDEX; ++i) {
            for(int j = 0; j < MAX_SUM; ++j) {
                dp[i][j] = 0;
            }
        }
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        for (int add = 1; add <= M; ++add) {
            for (int currIndex = N * N; currIndex >= 1; --currIndex) {
                for (int currSum = add; currSum <= S; ++currSum) {
                    (dp[currIndex][currSum] += dp[currIndex - 1][currSum - add]) %= MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        std::cout << dp[N * N][S] << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program is cleaner, easier to understand, and avoids potential issues related to namespace conflicts and magic numbers. It also only includes the necessary libraries, which can speed up compilation time.
