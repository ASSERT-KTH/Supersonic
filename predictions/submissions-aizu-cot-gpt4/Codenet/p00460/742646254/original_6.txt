Step 1: Avoid `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because it includes a lot of unnecessary headers which increases the compilation time. Instead, include only those libraries which are actually used in the code. Here, you are using `iostream` and `cstring`.

Step 2: Remove unused macros and typedefs, such as `all`, `zero`, `minus`, `watch`, `minimize`, `maximize`, and `ll` to clean up the code.

Step 3: In this case, `memset` can be used to initialize the 2D array `dp` to 0 instead of using nested loops. This will significantly improve the performance of your code.

Step 4: The constant `MOD` is not changing inside the loop, so it's better to define it outside the loop.

Step 5: The condition `(N | M | S)` is a bit tricky and may not be immediately clear to other developers. It would be clearer to use `(N || M || S)`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

#define REP(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < (int)b; i++)

typedef int int32;
int32 const inf = 1 << 29;
int32 dp[55][3030];

int main() {
  int32 const MOD = 100000;
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  for (int32 N, M, S; std::cin >> N >> M >> S && (N || M || S);) {
    std::memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    REP(add, 1, M + 1) {
      for (int32 currIndex = N * N; currIndex >= 1; currIndex--) {
        for (int32 currSum = add; currSum <= S; currSum++) {
          (dp[currIndex][currSum] += dp[currIndex - 1][currSum - add]) %= MOD;
        }
      }
    }
    std::cout << dp[N * N][S] << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code provides the same functionality as the original code but with better performance and readability.
