Here is a step-by-step optimization process for your program:

1. Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as this includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which will increase the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries: `<iostream>`, `<cstring>`.

2. Avoid using `#define` for loops such as `REP` and `rep`. It's better to write out the loops in your program as it makes the code easier to read and understand. This will also make debugging easier if you encounter issues.

3. The `memset` function is slower compared to a loop for initializing values in an array. Use a loop for such initialization.

4. Inline functions are efficient only when they are small. `minimize` and `maximize` functions are not small and it's better to define them normally.

5. Do not use the `watch` macro, it is not necessary and may lead to slower execution time if used excessively. 

6. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` at the beginning of the `main()` function to speed up the I/O operations.

Here is the optimized program with the above changes:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
const int inf = 1 << 29;
int dp[55][3030];

bool minimize(int &a, int b) {
  return b < a && (a = b, 1);
}

bool maximize(int &a, int b) {
  return a < b && (a = b, 1);
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);

  const int MOD = 100000;
  for (int N, M, S; cin >> N >> M >> S && (N | M | S);) {
    for(int i=0; i<55; i++) {
      for(int j=0; j<3030; j++) {
        dp[i][j] = 0;
      }
    }
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for(int add = 1; add < M + 1; add++) {
      for (int currIndex = N * N; currIndex >= 1; currIndex--) {
        for (int currSum = add; currSum <= S; currSum++) {
          (dp[currIndex][currSum] += dp[currIndex - 1][currSum - add]) %= MOD;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << dp[N * N][S] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The actual performance improvement depends on the specific use case, input data and the compiler used. These optimizations are general and may not always provide noticeable improvements.
