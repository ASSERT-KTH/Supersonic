The given C++ program is a simple brute force solution for a problem. It seems like the code is solving some sort of matching problem where it's matching strings and adding up some scores based on the match. The code has nested loops which makes it inefficient. The innermost loop runs for each character in the string which is a fixed size of 8. This can be optimized by using bitwise operations instead of char by char comparison.

Also, the code is using `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input/output which are slower compared with `scanf` and `printf`. Therefore, these can be replaced to improve I/O speed.

Here are the optimization steps:
1. Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`.
2. Convert the string comparison to integer comparison using bitwise operation which will avoid the third loop entirely.
3. Use an array to store the integer value of each string, so that the conversion is done only once.

The optimized program would look like:

```c
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, m, o[100], b[100];
    int ans;
    for (;;) {
        scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
        if (!n && !m)
            break;
        ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int mask = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
                char ch;
                scanf(" %c", &ch);
                if (ch == '*') {
                    mask |= (1 << j);
                }
            }
            b[i] = mask;
            scanf("%d", &o[i]);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int mask = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
                char ch;
                scanf(" %c", &ch);
                mask |= (1 << j);
            }
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (b[j] & mask) {
                    ans += o[j];
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        printf("%d\n", ans);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that some assumptions are made here about the input and the problem constraints. This optimized code assumes that the input strings are of fixed length and consists of only '*' and any other character.
