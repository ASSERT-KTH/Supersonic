The main issue with the given program is the current time complexity. The time complexity of the inner loop is O(n*m*8), which means that for every input string 'l', the program checks each character against all the characters of all strings in the array 'b'. 

This can be optimized by using a map instead of a string array 'b' and integer array 'o'. This way, the strings themselves can be used as keys, and the corresponding integers can be used as values. This will reduce the time complexity to O(n), as map operations such as insert and find work in O(log n) time complexity, but since we are inserting and finding only once, it will be taken as O(n) in the worst case.

Also, it's not necessary to check for '*' in every string 'b', as it's not influencing the result. So, the inner loop checking for '*' can be removed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, m;
    map<string, int> o;
    string l;
    for (;;) {
        cin >> n >> m;
        if (!n && !m)
            break;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> l;
            int val;
            cin >> val;
            o[l] = val;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            cin >> l;
            if (o.find(l) != o.end()) {
                ans += o[l];
            }
        }
        cout << ans << endl;
        o.clear();
    }
}
```

The modified program reads the strings and their corresponding integers, and stores them in a map. Then it reads the next set of strings and checks if they are present in the map. If present, it adds the corresponding value to the answer and prints it. This significantly reduces the time complexity of the program, thereby optimizing it.
