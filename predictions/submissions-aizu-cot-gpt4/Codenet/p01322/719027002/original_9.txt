This program reads in pairs of strings and integers (b and o respectively), then reads in a string l and checks if the string l matches any string in the array b. The matching is done by comparing the first 8 characters of the string. If a match is found, the corresponding integer from the array o is added to the result, ans. This continues until 0 0 is inputted for n m.

The main area for optimization here is in reducing the amount of string comparisons necessary. By replacing the inner for loop (which iterates through characters of a string) with the built-in string comparison function, we can reduce the time complexity of the program.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, m, o[100];
  string b[100];
  string l;
  int ans;
  for (;;) {
    cin >> n >> m;
    if (!n && !m)
      break;
    ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> b[i] >> o[i];
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      cin >> l;
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        if (b[j].substr(0, 8) == l.substr(0, 8)) {
          ans += o[j];
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
Here, we replace the inner loop which checks each character one-by-one, with the substr method of the string class. This method returns a substring from the given string, starting from the first index and of length specified. This substring is then directly compared to the substring of the other string, which is much faster than checking each character individually.
