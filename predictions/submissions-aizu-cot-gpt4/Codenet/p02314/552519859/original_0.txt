The program above is a typical dynamic programming problem. It tries to solve the coin change problem where we are trying to find the minimum number of coins needed to make a specific amount. Here are some potential areas of optimization:

1. I/O operations: We can use faster I/O operations to decrease the running time. C++ `cin` and `cout` are slower compared to `scanf` and `printf`.

2. In the nested loop, `mini[j + c[i]]` is calculated twice. We can store this value in a variable and use that variable instead, reducing the number of calculations.

3. Array initialization: Instead of using a loop to initialize `mini[]` with `INF`, we can use `std::fill_n` which is more efficient.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int INF = 2000000000;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  int c[21];
  int mini[50001];
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &c[i]);
  }
  sort(c + 1, c + 1 + m);
  fill_n(mini + 1, n, INF); // initialize mini[] array with INF
  mini[0] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= n - c[i]; j++) {
      int next = j + c[i];
      mini[next] = min(mini[j] + 1, mini[next]); // Use a temporary variable to reduce calculations
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", mini[n]);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program should reduce both the running time and memory usage of the original program.
