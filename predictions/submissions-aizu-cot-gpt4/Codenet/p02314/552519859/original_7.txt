The code you posted is a dynamic programming (DP) solution to a problem, which is often very optimal in terms of time complexity. However, there are a few small changes we can make to improve the efficiency of the program and to optimize memory usage:

1. Remove unnecessary libraries - The `cstdio` and `math.h` libraries are not used in the code, so they can be removed. This will reduce the memory footprint of the program.

2. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` - This command helps to untie C++'s cin/cout and C's stdin/stdout, which can speed up I/O operations in some cases where we only use cin/cout.

3. Use `cin.tie(NULL)` - This command will untie cin from cout, meaning cin doesn't need to flush cout before every operation. This can also speed up I/O.

4. Reduce variable scope - The `INF` constant is only used in the main function, so it could be defined there to reduce its scope. This can help to improve memory usage.

5. Use `std::vector` for dynamic arrays - The array `mini` is initialized with a size of 50001, regardless of the actual input size. We can use a `std::vector` instead, which can dynamically resize based on the input. This can help to reduce memory usage if the actual input size `n` is smaller than 50001.

Applying these optimizations, the optimized program would look like this:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  const int INF = 2000000000;
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  vector<int> c(m+1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    cin >> c[i];
  }
  sort(c.begin() + 1, c.end());
  
  vector<int> mini(n+1, INF);
  mini[0] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= n - c[i]; j++) {
      mini[j + c[i]] = min(mini[j] + 1, mini[j + c[i]]);
    }
  }
  
  cout << mini[n] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
