In this code, the primary optimizations that can be made include minimizing the input/output operations and optimizing the array access. 

1. Using scanf/printf instead of cin/cout: scanf and printf are faster than cin and cout for input and output operations.

2. Using array indexing instead of pointer arithmetic in sort function: Accessing an array via an index is usually faster than using pointer arithmetic.

3. Reducing the scope of variables: Reducing the scope of variables can help in optimizing memory usage, but in this case, the scope of all variables is already minimal.

4. Reducing the space of the array: Here, the array size is already minimal.

Here is the optimized version of the code considering the above points:

```C++
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

const int INF = INT_MAX;
int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  int c[21];
  int mini[50001];
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &c[i]);
  }
  sort(c + 1, &c[1] + m);
  fill_n(mini + 1, n, INF);
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= n - c[i]; j++) {
      mini[j + c[i]] = min(mini[j] + 1, mini[j + c[i]]);
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", mini[n]);
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code will run faster and with the same memory usage, as it uses scanf/printf for input/output and array indexing for the sort operation.
