The provided code is a dynamic programming solution to a coin change problem. However, a few minor optimizations can be made to the code to reduce memory usage and potentially improve speed.

Optimization Steps:

1. I/O operations can be optimized. C++ I/O operations are slower than C I/O operations. cin and cout can be changed to scanf and printf, which are faster.

2. The array c[] is 0-indexed in C/C++, so instead of starting from 1, we can start from 0. This does not affect the program's logic and would save one memory space.

3. Instead of initializing all elements of mini[] to INF, we can initialize it to 0 and set only the 0th index to INF. This is because we don't need to consider any value before the smallest coin, and the rest of the elements will be updated in the nested loop.

4. The nested loop can start from c[i] instead of 0. This is because we only need to consider values that can be formed using the current coin.

5. We don't need to use sort function to sort the c[] array. The coin change problem does not require the coins to be in sorted order.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 2000000000;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  int c[21], mini[50001] = {0};
  mini[0] = INF;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &c[i]);
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    for (int j = c[i]; j <= n; j++) {
      mini[j] = min(mini[j], mini[j - c[i]] + 1);
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", mini[n]);
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code should run faster and use less memory compared to the original code.
