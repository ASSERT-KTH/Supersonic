The given program reads two integers, H and W, and prints a checkerboard pattern of H rows and W columns. The inner loop constructs each row, alternating between "." and "#" characters, and the outer loop constructs the number of rows. The while loop keeps the program running until 0 0 is entered for H and W.

There are not many opportunities for significant optimization in this program, as it's already quite simple and efficient. However, there are a few small changes that could be made to potentially improve the program's performance:

1. Reducing the number of times the 'cout' operation is called: Instead of printing each character in the checkerboard individually, we could build the whole line as a string and print it all at once. This would reduce the number of times the 'cout' operation is called from W to 1 per line.

2. Reserve space for the string: If we know the size of the string beforehand, we can reserve the space in memory. This can avoid unnecessary reallocations during the string concatenation operations.

3. Using '\n' instead of 'endl': 'endl' causes a flush of the output buffer, which can slow down the program when done frequently. We can replace 'endl' with '\n' to avoid this.

Now let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int H, W;
  while (cin >> H >> W && H != 0 && W != 0) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= H; i++) {
      string line;
      line.reserve(W);
      for (int j = 1; j <= W; j++) {
        line += ".#"[(i + j) % 2 == 0];
      }
      cout << line << '\n';
    }
    cout << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the 'cout' operation is called only once for each line, and the size of the line string is reserved in advance, which could increase the efficiency of the string concatenation operations. Furthermore, 'endl' is replaced by '\n' to avoid unnecessary flushes of the output buffer.
