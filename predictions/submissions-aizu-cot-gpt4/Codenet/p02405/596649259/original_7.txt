The given C++ program reads two integers, H and W, from the standard input and generates a pattern of dots and hashes in a grid of H rows and W columns. It repeats the process until 0 is entered for both H and W. 

Looking at the program, there are a couple of optimizations that can be done:

1. Reduce the number of write operations: The program prints out each character one by one using `cout <<`. This requires a lot of write operations which can be slow. Instead, you can create a string for each row and print it out at once.

2. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`: `endl` not only inserts a newline character but also flushes the stream which can be slower than simply inserting a newline character.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int H, W;
  while (cin >> H >> W && H != 0 && W != 0) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= H; i++) {
      string row;
      for (int j = 1; j <= W; j++) {
        row += ".#"[(i + j) % 2 == 0];
      }
      cout << row << '\n';
    }
    cout << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This program reduces the number of write operations by creating a string for each row and printing it out at once. It also uses `'\n'` instead of `endl` to avoid unnecessary stream flushes.
