This program is quite complex and it seems to be well-optimized for its specific task, which appears to be a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm for a certain kind of problem (possibly a game). I will suggest a few general optimizations, but note that without understanding the specific problem domain it's hard to suggest more targeted improvements.

1. **Use `std::array` instead of C-style arrays**: `std::array` is safer and has the same performance as C-style arrays. For example, `char cx[3], cy[3];` can become `std::array<char, 3> cx, cy;`.

2. **Avoid `memset` for initializing arrays, use `std::fill`**: `memset` is a low-level function that can lead to errors when used with non-POD types. `std::fill` is safer and more idiomatic in C++. For example, `memset(bfscost, -1, sizeof(bfscost));` can become `std::fill(std::begin(bfscost), std::end(bfscost), -1);`.

3. **Avoid macros if possible**: Macros like `#define REP(i, a, n) for (i = a; i < n; i++)` can lead to unexpected behavior due to lack of type safety. It's better to use functions or, in this case, write out the for-loop manually.

4. **Use `std::pair` constructors directly**: Instead of using `make_pair`, you can use the `std::pair` constructor directly, which is more modern and can be more efficient. For example, `q.push(make_pair(0, state(sx, sy, cx, cy, 0)));` can become `q.emplace(0, state(sx, sy, cx, cy, 0));`.

5. **Limit the scope of variables as much as possible**: Variables `i, j, k` are declared at the beginning of `main` and reused in multiple places. It's better to declare them in the smallest scope where they're needed.

Here's the modified code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <map>
#include <numeric>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <sstream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <array>
using namespace std;

const int dx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
const int dy[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
int W, H, sx, sy, gx, gy;
int bfscost[10][10];
char csize, wsize, wx[3], wy[3];
std::array<char, 3> cx, cy;
char field[16][16];
char DP[9][9][9][9][9][9][9][9];

// ... rest of the code ...

int main() {
  while (scanf("%d%d", &H, &W), H | W) {
    csize = wsize = 0;
    std::fill(std::begin(DP), std::end(DP), -1);
    cx.fill(0);
    cy.fill(0);
    input();
    int res = INT_MAX;
    priority_queue<pair<int, state>, vector<pair<int, state>>,
                   greater<pair<int, state>>>
        q;
    q.emplace(0, state(sx, sy, cx.data(), cy.data(), 0));
    DP[cx[0]][cy[0]][cx[1]][cy[1]][cx[2]][cy[2]][sx][sy] = 0;
    
    // ... rest of the code ...
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: In the above code, `.data()` method is used to pass the `std::array` to a function expecting a C-style array. In real refactoring, you would modify the `state` constructor and other functions to accept `std::array` instead.
