The provided C/C++ code is already quite optimized. However, there are a few changes that could potentially make it run slightly more efficiently:

1. Avoid unnecessary function calls: While the functions `isdel` and `iscontena` are utilized to check certain conditions, these checks could be directly incorporated into the main code body to avoid the overhead of function calls.

2. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The `ttcx` and `ttcy` arrays are being created inside a loop, which means new memory is allocated for these arrays at each iteration. Instead of this, these arrays could be created outside the loop and their values can be updated inside the loop.

3. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment: The pre-increment operator (++i) is usually faster than the post-increment operator (i++) in C/C++. This is because post-increment needs to create a copy of i before it adds 1 to it, whereas pre-increment can just add 1 directly.

4. Remove unused code: The code contains multiple unnecessary includes and defines. Removing these would reduce the size of the code without affecting its functionality.

5. Use bitwise operations: Using bitwise operations instead of mathematical ones can also speed up computations. For example, replacing 'Sc & (1 << i)' with 'Sc & (1i)'.

Here's how the optimized code might look:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

const int dx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
const int dy[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
int W, H, sx, sy, gx, gy;
int bfscost[10][10];
char csize, wsize, wx[3], wy[3], cx[3], cy[3];
char field[16][16];
char DP[9][9][9][9][9][9][9][9];

struct state {
  char x, y, cx[3], cy[3], Sc;
  state(char _x, char _y, char _cx[], char _cy[], char _Sc) {
    x = _x, y = _y, Sc = _Sc;
    cx[0] = _cx[0], cx[1] = _cx[1], cx[2] = _cx[2];
    cy[0] = _cy[0], cy[1] = _cy[1], cy[2] = _cy[2];
  }
  bool operator<(const state &a) const {
    if (x != a.x)
      return x < a.x;
    if (y != a.y)
      return y < a.y;
    if (cx[0] != a.cx[0])
      return cx[0] < a.cx[0];
    if (cx[1] != a.cx[1])
      return cx[1] < a.cx[1];
    if (cx[2] != a.cx[2])
      return cx[2] < a.cx[2];
    if (cy[0] != a.cy[0])
      return cy[0] < a.cy[0;
    if (cy[1] != a.cy[1])
      return cy[1] < a.cy[1];
    if (cy[2] != a.cy[2])
      return cy[2] < a.cy[2];
    return Sc < a.Sc;
  }
  bool operator==(const state &a) const {
    return (x == a.x && y == a.y &&
            (cx[0] == a.cx[0] && cx[1] == a.cx[1] && cx[2] == a.cx[2]) &&
            (cy[0] == a.cy[0] && cy[1] == a.cy[1] && cy[2] == a.cy[2]) &&
            Sc == a.Sc);
  }
};

// Rest of the code...
```

Note that optimization heavily depends on the specific compiler and system architecture. What might be an optimization for one system might not be for another. Thus, it is always a good idea to test the optimized code to ensure it indeed performs better than the original.
