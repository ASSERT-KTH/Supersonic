The given C++ program is a fairly complex one, and it would be challenging to cover all optimization strategies in one go. However, here are a few general optimization strategies that could be applied:

1. **Avoid using std::endl:** Use '\n' instead of std::endl to avoid unnecessary flushes of the output buffer.

2. **Use prefix increment in loops:** Prefix increment operator (++i) is more efficient than postfix increment (i++) in loops because the latter creates a temporary copy of the object, increments the value, and then destroys the temporary copy.

3. **Reduce the number of object instantiations:** There are a number of places where objects are being created and destroyed repeatedly, which could lead to unnecessary overhead. For example, in the BFS function, instead of creating a new pair every time to push into the queue, we could reuse the existing pair object.

4. **Avoid unnecessary calculations inside loops:** In the while loop inside the BFS function, the calculation of tx and ty could be moved outside of the loop.

5. **Optimize your data structures:** The state struct could be optimized by using a smaller data type (if possible) for the member variables. Also, instead of using a map for the dp, we could use a multi-dimensional array, which would be faster to access.

Let's apply these optimizations to the given code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <map>
#include <numeric>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <sstream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define REP(i, a, n) for (i = a; i < n; ++i)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rall(x) x.rbegin(), x.rend()
#define foreach(it, x) for (typeof(x.begin()) it = x.begin(); it != x.end(); ++it)
const int dx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
const int dy[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
int W, H, sx, sy, gx, gy;
int bfscost[10][10];
char csize, wsize, wx[3], wy[3], cx[3], cy[3];
char field[16][16];
char DP[9][9][9][9][9][9][9][9];

// rest of the code remains same

int main() {
  int i, j, k;
  while (scanf("%d%d", &H, &W), H | W) {
    csize = wsize = 0;
    memset(DP, -1, sizeof(DP));
    rep(i, 3) cx[i] = cy[i] = 0;
    input();
    int res = INT_MAX;
    pair<int, state> qPair;
    qPair.first = 0;
    qPair.second = state(sx, sy, cx, cy, 0);
    priority_queue<pair<int, state>, vector<pair<int, state>>, greater<pair<int, state>>> q;
    q.push(qPair);
    DP[cx[0]][cy[0]][cx[1]][cy[1]][cx[2]][cy[2]][sx][sy] = 0;
    while (!q.empty()) {
      int cost = q.top().first;
      char nx = q.top().second.x, ny = q.top().second.y;
      char tSc = q.top().second.Sc;
      char ncx[3], ncy[3];
      rep(i, 3) ncx[i] = ncy[i] = 0;
      rep(i, csize) ncx[i] = q.top().second.cx[i], ncy[i] = q.top().second.cy[i];
      q.pop();
      if (res <= cost) break;
      BFS(nx, ny, ncx, ncy, tSc);
      if (bfscost[gy][gx] != -1) res = min(res, cost + bfscost[gy][gx]);
      rep(i, csize) if (!(tSc & (1 << i))) {
        rep(j, 4) {
          int tx = ncx[i] + dx[j];
          int ty = ncy[i] + dy[j];
          if (bfscost[ty][tx] == -1) continue;
          // rest of the code remains same
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", res == INT_MAX ? -1 : res);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that not all optimizations are applicable in all situations, and sometimes they may even lead to the code being more difficult to understand, so it's important to balance optimization with readability and maintainability.
