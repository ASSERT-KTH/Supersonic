This program performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) on a 2D grid. Here are some optimization steps:

1. Avoiding Recursion: The recursive DFS can be replaced by an iterative approach using a stack. This will remove the overhead of function calls and use less memory.

2. Reducing Condition Checks: The condition checks in the DFS can be reduced by ensuring the DFS never goes out of bounds. This can be done by adding a wall around the grid.

3. Avoiding Repeated Scans: The program scans the grid twice, once for finding the start position and once for counting the number of spaces. The space counting can be incorporated into the DFS.

4. Use Fast Input/Output: The scanf and printf functions can be replaced by faster input/output methods.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

#define rep(i, x) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(x); ++i)

int dx[] = {-1, 1, 0, 0}, dy[] = {0, 0, -1, 1};
char mp[22][24]; // Extra space for the wall
int H, W;

void dfs(int y, int x, int& cnt) {
  stack<pair<int, int>> stk;
  stk.push({y, x});

  while (!stk.empty()) {
    auto [y, x] = stk.top();
    stk.pop();
    if (mp[y][x] == '.')
        ++cnt;
    mp[y][x] = ' ';

    rep(i, 4) {
      int ny = y + dy[i], nx = x + dx[i];
      if (mp[ny][nx] == '.')
        stk.push({ny, nx});
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  
  while (cin >> W >> H, H || W) {
    int sy, sx, cnt = 0;
    rep(i, H + 2) fill(mp[i], mp[i] + W + 2, '#'); // Add wall
    
    rep(i, H) rep(j, W) {
      char& c = mp[i + 1][j + 1];
      cin >> c;
      if (c == '@')
        sy = i + 1, sx = j + 1, c = '.';
    }

    dfs(sy, sx, cnt);
    cout << cnt << '\n';
  }
}
```
Please note that this is a C++ solution, and the use of std::stack and std::pair is not available in C. If you want a C solution, you would need to implement a stack and pair-like structure yourself.
