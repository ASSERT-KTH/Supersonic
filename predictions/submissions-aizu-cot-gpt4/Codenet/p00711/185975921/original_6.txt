The given C/C++ program appears to be a Depth First Search (DFS) implementation on a 2D array. It's already quite optimized, but there are still a few possible improvements that could be made. Here's how we can optimize it:

1. **Avoid unnecessary calculations**: In the DFS function, you're currently recalculating `y + dy[i]` and `x + dx[i]` during each iteration. We can store these calculations in variables to avoid doing them twice.

2. **Reduce function call overhead**: Instead of calling DFS function recursively, we can use a stack and convert it into an iterative form to avoid function call overhead.

3. **Avoid unnecessary I/O operations**: Instead of using `scanf` and `printf`, we can use faster I/O operations like `getchar_unlocked` and `putchar_unlocked`.

Here is the optimized version of your program:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

#define rep(i, x) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(x); ++i)

int dx[] = {-1, 1, 0, 0}, dy[] = {0, 0, -1, 1};
char mp[20][22];
int H, W;

void dfs(int y, int x) {
  stack<pair<int, int>> stk;
  stk.push({y, x});

  while (!stk.empty()) {
    int cy = stk.top().first;
    int cx = stk.top().second;
    stk.pop();

    if (cy < 0 || cy >= H || cx < 0 || cx >= W || mp[cy][cx] == '#' || mp[cy][cx] == ' ')
      continue;

    mp[cy][cx] = ' ';

    rep(i, 4) {
      int ny = cy + dy[i];
      int nx = cx + dx[i];
      stk.push({ny, nx});
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  while (scanf("%d %d", &W, &H), H || W) {
    int sy, sx;
    rep(i, H) rep(j, W) {
      getchar_unlocked(); // consume newline character
      char c = getchar_unlocked();
      mp[i][j] = c;
      if (c == '@')
        sy = i, sx = j, mp[i][j] = '.';
    }
    dfs(sy, sx);
    int cnt = 0;
    rep(i, H) rep(j, W) if (mp[i][j] == ' ') cnt++;
    printf("%d\n", cnt);
  }
}
```

Note: `getchar_unlocked()` and `putchar_unlocked()` should be used carefully as they are not thread-safe. If your program is not multi-threaded, it should be fine to use them.
