This C++ program uses Depth First Search (DFS) to solve a maze-like problem. The optimization opportunities in this program are not very significant, but there are a few small steps that can be taken to slightly improve performance and memory usage.

1. Avoid unnecessary recursion: In the DFS function, it first marks the current cell as visited and then recursively calls itself for the four neighbors. This can lead to unnecessary recursion and stack usage when it encounters a cell that has already been visited. Instead of marking the cell as visited after the recursive calls, we can do it before them and avoid the recursive call altogether for already visited cells.

2. Reduce memory usage: The `mp` array is declared with a fixed size of `20x22`, which might be larger than necessary. If the values of `H` and `W` are always less than or equal to `20` and `22` respectively, then this is not a problem. But if they can be larger, we risk accessing beyond the array bounds, which is undefined behavior. To avoid this, we can declare `mp` with a size of `HxW` after reading these values.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

#define rep(i, x) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(x); ++i)
int dx[] = {-1, 1, 0, 0}, dy[] = {0, 0, -1, 1};
int H, W;

void dfs(int y, int x, char** mp) {
  if (y < 0 || y >= H || x < 0 || x >= W || mp[y][x] == '#' || mp[y][x] == ' ')
    return;
    
  mp[y][x] = ' ';

  rep(i, 4) dfs(y + dy[i], x + dx[i], mp);
}

int main() {
  while (scanf("%d %d", &W, &H), H || W) {
    int sy, sx;
    char** mp = new char*[H];
    rep(i, H) {
      mp[i] = new char[W];
      rep(j, W) {
        scanf("\n%c", &mp[i][j]);
        if (mp[i][j] == '@')
          sy = i, sx = j, mp[i][j] = '.';
      }
    }

    dfs(sy, sx, mp);

    int cnt = 0;
    rep(i, H) rep(j, W) if (mp[i][j] == ' ') cnt++;
    printf("%d\n", cnt);

    rep(i, H) delete[] mp[i];
    delete[] mp;
  }
}
```

Please note that this code now uses dynamic memory allocation for `mp` and it must be deallocated to prevent memory leaks. The `dfs` function now also takes `mp` as a parameter, because it's no longer a global variable.
