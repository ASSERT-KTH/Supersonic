This C/C++ program reads a 2D maze, finds a starting point, and then does a Depth First Search (DFS) to reach all possible points from the starting point. It counts the number of reachable points and prints out the count.

The original program seems already quite optimized. The improvements that can be made are minor and may not have a significant impact on the running time or memory usage. But here are some potential optimizations:

1. Instead of using the character array `mp` to mark visited locations, we can use a separate boolean array. This avoids the overhead of character manipulation and comparison, and boolean operations are faster.
2. We can optimize the DFS function by reducing the number of recursive calls. In the original program, the DFS function is called recursively for each direction (up, down, left, right) from the current location. However, we can optimize this by checking the validity of the next location in each direction before making the recursive call.
3. The counting of the empty spaces can be done directly in the DFS function. This will save us an extra loop over the maze in the main function.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, x) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(x); ++i)
int dx[] = {-1, 1, 0, 0}, dy[] = {0, 0, -1, 1};
char mp[20][22];
bool visited[20][22];
int H, W, cnt;
void dfs(int y, int x) {
  if (y < 0 || y >= H || x < 0 || x >= W || visited[y][x] || mp[y][x] == '#')
    return;
  visited[y][x] = true;
  cnt++;
  rep(i, 4) {
    int nx = x + dx[i];
    int ny = y + dy[i];
    if (ny >= 0 && ny < H && nx >= 0 && nx < W && mp[ny][nx] != '#' && !visited[ny][nx])
      dfs(ny, nx);
  }
}
int main() {
  while (scanf("%d %d", &W, &H), H || W) {
    int sy, sx;
    rep(i, H) {
      rep(j, W) {
        scanf("\n%c", &mp[i][j]);
        visited[i][j] = false;
        if (mp[i][j] == '@')
          sy = i, sx = j, mp[i][j] = '.';
      }
    }
    cnt = 0;
    dfs(sy, sx);
    printf("%d\n", cnt);
  }
}
```

Please note, these optimizations might not necessarily make the program run faster on all inputs or platforms. Always do performance testing to verify the optimizations.
