The program provided is already quite optimized, but there are still a few areas where we can improve performance and memory usage. 

1. The `dx` and `dy` arrays are defined globally but only used in the `dfs` function. We can define them inside `dfs` to reduce the scope and improve readability.

2. The `scanf` function is used to read input, which is slower than some alternatives. We can replace it with `getchar` for single character reading, which will be faster.

3. The counting of whitespace characters (`' '`) is done in a separate loop. We can count them in the same loop where we are doing the `dfs`.

4. The `while` loop condition is using the comma operator, which is not commonly used and might be confusing. We can split this into two separate statements for readability.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

#define rep(i, x) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(x); ++i)

char mp[20][22];
int H, W;

void dfs(int y, int x, int& cnt) {
  if (y < 0 || y >= H || x < 0 || x >= W || mp[y][x] == '#' || mp[y][x] == ' ')
    return;
  int dx[] = {-1, 1, 0, 0}, dy[] = {0, 0, -1, 1};
  mp[y][x] = ' ';
  cnt++;
  rep(i, 4) dfs(y + dy[i], x + dx[i], cnt);
}

int main() {
  while (true) {
    scanf("%d %d", &W, &H);
    if (H == 0 && W == 0) break;
    int sy, sx;
    int cnt = 0;
    getchar();  // consume newline
    rep(i, H) rep(j, W) {
      char c = getchar();
      mp[i][j] = c;
      if (c == '@')
        sy = i, sx = j, mp[i][j] = '.';
    }
    dfs(sy, sx, cnt);
    printf("%d\n", cnt);
  }
}
```

This program will have the same functionality as the original, but with a slight increase in performance and improved code readability.
