This program is already optimized significantly in many aspects. However, there are some points that can be further optimized in terms of running time and memory usage. Here are some possible optimizations:

1. First, the usage of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is not recommended. This header file includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can increase the compilation time and memory usage. Instead, you should only include the headers that you need. In this program, you only need `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<deque>` and `<algorithm>`. 

2. Remove the `typedef` statements and use `auto` keyword where possible. This will reduce code complexity and make it easier to read and maintain.

3. In `calc` function, you can get rid of the for loop by using a `std::for_each` or `std::transform` algorithm from STL.

4. Replace `deque<pint> deq;` with `deque<pair<int, int>> deq;`. This reduces the need for typedef and makes the code more readable.

5. In the main function, the lines `rep(i, 6)` and `rep(j, C[i])` can be replaced with range-based loops to improve readability.

Here is the optimized program:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <deque>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (n); i++)
#define all(v) (v).begin(), (v).end()
#define pb push_back
#define fi first
#define se second
template <typename A, typename B> inline void chmin(A &a, B b) {
  if (a > b)
    a = b;
}
int C[6] = {1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500};
int P;
int N[6];
const int T = 10000;
int dp[2][T];
int calc(int v) {
  int ans = 0;
  for_each(rbegin(C), rend(C), [&ans, &v](int c) {
    ans += v / c;
    v %= c;
  });
  return ans;
}
signed main() {
  while (cin >> P) {
    for(auto &n: N) cin >> n;
    if (P == 0)
      break;
    fill_n(*dp, 2 * T, 1001001001);
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 5; i >= 0; i--) {
      while (P - C[i] >= 2500 && N[i]) {
        cnt++;
        N[i]--;
        P -= C[i];
      }
      if (N[i])
        break;
    }
    dp[0][0] = 0;
    for(auto &c: C) {
      for(int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
        deque<pair<int, int>> deq;
        for (int k = j; k < T; k += c) {
          int w = T - k / c;
          chmin(dp[(i + 1) & 1][k], dp[i & 1][k]);
          while (deq.size() && deq.front().se + c * N[i] < k)
            deq.pop_front();
          if (deq.size())
            chmin(dp[(i + 1) & 1][k], deq.front().fi - w);
          deq.pb(pair<int, int>(dp[i & 1][k] + w, k));
        }
      }
    }
    int mi = 1001001001;
    for (int i = P; i < T; i++) {
      chmin(mi, dp[0][i] + calc(i - P));
    }
    cout << mi + cnt << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The code is more concise and readable now. The use of `auto` and range-based for loops reduces the need for macros and typedefs, and the program uses only necessary headers, which can reduce the compilation time and memory usage.
