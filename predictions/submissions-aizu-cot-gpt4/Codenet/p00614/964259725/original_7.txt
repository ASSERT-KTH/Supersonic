This code is already using a lot of good optimization techniques such as dynamic programming and deque for efficient queue operations. However, there are still a few areas where it can be optimized.

1. The "typedef" keyword is used in this code to define new data types. However, in modern C++, using "using" keyword is more preferred and readable. So we can replace typedef with using.

2. In the main function, a while loop is used to take input from the user. The condition for breaking the loop is P == 0. However, this check is done after a series of other operations, which will unnecessarily consume time if P is indeed 0. Therefore, it would be better to check if P is 0 right after taking user input.

3. The fill_n function is used to initialize all elements in dp array to a large number. Instead, we can use std::numeric_limits to get the maximum value for the data type and initialize the array with this value. This is more preferable and portable as it does not depend on hard-coded values.

4. In the main function, a for loop is used to calculate the minimum value among dp[0][i] + calc(i - P) for i from P to T. Instead of using a loop, we can use the min_element function from the STL, which would be faster and more efficient.

5. In some places in the code, the size() function of deque is used to check if it is empty. Instead of this, we can directly use the empty() function, which is more efficient and clear.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
using vll = vector<ll>;
using pll = pair<ll, ll>;
using vpll = vector<pll>;
constexpr ll C[6] = {1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500};
ll P;
ll N[6];
constexpr ll T = 10000;
ll dp[2][T];

ll calc(ll v) {
  ll ans = 0;
  for (int i = 5; i >= 0; --i) {
    ans += v / C[i];
    v %= C[i];
  }
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  while (true) {
    cin >> P;
    if (P == 0)
      break;
    for(ll &i : N) cin >> i;
    fill_n(*dp, 2 * T, numeric_limits<ll>::max());
    ll cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 5; i >= 0; i--) {
      while (P - C[i] >= 2500 && N[i]) {
        cnt++;
        N[i]--;
        P -= C[i];
      }
      if (N[i])
        break;
    }
    dp[0][0] = 0;
    for (ll i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
      for (ll j = 0; j < C[i]; j++) {
        deque<pll> deq;
        for (ll k = j; k < T; k += C[i]) {
          ll w = T - k / C[i];
          dp[(i + 1) & 1][k] = min(dp[(i + 1) & 1][k], dp[i & 1][k]);
          while (!deq.empty() && deq.front().second + C[i] * N[i] < k)
            deq.pop_front();
          if (!deq.empty())
            dp[(i + 1) & 1][k] = min(dp[(i + 1) & 1][k], deq.front().first - w);
          if (!deq.empty() && deq.front().second + N[i] * C[i] <= k)
            deq.pop_front();
          deq.push_back({dp[i & 1][k] + w, k});
        }
      }
    }
    ll mi = *min_element(dp[0] + P, dp[0] + T, [](ll a, ll b) { return a + calc(a - P) < b + calc(b - P); });
    cout << mi + cnt << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code should run faster and consume less memory than the original one.
