The program is a solution to a coin change problem, which gets an amount P, and a list of coins N with different denominations, and finds the minimal number of coins required to make up the amount P.

To optimize the program, we can do the following:

1. Remove unnecessary "#define" statements and unused macro definitions. Macros like "rep", "reps", "all", "each", "pb", "fi", "se", "vint", "pint", "vpint" are not used in the program, so we can remove them to enhance code readability and maintainability.
2. We could also replace the "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" statement with the specific libraries that are needed. It's generally not recommended to include bits/stdc++.h because it includes a lot of files which can lead to large compile time. Here we only need <iostream>, <vector>, <deque> and <algorithm>.
3. The array C is not modified and can be made constant to avoid accidental modifications.
4. The array dp is used as a two-dimensional array so it would be better to declare it as such for better understanding of the program.
5. The usage of "signed main()" is unnecessary because by default, the return type of main is int. We can replace "signed main()" with just "int main()".
6. The constant T appears to be the maximum possible value for the amount P, so it would be more appropriate to name it MAX_AMOUNT or similar.
7. The variable name "chmin" is not very descriptive. A more descriptive name such as "minimize" would improve code clarity.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <deque>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_AMOUNT = 10000;
const int INF = 1001001001;
const int COINS[6] = {1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500};
int num_coins[6];
int dp[6][MAX_AMOUNT];

template <typename A, typename B> 
inline void minimize(A &a, B b) {
  if (a > b)
    a = b;
}

int calc(int v) {
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 5; i >= 0; i--) {
    ans += v / COINS[i];
    v %= COINS[i];
  }
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  int P;
  while (cin >> P) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++)
      cin >> num_coins[i];
      
    if (P == 0)
      break;
      
    fill_n(*dp, 6 * MAX_AMOUNT, INF);
    int cnt = 0;
    
    for (int i = 5; i >= 0; i--) {
      while (P - COINS[i] >= 2500 && num_coins[i]) {
        cnt++;
        num_coins[i]--;
        P -= COINS[i];
      }
      if (num_coins[i])
        break;
    }
    
    dp[0][0] = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < COINS[i]; j++) {
        deque<pair<int, int>> deq;
        for (int k = j; k < MAX_AMOUNT; k += COINS[i]) {
          int w = MAX_AMOUNT - k / COINS[i];
          minimize(dp[(i + 1) % 6][k], dp[i % 6][k]);
          while (!deq.empty() && deq.front().second + COINS[i] * num_coins[i] < k)
            deq.pop_front();
          if (!deq.empty())
            minimize(dp[(i + 1) % 6][k], deq.front().first - w);
          if (!deq.empty() && deq.front().second + num_coins[i] * COINS[i] <= k)
            deq.pop_front();
          deq.push_back(make_pair(dp[i % 6][k] + w, k));
        }
      }
    }
    
    int mi = INF;
    for (int i = P; i < MAX_AMOUNT; i++) {
      minimize(mi, dp[0][i] + calc(i - P));
    }
    
    cout << mi + cnt << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version improves the clarity and readability of the code while preserving the original logic and functionality.
