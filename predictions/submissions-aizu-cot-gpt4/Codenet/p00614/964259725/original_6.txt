This program is already quite optimized, but there are still some elements that can be adjusted to potentially improve its performance:

1. **Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`**: This header file is quite large and contains almost all the standard C++ libraries. This can slow down the compilation time of the program. Instead, include only the libraries that are actually used in the program.

2. **Avoid using `using namespace std`**: This directive can potentially cause naming conflicts and make the program less readable.

3. **Use `constexpr` for constant arrays and variables**: The `constexpr` keyword tells the compiler that the value of a variable or array can be computed at compile time. This can potentially make the program run faster because it avoids calculating these values at runtime.

4. **Avoid using `deque` when unnecessary**: In this case, `deque` is used for its ability to pop elements from the front. However, the code also maintains an explicit index into the deque, which suggests that `deque` may not be necessary. A `vector` with an index can achieve the same functionality with potentially better performance.

5. **Avoid unnecessary `if` statements inside loops**: The line `if (deq.size() && deq.front().se + N[i] * C[i] <= k)` is within a loop and is checked even if the deque is empty. This can be avoided by checking if the deque is empty before the loop.

6. **Reduce repetitive calculations inside loops**: The calculation `deq.front().se + N[i] * C[i]` is repeatedly calculated inside a loop. This can be avoided by calculating it once and storing the result in a variable.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

#define int long long
typedef vector<int> vint;
typedef pair<int, int> pint;
typedef vector<pint> vpint;
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (n); i++)
#define reps(i, f, n) for (int i = (f); i < (n); i++)
#define all(v) (v).begin(), (v).end()
#define pb push_back
#define fi first
#define se second

constexpr int C[6] = {1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500};
int P;
constexpr int N[6];
constexpr int T = 10000;
int dp[2][T];

int calc(int v) {
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 5; i >= 0; i--) {
    ans += v / C[i];
    v %= C[i];
  }
  return ans;
}

signed main() {
  while (std::cin >> P) {
    rep(i, 6) std::cin >> N[i];
    if (P == 0)
      break;
    std::fill_n(*dp, 2 * T, 1001001001);
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 5; i >= 0; i--) {
      while (P - C[i] >= 2500 && N[i]) {
        cnt++;
        N[i]--;
        P -= C[i];
      }
      if (N[i])
        break;
    }
    dp[0][0] = 0;
    rep(i, 6) {
      rep(j, C[i]) {
        vector<pint> deq;
        for (int k = j; k < T; k += C[i]) {
          int w = T - k / C[i];
          dp[(i + 1) & 1][k] = min(dp[(i + 1) & 1][k], dp[i & 1][k]);
          while (!deq.empty() && deq.front().se + C[i] * N[i] < k)
            deq.erase(deq.begin());
          if (!deq.empty())
            dp[(i + 1) & 1][k] = min(dp[(i + 1) & 1][k], deq.front().fi - w);
          deq.pb(pint(dp[i & 1][k] + w, k));
        }
      }
    }
    int mi = 1001001001;
    for (int i = P; i < T; i++) {
      mi = min(mi, dp[0][i] + calc(i - P));
    }
    std::cout << mi + cnt << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations may not always lead to noticeable differences in runtime or memory usage, especially for small inputs. The actual impact will depend on the specific inputs and the hardware where the program is run.
