This program is already quite optimized in terms of algorithmic complexity, but there are still some small improvements that can be made to reduce memory usage and improve readability. Here are the steps:

1. The method `decomp(int root)` is called only once in the program with the argument `0`. The declaration of this function can be changed to `void decomp(void)` and the call to this function can be changed to `decomp();`. This will remove the unnecessary argument.

2. The `#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(n); i++)` preprocessor directive is used for creating a for loop. Instead of defining this preprocessor directive, we can use the for loop directly at the places of its usage. This will make the code more readable.

3. In the `decomp` function, there is a vector `tord` which is used to store the nodes in the order they are visited. Instead of storing the nodes in a vector and then iterating through the vector, we can directly perform the operations inside the first BFS loop. This will save memory usage as we don't need to store all the nodes in a vector.

4. The `vis` array is used to mark the nodes as visited in the BFS. Instead of resetting this array to `false` after the first BFS, we can use another array `vis2` to mark the nodes as visited in the second BFS. This will save some computation time as we don't need to reset the array.

5. In the main function, the parent of each node is set when reading the graph. But this is unnecessary as the parent of each node is already set in the `decomp` function.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int B = 200;
int color[100010], par[100010], depth[100010];
int top[100010];
int goUp[100010];
bool vis[100010], vis2[100010];
int n;
vector<vector<int>> g;

void decomp() {
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) vis[i] = false, par[i] = -1;
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(0);

  int c = 0;
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int v = q.front();
    q.pop();
    if (vis[v]) continue;
    vis[v] = true;

    int k = 0;
    queue<int> temp;
    temp.push(v);
    while (!temp.empty() && k < B) {
      int u = temp.front();
      temp.pop();
      vis2[u] = true;
      color[u] = c;
      goUp[u] = par[v];
      top[u] = v;
      k++;
      for (int c : g[u]) {
        if (!vis[c]) {
          temp.push(c);
          par[c] = u;
          depth[c] = depth[u] + 1;
        }
      }
    }
    while (!temp.empty()) temp.pop();
    c++;
  }
}

int solve(int u, int v) {
  while (color[u] != color[v]) {
    assert(u != -1 && v != -1);
    if (depth[top[u]] > depth[top[v]])
      u = goUp[u];
    else
      v = goUp[v];
  }
  while (u != v) {
    assert(u != -1 && v != -1);
    if (depth[u] > depth[v])
      u = par[u];
    else
      v = par[v];
  }
  return u;
}

int main() {
  cin >> n;
  g.assign(n, {});
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int k;
    cin >> k;
    for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      int c;
      cin >> c;
      g[i].push_back(c);
    }
  }
  decomp();
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    cout << solve(u, v) << endl;
  }
}
```
