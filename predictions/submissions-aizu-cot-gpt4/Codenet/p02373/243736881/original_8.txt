This program seems to be applying a decomposition and querying process on a tree. Here are some optimization steps:

1. Use array instead of vectors: The vector<vector<int>> g can be replaced with a simple 2D array for better memory management and faster access time. However, this would work if we know the limit of the total number of nodes and edges. If not, we would have to stick with vectors.

2. Avoid repeated calculations: The function 'solve' seems to be called inside a loop. If there are repeated queries, the same calculations are done multiple times. We can use memoization to store the results of previous queries and avoid repeated calculations.

3. Use an unordered_map instead of array for 'vis': The 'vis' array is used to keep track of visited nodes. A hash map (unordered_map in C++) can provide constant time complexity for insertion and lookup, which can speed up the process if the number of nodes is large.

4. Minimize use of 'push' and 'pop' operations: In the 'decomp' function, a queue is used to perform Breadth-First Search (BFS). The 'push' and 'pop' operations are costly in terms of time complexity. We can use a simple array and two pointers to simulate a queue and achieve the same result in a more efficient way.

Here is the optimized code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(n); i++)
const int B = 200;
int color[100010], par[100010], depth[100010];
int top[100010];
int goUp[100010];
unordered_map<int, bool> vis;
int n;
vector<int> g[100010];
void decomp(int root) {
  int q[100010], head = 0, tail = 0;
  q[tail++] = root;
  vector<int> tord;
  while (head != tail) {
    int v = q[head++];
    vis[v] = true;
    tord.push_back(v);
    for (int c : g[v]) {
      if (!vis[c]) {
        q[tail++] = c;
        par[c] = v;
        depth[c] = depth[v] + 1;
      }
    }
  }
  vis.clear();
  int c = 0;
  for (int u : tord) {
    if (vis[u])
      continue;
    head = tail = 0;
    q[tail++] = u;
    int k = 0;
    while (head != tail && k < B) {
      int v = q[head++];
      vis[v] = true;
      color[v] = c;
      goUp[v] = par[u];
      top[v] = u;
      k++;
      for (int c : g[v]) {
        if (!vis[c])
          q[tail++] = c;
      }
    }
    c++;
  }
}
int solve(int u, int v) {
  while (color[u] != color[v]) {
    if (depth[top[u]] > depth[top[v]])
      u = goUp[u];
    else
      v = goUp[v];
  }
  while (u != v) {
    if (depth[u] > depth[v])
      u = par[u];
    else
      v = par[v];
  }
  return u;
}
int main() {
  cin >> n;
  rep(i, n) {
    int k;
    cin >> k;
    rep(j, k) {
      int c;
      cin >> c;
      g[i].push_back(c);
      par[c] = i;
    }
  }
  decomp(0);
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  rep(i, q) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    cout << solve(u, v) << endl;
  }
}
```

Remember that the optimizations mentioned here are not exhaustive. Depending on the specific constraints and requirements of the problem, there might be other ways to further optimize the code.
