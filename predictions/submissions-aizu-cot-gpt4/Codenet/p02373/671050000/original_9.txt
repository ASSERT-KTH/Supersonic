The given C/C++ program seems to be about finding the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) for nodes in a heavy-light decomposition tree. Here are some steps to optimize it:

1. Reserve memory for vectors:
    - The `vector::push_back()` function, which is used to add elements to the vector, reallocates memory each time the capacity needs to be expanded. This can be expensive in terms of time. If the number of elements that will be added to the vector is known, then `vector::reserve()` can be called before adding elements to preallocate memory. This reduces the number of reallocations required, thus improving performance.

2. Avoid unnecessary calculations:
    - In the `lca()` function, the `pathRoot[path[a]]` and `pathRoot[path[b]]` are calculated twice in the loop condition and the loop body. This can be optimized by calculating these values once and storing them in variables.

3. Avoid iostream sync with stdio:
    - The `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` statement is used to uncouple C++'s iostream from C's stdio, which can significantly speed up iostream. However, after this statement is called, stdio (e.g., scanf, printf) cannot be mixed with iostream (e.g., cin, cout) in the program. If stdio is not used in the program, it's safe to call this.

Here's your optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define REP(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < int(n); ++i)
#define FOR(i, a, b) for (int i = int(a); i < int(b); ++i)
#define EACH(i, c) for (__typeof((c).begin()) i = (c).begin(); i != (c).end(); ++i)
#define ALL(A) A.begin(), A.end()
using namespace std;
struct HeavyLight {
  vector<vector<int>> len, tree;
  int pathCount, n;
  vector<int> size, parent, in, out, path, pathSize, pathPos, pathRoot;

  HeavyLight(vector<vector<int>> tree)
      : tree(tree), n(tree.size()), size(n), parent(n), in(n), out(n), path(n),
        pathSize(n), pathPos(n), pathRoot(n) {
    int time = 0;
    dfs(0, -1, time);
    buildPaths(0, newPath(0));
    len.reserve(pathCount);
    REP(i, pathCount) {
      int m = pathSize[i];
      len[i].reserve(2 * m);
      fill(ALL(len[i]), 0);
      fill(len[i].begin() + m, len[i].begin() + 2 * m, 1);
      for (int j = 2 * m - 1; j > 1; j -= 2)
        len[i][j >> 1] = len[i][j] + len[i][j ^ 1];
    }
  }

  void dfs(int u, int p, int &k) {
    in[u] = k++, parent[u] = p, size[u] = 1;
    EACH(v, tree[u]) if (*v != p) dfs(*v, u, k), size[u] += size[*v];
    out[u] = k++;
  }

  int newPath(int u) {
    pathRoot[pathCount] = u;
    return pathCount++;
  }

  void buildPaths(int u, int pt) {
    path[u] = pt, pathPos[u] = pathSize[pt]++;
    EACH(v, tree[u])
    if (*v != parent[u])
        buildPaths(*v, 2 * size[*v] >= size[u] ? pt : newPath(*v));
  }

  bool isAncestor(int p, int ch) {
    return in[p] <= in[ch] && out[ch] <= out[p];
  }

  int lca(int a, int b) {
    int root_a, root_b;
    while (!isAncestor(root_a = pathRoot[path[a]], b)) a = parent[root_a];
    while (!isAncestor(root_b = pathRoot[path[b]], a)) b = parent[root_b];
    return isAncestor(a, b) ? a : b;
  }
};

int main(void) {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<vector<int>> tree(n);
  REP(i, n) {
    int k;
    cin >> k;
    tree[i].reserve(k);
    REP(j, k) {
      int ch;
      cin >> ch;
      tree[i].push_back(ch);
    }
  }
  HeavyLight hl(tree);
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    cout << hl.lca(u, v) << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations may not result in a significant performance improvement if the input data is small. However, for larger data sets, these optimizations could potentially improve the program's performance.
