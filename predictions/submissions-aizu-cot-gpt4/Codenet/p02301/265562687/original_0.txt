This is a complex and lengthy program that performs a lot of geometric computations. However, there are still some small optimizations that can be done to improve the performance of the program.

1. Avoid using `std::endl`: Using `std::endl` not only inserts a newline character, but also flushes the output buffer which can be slow. Use "\n" instead.

2. Minimize use of `std::vector::push_back()`: Every time `push_back()` is called, it may cause the vector to reallocate its memory, which can be slow. This can be reduced by using `std::vector::reserve()` to allocate memory beforehand.

3. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This can speed up the I/O operations.

4. Use `std::vector::emplace_back()` instead of `std::vector::push_back()`: `emplace_back()` constructs the object in-place, thus avoiding unnecessary copy or move operations.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: For example, the program calculates the distance between two points multiple times when checking if a point is on a line, which can be optimized.

6. Use `constexpr` for constant expressions: This allows the compiler to calculate the value at compile-time, potentially resulting in faster code.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
constexpr double EPS = 1e-10;
constexpr double PI = 3.141592653589793238;
#define equals(a, b) (fabs((a) - (b)) < EPS)
#define int long long
...
signed main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  Polygon p(n);
  p.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> p[i];
  printf("%.12f\n", diameter(p));
  return 0;
}
```
This code is very similar to the original one but includes several small changes that should improve its performance.
