This program is already quite optimized in terms of data structures and algorithms used. However, few minor adjustments can be made to further optimize it:

1. Avoid Unnecessary Precision:
   The precision for the output is set to 12 decimal places. If this level of precision is not required, it can be reduced, thereby reducing the computational effort for such high precision calculations.

2. Avoid Unnecessary Calculations:
   The 'cross' function is called twice in the 'convex_hull' function. We can calculate this value once and store it in a variable to avoid duplicate calculations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define EPS (1e-10)
#define equals(a, b) (fabs((a) - (b)) < EPS)
#define PI 3.141592653589793238
#define int long long
using namespace std;
//...rest of the code...

Polygon convex_hull(Polygon ps) {
    int n = ps.size(), k = 0;
    sort(ps.begin(), ps.end());
    Polygon qs(n * 2);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        while (k > 1) {
            double crossValue = cross(qs[k - 1] - qs[k - 2], ps[i] - qs[k - 1]);
            if (crossValue <= 0) break;
            k--;
        }
        qs[k++] = ps[i];
    }
    for (int i = n - 2, t = k; i >= 0; i--) {
        while (k > t) {
            double crossValue = cross(qs[k - 1] - qs[k - 2], ps[i] - qs[k - 1]);
            if (crossValue <= 0) break;
            k--;
        }
        qs[k++] = ps[i];
    }
    qs.resize(k - 1);
    return qs;
}

signed main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    Polygon p(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> p[i];
    printf("%.6f\n", diameter(p));  //Reduced precision to 6 decimal places
    return 0;
}
```
Please note that the first optimization (reducing precision) may not be applicable in all cases, especially if high precision is required. The second optimization (avoiding duplicate calculations) should generally be applicable, and can slightly increase the speed of the program.
