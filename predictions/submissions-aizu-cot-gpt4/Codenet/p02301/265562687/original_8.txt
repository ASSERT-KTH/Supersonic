This is a geometric problem-solving code, which makes use of geometrical objects like points, lines, segments, and circles. The code is well written, but there are a few tweaks that can be done to optimize the code.

Optimization Steps:
1. Avoid using `#include<bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes most of the standard library headers and it increases the compilation time. It is better to include only those header files which are needed.
2. Reduce the scope of variables: In the `main()` function, the object 'p' of the 'Polygon' type is declared at the start but used much later. It is a good practice to declare variables as late as possible.
3. Use fast I/O operations: In competitive programming, using `scanf()` and `printf()` can save crucial time as they are faster than `cin` and `cout`.

Optimized Code:

```C++
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

#define EPS (1e-10)
#define equals(a, b) (fabs((a) - (b)) < EPS)
#define PI 3.141592653589793238
#define int long long
using namespace std;
static const int COUNTER_CLOCKWISE = 1;
static const int CLOCKWISE = -1;
static const int ONLINE_BACK = 2;
static const int ONLINE_FRONT = -2;
static const int ON_SEGMENT = 0;
//... Rest of the structures and functions

signed main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  scanf("%lld", &n); 

  Polygon p(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%lf %lf", &p[i].x, &p[i].y);

  printf("%.12f\n", diameter(p));
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program will perform faster than the original version. The use of `scanf()` and `printf()` will provide faster I/O operations. The declaration of the object 'p' is brought closer to its usage, making the code easier to read and understand.
