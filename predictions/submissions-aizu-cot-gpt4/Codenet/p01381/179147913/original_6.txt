The given program seems to be performing some operations and printing out results based on user input. However, there are places where we can optimize the code for improved performance and reduced memory usage. The optimizations include:

1. **Memory Allocation**: In the current program, an array `p` of size `n+2` is allocated for each iteration of the while loop. This memory is not being freed, causing a memory leak. Instead, we can dynamically allocate memory for array `p` and free it after each iteration.

2. **Redundant Calculations**: In the nested for loop, the same calculation `(p[j] + i) % n + 1` is repeated twice for the variables `a` and `b`. We can calculate it once, store the result in a variable, and reuse it.

3. **Optimized I/O**: The `printf` function is slower compared to `cout`. We can replace `printf` calls with `cout` for faster output.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, k;
  while (cin >> n >> k) {
    if (n / 2 < k) {
      cout << "-1\n";
      continue;
    }
    int* p = new int[n + 2];
    p[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i += 2) {
      p[i] = i / 2 + 1;
      p[i + 1] = n - p[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      if (i != 0)
        cout << "\n";
      for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
        int a = (p[j] + i) % n + 1;
        cout << a << " " << ((p[j + 1] + i) % n + 1) << "\n";
      }
    }
    delete[] p;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
