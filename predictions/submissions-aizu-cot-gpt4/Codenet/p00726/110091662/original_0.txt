Optimization steps:

1. Try to avoid unnecessary string copying and concatenation: In the original code, the `dfs` function creates a substring with `s.substr(i + 1, j - 1 - i - 1)`, then concatenates this substring to `r` for `n` times. This involves a lot of unnecessary copying and concatenating, which is costly in terms of time complexity. It's better to pass the string to the function by reference and use indices to access the substring directly.

2. Reduce string concatenation operations: In the original code, the program repeatedly concatenate `r0` to `r` for `n` times. Instead of doing this, it's more efficient to use `std::string::append` method to append `r0` to `r` for `n` times directly.

3. Avoid unnecessary string initialization: In the original code, `r` is initialized at the start of the `dfs` function, but in many cases, it's not used at all. It's better to initialize it when it's really needed.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int N;

string dfs(const string& s, int& i) {
  string r;
  long long n = -1;
  for (; i < s.size();) {
    if ('0' <= s[i] && s[i] <= '9') {
      if (n < 0)
        n = s[i] - '0';
      else
        n = n * 10 + s[i] - '0';
      i++;
    } else if (s[i] == '(') {
      if (n < 0) n = 1;
      int cnt = 1, j = i + 1;
      for (; cnt; j++) {
        if (s[j] == '(') cnt++;
        else if (s[j] == ')') cnt--;
      }
      int tmp = i + 1;
      string r0 = dfs(s, tmp);
      r.append(r0, 0, n * r0.size());
      n = -1;
      i = j;
    } else {
      if (n < 0) n = 1;
      r.append(n, s[i]);
      n = -1;
      i++;
    }
    if (r.size() > N)
      return r;
  }
  return r;
}

int main() {
  for (;;) {
    string s;
    cin >> s >> N;
    if (s == "0") break;
    int i = 0;
    string r = dfs(s, i);
    printf("%c\n", r.size() > N ? r[N] : '0');
  }
}
```
In this optimized version, the function `dfs` takes an additional reference parameter `i`, which is used to keep track of the current position in the string `s`. This allows us to pass `s` by reference and avoid creating substrings.

Note that this optimization mainly improves the running time of the program, but the memory usage is still dependent on the size of the input string and the number of recursive calls of `dfs`, which can be large for deeply nested parentheses.
