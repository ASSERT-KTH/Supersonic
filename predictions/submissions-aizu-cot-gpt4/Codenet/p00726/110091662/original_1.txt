The given code is a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm that builds a string based on a given input and then prints the Nth character of the final string. The main improvement area in the code is the unnecessary usage of string concatenation, which is inefficient, especially in a loop. It can be optimized by using a stringstream instead.

Here are the optimizations step by step:

1. Instead of using string concatenation for appending to string `r`, we will use `stringstream`. It is faster and more efficient because it doesn't need to constantly reallocate memory like string concatenation does.
2. The function `dfs` is taking a string parameter by value, which means a copy of the string is created every time the function is called. This can be improved by passing the string by const reference, since we're not modifying the input string.
3. The `substr` function in `dfs` also creates a new string. We can avoid this by passing start and end indices to the `dfs` function instead.
4. In the `main` function, we're using `cin` for input and `printf` for output. It's better to stick to one style, so we'll use `cout` for output.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int N;
stringstream output;

string dfs(const string& s, int start, int end) {
    int i = start;
    long long n = -1;
    while (i < end) {
        if ('0' <= s[i] && s[i] <= '9') {
            n = (n < 0) ? s[i] - '0' : n * 10 + s[i] - '0';
            i++;
        } else if (s[i] == '(') {
            if (n < 0) n = 1;
            int cnt = 1, j = i + 1;
            while (cnt) {
                if (s[j] == '(') cnt++;
                else if (s[j] == ')') cnt--;
                j++;
            }
            string r0 = dfs(s, i + 1, j - 1);
            for (int _ = 0; _ < n; _++) {
                output << r0;
                if (output.str().size() > N) return output.str();
            }
            n = -1;
            i = j;
        } else {
            if (n < 0) n = 1;
            output << string(n, s[i]);
            n = -1;
            i++;
        }
    }
    return output.str();
}

int main() {
    for (;;) {
        string s;
        cin >> s >> N;
        if (s == "0") break;
        string result = dfs(s, 0, s.size());
        cout << (result.size() > N ? result[N] : '0') << '\n';
    }
}
```

Note that this optimization reduces the memory usage and improves the running time of the program, but the general time complexity is still dependent on the input size and structure due to the nature of the DFS algorithm.
