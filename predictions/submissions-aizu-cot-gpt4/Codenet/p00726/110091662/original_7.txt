Here are the steps to optimize the given program:

1. Avoid string concatenation inside loops: String concatenation inside loops can be pretty expensive in terms of both, time and space complexity. In C++, every string concatenation results in the creation of a new string object, which involves memory allocation and can be slow. We can optimize this part by replacing string concatenation with `push_back` method which appends a character to the end of the string.

2. Avoid unnecessary substrings: Instead of creating a new substring in every recursion call, it would be beneficial to pass the start and end indices of the original string. This will reduce the memory used by the program since we are not creating a new string every time.

3. Avoid using `std::endl`: `std::endl` inserts a newline character into the output sequence and it flushes the output buffer. If the code is not dependent on the fact that your output buffer is flushed on each newline, then using "\n" instead can save you a lot of time in I/O operations.

Now, let's apply these steps to the given code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int N;
void dfs(string &s, int l, int r, string &out) {
  long long n = -1;
  for (int i = l; i < r; i++) {
    if ('0' <= s[i] && s[i] <= '9') {
      if (n < 0)
        n = s[i] - '0';
      else
        n = n * 10 + s[i] - '0';
    } else if (s[i] == '(') {
      if (n < 0)
        n = 1;
      int cnt = 1, j = i + 1;
      for (; cnt; j++) {
        if (s[j] == '(')
          cnt++;
        else if (s[j] == ')')
          cnt--;
      }
      string r0;
      dfs(s, i + 1, j - 1, r0);
      for (int _ = 0; _ < n; _++) {
        for (char c : r0) {
          out.push_back(c);
          if (out.size() > N)
            return;
        }
      }
      n = -1;
      i = j;
    } else {
      if (n < 0)
        n = 1;
      out += string(n, s[i]);
      n = -1;
    }
  }
}
int main() {
  while (true) {
    string s;
    cin >> s >> N;
    if (s == "0")
      break;
    string r;
    dfs(s, 0, s.size(), r);
    cout << (r.size() > N ? r[N] : '0') << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program should be faster and consume less memory than the original one.
