The program can be optimized mainly in two ways:

1. Pass string by reference in the expand function: The string is currently being passed by value to the function. This means that the entire string is copied each time, which can be quite expensive in terms of memory and CPU usage, especially for large strings. It's better to pass it by reference to avoid this overhead.

2. Avoid unnecessary string substr operations: The s and e variables are used to create a substring that is passed to the expand function. This is unnecessary and can be avoided by passing the start and end indices to the expand function instead.

Here is the optimized code with the above changes:

```c++
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int cket(const std::string &str, int i) {
  int n = 1;
  for (; i < str.size(); ++i) {
    if (str[i] == '(')
      n++;
    if (str[i] == ')')
      n--;
    if (n == 0)
      break;
  }
  return i;
}

int n;

char expand(const std::string &str, int s, int e) {
  char res = '0';
  for (int i = s; i < s + e && i < str.size(); ++i) {
    if (isdigit(str[i])) {
      int j = 1;
      while (isdigit(str[i + j]))
        j++;
      int num = std::atoi(str.substr(i, j).c_str());
      i = i + j;
      if (str[i] == '(') {
        int k = cket(str, i + 1);
        res = expand(str, i + 1, k - i - 1);
        i = k;
      } else {
        res = expand(str, i, 1);
      }
      for (int l = 1; l < num && res == '0'; ++l)
        res = expand(str, s, e);
    } else {
      if (n == 0) {
        return str[i];
      }
      n--;
    }
  }
  return res;
}

int main(void) {
  while (true) {
    std::string str;
    std::cin >> str >> n;
    if (str == "0" && n == 0)
      break;
    std::cout << expand(str, 0, str.size()) << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this is still a recursive function, so it will still consume a lot of stack memory for big inputs. If that is a concern, you might need to consider a different approach or algorithm.
