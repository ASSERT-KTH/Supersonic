The given code is a Depth-First Search(DFS) algorithm on a 2D board. The function DFS is recursively called, which can be heavy on the stack memory. It also iterates over the entire Board array to initialize it, which can be unnecessary if the size of the board is always known and limited. 

Here are the steps to optimize the code:

1. Change the recursive DFS to an iterative DFS using a stack to save memory and avoid stack overflow.

2. We can avoid initializing the entire Board array by using a map instead of an array. A map only stores the elements that are inserted into it, saving memory. However, this might slightly impact the access time. If the size of the board is known and limited, we might not need this step.

Here's the modified code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

map<pair<int, int>, int> Board;
bool isOK;
int xs, ys, xg, yg;

void DFS(int c, int x, int y) {
  stack<pair<int, int>> s;
  s.push({x, y});
  
  while (!s.empty()) {
    pair<int, int> p = s.top();
    s.pop();
    
    int x = p.first;
    int y = p.second;

    if (Board[{x, y}] != c) {
      continue;
    } else if (x == xg && y == yg) {
      isOK = true;
      return;
    }
    Board[{x, y}] = 0;
    s.push({x+1, y});
    s.push({x, y+1});
    s.push({x-1, y});
    s.push({x, y-1});
  }
}

int main() {
  int w, h;
  while (true) {
    cin >> w >> h;
    if (w == 0 && h == 0)
      break;
    isOK = false;
    Board.clear();
    cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;
    int n, c, d, x, y;
    cin >> n;
    for (int t = 0; t < n; t++) {
      cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
      int wb = 2 + (!d * 2);
      int hb = 2 + (d * 2);
      for (int i = 0; i < hb; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < wb; j++)
          Board[{x + j, y + i}] = c;
      }
    }
    DFS(Board[{xs, ys}], xs, ys);
    if (isOK)
      cout << "OK" << endl;
    else
      cout << "NG" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Remember that using a map instead of an array can impact performance due to the overhead of hashing and the non-continuous memory layout. If the size of the board is known and limited, it might be better to stick with the array and avoid initializing elements that will be overwritten soon.
