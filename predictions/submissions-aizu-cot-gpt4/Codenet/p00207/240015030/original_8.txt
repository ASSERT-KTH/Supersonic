The given C++ code is a Deep First Search (DFS) in a 2D grid problem. Here are the steps to optimize the code:

1. **Avoiding Global Variables**: It's better to avoid global variables in this case. Instead, we could pass them as function parameters. This would make the code easier to understand and less prone to errors.

2. **Optimizing DFS Calls**: Instead of making 4 calls for DFS function each time, we can use an array to optimize these calls.

3. **Optimizing the 2D grid Initialization**: Instead of initializing the 2D grid with two nested loops, we can use `memset` function to initialize the 2D grid with `-1`.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

const int MAX = 102;
int Board[MAX][MAX];
bool isOK;
int xs, ys, xg, yg;

const int dx[4] = {1, 0, -1, 0};
const int dy[4] = {0, 1, 0, -1};

void DFS(int c, int x, int y) {
    if (Board[x][y] != c) {
        return;
    } else if (x == xg && y == yg) {
        isOK = true;
        return;
    }
    Board[x][y] = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
        DFS(c, x + dx[i], y + dy[i]);
    }
}

int main() {
    int w, h;
    while (true) {
        cin >> w >> h;
        if (w == 0 && h == 0)
            break;
        isOK = false;
        memset(Board, -1, sizeof(Board));
        cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;
        int n, c, d, x, y;
        cin >> n;
        for (int t = 0; t < n; t++) {
            cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
            int wb = 2 + (!d * 2);
            int hb = 2 + (d * 2);
            for (int i = 0; i < hb; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < wb; j++)
                    Board[x + j][y + i] = c;
            }
        }
        DFS(Board[xs][ys], xs, ys);
        if (isOK)
            cout << "OK" << endl;
        else
            cout << "NG" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In the optimized version of the code, I introduced arrays `dx` and `dy` to optimize the recursive calls in the DFS function. This effectively reduces the number of lines of code and makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.

Also, I used `memset` to initialize the 2D grid array, which is more efficient than using two nested loops. It's also easier to understand and less error-prone.
