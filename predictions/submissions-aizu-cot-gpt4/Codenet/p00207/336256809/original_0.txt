This program seems to be a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm in a grid. It's hard to optimize the DFS part because it's just a recursive function. We can optimize the initialization of the 2D array (C) and the parts where the 2D array is updated.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. The 2D array C is always filled with 10 before reading the inputs. Instead of initializing it every time, we can initialize it once at the start of the program. This will reduce the running time when the program deals with multiple test cases.

2. The 2D array C is updated by two nested for-loops. We can replace these nested loops with std::fill, which is faster.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int C[102][102];

void meiro(int W, int H, int c) {
  if (C[W][H] != c) {
    return;
  }
  C[W][H] = -1;
  meiro(W - 1, H, c);
  meiro(W, H + 1, c);
  meiro(W + 1, H, c);
  meiro(W, H - 1, c);
}

int main() {

  // Initialize the array once at the start
  for (int i = 0; i < 102; i++) {
    std::fill(C[i], C[i] + 102, 10);
  }

  while (1) {
    int w, h;
    cin >> w >> h;
    if (w == 0 && h == 0) {
      break;
    }

    int xs, ys, xg, yg;
    cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int c, d, x, y;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
      if (d == 0) {
        for (int j = x; j < x + 4; j++) {
          std::fill(C[j] + y, C[j] + y + 2, c);
        }
      } else {
        for (int j = x; j < x + 2; j++) {
          std::fill(C[j] + y, C[j] + y + 4, c);
        }
      }
    }
    meiro(xs, ys, C[xs][ys]);
    if (C[xg][yg] == -1) {
      cout << "OK" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "NG" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimization depends on the compiler and hardware. Different compilers and hardware may result in different performance.
