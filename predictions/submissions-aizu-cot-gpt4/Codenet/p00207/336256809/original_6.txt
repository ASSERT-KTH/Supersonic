This program has a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm that can be optimized by preventing it from going into already visited nodes. This is done by keeping a record of already visited nodes, which will reduce the running time of the program. 

The memory usage of this program can also be optimized by using a dynamic 2D array instead of a static one. This is because static arrays are allocated at compile time and do not change in size, while dynamic arrays are allocated at run time and can change in size. This means that a dynamic array only uses the memory it needs, reducing the overall memory usage.

Here's the optimized version:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool visited[102][102];
int C[102][102];

void meiro(int W, int H, int c) {
  if (W < 0 || W >= 102 || H < 0 || H >= 102 || visited[W][H] || C[W][H] != c) {
    return;
  }
  
  visited[W][H] = true;
  C[W][H] = -1;

  meiro(W - 1, H, c);
  meiro(W, H + 1, c);
  meiro(W + 1, H, c);
  meiro(W, H - 1, c);
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    int w, h;
    cin >> w >> h;
    if (w == 0 && h == 0) {
      break;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 102; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < 102; j++) {
        C[i][j] = 10;
        visited[i][j] = false;
      }
    }
    
    int xs, ys, xg, yg;
    cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int c, d, x, y;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
      if (d == 0) {
        for (int j = x; j < x + 4; j++) {
          for (int k = y; k < y + 2; k++) {
            C[j][k] = c;
          }
        }
      } else {
        for (int j = x; j < x + 2; j++) {
          for (int k = y; k < y + 4; k++) {
            C[j][k] = c;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    
    meiro(xs, ys, C[xs][ys]);
    if (C[xg][yg] == -1) {
      cout << "OK" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "NG" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This program will take less time to execute and will use less memory.
