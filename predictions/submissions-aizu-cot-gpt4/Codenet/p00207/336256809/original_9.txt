This program seems to be a depth-first search maze solver. The main optimization that can be done in this code, to improve running time, is to add boundary checking in the function `meiro`. Without boundary checking, the function will do unnecessary recursion to the cells outside of the grid, which is a waste of time. 

As for memory usage, the 102x102 array `C` is larger than necessary. The maximum value of `w` and `h` is not given in the problem, but if we assume it's less than 102, we can reduce the size of the array.

Here are the steps for optimizing:

1. Add boundary checking in the `meiro` function to prevent unnecessary recursion.
2. Reduce the size of the array `C` to the maximum value of `w` and `h`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int C[100][100];
void meiro(int W, int H, int c, int maxW, int maxH) {
  if (W < 0 || H < 0 || W >= maxW || H >= maxH || C[W][H] != c) {
    return;
  }
  C[W][H] = -1;
  meiro(W - 1, H, c, maxW, maxH);
  meiro(W, H + 1, c, maxW, maxH);
  meiro(W + 1, H, c, maxW, maxH);
  meiro(W, H - 1, c, maxW, maxH);
}
int main() {
  while (1) {
    int w, h;
    cin >> w >> h;
    if (w == 0 && h == 0) {
      break;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < h; j++) {
        C[i][j] = 10;
      }
    }
    int xs, ys, xg, yg;
    cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int c, d, x, y;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
      if (d == 0) {
        for (int j = x; j < x + 4; j++) {
          for (int k = y; k < y + 2; k++) {
            C[j][k] = c;
          }
        }
      } else {
        for (int j = x; j < x + 2; j++) {
          for (int k = y; k < y + 4; k++) {
            C[j][k] = c;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    meiro(xs, ys, C[xs][ys], w, h);
    if (C[xg][yg] == -1) {
      cout << "OK" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "NG" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code should run faster and use less memory than the original.
