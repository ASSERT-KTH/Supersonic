Here are some optimization steps for the given C/C++ program:

1. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` after the main function to make the input/output operation faster.

2. Use `cout` instead of `printf` for consistency in the program and also because `cout` is slightly faster than `printf`.

3. Try to declare variables as late as possible, because in C++ the constructor is called at the point of declaration, not at the point of first use.

4. The `complex<double>` operation can be quite heavy for the program. Instead of creating a new `complex<double>` object and then calling `.imag()` and `.real()` on it, we can perform the operations directly.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  while (n--) {
    double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;
    cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by >> cx >> cy >> dx >> dy;
    
    double real = (bx - ax) * (dx - cx) - (by - ay) * (cy - dy);
    double imag = (bx - ax) * (cy - dy) + (by - ay) * (dx - cx);
    
    if (imag == 0)
      cout << "2\n";
    else if (real == 0)
      cout << "1\n";
    else
      cout << "0\n";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Note: Including `bits/stdc++.h` is not a good practice because it includes too many headers, which can slow down the compilation process. It's better to include only the necessary headers. However, as per your requirement of making small modifications, I haven't made this change.
