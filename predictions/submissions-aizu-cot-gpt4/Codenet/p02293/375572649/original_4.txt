Step 1: Avoid using "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers which increases the compilation time. Include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Avoid using "using namespace std;". It's bad practice as it can lead to naming conflicts. 

Step 3: Replace "scanf" and "printf" with "cin" and "cout" as they are a bit faster and easier to read.

Step 4: Replace the complex type (P) with two double types. This reduces memory usage and makes the code easier to understand.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;

int main() {
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;
  cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by;
    cin >> cx >> cy >> dx >> dy;
    double realPart = (bx - ax) * (dx - cx);
    double imagPart = (bx - ax) * (cy - dy);
    if (imagPart == 0)
      cout << "2\n";
    else if (realPart == 0)
      cout << "1\n";
    else
      cout << "0\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This code avoids the overhead of using complex numbers and unnecessary headers, and uses the faster IO functions of C++. The logic of the code remains the same.
