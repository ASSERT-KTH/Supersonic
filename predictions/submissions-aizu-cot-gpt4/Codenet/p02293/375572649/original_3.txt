Optimization steps:

1. Instead of using complex numbers and performing complex multiplication, we can use simple arithmetic operations to find the cross product and dot product of vectors. This will reduce the overhead of complex number operations, which can be quite significant.

2. The use of scanf and printf functions in C++ is not considered good practice. It's better to use cin and cout, which are more idiomatic to C++. However, cin and cout are slower than scanf and printf. To speed up cin and cout, we can use ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL).

3. The inclusion of all the standard library headers with #include <bits/stdc++.h> is a bad practice. It includes a lot of unnecessary code and increases compilation time. Instead, we should only include the required headers.

4. The 'using namespace std;' line can cause name conflicts in larger programs. It's better to use std:: before standard library functions and objects.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;
  while (n--) {
    std::cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by >> cx >> cy >> dx >> dy;
    double cross_product = (bx - ax) * (cy - dy) - (by - ay) * (cx - dx);
    double dot_product = (bx - ax) * (cx - dx) + (by - ay) * (cy - dy);
    if (std::abs(cross_product) < 1e-9)
      std::cout << "2\n";
    else if (std::abs(dot_product) < 1e-9)
      std::cout << "1\n";
    else
      std::cout << "0\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: We use a small tolerance (1e-9) instead of exact equality (== 0) to compare floating point numbers because of the precision errors in floating point arithmetic.
