The primary optimizations that can be made to this code involve reducing the memory usage and improving the input/output speed. 

1. Memory Usage: The complex type in C++ is a class that has two double members. This means that each complex object uses twice as much space as a double. In your code, you are using the complex type to store two doubles, which could be stored in two separate double variables instead.

2. Input/Output Speed: The functions `scanf` and `printf` are slower than their C++ counterparts `cin` and `cout`. However, in C++, you can use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to unsync the C++ standard streams with their C counterparts. This can make input/output operations faster.

3. Use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This is not considered a good practice because it includes too many headers, which increases the compilation time. It is better to include only the headers that you need.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;
  cin >> n;
  
  while (n--) {
    cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by;
    cin >> cx >> cy >> dx >> dy;
    double realPart = (bx - ax) * (dx - cx);
    double imagPart = (by - ay) * (cy - dy);

    if (imagPart == 0)
      cout << "2\n";
    else if (realPart == 0)
      cout << "1\n";
    else
      cout << "0\n";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
