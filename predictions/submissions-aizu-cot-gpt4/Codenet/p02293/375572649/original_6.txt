The given C/C++ program has a time complexity of O(n) and is already quite optimized. However, we can make a few minor changes to further optimize the program:

1. Instead of using `complex<double>` which can be quite expensive in terms of computation cost, we can directly calculate the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

2. The `printf` function has a higher overhead compared to `cout` in terms of performance. Instead of using `printf` multiple times, we can store the result in a variable and print it once at the end of each loop iteration.

3. `bits/stdc++.h` is quite heavy because it includes all the standard libraries, which increases the compilation time. It's better to include only those libraries that are really needed.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  while (n--) {
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf", &ax, &ay, &bx, &by);
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf", &cx, &cy, &dx, &dy);
    double real = (bx - ax) * (dx - cx);
    double imag = (bx - ax) * (cy - dy);
    int result;
    if (imag == 0)
      result = 2;
    else if (real == 0)
      result = 1;
    else
      result = 0;

    printf("%d\n", result);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program does the same job as the original one but with slight improvement in terms of speed and memory usage. Please note that the performance gain might not be significant for smaller inputs but it will be more visible for larger inputs.
