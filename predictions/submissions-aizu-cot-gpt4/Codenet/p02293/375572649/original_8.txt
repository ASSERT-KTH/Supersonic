Optimization Steps:

1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. It's generally not recommended to include `bits/stdc++.h` because it includes a lot of unnecessary headers which increases compile time. Instead, only include necessary headers.

2. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`. Although `scanf` and `printf` are faster, `cin` and `cout` are safer and more C++-like. And if you tie cin and cout and set stdio sync off, the speed of `cin` and `cout` will be almost as fast as `scanf` and `printf`.

3. Pre-calculate `bx - ax`, `by - ay`, `dx - cx`, and `cy - dy` to avoid multiple calculations of the same values. 

4. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(NULL);` to improve the I/O efficiency.

5. Reserve space for `vector<P>` if you know the size beforehand.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>
using namespace std;

typedef complex<double> P;

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
     
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    while (n--) {
        double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;
        cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by;
        cin >> cx >> cy >> dx >> dy;
        
        double bx_minus_ax = bx - ax;
        double by_minus_ay = by - ay;
        double dx_minus_cx = dx - cx;
        double cy_minus_dy = cy - dy;

        P k = P(bx_minus_ax, by_minus_ay) * P(dx_minus_cx, cy_minus_dy);
        
        if (k.imag() == 0)
            cout << "2\n";
        else if (k.real() == 0)
            cout << "1\n";
        else
            cout << "0\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This program should now run faster and use less memory than the original one.
