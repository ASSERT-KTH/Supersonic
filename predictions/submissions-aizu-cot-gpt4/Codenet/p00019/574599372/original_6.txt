The program calculates the factorial of a number using a loop. This method can be improved by using dynamic programming.

Here are the steps for optimization:

1. Use an array to store the factorial of numbers. This reduces the repeated multiplication operation for each number from 2 to n. The time complexity will be reduced from O(n^2) to O(n).

2. Use the property of factorial that n! = n * (n-1)!. So we can calculate the factorial of a number by multiplying the number with the factorial of the previous number. This saves memory as we don't need to store the factorial of all the previous numbers.

3. The variable 'i' is better to be declared inside the loop as it is not used outside the loop. Declaring variables in the smallest possible scope enhances readability and maintainability of the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
main() {
  long long a = 1;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    a *= i;
  }
  cout << a << endl;
}
```

This program reduces memory usage as it stores only the current factorial and not all the previous factorials. It also reduces time complexity as it performs multiplication operation only n times instead of n^2 times in the worst case scenario. The program also enhances readability and maintainability by declaring the variable 'i' inside the loop where it is used.
