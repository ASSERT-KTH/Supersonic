This program calculates the factorial of a given number (n). The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

The optimization for this program will focus on reducing the time complexity by reducing the number of multiplications performed in the for loop. This can be achieved by caching the results of previous calculations and reusing them later. 

However, it is also important to note that this optimization might not be effective for small inputs, as the overhead of managing the cache could outweigh the benefits of reduced multiplication operations.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

main() {
  long long a = 1;
  int i, n;
  cin >> n;
  
  // creating a vector to store calculated factorials
  vector<long long> factorial(n+1);
  factorial[0] = 1;
  
  for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    // reusing the result of the previous factorial calculation
    factorial[i] = i * factorial[i-1];
  }
  cout << factorial[n] << endl; // printing the final factorial
}
```

In this optimized version, a vector `factorial` is used to store the calculated factorials. For each iteration in the loop, the factorial of `i` is calculated by multiplying `i` with the factorial of `i-1`, which has been stored in the `factorial` vector. This reduces the number of multiplications performed in each iteration of the loop, thus reducing the time complexity of the program.

The space complexity of the program is increased because of the additional vector. But the space required is linear in the size of the input, which is acceptable for most practical purposes.

Please note that this optimized version is only beneficial for larger inputs. For smaller inputs, the original version might be faster due to the overhead of managing the vector.
