The given program calculates the factorial of a number using a simple loop. This is a fairly optimized algorithm for calculating a factorial.

However, there are a couple of small optimizations that can be done:

1. You can use `++i` instead of `i++` in the loop. This will avoid the creation of a temporary variable which is the case with `i++`.

2. You can declare `i` inside the for loop itself. This will limit the scope of `i` to the loop only and free up memory as soon as the loop is finished.

3. The return type of the main function is not specified, it should be `int`.

4. The `#include <cstdio>` is redundant here since we are not using any function from this library in our code.

5. The variable `a` can be renamed to something more meaningful like `factorial`.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  long long factorial = 1;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
    factorial *= i;
  }
  cout << factorial << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations are quite small and may not make a significant difference in the running time and memory usage of the program. The main algorithm of calculating a factorial using a loop is already quite efficient.
