The given program uses path compression and union by rank for disjoint set operations. The program is already optimized in terms of time complexity. However, there are still some improvements that can be made in terms of memory usage and code readability.

1. **Use std::vector instead of new[]**: It's better to use std::vector instead of raw arrays in C++. std::vector automatically handles memory deallocation when it goes out of scope and it also provides a lot of built-in functions which makes it easier to use.

2. **Avoid using global variables**: Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in the program, which can lead to unintended side effects. It's better to pass them as arguments to functions where they are needed.

3. **Remove unused includes and defines**: The program includes several libraries and defines several constants that are not used. We can remove these to make the code cleaner.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int get_boss(int id, vector<int>& boss) {
  if (boss[id] == id) {
    return id;
  } else {
    return boss[id] = get_boss(boss[id], boss);
  }
}

bool is_same(int x, int y, vector<int>& boss) { 
  return get_boss(x, boss) == get_boss(y, boss); 
}

void unite(int x, int y, vector<int>& boss, vector<int>& height) {
  int boss_x = get_boss(x, boss);
  int boss_y = get_boss(y, boss);
  if (boss_x == boss_y)
    return;
  if (height[x] > height[y]) {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
  } else if (height[x] < height[y]) {
    boss[boss_x] = boss_y;
  } else {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
    height[x]++;
  }
}

int main() {
  int N, Q, command, x, y;
  scanf("%d %d", &N, &Q);
  vector<int> boss(N);
  vector<int> height(N, 1);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    boss[i] = i;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d %d", &command, &x, &y);
    if (command == 0) {
      unite(x, y, boss, height);
    } else {
      printf(is_same(x, y, boss) ? "1\n" : "0\n");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
