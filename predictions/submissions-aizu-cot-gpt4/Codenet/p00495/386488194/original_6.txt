Let's go through the optimization process step by step:

1. **Variable Declaration**: In the original code, the type of several variables is not defined. This is not a good practice and may lead to unexpected behavior. We should declare the type of variables properly.

2. **Unused Variable 'm'**: The variable 'm' is used to store the maximum value. However, after storing the max value, it is immediately overwritten to store the result of a printf function call which is not used anywhere. So, the statement 'm = !printf(f, m);' can be changed to 'printf(f, m);' to save both time and space.

3. **scanf and printf**: scanf and printf are slower compared to cin and cout. So, we can replace them with cin and cout for faster I/O. 

4. **Global variables**: The variables declared globally at the beginning of the program are not a good practice for optimization. It's better to declare them only when they are needed.

5. **Nested Loops**: The nested loops in the original program greatly increased the time complexity. If possible, we should try to reduce the number of nested loops.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int c[5004], d[5004], t, u, i;
  cin >> t;
  for(i = 0; i < t; i++)
    cin >> c[i];
  int m = 0;
  int x;
  while(cin >> x){
    for (u = i = 0; i < t; i++) {
      int temp = d[i];
      d[i] = max(m, u);
      if(x == c[i]) 
        u = temp + 1;
      m = max(m, d[i]);
    }
  }
  cout << m << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the program's logic may depend on the specific problem it attempts to solve. Therefore, there might be a necessity to preserve some structures (like nested loops) if the problem's nature requires it.
