This C program is quite cryptic and hard to read, mainly due to the use of single-letter variable names and unconventional coding style. However, it appears to be a variant of the longest increasing subsequence problem, where the sequence is read from standard input. The program uses two arrays, `c` and `d`, to store the input sequence and the current maximum lengths of the subsequences, respectively.

Here are the steps to optimize this program:

1. Use meaningful variable names: This will not change the runtime or memory usage of the program, but it will make it much easier to understand and maintain.

2. Use `int` type for function return and input types explicitly.

3. Initialize your variables: The program currently relies on the fact that global variables in C are automatically initialized to zero. However, it's generally a good practice to initialize your variables explicitly. It makes the code more robust and less prone to bugs.

4. I see some unnecessary operations like `m = !printf(f, m);` which does not seem to contribute to the program's functionality and can be removed.

5. Avoid the use of magic numbers. Define constants instead of using numbers such as 5004 directly in your code. 

6. Use `std::vector` if you're allowed to use C++ features, because arrays in C++ don't have bounds checking, leading to potential overflows.

Here's the optimized version of your program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_SIZE 5004

int inputSequence[MAX_SIZE], maxLengths[MAX_SIZE], maxSeqLength, temp, seqSize, i;

int main() {
  for (scanf("%d%*d", &inputSequence[0]); i < inputSequence[0]; scanf("%d\n", &inputSequence[++i]))
    ;
  for (; ~scanf("%d\n", &temp);)
    for (seqSize = i = maxSeqLength = 0; i++ < inputSequence[0]; maxLengths[i] = maxSeqLength < seqSize ? maxSeqLength = seqSize : seqSize)
      seqSize = temp - inputSequence[i] ? seqSize : maxLengths[i] + 1;
  printf("%d\n", maxSeqLength);
  
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this optimization does not improve the time complexity of the original code, which seems to be O(n^2). If you need to optimize the program further in terms of time complexity, you may need to consider a more efficient algorithm, such as the binary search method for the longest increasing subsequence problem, which has a time complexity of O(n log n).
