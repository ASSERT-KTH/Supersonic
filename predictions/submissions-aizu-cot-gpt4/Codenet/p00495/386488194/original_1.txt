This program is tough to optimize without a complete rewrite because it has several issues including poor variable naming, lack of function decomposition, and a lack of comments that make it difficult to understand what the program is doing.

However, there are a few small changes that can be made to improve the program's efficiency:

1. Reduce the size of the arrays if possible. The arrays `c` and `d` are both of size 5004. If this size is not needed, reducing it will save memory.
2. Use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf` for input/output to improve readability.
3. The loop `for (; ~scanf(f, &x);)` is tricky because it uses bitwise NOT operator on the return value of `scanf`. It's better to use a while loop with a clearer condition.
4. The conditional assignment `m = u < m ? m = u : u` can be replaced with a simple `if` statement to improve readability and prevent unnecessary assignments.

Here is an optimized version of your program with these changes applied:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int c[5004], d[5004], m, t, u, i;
int main() {
  std::cin >> c[0];
  for (i = 1; i < c[0]; ++i)
    std::cin >> c[i];

  int x;
  while (std::cin >> x) {
    for (u = i = t = 0; i < c[0]; t = d[i], d[i] = std::max(m, u), ++i)
      u = x - c[i] ? u : t + 1;
    if (u > m)
      m = u;
  }
  std::cout << m << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program is more readable and should be more efficient, especially if the size of the arrays `c` and `d` can be reduced.
