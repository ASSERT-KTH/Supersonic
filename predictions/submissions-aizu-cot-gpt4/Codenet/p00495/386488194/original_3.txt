The given program is a bit difficult to understand due to its complex structure and lack of descriptive variable names. However, the program seems to be a kind of dynamic programming solution. 

In order to optimize the program, we can follow these steps:

1. Use `std::vector` instead of arrays: In C++, we usually prefer `std::vector` over traditional C-style arrays because they are more flexible and safe.

2. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This line can help to speed up I/O operations in some cases.

3. Use `std::endl` sparingly, as it forces a flush operation which can slow down the program.

4. Use meaningful variable names: This won't necessarily optimize the runtime or memory usage, but it will make the code easier to understand and maintain.

5. Avoid using global variables: This helps to make the code cleaner and easier to debug.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);

    int size, x;
    std::cin >> size;

    std::vector<int> c(size+1), d(size+1);
    for(int i = 1; i <= size; ++i) {
        std::cin >> c[i];
    }

    int m = 0, t = 0, u = 0;
    while(std::cin >> x) {
        for (int i = 0; i++ < size; t = d[i], d[i] = std::min(m, u)) {
            u = (x - c[i]) ? u : t + 1;
        }
    }
    std::cout << m << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

Note: This is a basic optimization. Depending on the specific problem that this code is trying to solve, there might be other more advanced algorithmic optimizations possible.
