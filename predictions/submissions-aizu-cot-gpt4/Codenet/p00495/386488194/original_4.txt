The given C program is not well-structured and it's hard to understand what it does. However, there are some optimizations can be done based on the existing code:

1. Remove the global variables and declare them inside the main function. Global variables are generally avoided as they can lead to confusing code. In this case, we can make them local to the main function.

2. Use meaningful variable names. This aids in code readability and understanding.

3. Add more checks for scanf to ensure it has read the correct number of arguments.

4. The printf function returns the number of characters that are printed. So, no need to assign the return value to `m`.

5. The statement `m = !printf(f, m);` seems to be unnecessary. The logical NOT operation on printf's return value is assigned to `m`, but `m` is not used afterwards.

6. Use int for the main function's return type and parameter.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int count[5004], diff[5004], max_diff = 0, temp = 0, max_temp = 0, index = 0;
    char format[] = "%d\n";

    for (scanf("%d%*d", count); index < *count; scanf(format, ++index + count))
        ;

    int num;
    for (; ~scanf(format, &num);)
        for (max_temp = index = temp = 0; index++ < *count; temp = diff[index], diff[index] = max_diff < max_temp ? max_diff = max_temp : max_temp)
            max_temp = num - count[index] ? max_temp : temp + 1;

    printf(format, max_diff);

    return 0;
}
```

Please note that this optimized code is based on the provided code. There might be logical errors in the initial code that are preserved in the optimized version. Without a clearer understanding of the intended functionality, it's hard to provide a more accurate optimization.
