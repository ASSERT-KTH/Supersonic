This program calculates the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between two sequences. However, the code is written in a very obscure and unreadable way. The biggest issue is the lack of readability, which makes it hard to maintain and understand.

Here are some steps we can take to optimize this program:

1. Use meaningful variable names.
2. Initialize all variables properly.
3. Use standard function signature for main.
4. Use array index instead of pointer arithmetic.
5. Remove unnecessary input read.
6. Use standard I/O functions correctly.
7. Use std::max function instead of ternary operator for maximum.
8. Use std::vector instead of C-style arrays - this ensures automatic memory management.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    int arraySize;
    std::cin >> arraySize;

    std::vector<int> sequence1(arraySize), sequence2(arraySize);
    for(int& num : sequence1)
        std::cin >> num;

    int num;
    while(std::cin >> num) {
        sequence2.push_back(num);
    }

    std::vector<int> dp(arraySize+1);
    for(int x : sequence2) {
        int maxSoFar = 0, prev;
        for(int i=0; i<arraySize; i++) {
            prev = dp[i];
            if(x == sequence1[i])
                dp[i] = maxSoFar + 1;
            else if(maxSoFar < dp[i])
                maxSoFar = dp[i];
            dp[i] = prev;
        }
    }

    std::cout << *std::max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end()) << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

This code is easier to understand and maintain, and the use of std::vector and std::max_element ensures efficient memory management and computation.
