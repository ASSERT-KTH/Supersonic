The given program does not follow good programming practices. For instance, the single character variable names are not meaningful and make the code harder to follow. Also, using a pointer to an integer as an array is not a good practice. Though this is not a complete rewrite, these basic changes would make the program much more readable and efficient.

The first for loop scans the number of integers to be inputted and their values. The second for loop and the nested for loop calculate the maximum length of the sequence of the same number.

Here are steps of the optimization:

1. Use meaningful variable names. This makes it easier to understand what each variable is used for.
2. Use standard function prototypes. Define `main()` as `int main(void)` and return 0 at the end of the function. This is a good programming practice.
3. It's not necessary to declare `f` as a string variable. It can be replaced directly by its value `"%d\n"`.
4. The variable `m` is used to store the maximum length of the sequence. It's initially set to 0 and gets updated in the nested loop. It should be re-initialized to 0 at the beginning of each iteration of the second for loop, not at the end of the program.
5. The array indices should start from 0 as per C/C++ standard practice. So, `i` should be initialized as 0 and used as `i++` in the loop condition.

Now, let's rewrite the program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int numCount[5004], maxLength[5004], maxSequence = 0, current, i, tmp;
    
    for (scanf("%d", &numCount[0]), i = 1; i < numCount[0]; scanf("%d", &numCount[i++]));
    
    while(scanf("%d", &current) != EOF) {
        maxSequence = 0;
        for (i = 0; i < numCount[0]; tmp = maxLength[i], maxLength[i] = maxSequence < tmp ? maxSequence = tmp : tmp, maxSequence = current - numCount[i++] ? maxSequence : tmp + 1);
        printf("%d\n", maxSequence);
        maxSequence = 0;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
This program is more readable, easier to understand, and follows good programming practices.
