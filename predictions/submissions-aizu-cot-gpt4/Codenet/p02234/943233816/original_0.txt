The given program is already quite efficient, but there are small tweaks that can be done for a slight performance improvement.

1) The first optimization is to use the pre-increment operator instead of the post-increment operator where applicable. In C/C++, a post-increment involves a temporary object, which results in slight overhead. It makes no significant difference for basic types, but it's a good practice to stick with pre-increment where the result of the operation isnâ€™t used.

2) The second optimization is to reduce the scope of variables as much as possible. If a variable is only used in a specific loop or if/else branch, declare it there.

3) The third optimization is about avoiding unnecessary computations and memory reads. In the innermost loop, we are reading `p[i - 1]` and `p[j]` from memory in each iteration, even though their values do not change during the loop. We can read these values into variables before the loop, which might give a slight performance improvement on some systems due to less memory access.

Here is the optimized version of your program:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#define INF 100000000
int m[101][101];
int p[101];
int matrixChainOrder(int pl) {
  int n = pl - 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    m[i][i] = 0;
  }
  for (int l = 2; l <= n; ++l) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n - l + 1; ++i) {
      int j = i + l - 1;
      m[i][j] = INF;
      int pi_1 = p[i - 1], pj = p[j];
      for (int k = i; k < j; ++k) {
        int q = m[i][k] + m[k + 1][j] + pi_1 * p[k] * pj;
        if (m[i][j] > q)
          m[i][j] = q;
      }
    }
  }
  return m[1][n];
}
int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &p[i]);
    if (i < n - 1) {
      int k;
      scanf("%d", &k);
    }
  }
  scanf("%d", &p[n]);
  int x = matrixChainOrder(n + 1);
  printf("%d\n", x);
  return 0;
}
```

Remember, these optimizations are quite minor and may not lead to noticeable improvements in this particular program depending on the compiler and the system it's run on. But they are good practices to follow. The primary improvement here is more in terms of code quality than raw performance.
