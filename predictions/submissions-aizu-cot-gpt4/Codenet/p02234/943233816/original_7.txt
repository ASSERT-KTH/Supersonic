The existing code is already a dynamic programming solution which is efficient. However, there are a few small optimizations that can be done.

1. Precompute the multiplications: Instead of calculating the multiplication of `p[i - 1] * p[k] * p[j]` inside the innermost loop, we can precalculate and store them in a separate array. This will reduce the time complexity of the innermost loop.

2. Use scanf return value: Instead of using 'if' condition inside the loop in the main function, we can use the return value of scanf to identify if the input was successful or not. This will make the code more efficient and concise.

Here's the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define INF 100000000
int m[101][101];
int p[101];
int precomputed[101][101][101];

int matrixChainOrder(int pl) {
  int n = pl - 1;

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    m[i][i] = 0;
  }

  for (int l = 2; l <= n; l++) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n - l + 1; i++) {
      int j = i + l - 1;
      m[i][j] = INF;
      for (int k = i; k < j; k++) {
        int q = m[i][k] + m[k + 1][j] + precomputed[i][k][j];
        if (m[i][j] > q)
          m[i][j] = q;
      }
    }
  }
  return m[1][n];
}

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &p[i]);
    for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
      for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
        precomputed[i][j][k] = p[i - 1] * p[k] * p[j];
      }
    }
  }
  scanf("%d", &p[n]);
  int x = matrixChainOrder(n + 1);
  printf("%d\n", x);
  return 0;
}
```

Note:
This optimization may not significantly improve the performance if the number of dimensions 'n' is small. In fact, it can potentially increase memory usage due to the precomputed array, especially if 'n' is large. Therefore, this kind of optimization needs to be applied judiciously, based on the specific constraints and requirements of your problem.
