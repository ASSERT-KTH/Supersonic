The given C/C++ program is already quite optimized, but there are still a few areas where we can make small improvements.

1. Redundant Scanf: In the main function, there's a redundant scanf statement that can be removed, thus reducing the number of I/O operations.

2. Use of Constants: Instead of using the number 101 directly in the code, it's better to define it as a constant. This way, if we want to change the value in the future, we only need to modify it in one place.

3. Variable Initialization: Variables 'i', 'j', 'l', 'k', and 'q' are declared but not initialized at once. Initializing them with a value during their declaration can make the program more efficient and easy to understand.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#define INF 100000000
#define MAX 101

int m[MAX][MAX];
int p[MAX];

int matrixChainOrder(int pl) {
  int n = pl - 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    m[i][i] = 0;
  }
  for (int l = 2; l <= n; l++) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n - l + 1; i++) {
      int j = i + l - 1;
      m[i][j] = INF;
      for (int k = i; k < j; k++) {
        int q = m[i][k] + m[k + 1][j] + p[i - 1] * p[k] * p[j];
        if (m[i][j] > q)
          m[i][j] = q;
      }
    }
  }
  return m[1][n];
}

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &p[i]);
  }
  int x = matrixChainOrder(n + 1);
  printf("%d\n", x);
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program not only reduces the number of I/O operations but also makes the code cleaner and easier to read. It also improves the memory efficiency by using a constant instead of a direct number.
