The program provided is using a tabulation based dynamic programming approach to solve the matrix chain multiplication problem. The optimization can be done in terms of running time and memory usage. Here's how:

1. Running Time: The running time of the program can be optimized slightly by reducing the number of operations in the innermost loop. The multiplication `p[i - 1] * p[k] * p[j]` is done for every `k` in the range `i` to `j`, even though `p[i - 1] * p[j]` remains the same for a given `i` and `j`. We can calculate `p[i - 1] * p[j]` once outside the `k` loop and reuse it.

2. Memory Usage: The memory usage can be optimized by using a 1D array instead of a 2D array for `m`. However, this would require a larger modification of the program and could make it less clear.

Now, let's apply the running time optimization to the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define INF 100000000
int m[101][101];
int p[101];
int matrixChainOrder(int pl) {
  int n, i, j, l, k, q;
  n = pl - 1;
  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    m[i][i] = 0;
  }
  for (l = 2; l <= n; l++) {
    for (i = 1; i <= n - l + 1; i++) {
      j = i + l - 1;
      m[i][j] = INF;
      int pj_pi = p[i - 1] * p[j];  // calculate once outside k loop
      for (k = i; k < j; k++) {
        q = m[i][k] + m[k + 1][j] + pj_pi * p[k];
        if (m[i][j] > q)
          m[i][j] = q;
      }
    }
  }
  return m[1][n];
}
int main() {
  int n, i, x, k;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &p[i]);
    if (i < n - 1)
      scanf("%d", &k);
  }
  scanf("%d", &p[n]);
  x = matrixChainOrder(n + 1);
  printf("%d\n", x);
  return 0;
}
```

By doing this, we've decreased the number of multiplications in the innermost loop from 3 to 2, which should result in a slight increase in running time performance.
