The given C/C++ program is already quite optimized. However, there are still a few improvements that can be made:

1. Use prefix increment in loops instead of postfix increment: In C/C++, prefix increment (++i) is generally faster than postfix increment (i++) as it doesn't require a temporary variable to hold the value of the variable. This change can lead to a small performance improvement.

2. Store the result of 'W * vw[i]': Instead of calculating 'W * vw[i]' twice, you can store the result in a variable and use that variable in the if condition and the calculation of 'sum1'. This can save a few operations.

3. Avoid using 'double' cast: The cast to double in the calculation of 'sum2' is unnecessary as the division of two doubles will always result in a double. 

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define MAX 100001
#define inf 1e9
using namespace std;
int n, pw;
double vw[MAX], pf[MAX], vf[MAX], th[MAX];
double f(double W) {
  double cost = W * pw;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    double W_vw = W * vw[i];
    if (W_vw > th[i])
      continue;
    double sum1 = th[i] - W_vw;
    double sum2 = sum1 / vf[i];
    cost += sum2 * pf[i];
  }
  return cost;
}
int main() {
  while (1) {
    cin >> n >> pw;
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      cin >> vw[i] >> pf[i] >> vf[i] >> th[i];
    double l = 0, r = inf;
    for (int i = 0; i < 200; ++i) {
      double m1 = (l * 2.0 + r) / 3.0;
      double m2 = (l + r * 2.0) / 3.0;
      double res1 = f(m1);
      double res2 = f(m2);
      if (res1 < res2)
        r = m2;
      else
        l = m1;
    }
    printf("%.4f\n", f(l));
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations will not drastically improve the performance of your program, but they can lead to minor improvements in speed and memory usage.
