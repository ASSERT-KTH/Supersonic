This C++ program is already quite efficient. However, there are a few minor optimizations that can be made.

1. Reduce the scope of variables: In the original code, variables m1, m2, res1, and res2 are created in every iteration of the for loop in the main() function. We can declare these variables before the loop starts to avoid recreating them in every iteration.

2. Avoid division: The division operation is considered more costly than multiplication in terms of processing time. In the f() function, we can replace "sum1 / (double)vf[i]" with "sum1 * (1.0 / vf[i])".

3. Use fast I/O methods: cin and cout are slower compared to scanf and printf. To make the input-output operations faster, we can use scanf and printf instead of cin and cout. Also, we can use ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL) to make cin and cout faster.

Here is the optimized version of the given C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define MAX 100001
#define inf 1e9
using namespace std;
int n, pw;
double vw[MAX], pf[MAX], vf[MAX], th[MAX];
double f(double W) {
  double cost = W * pw;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (W * vw[i] > th[i])
      continue;
    double sum1 = th[i] - W * vw[i];
    double sum2 = sum1 * (1.0 / vf[i]);
    cost += sum2 * pf[i];
  }
  return cost;
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  double m1, m2, res1, res2; // Reduce the scope of variables
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &pw);
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf", &vw[i], &pf[i], &vf[i], &th[i]);
    double l = 0, r = inf;
    for (int i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
      m1 = (l * 2.0 + r) / 3.0;
      m2 = (l + r * 2.0) / 3.0;
      res1 = f(m1);
      res2 = f(m2);
      if (res1 < res2)
        r = m2;
      else
        l = m1;
    }
    printf("%.4f\n", f(l));
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these are micro-optimizations and may not have a significant impact on the program's performance. The actual performance gain can vary depending on the specific use case and the compiler used.
