Step 1: Avoid unnecessary calculations
In the function `f(double W)`, we see that the calculation `W * vw[i]` is done twice if the condition `if (W * vw[i] > th[i])` is not met. We can calculate it once, store it in a variable, and then use this variable in the `if` condition and in the `sum1` calculation. 

Step 2: Use fast input-output methods
We know that `cin` and `cout` are slower than `scanf` and `printf`. In competitive programming, this difference can be crucial. So, we will replace `cin` with `scanf`.

Step 3: Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`
The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes quite a lot of files, and it is not standard. It might be useful for contests, when you know what environment it will be tested in, but for other uses, it is not recommended.

Step 4: Use `const` for constant variables
The variables `MAX` and `inf` can be declared as constant because they are not being modified in the code, which makes the code safer.

Here is the optimized program based on the steps above:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
const int MAX = 100001;
const double inf = 1e9;
int n, pw;
double vw[MAX], pf[MAX], vf[MAX], th[MAX];

double f(double W) {
  double cost = W * pw;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    double Wvw = W * vw[i];
    if (Wvw > th[i])
      continue;
    double sum1 = th[i] - Wvw;
    double sum2 = sum1 / vf[i];
    cost += sum2 * pf[i];
  }
  return cost;
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &pw);
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf", &vw[i], &pf[i], &vf[i], &th[i]);
    double l = 0, r = inf;
    for (int i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
      double m1 = (l * 2.0 + r) / 3.0;
      double m2 = (l + r * 2.0) / 3.0;
      double res1 = f(m1);
      double res2 = f(m2);
      if (res1 < res2)
        r = m2;
      else
        l = m1;
    }
    printf("%.4f\n", f(l));
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the real performance of the program depends on the specific platform, compiler, and input data. Therefore, the result of optimization may vary.
