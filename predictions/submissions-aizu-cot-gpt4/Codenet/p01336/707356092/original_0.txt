The given C++ program is complex and has multiple areas where we can optimize both for running time and memory.

1. Unnecessary #include files: The code includes many libraries that are not actually used, which unnecessarily increases the compilation time. We can remove these.

2. Vector idols: The idols vector is being cleared and re-initialized for each test case. Instead of doing this, we can declare it inside the while loop, which will automatically clear it at the end of each test case.

3. Stringstream ss: The stringstream is being cleared and re-initialized for each test case and each idol. Instead, we can declare a new stringstream each time, which will automatically clear it.

4. Triple loop: The triple loop in the program is the most time consuming part. We can see that the 'k' loop is not needed as the number of times a particular idol is used does not affect the other idols, we can calculate the maximum values for each idol once and use it.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#define INF 0x3f3f3f3f
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
typedef pair<int, P> PP;
int tx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int ty[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
static const double EPS = 1e-8;
class Data {
public:
  string mName;
  int mC, mV, mD, mL;
  Data(string _n, int _c, int _v, int _d, int _l) {
    mName = _n;
    mC = _c;
    mV = _v;
    mD = _d;
    mL = _l;
  }
};
int dp[301][3];
int main() {
  int N, M;
  string line;
  while (getline(cin, line)) {
    stringstream ss(line);
    ss >> N >> M;
    vector<Data> idols;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      getline(cin, line);
      string name = line;
      getline(cin, line);
      stringstream ss(line);
      int C, V, D, L;
      ss >> C >> V >> D >> L;
      idols.push_back(Data(name, C, V, D, L));
    }
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    for (int i = 0; i < idols.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = idols[i].mC; j <= M; j++) {
          dp[j][0] = max(dp[j - idols[i].mC][0] + idols[i].mV, dp[j][0]);
          dp[j][1] = max(dp[j - idols[i].mC][1] + idols[i].mD, dp[j][1]);
          dp[j][2] = max(dp[j - idols[i].mC][2] + idols[i].mL, dp[j][2]);
        }
    }
    int maxv = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= M; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        maxv = max(dp[i][j], maxv);
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", maxv);
  }
}
```
These changes should make the program run faster and use less memory.
