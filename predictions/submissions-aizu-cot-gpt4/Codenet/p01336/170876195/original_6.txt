The original code is quite optimized, but there are a few places where we can make some slight improvements:

1. In the dpru function, there are two nested loops. The inner loop can be optimized by starting from c[i] instead of 0 because dp[i+1][j] = dp[i][j] for all j < c[i]. This will reduce the number of iterations, especially when c[i] is large.

2. The use of the max_swap function in the inner loop and in the main function is not necessary. It is clearer and more efficient to use the standard max function instead.

3. The array dp is static and can be declared outside the dpru function. This will avoid the overhead of creating and initializing the array every time the function is called.

4. It's not necessary to include so many libraries if they are not being used in the code. This can reduce the compilation time.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
typedef long long ll;
int n, m;
int dp[333][333];

int dpru(int *c, int *v) {
  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (int j = c[i]; j <= m; ++j) {
      dp[i + 1][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 1][j - c[i]] + v[i]);
    }
  }
  return dp[n][m];
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> n >> m) {
    int c[333], v[3][333];
    rep(i, n) {
      string s;
      int t;
      getline(cin, s);
      getline(cin, s);
      cin >> t;
      c[i] = t;
      rep(j, 3) cin >> v[j][i];
    }
    int res = 0;
    rep(i, 3) res = max(res, dpru(c, v[i]));
    cout << res << endl;
  }
}
```
In this optimized version, the efficiency of the code has been improved by reducing the number of unnecessary calculations and memory usage. The clarity of the code has also been improved by using standard functions and removing unnecessary ones.
