Step 1: Remove unused header files
In the given program, several header files are included but not used. This can cause the program to load unnecessary libraries, which can increase the execution time and memory usage of the program. These include <algorithm>, <cfloat>, <climits>, <cmath>, <complex>, <cstdlib>, <ctime>, <functional>, <list>, <map>, <memory>, <numeric>, <queue>, <set>, <sstream>, <stack>, <string>, <utility>, and <vector>.

Step 2: Use dynamic memory allocation for large arrays
The program uses large static arrays in the main function and in the dpru function. Static arrays have a fixed size, and if the program needs more memory than is allocated to these arrays, it can cause the program to crash. Dynamic memory allocation can be used instead to allocate the exact amount of memory needed for the arrays. This can reduce the memory usage of the program.

Step 3: Reduce redundant computations
The program calculates dp[i + 1][j] multiple times when j >= c[i]. This redundant computation can be eliminated by storing the result of dp[i + 1][j - c[i]] + v[i] in a temporary variable.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define CLEAR(arr, val) memset(arr, val, sizeof(arr))
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
template <class T> void max_swap(T &a, const T &b) { a = max(a, b); }

int n, m;

int dpru(int *c, int **v) {
  int **dp = new int*[n+1];
  for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
    dp[i] = new int[m+1];

  CLEAR(dp, 0);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= m; ++j) {
      dp[i + 1][j] = dp[i][j];
      if (j >= c[i]) {
        int temp = dp[i + 1][j - c[i]] + v[i];
        max_swap(dp[i + 1][j], temp);
      }
    }
  }
  int res = dp[n][m];

  for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
    delete [] dp[i];
  delete [] dp;

  return res;
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> n >> m) {
    int *c = new int[n];
    int **v = new int*[3];
    for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
      v[i] = new int[n];
    
    rep(i, n) {
      string s;
      int t;
      getline(cin, s);
      getline(cin, s);
      cin >> t;
      c[i] = t;
      rep(j, 3) cin >> v[j][i];
    }
    int res = 0;
    rep(i, 3) max_swap(res, dpru(c, v[i]));
    cout << res << endl;

    delete [] c;
    for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
      delete [] v[i];
    delete [] v;
  }
}
```
This version of the program optimizes for running time by removing unused header files and reducing redundant computations. It also optimizes for memory usage by using dynamic memory allocation for large arrays.
