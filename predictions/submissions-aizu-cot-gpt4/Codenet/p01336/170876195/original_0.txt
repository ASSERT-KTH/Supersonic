Here are some potential optimization steps:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The function dpru() allocates memory for the dp array every time it is called. This is inefficient and can be avoided by declaring the dp array as a static variable. This way, memory for the array is allocated only once and reused for subsequent function calls.

2. Avoid unnecessary computations: The function dpru() checks if j >= c[i] in each iteration. This check is not necessary if c[i] > m, in which case c[i] is never less than or equal to j. By checking if c[i] > m before the loop, unnecessary computations can be avoided.

3. Avoid unnecessary string operations: In the main function, two strings are read from the input but not used. This can be avoided by reading the input directly into the necessary variables.

4. Use fast input/output methods: The cin and cout methods are slow compared to scanf and printf, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. By replacing cin and cout with scanf and printf, the program can run faster.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
template <class T> void max_swap(T &a, const T &b) { a = max(a, b); }
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pint;
static int dp[333][333];
int n, m;
int dpru(int *c, int *v) {
  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (c[i] > m) continue;
    for (int j = 0; j <= m; ++j) {
      dp[i + 1][j] = dp[i][j];
      if (j >= c[i])
        max_swap(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 1][j - c[i]] + v[i]);
    }
  }
  return dp[n][m];
}
int main() {
  while (scanf("%d %d", &n, &m) == 2) {
    int c[333], v[3][333];
    rep(i, n) {
      int t;
      scanf("%*s %*s %d", &t);
      c[i] = t;
      rep(j, 3) scanf("%d", &v[j][i]);
    }
    int res = 0;
    rep(i, 3) max_swap(res, dpru(c, v[i]));
    printf("%d\n", res);
  }
}
```
This optimized program will run faster and use less memory than the original program.
