To optimize the given C/C++ program, we will take the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Many of the included libraries are not used in the program. Including unnecessary libraries increases the compilation time and does not affect the run-time performance but it is a good practice to only include what is necessary.

2. Avoid using namespace std: This is a bad programming practice, especially in a large program, because it can lead to name clashes.

3. Optimize dynamic programming array: The size of the dynamic programming array dp[][] is fixed and quite large. This can consume a large amount of memory. We can reduce the memory usage by only keeping the current and previous row of the dp table, because the rest of the rows are not used after they are computed.

4. Avoid reading unnecessary input: The program reads a string s twice but never uses it. We can remove these unnecessary reads to slightly speed up the program.

5. Use faster I/O methods: The cin and cout streams in C++ are much slower than scanf and printf in C. We can replace cin and cout with scanf and printf for faster input and output.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
using std::max;

#define CLEAR(arr, val) memset(arr, val, sizeof(arr))
typedef long long ll;

const int MAXN = 333;
int n, m;
int c[MAXN], v[3][MAXN];
int dp[2][MAXN];

int dpru(int *c, int *v) {
  CLEAR(dp, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    memcpy(dp[(i + 1) % 2], dp[i % 2], sizeof(dp[0]));
    for (int j = c[i]; j <= m; ++j) {
      dp[(i + 1) % 2][j] = max(dp[(i + 1) % 2][j], dp[i % 2][j - c[i]] + v[i]);
    }
  }
  return dp[n % 2][m];
}

int main() {
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &m) == 2) {
    int res = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      scanf("%*s %*s %d", &c[i]);
      for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j) scanf("%d", &v[j][i]);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) res = max(res, dpru(c, v[i]));
    printf("%d\n", res);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized program, we significantly reduced the amount of memory used by the program by optimizing the dynamic programming array. We also slightly increased the speed of the program by removing unnecessary input reads and using faster I/O methods.
