This program can be optimized by reducing the number of unnecessary function calls and removing redundant memory allocations. 

Here's how:

1. Remove unnecessary `#include` statements: If you look at the `#include` statements, you'll see that there are some headers that aren't actually used in the program. These include `<cfloat>`, `<complex>`, `<ctime>`, `<functional>`, `<list>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<sstream>`, `<stack>`, `<utility>`, and `<numeric>`. Removing these will reduce the load on the preprocessor and make the compilation process a bit faster.

2. Reduce memory allocation in the `dpru` function: The `dp` array in the `dpru` function is initialized every time the function is called. This is a waste of time and memory. Instead, you can declare `dp` as a global variable and initialize it once in the `main` function. 

3. Avoid use of `getline` function: The `getline` function is used to read a string, but in this case, it seems to be unnecessary. The program reads two lines and then immediately overwrites the string `s` without using its value. You can just call `cin >> t` directly.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
template <class T> void max_swap(T &a, const T &b) { a = max(a, b); }
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pint;

int n, m;
int dp[333][333];

int dpru(int *c, int *v) {
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= m; ++j) {
      dp[i + 1][j] = dp[i][j];
      if (j >= c[i])
        max_swap(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 1][j - c[i]] + v[i]);
    }
  }
  return dp[n][m];
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> n >> m) {
    int c[333], v[3][333];
    rep(i, n) {
      int t;
      cin >> t;
      c[i] = t;
      rep(j, 3) cin >> v[j][i];
    }
    int res = 0;
    rep(i, 3) max_swap(res, dpru(c, v[i]));
    cout << res << endl;
  }
}
```

Please note that the optimizations will not significantly change the runtime of the program if the input size is small, but it could make a difference for large inputs.
