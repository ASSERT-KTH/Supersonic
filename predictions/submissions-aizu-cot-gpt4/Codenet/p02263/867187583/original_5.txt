This program implements a basic stack-based calculator which reads operations from the standard input and applies them to the values in the stack. The operations are in postfix notation, where operands come before the operator, such as "4 5 +". 

Here are a few optimizations that can be done:

1. Avoid repeated function calls: There are multiple calls to `stack.pop()` within each operation ('+', '-', '*'). This could be optimized by storing the result of `stack.pop()` in a variable and reusing it.

2. Reserving memory for vector: By default, vectors in C++ dynamically resize when elements are added. This can be expensive in terms of time. As we know the size of the stack beforehand, we can use the `reserve` function to allocate the required memory at once.

3. Using `switch` statement instead of `if-else`: The `switch` statement can be more efficient in terms of execution time when there are more than two conditions because it uses a jump table in the backend.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Stack {
public:
  Stack(int n) : top_(0) {
    s_.reserve(n);
  }

  bool isEmpty() {
    return top_ == 0;
  }

  bool isFull() {
    return top_ == s_.size();
  }

  void push(int x) {
    if (!isFull()) {
      s_[top_++] = x;
    }
  }

  int pop() {
    return isEmpty() ? -1 : s_[--top_];
  }

private:
  vector<int> s_;
  size_t top_;
};

int main() {
  char s[1000];
  Stack stack(110);
  while (scanf("%s", s) != EOF) {
    int rhs, lhs, t;
    switch(s[0]) {
      case '+':
        rhs = stack.pop();
        lhs = stack.pop();
        t = lhs + rhs;
        stack.push(t);
        break;
      case '-':
        rhs = stack.pop();
        lhs = stack.pop();
        t = lhs - rhs;
        stack.push(t);
        break;
      case '*':
        rhs = stack.pop();
        lhs = stack.pop();
        t = lhs * rhs;
        stack.push(t);
        break;
      default:
        stack.push(atoi(s));
        break;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", stack.pop());
  return 0;
}
```
With this version, the program should be faster and more memory efficient.
