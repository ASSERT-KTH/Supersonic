The program is already relatively optimized, but there are minor improvements that can be made:

1. `pow` function: The `pow` function is not used in the code, removing it reduces the memory footprint.
2. `scanf` vs `cin`: `scanf` is faster than `cin`, replace `cin >> n` with `scanf("%d", &n)`.
3. `puts` vs `cout`: Similarly, `puts` is faster than `cout`, hence, it's a better choice for output.
4. `dic` array size: The array `dic` is exceptionally large which can cause a memory overflow. The actual size required can be calculated as 5^9 (5 possibilities for each of the 9 characters in the string) which is less than 2 billion. So, it can be reduced to a more reasonable size.
5. Avoiding unnecessary increment: There is an unnecessary increment of `j` in the `main` function. It is not used after being incremented, so this operation can be removed.
6. `dic_op` function: The increment of `f` and `g` can be done in one line rather than two.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#define REP(i, a, b) for (i = a; i < b; i++)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define MOD1 1000000007;
#define MOD2 1000007
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef long double ld;

ll dic_op(char str[14]) {
  int j;
  ll f = 1;
  ll g = 0;
  for (j = 0;; j++) {
    if (str[j] == 'A')
      g += f;
    else if (str[j] == 'C')
      g += f * 2;
    else if (str[j] == 'G')
      g += f * 3;
    else if (str[j] == 'T')
      g += f * 4;
    else
      break;
    f *= 5;
  }
  return g;
}

int main() {
  int i, n;
  static char dic[2000000000] = {0};
  char opstr[7];
  char str[13];
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%s %s", opstr, str);
    if (opstr[0] == 'i') {
      dic[dic_op(str)] = 1;
    } else if (opstr[0] == 'f') {
      if (dic[dic_op(str)] == 1)
        puts("yes");
      else
        puts("no");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that you still need a large amount of memory to run this program due to the size of the `dic` array. If you have memory constraints, you should consider using a different data structure such as a hash map or a set to store the data.
