The given program is a dictionary operation program which performs insert and find operations on a dictionary. The following optimizations can be made:

1. The 'pow' function is not used anywhere in the code and can be removed. This will reduce the memory footprint and load time of the program.

2. The 'dic' array is allocated a huge size of 90,000,000. This is a wastage of memory if the input is not that large. It would be more efficient to use a data structure like std::unordered_map which only uses the memory needed.

3. The 'dic_op' function computes a hash for a string. Although the computation is efficient, it is done twice in case of 'find' operation. This can be optimized by storing the hash and reusing it.

4. The 'scanf' function is slower compared to 'cin' operator. Replacing 'scanf' with 'cin' can make the program run faster.

5. The 'puts' function is slower compared to 'cout' operator. Replacing 'puts' with 'cout' can make the program run faster.

6. The 'j' variable is incremented but not used anywhere in the program. It can be removed to reduce the memory footprint of the program.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#define REP(i, a, b) for (i = a; i < b; i++)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define MOD1 1000000007;
#define MOD2 1000007
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef long double ld;

unordered_map<string, bool> dic;

int dic_op(char str[14]) {
  int j;
  long long f = 1;
  long long g = 0;
  for (j = 0;; j++) {
    if (str[j] == 'A')
      g += f * 1;
    else if (str[j] == 'C')
      g += f * 2;
    else if (str[j] == 'G')
      g += f * 3;
    else if (str[j] == 'T')
      g += f * 4;
    else
      break;
    f *= 5;
  }
  return g;
}

int main() {
  int i, k, l;
  int n;
  long ans = 0;
  string opstr;
  char str[13];
  cin >> n;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> opstr >> str;
    if (opstr[0] == 'i') {
      dic[str] = true;
    } else if (opstr[0] == 'f') {
      if (dic[str])
        cout << "yes" << endl;
      else
        cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that, the hash function dic_op() is not used in the optimized code because the std::unordered_map takes care of hashing internally. This further reduces the memory and runtime of the program.
