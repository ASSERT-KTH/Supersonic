This program takes a string of characters (ACGT) and converts it into an integer by mapping each character to a number (A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3) and storing that in the `d` array. The program then checks if the mapped number exists in the `d` array.

There are several optimizations we can make to this program:

1. **Use `std::unordered_map` instead of an array for `d`.** This will reduce memory usage as `std::unordered_map` only allocates memory for the elements it actually contains. In contrast, an array allocates memory for all possible elements upfront. This will particularly save memory if the set of unique keys is small compared to the possible key space.

2. **Use `std::string` instead of `char` arrays for `s` and `str`.** `std::string` is easier to work with and more efficient than C-style strings. It also provides a safer interface as you don't have to worry about null-terminating your strings or buffer overflows.

3. **Replace `scanf` and `puts` with `std::cin` and `std::cout`.** The C++ IO streams are more flexible and safer to use than their C counterparts.

Now let's put these optimizations into practice:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

std::unordered_map<int, bool> d;
std::unordered_map<char, int> k = {{'A', 0}, {'C', 1}, {'G', 2}, {'T', 3}};

int c(const std::string& str) {
  int ans = str[0];
  for (size_t i = 1; i < str.size(); ++i) {
    ans <<= 2;
    ans += k[str[i]];
  }
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::string s, str;
  while (n--) {
    std::cin >> s >> str;
    if (s == "i")
      d[c(str)] = true;
    else
      std::cout << (d[c(str)] ? "yes\n" : "no\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This program should have comparable performance to the original, but with less memory usage and safer code. The logic of the program remains the same, it's just the data structures that have been updated to their C++ counterparts.
