This program seems to be well optimized already for the problem it is solving, but there are some minor improvements we can make.

1. Inline function: The function c() can be made inline to reduce the overhead of function call. Inline functions are a good optimization technique where the function body is small.

2. Remove variable initialization: We can remove the initialization of `i` to 1 in the function `c()`. No need to initialize `i` as it is initialized in the for loop itself.

3. Use std::unordered_map instead of array: In this case, the `k` array is used as a map where keys are char and values are int. A std::unordered_map can be used instead of an array `k`. This can improve the lookup time from O(n) to O(1).

4. Use std::ios::sync_with_stdio: By default, c++ streams are synchronized with standard C streams. By using `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`, we can improve the I/O performance.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

bool d[33554432];
unordered_map<char, int> k;
inline int c(char str[12]) {
  int ans = str[0];
  for (int i = 1; str[i] != '\0'; i++) {
    ans <<= 2;
    ans += k[str[i]];
  }
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  k['A'] = 0;
  k['C'] = 1;
  k['G'] = 2;
  k['T'] = 3;
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  char s[7], str[12];
  while (n--) {
    scanf("%s %s", s, str);
    if (s[0] == 'i')
      d[c(str)] = true;
    else
      puts(d[c(str)] ? "yes" : "no");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Here, please note that the difference in performance between these two versions of the code might be negligible for small inputs and the improvements may become more noticeable for large inputs.
