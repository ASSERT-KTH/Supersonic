The given program is already quite optimized and performs an efficient operation of hashing DNA sequences and checking the existence of a sequence. However, few small changes can be made:

1. As per the C++ standards, the variable `i` inside the loop in function `c` can be declared inside the loop initialization itself, i.e. `for(int i=1; str[i] != '\0'; i++)`. This will restrict the scope of `i` to the loop only, freeing up memory as soon as the loop execution completes.

2. The character array `s` has a size of `7`, which is more than required. As per the program logic, it only needs to store two strings: `'insert'` and `'find'`. It can be reduced to `s[6]` which is enough to store these strings and also the null character. This will save a small amount of memory.

3. The character array `str` is declared as `str[12]`, this is more than required. Given the problem's constraints (DNA sequences of length 10), we can safely reduce this to `str[11]` (10 for the sequence and 1 for the null character).

4. The `puts` function can be replaced with `printf` function which is considered faster in terms of execution time.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
bool d[33554432];
char k[128];
int c(char str[11]) {
  int ans = str[0];
  for(int i = 1; str[i] != '\0'; i++) {
    ans <<= 2;
    ans += k[str[i]];
  }
  return ans;
}
int main() {
  k['A'] = 0;
  k['C'] = 1;
  k['G'] = 2;
  k['T'] = 3;
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  char s[6], str[11];
  while (n--) {
    scanf("%s %s", s, str);
    if (s[0] == 'i')
      d[c(str)] = true;
    else
      printf(d[c(str)] ? "yes\n" : "no\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations are relatively minor and may not lead to a substantial improvement in performance. The actual performance gain will depend on various factors including the compiler and the hardware where the program is executed.
