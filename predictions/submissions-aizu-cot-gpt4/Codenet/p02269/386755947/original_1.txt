The given program appears to be fairly optimized for memory usage and running time. However, there are a few minor improvements that could be made. Most of these optimizations are related to style and readability rather than performance, but they can make the code easier to work with and may help compilers optimize the code further.

Here are the steps for optimization:

1. `scanf` and `puts` functions are slower than the `cin` and `cout` in C++. So, we can replace them with `cin` and `cout` respectively. 

2. Use pre-increment (++i) instead of post-increment (i++) in loops.

3. Make use of `const char*` instead of `char` for strings. This can speed up string comparisons as the compiler can calculate the lengths and comparison results at compile time.

4. The `for` loop in function `c` could be written in a more standard way. In C/C++, it's not necessary to declare the loop counter outside the `for` statement, unless you need to use the counter value after the loop ends. 

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool d[33554432];
char k[128];

int c(const char* str) {
    int ans = str[0];
    for (int i = 1; str[i] != '\0'; ++i) {
        ans <<= 2;
        ans += k[str[i]];
    }
    return ans;
}

int main() {
    k['A'] = 0;
    k['C'] = 1;
    k['G'] = 2;
    k['T'] = 3;
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    char s[7], str[12];
    while (n--) {
        cin >> s >> str;
        if (s[0] == 'i')
            d[c(str)] = true;
        else
            cout << (d[c(str)] ? "yes\n" : "no\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Remember, these optimizations are minor and unlikely to significantly affect the performance of your code. Always profile your code before and after any optimizations to see if they're having the desired effect.
