This program seems to be a DNA sequence search program. It uses a 33,554,432 length boolean array to store whether a particular DNA sequence exists or not. The DNA sequences are converted to an integer index using the function `c`. It also uses a character-to-integer mapping `k` for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' to 0, 1, 2, 3 respectively. 

To optimize this program, we can consider the following points:

1. **Avoid large static array**: The boolean array `d` is very large which may cause a stack overflow. It is better to use dynamic memory allocation for this array. However, as the array size is too big, it is still not safe to allocate such a large space at once. We need to break it into smaller parts and allocate dynamically. 

2. **Avoid global variables**: The character-to-integer mapping `k` is defined as a global variable. It would be better to make it local to the main function.

3. **Avoid unnecessary array initialization**: The array `k` is initialized with 0 for 'A' and so on. But C/C++ already initializes global and static arrays to 0, so the initialization of 'A' to 0 is unnecessary.

4. **Prefer `std::vector` over raw arrays**: In C++, `std::vector` is preferred over raw arrays because it is safer and more flexible.

Here is the optimized version of the program implementing these points:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int c(char str[12], char k[128]) {
  int ans = str[0], i = 1;
  for (i; str[i] != '\0'; i++) {
    ans <<= 2;
    ans += k[str[i]];
  }
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  char k[128];
  k['C'] = 1;
  k['G'] = 2;
  k['T'] = 3;
  vector<bool> d(33554432);
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  char s[7], str[12];
  while (n--) {
    scanf("%s %s", s, str);
    if (s[0] == 'i')
      d[c(str, k)] = true;
    else
      puts(d[c(str, k)] ? "yes" : "no");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program reduces the risk of stack overflow by using a dynamic array and simplifies the code by avoiding unnecessary array initialization. It also makes the program safer by avoiding the use of global variables.
