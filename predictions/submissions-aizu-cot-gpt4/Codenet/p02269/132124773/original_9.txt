This program takes a number of commands from user input. Each command is either an insertion or a query to a dictionary. The dictionary is implemented using std::map where keys are strings and values are boolean flags. An insertion command inserts a string into the dictionary and associates it with a boolean value of true. A query command checks if a string is present in the dictionary and, if it is, prints 'yes', otherwise it prints 'no'. 

There are several optimizations we can make to this program.

Optimization Steps:

1. Reserve memory for the 'com' and 'word' strings: Strings in C++ are dynamic arrays, which means that each time we add an element to a string, it may need to allocate a new block of memory and copy the existing string into it. This can be slow and inefficient, especially for large strings. We can avoid this by reserving memory for the strings at the beginning of the program.

2. Use std::unordered_map instead of std::map: std::unordered_map uses a hash table for storage, which provides constant time insertion and lookup on average, as opposed to std::map which is typically implemented as a red-black tree, providing logarithmic time insertion and lookup.

3. Use std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false): This line of code will make input and output operations faster, but be careful because it may cause problems if you mix C++ and C I/O operations.

4. Use '\n' instead of endl: std::endl is equivalent to '\n' followed by std::flush, which forces a write to the underlying output stream. This can slow down your program if you're writing a lot of data. Using '\n' instead of std::endl can make your program faster.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  unordered_map<string, bool> Dic;
  string com, word;
  com.reserve(100);
  word.reserve(100);
  while (n--) {
    cin >> com >> word;
    if (com[0] == 'i')
      Dic[word] = true;
    else {
      if (Dic[word])
        cout << "yes\n";
      else
        cout << "no\n";
    }
  }
}
```
