The given program is already efficient in terms of time complexity. The map structure in C++ provides an O(logN) search, insertion, and deletion operations. But, we can make some small optimizations:

1. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(NULL);` to make input and output operations faster. This can speed up the cin and cout operations which can be useful when there is a large amount of I/O.
2. Use '\n' instead of `endl` for newlines. `endl` causes a flush operation, which can be unnecessary and slows down the program. Replacing `endl` with '\n' can speed up the output operation.
3. Instead of comparing `com[0]` with 'i', we can compare the whole string with "i". This will make the program more readable and avoid potential errors if other commands starting with 'i' are added in the future.
4. Reserve some space for the map to avoid rehashing. This can be beneficial if we know the approximate size of the data.
5. If the word is not in the map, it will be inserted with the default value of false. To avoid this, we can use the `Dic.find()` method which just checks if the element is in the map but doesn't insert it.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>

using namespace std;
int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    map<string, bool> Dic;
    Dic.reserve(n); // reserve space for n elements
    string com, word;
    while (n--) {
        cin >> com >> word;
        if (com == "i")
            Dic[word] = true;
        else {
            if (Dic.find(word) != Dic.end()) // use find() to check if word is in the map
                cout << "yes\n"; // use '\n' instead of endl
            else
                cout << "no\n"; // use '\n' instead of endl
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Please note that map does not have a `reserve` function as `std::vector` does. If you know the size of your data, you might want to consider using a data structure that allows for reserving memory, like `std::unordered_map` which could provide a faster access time of O(1) on average.
