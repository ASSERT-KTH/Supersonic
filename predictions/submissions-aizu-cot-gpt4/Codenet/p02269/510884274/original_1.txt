The given C/C++ program is a simple string hashing program that checks if the hashed value of a given string is already in the array `chk[]`. The hashing function `h(s)` converts string `s` into an integer based on the character values 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'.

Step by Step Optimization:

1. Instead of using `std::string` for `ins` and `s`, we can use `std::string_view`. `std::string_view` is a lightweight, non-owning reference to a string. It can be used to refer to the entire string or just a part of it. This will save memory allocation/deallocation time which happens in case of `std::string`.

2. In the hash function `h(s)`, the size of the string `s` is calculated in each iteration of the loop. This can be optimized by storing the size in a variable before the loop begins.

3. The if-else chain in hash function `h(s)` can be replaced with a switch-case statement. It is generally faster because it uses a jump table in the background.

4. The `ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` is already used to untie `cin` and `cout` from their corresponding C streams, which is an optimization.

The Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>
using namespace std;
bool chk[244140624];
int n;
string_view ins, s;
int h(string_view s) {
  int ret = 0;
  int size = s.size();
  for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    ret *= 5;
    switch(s[i]) {
      case 'A':
        ret += 1;
        break;
      case 'C':
        ret += 2;
        break;
      case 'G':
        ret += 3;
        break;
      case 'T':
        ret += 4;
        break;
    }
  }
  return ret;
}
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> ins >> s;
    if (ins[0] == 'i') {
      chk[h(s)] = true;
    } else {
      cout << (chk[h(s)] ? "yes" : "no") << '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program reduces memory usage due to the use of `string_view` instead of `string`, and faster execution because of the hash function optimization.
