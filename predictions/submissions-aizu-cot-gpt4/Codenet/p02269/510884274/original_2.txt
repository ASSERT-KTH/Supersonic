This program appears to be implementing a simple hash table for DNA sequences, with the four possible nucleotides (A, C, G, and T) being assigned hash values of 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. A hash function h is defined to convert a string of these nucleotides into an integer, which is then used as an index into the chk array to indicate the presence of the sequence in the hash table.

Here are the steps to optimize this program:

1. Reduce the size of chk array: The size of the chk array should only be as large as the number of different possible hashes. The current size (244140624) seems excessively large, especially given that the maximum value that can be returned by the hash function h is much smaller. Since the maximum hash value for a string of length 10 (maximum length of a DNA sequence) is 4^10 = 1048576, we can reduce the size of chk array to this value which will save a significant amount of memory.

2. Use switch-case instead of if-else: In the hash function, using switch-case instead of if-else can make the program more readable and slightly faster since switch-case statements are generally faster than if-else statements when there are more than two conditions, which is the case here.

3. Use std::bitset instead of bool array: A std::bitset uses less memory than a bool array. Each element in a std::bitset takes up only one bit of memory, while each element in a bool array (which is actually just a char array) takes up one byte.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

bitset<1048576> chk;
int n;
string ins, s;

int h(string s) {
  int ret = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); ++i) {
    ret *= 5;
    switch (s[i]) {
      case 'A': ret += 1; break;
      case 'C': ret += 2; break;
      case 'G': ret += 3; break;
      case 'T': ret += 4; break;
    }
  }
  return ret;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> ins >> s;
    if (ins[0] == 'i') {
      chk[h(s)] = true;
    } else {
      cout << (chk[h(s)] ? "yes" : "no") << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

One note: This optimization assumes that the input strings s are never longer than 10 characters. If they could be longer than that, you would need a different approach to avoid potential collisions in the hash function.
