This program seems to be dealing with DNA sequences with the four bases 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. It provides two operations: 'insertion' and 'checking' of sequences. The hash function `h` maps each sequence to a unique integer. The optimization possibilities here are:

1. Avoid repeated calculation of the hash value: In the current program, the hash value of the sequence `s` is calculated twice if the operation is not 'insertion'. We can avoid this by storing the hash value in a variable.

2. Use a switch-case instead of if-else: The if-else construct checks each condition sequentially until it finds a match. In contrast, a switch-case construct may be more efficient in some compilers because it uses a jump table. In this case, with only four possible values, the performance difference may be negligible, but it's a good practice in general.

3. Reduce the size of the `chk` array: The current size of the `chk` array seems to be the maximum possible value of the hash function `h`. However, the hash function will only return values up to `4^n`, where `n` is the length of the longest sequence. If we can determine this length in advance, we could potentially reduce the memory usage significantly. However, since the problem statement doesn't provide this information, we cannot apply this optimization here.

4. Avoid using `std::endl`: `std::endl` not only inserts a newline character, but also flushes the output buffer, which can slow down the program. Instead, we can use `'\n'` to insert a newline character.

The optimized program is:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
bool chk[244140624];
int n;
string ins, s;
int h(const string& s) {
  int ret = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); ++i) {
    ret *= 5;
    switch (s[i]) {
      case 'A':
        ret += 1;
        break;
      case 'C':
        ret += 2;
        break;
      case 'G':
        ret += 3;
        break;
      case 'T':
        ret += 4;
        break;
    }
  }
  return ret;
}
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> ins >> s;
    int hash = h(s);
    if (ins[0] == 'i') {
      chk[hash] = true;
    } else {
      cout << (chk[hash] ? "yes" : "no") << '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note that simply passing the string `s` to the function `h` could potentially create a copy of the string, depending on the compiler. To ensure that this doesn't happen, we pass the string by const reference, using `const string& s`.
