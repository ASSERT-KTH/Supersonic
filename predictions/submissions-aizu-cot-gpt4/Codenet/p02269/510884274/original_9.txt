This program seems to be a simple DNA sequence checker. It checks whether a specific DNA sequence has been seen before. The sequences are hashed into an integer and stored in a boolean array. The main optimization that can be done here is to use a more memory-efficient data structure. The boolean array `chk` is quite large and uses a lot of memory. A better approach would be to use a `std::unordered_set<int>`, which uses a hash table internally and is more memory-efficient.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Replace the `chk` array with a `std::unordered_set<int>`.
2. Replace `chk[h(s)] = true;` with `chk.insert(h(s));` because in an unordered_set, we use the insert function to add elements.
3. Replace `chk[h(s)]` with `chk.count(h(s))` because in an unordered_set, we use the count function to check if an element is present.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

unordered_set<int> chk;
int n;
string ins, s;

int h(string s) {
  int ret = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); ++i) {
    ret *= 5;
    if (s[i] == 'A')
      ret += 1;
    else if (s[i] == 'C')
      ret += 2;
    else if (s[i] == 'G')
      ret += 3;
    else if (s[i] == 'T')
      ret += 4;
  }
  return ret;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr); // including this line will further speed up cin and cout
  cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> ins >> s;
    if (ins[0] == 'i') {
      chk.insert(h(s));
    } else {
      cout << (chk.count(h(s)) ? "yes" : "no") << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program uses less memory because `unordered_set` only stores the elements that are actually inserted, while the boolean array `chk` in the original program reserves memory for all possible elements whether they are used or not. This also slightly speeds up the program because checking whether an element is in an `unordered_set` is faster than checking an element in an array.
