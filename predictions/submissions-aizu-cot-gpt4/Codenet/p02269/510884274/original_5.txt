The given code is already well-optimized in terms of time complexity. However, there is an aspect that can be improved, which is the space usage. 

The chk array seems to be used as a boolean hash table, but it's declared with a constant size of 244140624 elements. This can consume a significant amount of memory. A more memory-efficient solution would be to use a std::unordered_set instead of an array. This container only allocates memory for the elements it actually contains, and it provides O(1) insertion and lookup times, just like the chk array.

Also, the function h(s) can be optimized by removing the unnecessary type casting to int in the loop condition check. The size() function of the std::string class in C++ returns a value of type std::size_t, which is an unsigned integral type, so it's not necessary to cast it to int.

Here are the steps to optimize:

1. Replace the chk array with a std::unordered_set.
2. Remove the type casting in the loop condition in the h() function.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

unordered_set<int> chk;
int n;
string ins, s;

int h(string s) {
  int ret = 0;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
    ret *= 5;
    if (s[i] == 'A')
      ret += 1;
    else if (s[i] == 'C')
      ret += 2;
    else if (s[i] == 'G')
      ret += 3;
    else if (s[i] == 'T')
      ret += 4;
  }
  return ret;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> ins >> s;
    if (ins[0] == 'i') {
      chk.insert(h(s));
    } else {
      cout << (chk.count(h(s)) ? "yes" : "no") << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code will perform as efficiently as the original one in terms of running time, but it will consume significantly less memory if the number of elements in the chk set is much less than 244140624.
