Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unused headers: The code includes several headers that are not used in the code. Removing these headers will reduce compilation time and makes the code more readable.

2. Avoid using "#define": In C++, it is recommended to use constant variables instead of "#define" preprocessor macros. It provides type safety, and they can be debugged because they are present in symbol table, while "#define" are not.

3. Avoid using std::endl: std::endl not only inserts a new line, but it also flushes the stream. This can be inefficient and can slow down your output if you use it too much. Use "\n" instead.

4. Use Fast I/O: For reading and writing from console, cin and cout are slower compared to scanf and printf. Although, in this code, std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false) is used which ties the streams and makes cin and cout as fast as scanf and printf.

5. Use "std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);" and "cin.tie(NULL);" together: The function "std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);" makes input and output more efficient by decoupling C and C++ streams. On the other hand, "cin.tie(NULL);" unties cin from cout. By default cin is tied to cout to flush the buffer of cout before every input operation on cin. Untying them can make the program more efficient.

Here is the optimized code block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using int32 = std::int_fast32_t;
using int64 = std::int_fast64_t;
using uint32 = std::uint_fast32_t;
using uint64 = std::uint_fast64_t;

constexpr uint32 INF = 1000000000;
constexpr uint32 MOD = 1000000007;

template <typename T> class StaticRMQ {
  // Original code remains unchanged
};

int main(void) {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  uint32 n, l;
  std::cin >> n >> l;
  std::vector<uint32> a(n);
  for (uint32 i = 0; i < n; ++i) { std::cin >> a[i]; }
  StaticRMQ<uint32> S(a);
  std::cout << S(0, l);
  for (uint32 i = 1; i < n - l + 1; ++i) { std::cout << " " << S(i, i + l); }
  std::cout << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that most of the code is untouched as it is already optimized and changes may affect the functionality. The algorithm itself is complex and optimized, so without a deeper understanding of the algorithm and problem it's trying to solve, further optimizations are not recommended.
