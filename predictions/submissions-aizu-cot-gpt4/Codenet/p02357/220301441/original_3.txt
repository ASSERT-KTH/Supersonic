This C++ program is quite well optimized already, but there are a few things we could tweak to potentially improve its performance and memory usage. 

1. Include Headers Only If Needed: Include only the necessary headers. This won't necessarily speed up the runtime of your program, but it can speed up compilation time and reduce the memory footprint. I noticed that you have included several headers that are not used in the program. Headers such as `<stack>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<map>`, `<utility>`, `<functional>`, and `<algorithm>` are not used and therefore can be removed.

2. Use namespace std: Instead of prefixing every standard library object or function with `std::`, you could use `using namespace std;` at the top of the program. This could make the code cleaner and more readable. However, this is generally frowned upon in larger projects or libraries, as it can lead to name conflicts.

3. Avoid Macros: It's generally better to avoid macros (`#define`) if possible, as they can make code harder to read and debug. In this case, the `rep` macro could be replaced with a regular for loop.

4. Use `std::array` instead of C-style arrays: `std::array` is a container that encapsulates fixed size arrays and provides benefits of standard C++ container, like knowing its own size, supporting assignment, random access, etc. 

5. Don't mix C and C++ headers: In C++, the C library headers (like `stdlib.h`) are available with a 'c' prefix and no extension (like `cstdlib`). The C++ versions of these headers should be preferred when writing C++ code, as they put their symbols in the `std` namespace.

6. Use smart pointers instead of raw pointers for better memory management: Smart pointers automatically manage memory, freeing the developer from this task and reducing the risk of memory leaks.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cmath>
#include <ctime>
#include <string>
#include <array>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <climits> 

using namespace std;
using int32 = int_fast32_t;
using int64 = int_fast64_t;
using uint32 = uint_fast32_t;
using uint64 = uint_fast64_t;

constexpr uint32 INF = 1000000000;
constexpr uint32 MOD = 1000000007;

template <typename T> 
class StaticRMQ {
    // ...
    // Keep the rest of the StaticRMQ code as is
    // ...
};

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    uint32 n, l;
    cin >> n >> l;
    vector<uint32> a(n);
    for (uint32 i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    StaticRMQ<uint32> S(a);
    cout << S(0, l);
    for (uint32 i = 1; i < n - l + 1; ++i) {
        cout << " " << S(i, i + l);
    }
    cout << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations are minor and the performance improvement might not be significant. The original code is already quite optimized.
