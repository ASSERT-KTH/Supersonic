This program is already optimized in some sense - it uses the Range Minimum Query (RMQ) algorithm for efficiently finding the minimum value in a given range of an array. However, there are few parts of the code which we can optimize further.

Optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary #include statements: Including unnecessary libraries can increase the compilation time and memory footprint of the program. We can remove unneeded libraries.

2. Remove unused macros: The code contains unused macros such as INF and MOD. Removing them will help clean up the code and decrease the memory footprint.

3. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(NULL)`: These lines of code make input and output more efficient. They are already present in your code but we'll keep them in mind as good practice.

4. Use fast I/O methods: If the program is I/O bound, we can switch from `std::cin` and `std::cout` to faster methods like `scanf` and `printf`.

5. Avoid recalculations: If a value is used multiple times, pre-calculate it and store it in a variable.

6. Use 'auto' keyword for variable type inference: This can make the code cleaner and easier to maintain, especially when dealing with complex types like iterators.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <cstdint>
#include <vector>
using int32 = std::int_fast32_t;
using int64 = std::int_fast64_t;
using uint32 = std::uint_fast32_t;
using uint64 = std::uint_fast64_t;
#define rep(i, a, b) for (uint32 i = (a); i < (b); ++i)
#define ALL(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()
using namespace std;

// Remainder of your StaticRMQ class goes here...

int main(void) {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  uint32 n, l;
  std::cin >> n >> l;
  std::vector<uint32> a(n);
  rep(i, 0, n) { std::cin >> a[i]; }
  StaticRMQ<uint32> S(a);
  std::cout << S(0, l);
  rep(i, 1, n - l + 1) { std::cout << " " << S(i, i + l); }
  std::cout << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimizations applied here are quite basic and high-level. For more detailed and specific optimizations, one would require a deeper understanding of the algorithm and data structures used in the program.
