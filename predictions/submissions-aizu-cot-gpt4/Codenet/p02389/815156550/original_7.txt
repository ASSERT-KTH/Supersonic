The given program is already quite optimized and there isn't much that can be done to further optimize it. However, one small optimization that can be done is to calculate `a * 2` and `b * 2` only once and store them in variables, in case the compiler doesn't already do this optimization.

Here is the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  int doubleA = a * 2;
  int doubleB = b * 2;
  std::cout << doubleA * b / 2 << " " << doubleA + doubleB << std::endl;
}
```
In this version of the program, `a * 2` and `b * 2` are calculated only once and stored in `doubleA` and `doubleB` respectively. The area is then calculated by multiplying `doubleA` by `b` and dividing by `2` (since `doubleA = a * 2`, `doubleA * b / 2 = a * b`). The perimeter is calculated by adding `doubleA` and `doubleB`.

Please note: This optimization is very minor and might not lead to observable performance improvement. Modern C++ compilers are very good at optimizing code, and they might already perform this optimization automatically.
