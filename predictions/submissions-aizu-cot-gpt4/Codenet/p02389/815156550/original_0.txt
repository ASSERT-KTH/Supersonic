The provided C/C++ program is relatively simple and mostly efficient. Still, there are a couple of small modifications we can make to save a tiny bit of memory and potentially improve running time:

1. Declare the variables `a` and `b` when they are needed, not in advance. This may allow the compiler to optimize memory usage better and is considered good practice in modern C++. 

2. Instead of performing multiplication operation twice for calculating `a * 2` and `b * 2`, we can do it once and use it in both places. This could possibly reduce the running time of the program.

3. Another small optimization can be done by using '\n' instead of 'std::endl'. This will just print a newline character. The std::endl might force a flush of the output buffer, which is not needed here and might slow down the output.

Here is how the optimized program would look like:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  
  int double_a = a * 2;
  int double_b = b * 2;
  std::cout << a * b << " " << double_a + double_b << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

Note that these optimizations are not going to have a big impact unless you are running this program billions of times. For a program this simple, the most important thing is to write clean, readable code.
