This C++ program is already quite optimized. It takes two inputs, and then prints their product and the sum of their doubles. The memory usage is minimal (two integer variables), and the running time is constant.

However, there are a few tiny optimizations we can make:

1. We can eliminate the need for the 'b' variable entirely by reading the second input into the 'a' variable after it has been used to calculate the product. This reduces memory usage slightly, but may make the code more difficult to understand.

2. We can eliminate the space in the output string and use '\n' for a new line instead. This won't impact performance but it's a common practice to end the line with '\n'.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int a;
  std::cin >> a;
  int product = a;
  std::cin >> a;
  product *= a;
  std::cout << product << "\n" << a * 3 << std::endl;
}
```

Remember, these optimizations are tiny and won't make a noticeable difference in running time or memory usage. The original code was already efficient.
