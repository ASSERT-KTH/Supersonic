The given program is already quite simple and doesn't have any major inefficiencies. However, it does perform the operation `a * 2` and `b * 2` twice which is unnecessary. We can calculate these values once and store them in variables to reduce the number of multiplications. This is a small optimization but it can add up in more complex programs or in cases where the operation is computationally expensive.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  int doubleA = a * 2;
  int doubleB = b * 2;
  std::cout << doubleA * b << " " << doubleA + doubleB << std::endl;
}
```

In this optimized code, the multiplication operation `a*2` and `b*2` is performed only once. Even though the difference in performance may not be noticeable in this simple program, such optimizations can make a difference in programs where the operation is more expensive (like a function call, for instance) or the operation is performed many times (like in a loop).
