The given C++ program is quite simple, it reads two integers from the standard input, calculates their product and the sum of their doubles, and then outputs these two values. The program is already quite efficient in terms of time and space complexity, but there are still a couple of minor improvements that can be made:

1. Avoid using `std::endl`: `std::endl` not only creates a new line but also flushes the output buffer, which can be a costly operation in terms of performance. It's better to use `"\n"` for a new line.

2. Declare variables at the point of use: In modern C++, it's generally recommended to declare variables as close as possible to the point where they are first used. This helps to make the code cleaner and more readable, and in some cases it can also help the compiler to optimize the code better.

3. Perform Calculations once: The multiplication operation is performed twice for each variable. We can store the results in temporary variables and use these variables in the output statement.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a, b;
    std::cin >> a >> b;
    
    int product = a * b;
    int doubledSum = a * 2 + b * 2;
    
    std::cout << product << " " << doubledSum << "\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```
