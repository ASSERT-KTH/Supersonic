The given C++ program is quite optimal in terms of both memory and running time. It is a simple program that reads two integers from the console, multiplies them, and then calculates the perimeter of a rectangle with sides a and b. However, a small optimization can be made to reduce the number of multiplications.

Optimization Steps:
1. Assign `a * b` to one variable and `2 * (a + b)` to another variable before outputting them. This will eliminate the need to calculate these expressions directly in the output statement, making the code slightly more efficient. 

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  int product = a * b;
  int sum = 2 * (a + b);
  std::cout << product << " " << sum << std::endl;
}
```

This version of the program performs the same operations as the original, but it does so in a slightly more efficient manner. However, the difference in performance will be negligible for this simple program. The real benefit of this optimization is that it makes the code easier to read and understand, as the calculations are performed explicitly before they are printed.
