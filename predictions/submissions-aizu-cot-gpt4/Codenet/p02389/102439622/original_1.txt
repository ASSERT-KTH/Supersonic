The given C program is quite optimized already. However, there's a small optimization that can be made in terms of computation. The computation of the perimeter `c` involves two multiplications and one addition. Instead, we can use one multiplication and one addition by factoring out 2 from the calculation.

Here are the steps:

1. Instead of computing `a * 2 + b * 2`, compute `2 * (a + b)`. This uses only one multiplication and one addition, instead of two multiplications and one addition.

Now, let's write the optimized code.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  int area = a * b;
  int c = 2 * (a + b);
  printf("%d %d\n", area, c);
}
```
This optimization is quite micro and in practice, modern compilers would probably optimize the original code in the same way.
