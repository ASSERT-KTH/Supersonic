The given C/C++ program is efficient already, but there are a few small optimizations that we can do:

1. Reduce the number of multiplications: Instead of multiplying 'a' and 'b' twice for 'area' and 'c', you can compute it once and store it in 'area', then use this for calculating 'c'.
2. Directly print the computed values: Instead of storing the results in 'area' and 'c', then printing these, you can directly print the computed results. This reduces memory usage slightly because we don't need to store the results.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  printf("%d %d\n", a*b, 2*(a+b));
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized version, we only perform multiplication once and remove the need for the 'area' and 'c' variables. We also ensure we return an integer at the end of the main function, which is good practice.
