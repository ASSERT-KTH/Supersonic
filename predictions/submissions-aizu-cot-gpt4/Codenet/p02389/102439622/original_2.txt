This is a simple C program that takes two integers as input, calculates their product (area), and the sum of twice each (perimeter) and prints them. There isn't much to optimize here because it's already quite efficient. However, there are a few minor things we can do.

1. Remove the unnecessary variable 'c'. We can directly print the expression in the printf statement.
2. Instead of multiplying 'a' and 'b' by 2 to calculate the perimeter, we can just add 'a' and 'b' and multiply the result by 2. This would reduce one multiplication operation.

Here is the optimized version of the given code:

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  int area = a * b;
  printf("%d %d\n", area, 2 * (a + b));
}
```

This does not make a significant difference in this particular program but practicing such small optimizations can lead to significant improvements in larger, more complex programs.
