The given program is already quite simple and efficient. It reads two integers from the standard input, calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle with sides a and b, and prints the results. The time and space complexity of this program is O(1), which means it does not depend on the size of the input.

However, if we want to optimize it a bit further, we can avoid the creation of the temporary variable 'c' and calculate the perimeter directly inside the printf function. This reduces memory usage slightly.

Here's the optimized version:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  printf("%d %d\n", a * b, 2 * (a + b));
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of changes:
1. I have removed the variable 'c' and its calculation.
2. I have moved the perimeter calculation directly into the printf function call. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2 * (length + width) or 2 * (a + b) in this case.
3. Also, I have added 'return 0;' at the end of the main function. Although it's not necessary in most modern C/C++ compilers as they add it automatically if it's missing, it's a good practice to add it for the sake of completeness and clarity.
