The given code is already quite efficient as it is simple arithmetic operations and I/O operations. However, one possible optimization is to remove the unnecessary variables. This won't affect the running time, but it might save a tiny bit of memory usage. 

You can calculate and print the results directly without storing them in variables.

Here's the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  printf("%d %d\n", a * b, a * 2 + b * 2);
}
```

In this optimized version, I have removed the variables `area` and `c` and performed the calculations directly within the `printf` function. This reduces the memory footprint of the program slightly. However, it should be noted that this optimization will likely have a negligible impact on performance in modern systems, as the memory usage of a few integers is quite small.
