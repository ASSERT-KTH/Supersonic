The provided program creates a tree structure using the `node` struct, and has various utility functions to initialize nodes, get the depth of a node, print a node's details, etc.

There are a few places where small optimizations can be made:

1. `scanf` and `printf` calls can be quite slow due to their buffering and parsing of format strings, so reducing the number of such calls can potentially speed up the program. In the provided program, there are multiple consecutive `scanf` and `printf` calls that can be combined into a single call.

2. The `getDepth` function currently has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the depth of the node. However, we can calculate and store the depth of each node during the tree construction to reduce this time complexity to O(1).

3. The memory allocated for the `arr` array is never freed, which can lead to a memory leak.

Below is the optimized version of the program with these changes applied:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct node {
  int id;
  int depth; // Added depth field
  struct node *parent;
  struct node *leftMostChild;
  struct node *rightSibling;
} * nodePointer;

nodePointer make1node(void);
void printNode(nodePointer);
void printType(nodePointer);
void printChild(nodePointer);
nodePointer init(int, int);
nodePointer head;

int main(void) {
  int i, j;
  int n;
  int id, k, c1, c2;
  nodePointer p1, p2;
  nodePointer *arr;

  head = init(-1, 0);
  scanf("%d", &n);

  arr = (nodePointer *)malloc(sizeof(nodePointer) * n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    arr[i] = init(i, 0); // 0 depth initially
  }

  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d%d", &id, &k); // Combined scanf
    for (j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      scanf("%d", &c1);
      if (j == 0) {
        arr[id]->leftMostChild = arr[c1];
      } else {
        arr[c2]->rightSibling = arr[c1];
      }
      arr[c1]->parent = arr[id];
      arr[c1]->depth = arr[id]->depth + 1; // Update depth during tree construction
      c2 = c1;
    }
  }

  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    printNode(arr[i]);

  free(arr); // Free memory

  return 0;
}

nodePointer init(int id, int depth) {
  nodePointer p = make1node();
  p->id = id;
  p->depth = depth; // Set depth
  p->parent = NULL;
  p->leftMostChild = NULL;
  p->rightSibling = NULL;
  return p;
}

void printNode(nodePointer p) {
  printf("node %d: ", p->id);
  printf("parent = %d, ", p->parent != NULL ? p->parent->id : -1);
  printf("depth = %d, ", p->depth); // Print depth directly
  printType(p);
  printf(", ");
  printChild(p);
  printf("\n");
}

nodePointer make1node(void) {
  return (nodePointer)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
}

void printType(nodePointer p) {
  printf("%s", p->parent == NULL ? "root" : (p->leftMostChild == NULL ? "leaf" : "internal node"));
}

void printChild(nodePointer p) {
  printf("[");
  if (p->leftMostChild != NULL) {
    p = p->leftMostChild;
    printf("%d", p->id);
    for (; p->rightSibling != NULL; p = p->rightSibling)
      printf(", %d", p->rightSibling->id);
  }
  printf("]");
}
```

These optimizations should make the program run faster and use memory more efficiently. However, it's important to note that these are minor optimizations, and the biggest improvements would likely come from rethinking the overall data structure and algorithm if that was possible.
