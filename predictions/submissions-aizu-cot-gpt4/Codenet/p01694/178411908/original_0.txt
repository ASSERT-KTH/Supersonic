The program reads a sequence of strings and counts transitions between certain pairs of them. We can optimize the program by reducing the number of string comparisons. In the original version, the program uses string comparisons to identify the pairs of strings. String comparison is quite slow and inefficient especially when the strings are long. Instead, we can use a map to assign an integer to each string and then just compare integers, which is much faster.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Replace the string comparison with integer comparison. Create a map to associate each string with a unique integer. Only use strings when reading input, then convert them to integers and work with integers.

2. Remove the unnecessary preprocessor directives. `#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (int)n; ++i)` and other similar defines are not needed because they are used only once. It's better to write the loop directly in the code. It will make the code clearer and more understandable.

3. Remove the unused typedefs and constants. They just consume memory and complicate the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  unordered_map<string, int> dir = {{"lu", 0}, {"ru", 1}, {"ld", 2}, {"rd", 3}};
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    int ans = 0;
    int now = -1, next;
    string str;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> str;
      next = dir[str];
      if ((now == 0 && next == 1) || (now == 1 && next == 0) || 
          (now == 2 && next == 3) || (now == 3 && next == 2))
        ans++;
      now = next;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimization will significantly reduce the running time of the program because integer comparison is much faster than string comparison. The memory usage is also slightly reduced because we removed the unnecessary typedefs and constants.
