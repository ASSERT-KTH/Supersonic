This C/C++ program seems to be counting how many times a specific transition happens between two strings in a sequence. The program is mostly well-written but there are a few potential areas for optimization:

1. **Unnecessary Type Definitions and Macros**: The type definitions (`typedef`) and the macros (`#define`) at the beginning of the program are not used anywhere in the code, so they should be removed to reduce clutter and improve readability.
   
2. **Avoiding std namespace**: It is generally a bad practice to use the entire `std` namespace. Instead, we should only import the specific functions that we need.

3. **Memory Usage**: The program uses two string variables (`now` and `next`) to keep track of the current and next strings. We can reduce the memory usage by using a single string variable and a character variable to store the last character of the current string.

4. **Input/Output optimization**: By using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`, we can significantly speed up C++ input/output operations.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::string;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    int ans = 0;
    string now;
    char last_char = ' ';
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> now;
      if ((last_char == 'u' && now == "ru") || (last_char == 'r' && now == "lu") ||
          (last_char == 'd' && now == "rd") || (last_char == 'd' && now == "ld"))
        ans++;
      last_char = now[1];
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimized program assumes that the input strings are always of length 2. If the strings can have varying lengths, we will need to modify the program to handle that.
