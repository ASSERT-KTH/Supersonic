Optimization Steps:

1. Instead of using stringstream to concatenate strings and then outputting them, directly output the '#' character to the console. This eliminates the need for the stringstream object and reduces memory usage.

2. Instead of using a loop to print the '#' character 'w' times, use the string constructor that repeats a character a specified number of times. This reduces the number of iterations and thus optimizes running time.

3. In the original program, after generating the string for each row, it is outputted immediately. This may cause multiple I/O operations which can be time-consuming. So, instead, we can generate the whole string for the rectangle and output it at once.

4. We can reserve space for the string 'str'. By reserving, we can potentially reduce the number of memory allocations that the program makes.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

auto main() -> int {
  int h, w;
  for (;;) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::string str;
    str.reserve(h*(w+1));
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      str += std::string(w, '#') + "\n";
    }
    std::cout << str << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces memory usage by avoiding the stringstream and optimizing running time by reducing the number of iterations and I/O operations.
