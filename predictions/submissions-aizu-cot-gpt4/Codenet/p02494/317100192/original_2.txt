The program reads in pairs of integers from standard input and outputs a grid of '#' characters of the given dimensions. It terminates when it reads a pair of zeros.

The only real optimization possible here is to avoid the use of the std::stringstream and std::string objects, since these allocate memory dynamically and perform string concatenation, both of which are relatively slow operations. Instead, we could print the '#' characters and newlines directly to standard output, which eliminates the need for dynamic memory allocation and string concatenation.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the std::stringstream ss declaration. It is not needed since we can print directly to the console.

2. Inside the nested loops, replace ss << '#' with std::cout << '#'. This prints each '#' character directly to standard output.

3. Replace ss << '\n' with std::cout << '\n'. This prints a newline character directly to standard output after each row of '#' characters.

4. Remove the std::cout << ss.str() << std::endl; line. It is no longer necessary since we're printing directly to standard output.

Here's the optimized program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
auto main() -> int {
  int h, w;
  for (;;) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x) {
        std::cout << '#';
      }
      std::cout << '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program should run faster and use less memory than the original, especially for large dimensions of the grid.
