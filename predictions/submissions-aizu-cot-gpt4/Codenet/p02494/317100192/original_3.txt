The given program generates a rectangle of '#' characters of size h by w, repeatedly, until the input is 0 0. It uses a stringstream to accumulate the characters before printing them all at once.

The optimization opportunities here are mainly focused on reducing the usage of the stringstream, which has fairly high overhead for this use.

Step by step optimization:

1. Replace the stringstream with a pre-allocated string of maximum length. This reduces the memory allocation and deallocation overhead of the stringstream.

2. Replace the inner for loop that writes characters to the stringstream with a call to std::string::append. This reduces the number of function calls and stream insertions.

3. Print the string directly to std::cout after each rectangle is constructed, rather than storing all the rectangles in the stringstream and printing them all at once. This reduces the memory usage by not storing all the rectangles at the same time.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
auto main() -> int {
  int h, w;
  std::string line;
  for (;;) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    line = std::string(w, '#') + '\n';
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      std::cout << line;
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
