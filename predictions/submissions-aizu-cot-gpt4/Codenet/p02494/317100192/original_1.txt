This program reads pairs of integers from the standard input, and for each pair (h, w), it outputs a rectangle made of '#' of height h and width w. The program ends when a pair (0, 0) is read.

Here are some optimizations we can apply:

1. Avoid the use of stringstream where it is not necessary. In this case, there is no need to build the entire string in memory only to output it immediately afterwards. We can improve memory usage by directly sending the output to std::cout.

2. The inner loop that prints the '#' characters is essentially printing a string of '#' characters of fixed length w. Instead of repeatedly outputting a single character '#', we can create a string of '#' characters of length w and print the entire string at once. This can reduce the overhead of multiple output operations.

3. Move the check for the end condition (h == 0 && w == 0) right after the input, so we don't need to create the stringstream or the string of '#' characters if we're about to exit the program.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  int h, w;
  while (true) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::string row(w, '#');
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      std::cout << row << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the program uses less memory because it avoids the unnecessary use of stringstream and outputs directly to std::cout. Also, it can potentially be faster because it reduces the number of output operations by printing entire rows at once.
