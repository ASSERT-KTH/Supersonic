As an experienced C/C++ developer, there are a few optimizations we can do in this program:

1. The first optimization is avoiding the use of `std::stringstream` to accumulate the output. String concatenation is a costly operation in terms of time complexity. Instead, we can directly output the characters to `std::cout`.

2. To further optimize the nested loop, we can use a single call to `std::cout` to output multiple '#' characters at once. This reduces the overhead of calling `std::cout` multiple times.

3. We can add `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` to make input and output more efficient. This disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. But in this case, mixing C and C++ IO operations is not done, so we can safely disable it.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int h, w;
  for (;;) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::string line(w, '#');
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      std::cout << line << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program should run significantly faster and use less memory than the original one.
