First, let's discuss the main points we can optimize in this code:

1. The use of `std::stringstream` to construct the output string. While this is good for readability and understanding, it can be quite taxing on the memory and time because it involves a lot of string concatenation operations. We could directly output the results to `std::cout` in the inner loop to avoid this extra overhead.

2. We don't need to check for the condition `if (h == 0 && w == 0)` immediately after the input is taken. We can take this check to the end of the loop which will save one unnecessary loop check when the program end condition is met.

3. We don't necessarily need to use `std::endl` to print a newline and flush the output buffer. Using `'\n'` will give us the newline, and the buffer will be flushed when the program ends or when it's full, whichever comes first. This will save us some unnecessary buffer flush operations.

Here's how the optimized code would look:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int h, w;
  for (;;) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x) {
        std::cout << '#';
      }
      std::cout << '\n';
    }
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimization here is very minute and might not be noticeable for small inputs. The main goal here is to get rid of unnecessary operations. For larger inputs, the difference could be noticeable.
