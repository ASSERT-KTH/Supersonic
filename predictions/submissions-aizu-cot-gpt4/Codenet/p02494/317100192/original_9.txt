This program generates a grid of '#' characters with dimensions given as inputs. The primary area of improvement is to reduce the usage of the `stringstream` object in the nested loop. Currently, the program is using the `stringstream` to build the grid string and then print it out. This is unnecessary and can be optimized by directly printing the grid as it is generated.

1. Remove the `stringstream` object.
2. Replace the `ss << '#'` with `std::cout << '#'` and `ss << '\n'` with `std::cout << '\n'`.
3. Remove the line `std::cout << ss.str() << std::endl;`.

Applying these steps, the optimized program would look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
auto main() -> int {
  int h, w;
  for (;;) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x) {
        std::cout << '#';
      }
      std::cout << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program directly prints the grid as it is generated, which reduces the memory usage and running time of the program.
