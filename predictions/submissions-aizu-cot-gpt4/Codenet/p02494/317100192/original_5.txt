The given C++ program reads two integers from the input until they're both zero. For each pair of integers, it prints a rectangle of '#' characters with the given width and height.

There are several optimizations we can make to this program:

1. Unnecessary use of stringstream: The stringstream object 'ss' is used to build the string to be output, but it's not really necessary. Instead, we could directly print to the standard output, which would save memory and time.

2. Inefficient string concatenation: Each call to 'ss << "#" ' causes a new string to be created and the old one to be destroyed. This is a heavy operation and can be avoided.

3. Unnecessary newline after last line: The program prints a newline character after the last line of '#' characters, which might not be desired. 

4. Usage of 'std::endl': 'std::endl' is used to print a newline character and flush the output stream. If we don't need to flush the stream immediately, it's more efficient to print '\n'.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int h, w;
  while (true) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x) {
        std::cout << '#';
      }
      if (y != h - 1) std::cout << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version, we write directly to the standard output and we only print a newline character if it's not the last line of '#' characters. We also replaced the 'std::endl' with '\n'.
