This program reads pairs of integers from the standard input until it gets a pair of zeros. For each pair, it prints a rectangle of hash signs (#) of the given size. The size of each rectangle is determined by the pair of integers read from the standard input. The rectangle is printed to the standard output.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Avoid using `std::stringstream` to concatenate the strings. This is because creating, inserting, and extracting strings to/from the `std::stringstream` can be time-consuming and memory-intensive. Instead, use `std::string::append` or `std::string::operator+=`.

2. To avoid multiple heap allocations during the string concatenation, reserve the memory in advance using `std::string::reserve`. The total size needed for a rectangle is `h * (w + 1)`. The `+ 1` is for the newline character after each row.

3. Instead of using `std::endl` which inserts a newline character and then flushes the output stream, use '\n' directly. Flushing the output stream can be expensive and is not necessary here.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

auto main() -> int {
  int h, w;
  for (;;) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::string str;
    str.reserve(h * (w + 1));
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x) {
        str += '#';
      }
      str += '\n';
    }
    std::cout << str << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please test this program on your side to ensure it works as expected.
