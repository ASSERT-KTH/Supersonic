The main optimization here is to avoid using a stringstream to build the string. Instead, we can directly print to the console. This will avoid the overhead of building the string in memory before printing it out. This can significantly reduce memory usage and potentially increase speed, especially for large h and w.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int h, w;
  for (;;) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x) {
        std::cout << '#';
      }
      std::cout << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Another possible improvement could be to create a string of '#' of length w once and print this string h times. This way we only have to create the string once, and can avoid the inner loop. This could potentially improve speed, especially for large w. However, this would increase memory usage slightly, as we need to store the string. Here is a version of the program with this optimization:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  int h, w;
  for (;;) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::string line(w, '#');
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      std::cout << line << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
