The following optimizations can be done:

1. Repeated calculations: The variable `b` is calculated every time inside the while loop using the same equation. This calculation can be moved outside the while loop to save computation time. Similarly, the expression `(100 + x) / 100.0` is used multiple times. You can compute this once and store it in a variable for use in the rest of the code.

2. Unnecessary use of vector: The vector `tax` is used to store the values of `a` and `b` but there is no need to store these values as they are not used after the calculation of `maxi`.

3. Unnecessary checks: The check `b != 0` is unnecessary because if `b` equals `0`, the condition `((int)((a * (100 + x)) / 100.0) + (int)((b * (100 + x)) / 100.0)) == s` will not be true.

The optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int x, y, s;
  while (cin >> x >> y >> s && (x || y || s)) {
    int maxi = 0, a = 1, b, calc;
    float y_val = (100 + y) / 100.0, x_val = (100 + x) / 100.0;
    while (a < s) {
      b = (s - (int)(a * x_val) + 1) / x_val;
      calc = (int)(a * x_val) + (int)(b * x_val);
      if (calc == s) {
        maxi = max(maxi, (int)(a * y_val) + (int)(b * y_val));
      }
      a++;
    }
    cout << maxi << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the code is more efficient and uses less memory. The calculations that were previously being done in each iteration of the loop are now done only once, and the unnecessary vector and checks have been removed.
