The following optimizations can be made:

1. Precompute some values: The value of `(100 + x) / 100.0` is used in multiple places. It can be calculated once and stored for avoiding multiple calculations and improving execution time.

2. Vector Initialization: The vector `tax` is initialized with a size of 1000. However, it's hard to know if all of this space is necessary. If the values of `a` and `b` are only kept for the purpose of calculating `maxi`, then it's not necessary to store them in a matrix. Instead, we can calculate `maxi` directly and avoid the need for the `tax` vector altogether.

3. Integer Division: In several places, the program is performing integer division on doubles. This is unnecessary and can slow down the program. Instead, we should perform the division as a double division and then cast the result to an integer only when necessary.

4. Remove unnecessary condition: The condition `b != 0` is not necessary as the `while` loop ensures that `b` will never be 0.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int x, y, s;
  while (cin >> x >> y >> s && (x || y || s)) {
    int maxi = 0, a = 1, b;
    double rateX = (100 + x) / 100.0;
    double rateY = (100 + y) / 100.0;
    while (a < s) {
      b = (s - static_cast<int>(a * rateX) + 1) / rateX;
      if ((static_cast<int>(a * rateX) + static_cast<int>(b * rateX)) == s) {
        maxi = max(maxi, static_cast<int>(a * rateY) +
                             static_cast<int>(b * rateY));
      }
      a++;
    }
    cout << maxi << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program should run faster and use significantly less memory than the original version.
