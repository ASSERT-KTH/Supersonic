This program can be optimized in several ways. Let's break it down:

1. **Avoiding Unnecessary Calculations:** There are repeated calculations such as `(100 + x)` and `(int)((a * (100 + x)) / 100.0)` that can be computed once and stored in variables for further use. This will reduce the time taken to perform these operations repeatedly.

2. **Minimizing Memory Usage:** The 2D vector `tax` is being used to store the values of `a` and `b`. However, the values of `a` and `b` are only used to calculate `maxi`. We can directly use the values of `a` and `b` in calculating `maxi` and remove the `tax` vector. This will reduce the memory usage.

3. **Removing Unused Variables:** The variable `i` is being incremented but never used elsewhere. This can be removed.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x, y, s;
    while (cin >> x >> y >> s && (x || y || s)) {
        int maxi = 0, a = 1, b;
        double x_ratio = (100 + x) / 100.0;
        double y_ratio = (100 + y) / 100.0;
        while (a < s) {
            b = (s - (int)(a * x_ratio) + 1) / x_ratio;
            if ((int)(a * x_ratio) + (int)(b * x_ratio) == s && b != 0) {
                maxi = max(maxi, (int)(a * y_ratio) + (int)(b * y_ratio));
            }
            a++;
        }
        cout << maxi << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This optimized program reduces unnecessary calculations and memory usage, making it more efficient.
