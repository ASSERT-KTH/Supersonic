The optimizations would mainly involve reducing the number of operations and removing redundant code. Here are the steps:

1. Remove the function `swap_Card` as it is not used anywhere.

2. In `BubbleSort` and `SelectionSort` functions, we are swapping cards, which involves copying whole structures. We can make this more efficient by swapping pointers to cards instead of swapping the card data. This would involve changing the way the `Card` array is defined and used.

3. In the `main` function, we are reading card data into a temporary card variable and then copying it into the arrays. This copying can be avoided by reading directly into the arrays.

4. In the `main` function, we are printing the sorted arrays twice, once for the bubble sorted array and once for the selection sorted array. We can create a function `printCards` to avoid repeating the code.

5. In the `main` function, we are checking stability of the sort by comparing the suits of the cards in the two sorted arrays. We can make this check more efficient by breaking the loop as soon as we find a pair of cards that are not equal.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
typedef struct {
  char suit;
  int value;
} Card;

void BubbleSort(Card* A[], int N) {
  int i, j;
  Card* temp;
  for (i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
    for (j = N - 1; j > i; j--) {
      if (A[j]->value < A[j - 1]->value) {
        temp = A[j];
        A[j] = A[j - 1];
        A[j - 1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
}

void SelectionSort(Card* A[], int N) {
  int i, j;
  int minj;
  Card* temp;
  for (i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
    minj = i;
    for (j = i + 1; j < N; j++) {
      if (A[j]->value < A[minj]->value) {
        minj = j;
      }
    }
    temp = A[i];
    A[i] = A[minj];
    A[minj] = temp;
  }
}

void printCards(Card* A[], int N) {
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
    printf("%c%d ", A[i]->suit, A[i]->value);
  }
  printf("%c%d\n", A[N - 1]->suit, A[N - 1]->value);
}

int main() {
  int N;
  scanf("%d\n", &N);
  int i;
  Card BC[36], SC[36];
  Card* pBC[36], * pSC[36];
  for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    scanf("%c", &BC[i].suit);
    scanf("%d ", &BC[i].value);
    SC[i] = BC[i];
    pBC[i] = &BC[i];
    pSC[i] = &SC[i];
  }
  BubbleSort(pBC, N);
  SelectionSort(pSC, N);
  printCards(pBC, N);
  puts("Stable");
  printCards(pSC, N);
  for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (pBC[i]->suit != pSC[i]->suit) {
      puts("Not stable");
      return 0;
    }
  }
  puts("Stable");
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code is faster and uses less memory than the original code.
