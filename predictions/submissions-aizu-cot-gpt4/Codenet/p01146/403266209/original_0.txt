This C++ program seems to be implementing the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which is used for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights. Here are some potential optimizations:

1. Avoid global `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is quite large and includes a lot of unnecessary libraries thereby increasing the compile time. Include only those libraries that are actually needed.

2. Avoid using `#define` for loops: This can lead to confusing code and is not generally a good practice. Use regular for loops instead.

3. Use `vector` instead of array: Dynamic arrays `b` and `x` are created with size `n`. Instead, you could use `std::vector` which is a dynamic array provided by the C++ Standard Library. It can grow and shrink at runtime.

4. Use `unordered_set` instead of `set`: The `std::unordered_set` container is faster than `std::set` for lookups on average because it uses hashing instead of a binary search tree.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>
#define INF 1e9

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, m, l, k, a, h, t1, t2, t3;
    while (cin >> n >> m >> l >> k >> a >> h, n) {
        unordered_set<int> rei;
        rei.insert(a);
        rei.insert(h);

        vector<vector<int>> b(n, vector<int>(n, INF));
        vector<vector<int>> x(n, vector<int>(n, INF));

        int re;
        for(int i = 0; i < l; i++) {
            cin >> re;
            rei.insert(re);
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            cin >> t1 >> t2 >> t3;
            b[t1][t2] = b[t2][t1] = t3;
        }

        for(int o = 0; o < n; o++)
            for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
                for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                    b[i][j] = min(b[i][j], b[i][o] + b[o][j]);

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            if (rei.count(i))
                for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                    if (rei.count(j) && b[i][j] <= m)
                        x[i][j] = b[i][j];

        for(int o = 0; o < n; o++)
            for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
                for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                    x[i][j] = min(x[i][j], x[i][o] + x[o][j]);

        if (x[a][h] >= INF)
            cout << "Help!" << endl;
        else if (x[a][h] < m)
            cout << x[a][h] << endl;
        else
            cout << x[a][h] * 2 - m << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Please note that the memory usage and running time are highly dependent on the input size. If `n`, `m`, `l`, and `k` are large, the program may still consume a significant amount of memory and time due to the triple nested loops and the use of dynamic data structures. These are inherent to the Floyd-Warshall algorithm and the problem being solved, and cannot be optimized further without changing the algorithm or problem constraints.
