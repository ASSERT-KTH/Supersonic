The original code is solving a shortest path problem in a graph using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, with additional constraints. 

Let's optimize the original code:

1. Avoid declaring variables in global scope: Declaring variables in the global scope, especially when they are not required, can lead to unnecessary memory usage. In the original code, the variables t1, t2, and t3 are not used outside of the for loop where they are used, so they can be declared inside the loop.

2. Use vector instead of array: The original code uses arrays to store the graph representation. We can use vectors instead, which provide dynamic size and built-in functions for easier manipulation. This will also save memory as the size of vectors can be altered dynamically. 

3. Use unordered_set instead of set: The original code uses a set to store vertexes, which has a time complexity of O(log n) for insertion and retrieval operations. We can use an unordered_set instead, which has an average time complexity of O(1) for the same operations. This optimization will reduce the running time.

4. Avoid redundant computations: The original code calculates the shortest path between every pair of vertices twice, once for the array b and once for the array x. We can optimize this by calculating the shortest path only once and using the results for both arrays.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define r(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define INF 1e9
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, m, l, k, a, h;
  while (cin >> n >> m >> l >> k >> a >> h, n) {
    unordered_set<int> rei;
    rei.insert(a), rei.insert(h);
    vector<vector<int>> b(n, vector<int>(n, INF));
    vector<vector<int>> x(n, vector<int>(n, INF));
    int re;
    r(i, l) {
        cin >> re;
        rei.insert(re);
    }
    r(i, k) {
        int t1, t2, t3;
        cin >> t1 >> t2 >> t3;
        b[t1][t2] = b[t2][t1] = t3;
    }
    r(o, n) r(i, n) r(j, n) {
        b[i][j] = min(b[i][j], b[i][o] + b[o][j]);
        if (rei.count(i) && rei.count(j)) {
            x[i][j] = b[i][j];
        }
    }
    r(o, n) r(i, n) r(j, n) x[i][j] = min(x[i][j], x[i][o] + x[o][j]);
    if (x[a][h] >= INF)
      cout << "Help!" << endl;
    else if (x[a][h] < m)
      cout << x[a][h] << endl;
    else
      cout << x[a][h] * 2 - m << endl;
  }
}
```

Please note that these optimizations are mainly focused on improving runtime efficiency and memory usage. Some other aspects, such as code readability or best practices, are not covered here.
