Here are a few optimizations that can be applied to the given program:

1. Use `vector` instead of arrays: Arrays in C++ are not as flexible as vectors and do not give many built-in functionalities. Using vectors also helps in reducing memory usage as it can dynamically resize as needed.

2. Initialize 2D vectors with INF: The current implementation uses two nested loops to assign INF to all elements. This can be avoided by using the fill constructor of vector which assigns a given value to all elements while creating the vector.

3. Avoid unnecessary calculations: In the current implementation, the program performs some unnecessary calculations. In the third nested loop, we can restrict the inner two loops to only iterate over elements in 'rei' set. This would reduce the number of unnecessary iterations.

4. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`: This will make the input/output more efficient, which can be helpful in reducing the running time of the program.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define r(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define INF 1e9
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, m, l, k, a, h, t1, t2, t3;
  while (cin >> n >> m >> l >> k >> a >> h, n) {
    set<int> rei;
    rei.insert(a), rei.insert(h);
    vector<vector<int>> b(n, vector<int>(n, INF)), x(n, vector<int>(n, INF));
    r(i, l) cin >> re, rei.insert(re);
    r(i, k) cin >> t1 >> t2 >> t3, b[t1][t2] = b[t2][t1] = t3;
    r(o, n) for(auto i: rei) for(auto j: rei) b[i][j] = min(b[i][j], b[i][o] + b[o][j]);
    for(auto i: rei) for(auto j: rei) if (b[i][j] <= m) x[i][j] = b[i][j];
    r(o, n) for(auto i: rei) for(auto j: rei) x[i][j] = min(x[i][j], x[i][o] + x[o][j]);
    if (x[a][h] >= INF)
      cout << "Help!" << endl;
    else if (x[a][h] < m)
      cout << x[a][h] << endl;
    else
      cout << x[a][h] * 2 - m << endl;
  }
}
```
Please note that, depending on the problem specifics, the efficiency gain from these improvements may vary. For example, if the size of 'n' is small, the difference may not be noticeable. However, for large 'n', these improvements can significantly reduce the running time and memory usage.
