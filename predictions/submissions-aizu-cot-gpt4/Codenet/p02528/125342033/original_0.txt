The given C/C++ program reads an array of integers from standard input, sorts the array, and then prints the sorted array to standard output. The program is already quite efficient in terms of time complexity, as the sorting operation dominates with a time complexity of O(n log n). The memory usage of the program is also quite good, as it only uses a single array to store the input numbers.

Nevertheless, there are still a couple of small optimizations that can be made:

1. **Avoid unnecessary initialization:** The variable `f` is initialized to `0` before the second loop, but it is immediately set to `1` in the first iteration of the loop. Therefore, it would be more efficient to initialize `f` to `1` and adjust the loop accordingly.

2. **Use '\n' instead of puts("") for new line:** It's a more efficient way to print a newline character.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
int main() {
  int n, i, A[1000001];
  for (scanf("%d", &n), i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", A + i);
  std::sort(A, A + n);
  if (n > 0) {
    printf("%d", A[0]);
    for (i = 1; i < n; i++)
      printf(" %d", A[i]);
  }
  printf("\n");
}
```

In this optimized version, `f` is removed completely since it is unnecessary. Instead, the first element is printed before the loop, and then the rest of the elements are printed from within the loop. This ensures that there is no leading space before the first element, which was the original purpose of `f`. The `if (n > 0)` check is added to prevent potential issues when `n` is `0`. 

The `puts("")` function call is replaced with `printf("\n")`, which is more efficient because it doesn't need to scan the string for a null terminator. 

Please keep in mind that these optimizations are quite minor and unlikely to result in noticeable performance improvements for the given program. The biggest impact on performance will come from the choice of sorting algorithm, which is determined by the `std::sort` function in the C++ Standard Library.
