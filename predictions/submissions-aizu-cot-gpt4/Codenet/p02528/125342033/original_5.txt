Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid using scanf and printf which are slower than cin and cout in C++. We will use ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) to make cin and cout operations faster.

2. Use vector instead of array. This will give us dynamic size and we won't need to allocate maximum size initially. This will save memory.

3. Use '\n' instead of puts("") for printing newline. '\n' is faster than puts("")

4. Instead of using a flag variable 'f' to print space before numbers (except the first number), we can print a space after each number which will give the same result. This will reduce the number of operations in the loop.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> A[i];

  sort(A.begin(), A.end());

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cout << A[i] << ' ';

  cout << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program should be faster and use less memory than the original program.
