This C++ program reads an array of integers from the standard input, sorts it, and then prints it to the standard output. The program is already quite optimized, but there are a few small changes we could make:

1. **Array to Vector**: In C++, it's generally better to use a vector instead of an array because vectors are dynamic arrays that can grow and shrink in size. This would also eliminate the need for the variable `n` because you can get the size of a vector with the `size` method.

2. **Use cin and cout instead of scanf and printf**: In C++, `cin` and `cout` are generally more idiomatic than `scanf` and `printf`. These also automatically take care of type conversion, which can help prevent errors.

3. **Use "\n" instead of puts("")**: It's more efficient to use "\n" to print a new line instead of `puts("")`.

4. **Use auto in the for loop**: It's more idiomatic in modern C++ to use `auto` in the for loop to automatically infer the type of the variable.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  vector<int> A;
  int f;

  for (int i; cin >> i;) {
    A.push_back(i);
  }
  sort(A.begin(), A.end());

  for (auto i = A.begin(); i != A.end(); ++i) {
    cout << (f ? " " : "") << *i;
    f = 1;
  }
  cout << "\n";
}
```

This code still does essentially the same thing as the original program, but it's more idiomatic and slightly more efficient.
