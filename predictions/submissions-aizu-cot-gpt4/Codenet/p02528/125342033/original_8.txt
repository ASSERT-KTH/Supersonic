The provided C++ code reads 'n' numbers from the standard input, stores them in an array, sorts the array, and then prints the sorted array.

The code is already quite efficient, but there are a few things we can do to optimize it a bit more.

1. Replace 'scanf' and 'printf' with 'cin' and 'cout': The 'scanf' and 'printf' functions are slower than 'cin' and 'cout' because they have to parse the format strings. 'cin' and 'cout' are tied with the C++ streams and are more efficient.

2. Use '\n' instead of 'puts("")': The 'puts' function appends a newline character automatically. By using '\n', we can avoid the overhead of a function call.

3. Use 'ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)': This unties 'cin' and 'cout' from the C streams, making them faster. 

4. Use 'cin.tie(NULL)': This unties 'cin' from 'cout', so 'cout' doesn't have to be flushed before every 'cin'. This can make input faster when you're doing a lot of alternating input and output.

Now let's implement these optimizations:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, f, A[1000001];
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> A[i];
  
  sort(A, A + n);

  for (int i = 0, f = 0; i < n; i++)
    cout << (f ? " " : "") << A[i], f = 1;

  cout << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the running time of the program is largely dominated by the 'sort' function, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). The optimizations we made will have a minor effect compared to this. However, they can still be useful in a situation where you're doing a lot of I/O operations.
