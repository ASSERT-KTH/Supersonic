The given C/C++ program reads an integer `n` as the number of elements, then reads `n` integers into array `A`, sorts `A` in ascending order, then prints the sorted numbers. 

Steps to optimize the program:

1. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` to unlink C++'s standard streams (cin, cout) with C's (scanf, printf). This can speed up I/O operations.

2. Use `cin.tie(NULL);` to untie `cin` from `cout`. By default, before each I/O operation with `cin`, `cout`'s buffer gets flushed. This operation is not necessary in the current program.

3. Use `'\n'` instead of `puts("")` or `endl`. `'\n'` does not flush the output buffer while `endl` and `puts("")` do.

4. Instead of using `printf` in a loop, we can use a `stringstream` to store the output, and then print it once at the end. This can reduce the number of I/O operations, which can be costly in terms of performance.

Now let's see the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, i, f;
  int A[1000001];
  cin >> n;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> A[i];
  
  sort(A, A + n);
  
  stringstream output;
  for (i = f = 0; i < n; i++)
    output << (f ? " " : "") << A[i], f = 1;
  
  cout << output.str() << '\n';
}
```

Remember that these optimizations mainly improve the performance for large inputs. In many real-world scenarios, you might not see a noticeable difference. However, in competitive programming or when dealing with large datasets, these optimizations can make a significant impact.
