This program reads a series of integers from the standard input, sorts them, and then prints them out.

The program can be optimized in several ways:

1. If the program is run multiple times with the same input, it would be beneficial to save the sorted array to a file, which can be loaded the next time the program runs. This will avoid the time-consuming sorting process. However, this optimization is out of the scope of the question as it requires adding new features and significantly changing the program structure.

2. The `printf` function is slower than `putchar` and `puts`, and the `scanf` function is slower than `getchar`. However, replacing them would make the program more complex and may not significantly improve performance, given that the majority of the time is spent sorting the array.

3. The biggest impact on performance is the sorting algorithm. The `std::sort` function in C++ uses the introsort algorithm, which has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). There are no faster sorting algorithms for arbitrary data. However, if the input data has certain characteristics, a faster algorithm might be used. For example, if the integers are all within a certain range, a counting sort or radix sort might be faster.

4. As for memory usage, the only large data structure is the array storing the integers. Its size is fixed and cannot be reduced.

Given the above analysis, there are no obvious optimizations for this program without changing its structure or behavior.

Here is the optimized code where there's no need to use a flag 'f' to check for the first element. Instead, we can separately handle the first element outside the loop and then start the loop from the second element (index 1).

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
int main() {
  int n, i, A[1000001];
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", A + i);
  std::sort(A, A + n);
  if(n>0) printf("%d", A[0]);
  for (i = 1; i < n; i++)
    printf(" %d", A[i]);
  puts("");
}
```
