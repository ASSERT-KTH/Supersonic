Optimization Steps:

1. The first optimization will be to reserve the input stream with a fixed size. This will help in reducing the time taken for memory allocation. We can use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` for this.

2. Instead of using `scanf` to read the input, we can use `std::cin`. This will help in reducing the execution time.

3. The `printf` function is more expensive in terms of time complexity than `std::cout`. So, we can replace `printf` with `std::cout`.

4. We can use `'\n'` instead of `puts("")` to print a newline character as it is faster.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    int n, f, A[1000001];
    std::cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        std::cin >> A[i];
    std::sort(A, A + n);
    for (int i = 0, f = 0; i < n; i++)
        std::cout << (f++ ? " " : "") << A[i];
    std::cout << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` can lead to faster execution, but it can cause problems if you are mixing `std::cin/cout` with `scanf/printf` in your code, which we are not in this optimized version.
