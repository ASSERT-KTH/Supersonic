The given program seems to be implementing the heap sort algorithm. The heap sort algorithm is already an optimized sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n). However, there are a few places where we could potentially optimize the program, but they might not significantly affect the runtime or memory usage:

1.  Static Array Size: In the main function, an array `a` of size 1000000 is declared. If the input size `n` is smaller than this size, then a lot of memory is wasted. Instead of declaring a static array of such a large size, we can dynamically allocate the array after taking the input size `n`.

2.  IO operations: The IO operations, cin and cout, are relatively slow. Therefore, we can use faster IO operations, such as scanf and printf, to further optimize the program.

Here's the modified code implementing these optimizations:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <utility>

template <class T, class Compare>
void hsort(T a, std::ptrdiff_t n, Compare cmp) {
  if (n < 2) {
    return;
  }
  using dif_t = std::ptrdiff_t;
  auto heapify = [](T a, dif_t p, dif_t hpsz, Compare cmp) {
    dif_t c;
    while ((c = (p << 1) + 1) < hpsz) {
      if (c + 1 < hpsz && cmp(a[c], a[c + 1])) {
        ++c;
      }
      if (!cmp(a[p], a[c])) {
        break;
      }
      std::swap(a[p], a[c]);
      p = c;
    }
  };
  for (dif_t i = n / 2; i >= 0; --i) {
    heapify(a, i, n, cmp);
  }
  for (dif_t i = n - 1; i > 0; --i) {
    std::swap(a[0], a[i]);
    heapify(a, 0, i, cmp);
  }
}

template <class Iterator, class Compare>
void hsort(Iterator a0, Iterator aN, Compare cmp) {
  using dif_t = typename std::iterator_traits<Iterator>::difference_type;
  dif_t n = std::distance(a0, aN);
  hsort(a0, n, cmp);
}

template <class Iterator> void hsort(Iterator a0, Iterator aN) {
  using val_t = typename std::iterator_traits<Iterator>::value_type;
  hsort(a0, aN, std::less<val_t>());
}

int main(void) {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int* a = new int[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
  hsort(a, a + n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    printf("%d%c", a[i], ((i == n - 1) ? '\n' : ' '));
  delete[] a;
  return 0;
}
```

Remember that these optimizations may not significantly improve the performance of the program, as heap sort is already an efficient algorithm and the original code was also well-written.
