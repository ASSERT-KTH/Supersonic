This program uses a heap sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. There are a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The heapify function is called in a loop for all elements. We could potentially start from the middle of the array and go backwards. This is because the elements after the middle are leaves and do not need to be heapified. This technique is known as Floyd's heap construction algorithm and it reduces the time complexity of the heap construction phase from O(n log n) to O(n).

2. The array a is declared as static with a size of 1 million. This means that the memory for the array is allocated at the start of the program and remains until the program ends, regardless of how much of the array is actually used. This could potentially waste a lot of memory if the input size is significantly less than 1 million. We could consider using a dynamic array (std::vector) that can resize depending on the input size, thus saving memory. 

3. There is a minor optimization in the print loop where we check if the current index is the last index in every iteration to decide whether to print a newline or a space. This check could be eliminated by always printing a space during the loop and printing a newline after the loop.

The optimized program would look like this:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

template <class T, class Compare>
void hsort(T a, std::ptrdiff_t n, Compare cmp) {
  if (n < 2) {
    return;
  }
  using dif_t = std::ptrdiff_t;
  auto heapify = [](T a, dif_t p, dif_t hpsz, Compare cmp) {
    dif_t c;
    while ((c = (p << 1) + 1) < hpsz) {
      if (c + 1 < hpsz && cmp(a[c], a[c + 1])) {
        ++c;
      }
      if (!cmp(a[p], a[c])) {
        break;
      }
      std::swap(a[p], a[c]);
      p = c;
    }
  };
  // Floyd's heap construction
  for (dif_t i = n / 2 - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
    heapify(a, i, n, cmp);
  }
  for (dif_t i = n - 1; i > 0; --i) {
    std::swap(a[0], a[i]);
    heapify(a, 0, i, cmp);
  }
}

template <class Iterator, class Compare>
void hsort(Iterator a0, Iterator aN, Compare cmp) {
  using dif_t = typename std::iterator_traits<Iterator>::difference_type;
  dif_t n = std::distance(a0, aN);
  hsort(a0, n, cmp);
}

template <class Iterator> 
void hsort(Iterator a0, Iterator aN) {
  using val_t = typename std::iterator_traits<Iterator>::value_type;
  hsort(a0, aN, std::less<val_t>());
}

int main(void) {
  using namespace std;
  cin.tie(0);
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  hsort(a.begin(), a.end());
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cout << a[i] << ' ';
  cout << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
