This code can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Reusing `i` as loop variable: `i` is used in multiple loops, we can declare it only once at the beginning of the program and then use it in all the loops. This will avoid unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation for `i` every time a loop starts and ends.

2. Unnecessary use of dynamic memory: The code uses dynamic memory allocation (through `new`) for arrays `P` and `H`. But it doesn't deallocate this memory at the end, which can cause memory leaks. Even though this isn't a big issue for smaller inputs, it will be a problem for larger ones. We can replace dynamic memory allocation with static memory allocation if the size of the input is not too large. If the input size can be large, we should at least deallocate the memory at the end.

3. Constructor in `Point` class: The constructor of the `Point` class declares two local variables `x` and `y` which shadows the class members `x` and `y`. This is a bug in the code and needs to be fixed.

4. `direct` function can be `const`: The `direct` function doesn't modify the points, so it can be declared as `const`.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Point {
public:
  int x, y;
  Point(int a = 0, int b = 0) : x(a), y(b) {};  // Fixed the constructor
  bool operator<(const Point &p) const {
    return y < p.y || (y == p.y && x < p.x);
  }
};

inline bool direct(const Point &base, const Point &a, const Point &b) {  // direct can be const
  return (a.x - base.x) * (b.y - base.y) - (a.y - base.y) * (b.x - base.x) < 0;
}

int main() {
  int n, i, k = 2;
  Point P[1000], H[2000];  // Replaces dynamic memory allocation with static if input size is not too large

  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d%d", &P[i].x, &P[i].y);
  }
  sort(P, P + n);
  H[0] = P[0];
  H[1] = P[1];
  for (i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
    while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i]))
      k--;
    H[k++] = P[i];
  }
  H[k++] = P[n - 1];
  for (i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i]))
      k--;
    H[k++] = P[i];
  }
  printf("%d\n", k - 1);
  for (i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i) {
    printf("%d %d\n", H[i].x, H[i].y);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this code assumes that the maximum number of points is 1000. If the maximum number of points can be more than 1000, you should stick with dynamic memory allocation but don't forget to deallocate the memory at the end with `delete[]`.
