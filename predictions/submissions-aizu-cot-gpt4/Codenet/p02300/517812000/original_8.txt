There are several optimizations to consider:

1. Avoid dynamic memory allocation whenever possible. In this case, we can use `std::vector` instead of raw pointers for the `P` and `H` arrays. This will not only optimize memory usage (since `std::vector` automatically manages memory), it will also make the code safer because we won't need to manually delete the arrays to prevent memory leaks.

2. The constructor of the `Point` class is not setting the member variables `x` and `y`. Instead, it is setting local variables. We should set the member variables instead.

3. The `direct` function is currently taking its parameters by reference. It is not modifying these parameters, so they can be taken by const reference. This will make the function safer because it won't accidentally modify the parameters.

4. The `scanf` and `printf` functions are slower than their C++ counterparts, `std::cin` and `std::cout`. We can replace these functions to make the program faster.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Point {
public:
  int x, y;
  Point(int a = 0, int b = 0) : x(a), y(b) {}
  bool operator<(const Point &p) const {
    return y < p.y || (y == p.y && x < p.x);
  }
};

inline bool direct(const Point &base, const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  return (a.x - base.x) * (b.y - base.y) - (a.y - base.y) * (b.x - base.x) < 0;
}

int main() {
  int n, i;
  int k = 2;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<Point> P(n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> P[i].x >> P[i].y;
  }
  std::sort(P.begin(), P.end());
  std::vector<Point> H(2 * n);
  H[0] = P[0];
  H[1] = P[1];
  for (i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
    while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i]))
      k--;
    H[k++] = P[i];
  }
  for (i = n - 1; i > 1; i--) {
    while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i - 1]))
      k--;
    H[k++] = P[i - 1];
  }
  std::cout << k - 1 << "\n";
  for (i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i) {
    std::cout << H[i].x << " " << H[i].y << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized code is not only faster and more memory efficient, but also safer and more idiomatic in modern C++.
