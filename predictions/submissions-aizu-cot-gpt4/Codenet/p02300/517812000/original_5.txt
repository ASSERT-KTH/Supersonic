The given code is aimed at the Convex Hull problem and finding the points that make up the convex hull of a set of points in a 2D plane. Here are some optimization suggestions:

1. Remove the `using namespace std;` line. It's not recommended to use the whole namespace. It can cause name collisions and unexpected behavior. 
2. In the constructor of the `Point` class, the variables `x` and `y` are declared again. This shadows the class members and results in them not being initialized. Remove the `int` keyword.
3. The `direct` function can be made a private member of the `Point` class since it operates on `Point` objects.
4. Dynamic memory allocation using the `new` keyword should be avoided when possible, as it can lead to memory leaks if not properly managed. Use smart pointers or STL containers like `std::vector` instead.
5. The condition checking in the for loop can be optimized by removing the `n - 2` operation in every iteration.
6. The use of `scanf` and `printf` for input/output can be replaced with `cin` and `cout` for better code readability.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Point {
public:
  int x, y;
  Point(int a = 0, int b = 0) : x(a), y(b) {};

  bool operator<(const Point &p) const {
    return y < p.y || (y == p.y && x < p.x);
  }

  static bool direct(Point &base, Point &a, Point &b) {
    return (a.x - base.x) * (b.y - base.y) - (a.y - base.y) * (b.x - base.x) < 0;
  }
};

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::vector<Point> P(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> P[i].x >> P[i].y;
  }

  std::sort(P.begin(), P.end());

  std::vector<Point> H(2 * n);
  H[0] = P[0];
  H[1] = P[1];

  int k = 2;
  int end = n - 2;
  for (int i = 0; i <= end; ++i) {
    while (k >= 2 && Point::direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i + 2])) {
      k--;
    }
    H[k++] = P[i + 2];
  }

  H[k++] = P[end];

  for (int i = n; i > 2; --i) {
    while (k >= 2 && Point::direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i - 3])) {
      k--;
    }
    H[k++] = P[i - 3];
  }

  std::cout << k - 1 << "\n";
  for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i) {
    std::cout << H[i].x << " " << H[i].y << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program uses the STL vector class for dynamic array allocation and it is safer and easier to manage than raw pointers. Also, by putting the `direct` function inside the `Point` class, we are encapsulating the function that operates on the `Point` class instances. This makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.
