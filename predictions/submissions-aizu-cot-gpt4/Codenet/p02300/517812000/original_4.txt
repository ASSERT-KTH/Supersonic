This program is finding the convex hull of a set of points in the plane, which is a common problem in computational geometry.

The optimization steps are as follows:

1. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` for faster input/output operations.

2. In the constructor of the class `Point`, you are creating local variables `x` and `y` instead of initializing the class members `x` and `y`. This is a bug and it also wastes memory. We need to correct this.

3. Dynamic memory allocation using `new` is slower and can lead to memory leaks if not handled properly. We replace the dynamic arrays `P` and `H` with `std::vector`. This also eliminates the need to manually manage memory.

4. If the number of points `n` is less than 2, the program will crash. We need to add a check for this.

5. The `direct` function can be a member function of the `Point` class, which can slightly improve the performance because it can directly access the member variables.

Below is the optimized program:

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Point {
public:
    int x, y;
    Point(int a = 0, int b = 0) : x(a), y(b) {};
    bool operator<(const Point &p) const {
        return y < p.y || (y == p.y && x < p.x);
    }
    inline bool direct(const Point &a, const Point &b) const {
        return (a.x - x) * (b.y - y) - (a.y - y) * (b.x - x) < 0;
    }
};

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    if(n < 2) return 0;
    vector<Point> P(n), H(2*n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> P[i].x >> P[i].y;
    }
    sort(P.begin(), P.end());
    H[0] = P[0];
    H[1] = P[1];
    int k = 2;
    for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
        while (k >= 2 && H[k - 2].direct(H[k - 1], P[i]))
            --k;
        H[k++] = P[i];
    }
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        while (k >= 2 && H[k - 2].direct(H[k - 1], P[i]))
            --k;
        H[k++] = P[i];
    }
    cout << k - 1 << '\n';
    for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i) {
        cout << H[i].x << ' ' << H[i].y << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
