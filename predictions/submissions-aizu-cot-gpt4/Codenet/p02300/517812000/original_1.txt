This program is a geometric algorithm to find the convex hull of a set of points. The optimization can be done in several ways:

1. The `Point` class constructor is not assigning values to member variables `x` and `y`. It's creating new local variables `x` and `y` which are not used anywhere. This issue should be fixed.

2. Using `std::vector` instead of dynamic arrays (`new` keyword) will prevent any potential memory leaks and will automatically manage the memory.

3. Instead of using printf and scanf for input/output operations, it would be better to use the C++ alternatives, cin and cout. cin and cout are generally slower than scanf and printf, but the difference is negligible and using cin/cout makes the code cleaner and less prone to errors.

4. Using `emplace_back` while adding elements to the vector will construct the object in place and avoid unnecessary copy or movement.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Point {
public:
  int x, y;
  Point(int a = 0, int b = 0) : x(a), y(b) {}
  bool operator<(const Point &p) const {
    return y < p.y || (y == p.y && x < p.x);
  }
};

inline bool direct(Point &base, Point &a, Point &b) {
  return (a.x - base.x) * (b.y - base.y) - (a.y - base.y) * (b.x - base.x) < 0;
}

int main() {
  int n, i;
  int k = 2;
  vector<Point> P, H;

  cin >> n;
  P.resize(n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> P[i].x >> P[i].y;
  }
  sort(P.begin(), P.end());
  
  H.resize(2 * n);
  H[0] = P[0];
  H[1] = P[1];
  
  for (i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
    while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i]))
      k--;
    H[k++] = P[i];
  }
  
  for (i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i - 1]))
      k--;
    H[k++] = P[i - 1];
  }

  cout << k - 1 << "\n";
  
  for (i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i) {
    cout << H[i].x << " " << H[i].y << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note that the loop indices have been adjusted as the C++ vectors start indexing from `0`. Also, the vector `H` is resized to `2*n` at the start and then elements are replaced as needed. This avoids the overhead of dynamic resizing of the vector.
