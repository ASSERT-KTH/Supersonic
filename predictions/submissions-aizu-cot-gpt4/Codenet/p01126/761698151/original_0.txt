First, let's understand the program: The program is a continuous game loop that ends when the user inputs three zeros. In each game loop, the program first reads from the input the values of `n`, `m`, and `a`. `n` appears to be unused and can be removed, `m` is the number of lines to read from the input, and `a` is the initial position. 

Next, the program creates a 2D array `amida` with a fixed size of `101x1001`. This array is too big and only a small portion of it is used. Instead of using a 2D array, we can use a map to only store the positions that are used. This will greatly reduce memory usage.

After initializing the array, the program reads `m` lines from the input and sets the value of `amida[p][h]` to `1` for each line. `p` and `h` are read from the input and can be any value from `1` to `1000`. Instead of storing these values in an array, we can store them in a map with the key being a pair `(p, h)`.

Next, the program checks the array `amida` from `j=1000` to `j=1` and if `amida[a][j]` is `1`, it increments `a`, and if `amida[a-1][j]` is `1`, it decrements `a`. Instead of checking all values of `j` from `1000` to `1`, we can keep track of the maximum `h` value when reading the input and only check the values of `j` from `max_h` to `1`. This will reduce the running time of the program.

Finally, the program outputs the value of `a` and repeats the game loop.

Here is the optimized program based on these observations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int m, a;
  while (true) {
    cin >> m >> a;
    if (m == 0 && a == 0) {
      break;
    }
    map<pair<int, int>, int> amida;
    int max_h = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      int h, p;
      cin >> h >> p;
      amida[{p, h}] = 1;
      if (h > max_h) max_h = h;
    }
    for (int j = max_h; j > 0; j--) {
      if (amida[{a, j}] == 1)
        a++;
      else if (amida[{a - 1, j}] == 1)
        a--;
    }
    cout << a << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that if the `n` variable is used in other parts of your program and it's not shown here, you shouldn't remove it. It was removed in this optimization because it seems to be unused in this snippet.
