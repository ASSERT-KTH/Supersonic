The code reads from standard input and processes the input. There are several optimizations that can be made:

1. Reduce the scope of variables: The variable `h` can be moved inside the inner loop. This is because it is only used within that loop and does not need to be maintained across iterations of the outer loop. This would free up a small amount of memory in each iteration of the outer loop.

2. Reduce the size of variables: The variables `p` and `q` are not used and can be removed.

3. Allocate memory dynamically: The array `amida` is initialized with a fixed size, which may waste memory if `m` is significantly smaller than 1001 or `n` is significantly smaller than 101. You could use a dynamic data structure like a vector or an array with dynamic size to save memory.

4. Avoid unnecessary checks: The check `amida[a - 1][j] == 1` can be avoided if `a` is 1.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, m, a;
  while (true) {
    cin >> n >> m >> a;
    if (n == 0 && m == 0 && a == 0) {
      break;
    }
    vector<vector<int>> amida(n+1, vector<int>(m+1, 0));
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      int h, p;
      cin >> h >> p;
      amida[p][h] = 1;
    }
    for (int j = m; j > 0; j--) {
      if (amida[a][j] == 1)
        a++;
      else if (a > 1 && amida[a - 1][j] == 1)
        a--;
    }
    cout << a << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that in the above code, the size of `amida` is now `n+1` and `m+1` to prevent out of range access. The for loop iterating over `j` now iterates till `m` instead of 1000 to match the size of the `amida` array.
