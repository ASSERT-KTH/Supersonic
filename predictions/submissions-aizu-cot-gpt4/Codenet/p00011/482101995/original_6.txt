The original program works, but there are a few areas where it could be optimized. 

1. The vector `StartingPoint` is initialized with a sequence of increasing integers. This is unnecessary because it is overwritten in the next loop, so this initialization can be skipped.

2. The vector `StartingPoint` holds `w` elements, which could be a large amount of memory if `w` is large. However, we don't need to store all these elements at once. We can instead use two variables to hold the current left and right endpoints and swap them as necessary.

3. The program reads from `cin` and writes to `cout` multiple times. This can be slow if there are many data. We can speed this up by using `cin.sync_with_stdio(false)` at the beginning of the program.

4. The use of `endl` to print a newline at the end of each output is inefficient because it also flushes the output buffer. We can use `'\n'` instead to only print a newline.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
struct THorizonalLine {
  int Left;
  int Right;
};
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int w, n;
  cin >> w >> n;
  int left, right;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    THorizonalLine HorizonalLine;
    char Dummy;
    cin >> HorizonalLine.Left >> Dummy >> HorizonalLine.Right;
    if(i == 0) {
        left = HorizonalLine.Left;
        right = HorizonalLine.Right;
      } else {
        if(HorizonalLine.Left == left) left = HorizonalLine.Right;
        else if(HorizonalLine.Left == right) right = HorizonalLine.Left;
        else if(HorizonalLine.Right == left) left = HorizonalLine.Left;
        else if(HorizonalLine.Right == right) right = HorizonalLine.Right;
      }
  }
  cout << left << '\n' << right << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that this version of the code assumes that each line will only swap the current left or right endpoint with a new point. If this is not the case, additional logic may be needed to handle other swaps.
