The program reads the number of elements and swaps, initializes a vector with the sequence of numbers, and then performs the swaps. At the end, it prints the final sequence. 

Here are the optimization steps:

1. The vector `StartingPoint` is initialized with `i + 1`. But the program uses `StartingPoint` only for swapping elements. After swapping, the program doesn't care about the original values. So there is no need to initialize the vector with `i + 1`. Instead, initialize it with `0`. This reduces unnecessary computations.

2. We don't need to store the left and right values in the `THorizonalLine` structure. We can read them directly into variables and perform the swap. This reduces memory usage.

3. We can use '\n' instead of `endl` for printing to the console. The `endl` manipulator flushes the output buffer each time it is called, whereas '\n' doesn't. This will make the output faster.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int w;
  cin >> w;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> StartingPoint(w, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int Left, Right;
    char Dummy;
    cin >> Left >> Dummy >> Right;
    swap(StartingPoint[Left - 1], StartingPoint[Right - 1]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    cout << StartingPoint[i] << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version should have the same functionality as the original, but with better performance in terms of time and space complexity.
