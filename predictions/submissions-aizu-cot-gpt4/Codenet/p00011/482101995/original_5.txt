The given program is a C++ program that reads a number `w` which represents the size of a vector StartingPoint. The elements of this vector are initialized from 1 to `w`. Then it reads `n` pairs of indices (left and right), and swaps the elements at these indices in the vector. Finally, it prints the elements of the vector.

The program can be optimized in terms of running time and memory usage using these steps:

1. Avoid unnecessary initializations: In the given program, the vector StartingPoint is initialized with values from 1 to `w`. However, these values are then swapped based on the user's input. Therefore, the initial values of the vector do not affect the final output of the program. Skipping the initialization of the vector can save both time and memory.

2. Minimize input/output operations: The program performs input and output operations inside loops. These operations are generally slow and can slow down the program, especially when the size of the input/output is large. To avoid this, the program can read all the input at once, perform the necessary operations, and then print the output at once.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
struct THorizonalLine {
  int Left;
  int Right;
};
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL); 
  int w;
  cin >> w;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> StartingPoint(w);
  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    StartingPoint[i] = i + 1;
  }
  THorizonalLine HorizonalLine[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    char Dummy;
    cin >> HorizonalLine[i].Left >> Dummy >> HorizonalLine[i].Right;
  }
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    swap(StartingPoint[HorizonalLine[i].Left - 1],
         StartingPoint[HorizonalLine[i].Right - 1]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    cout << StartingPoint[i] << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note:
- `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` are used to speed up the cin and cout operations.
- The '\n' character is used instead of endl to prevent unnecessary flushing of the output stream, which can slow down the program.
