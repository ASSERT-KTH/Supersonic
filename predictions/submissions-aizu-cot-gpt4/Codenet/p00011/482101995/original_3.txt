Your code is already quite optimized, but there are a few things we can do to improve it further:

1. **Avoid unnecessary initialization of `StartingPoint` vector:** In your code, you are initializing the `StartingPoint` vector with values from 1 to `w`. However, for the purpose of this program, it is unnecessary to do the initialization since the values are based on indexes which are then swapped. Instead, we can initialize the vector to `0` and then add `1` to the index when printing.

2. **Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` for faster I/O:** This disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. It can make I/O operations faster in some cases, but it may also cause problems if both C and C++ streams are used.

3. **Use `std::cin.tie(NULL);`:** This unties `cin` from `cout`. By default, before each I/O operation, `cin` checks if `cout` needs to flush. By untying them, this check is no longer performed, which can make I/O operations faster.

4. **Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`:** `endl` causes a flush of the output buffer, which can be slower than just outputting a newline character (`'\n'`).

Here is the optimized code with the above changes:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
struct THorizonalLine {
  int Left;
  int Right;
};
int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  int w;
  cin >> w;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> StartingPoint(w, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    THorizonalLine HorizonalLine;
    char Dummy;
    cin >> HorizonalLine.Left >> Dummy >> HorizonalLine.Right;
    swap(StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1],
         StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    cout << i + 1 << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
