This program reads a number `w` from the input, then a number `n`, and then `n` pairs of integers. It then uses these pairs of integers to swap elements in a vector `StartingPoint` of length `w` that is initially filled with the numbers from 1 to `w`. Finally, it prints the elements of this vector.

Here are a few ways to optimize the program:

1. Reserve space for the vector `StartingPoint`: The `reserve` method in the vector class is used to preallocate enough memory for the vector. This can potentially speed up the program, as the vector will not need to resize itself every time an element is added.

2. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This can give you a significant improvement when dealing with large amounts of I/O. This disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. By default, all standard streams are synchronized at the start of the program.

3. Use '\n' instead of `endl`: `endl` not only adds a newline, but it also flushes the output buffer. If performance is a concern, and you don't need to flush the buffer at every newline, use '\n' instead.

Here is a version of the program that incorporates these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct THorizonalLine {
  int Left;
  int Right;
};

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // For Fast IO
  int w;
  cin >> w;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> StartingPoint;
  StartingPoint.reserve(w); // Reserving space in memory
  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    StartingPoint[i] = i + 1;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    THorizonalLine HorizonalLine;
    char Dummy;
    cin >> HorizonalLine.Left >> Dummy >> HorizonalLine.Right;
    swap(StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1],
         StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    cout << StartingPoint[i] << '\n'; // using '\n' instead of endl
  }
  return 0;
}
```
