The given C++ program implements Union-Find data structure which is a common data structure to solve problems related to connectivity in a graph.

Optimization Steps:

1. Use Path Compression in the `find` function: Path compression is a technique where we make every node we traverse in the path of finding the root to directly point to the root. This method helps in flattening the structure of the tree whenever Find is called. The idea is to speed up future find operations.

2. Avoid the use of `std::endl` (which also flushes the stream which is an expensive operation) if you just need to print a newline character. Use "\n" instead.

3. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to untie C++ and C I/O operations. This can speed up I/O operations significantly. But be aware that you cannot mix C and C++ I/O operations after this.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int find(int join[], int x) {
  if (join[x] != x)
    join[x] = find(join, join[x]);
  return join[x];
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n, m, join[100000], num[100000], s, t;
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    join[i] = i;
    num[i] = 0;
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> s >> t;
    s = find(join, s);
    t = find(join, t);
    
    if (s != t) {
      if (num[s] < num[t])
        join[s] = join[t];
      else {
        join[t] = join[s];
        if (num[s] == num[t])
          num[s]++;
      }
    }
  }
  
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    cin >> s >> t;
    if (find(join, s) == find(join, t))
      cout << "yes\n";
    else
      cout << "no\n";
  }
}
```

Note that the array indices start from 0, so if the input indices are 1-based, you should adjust them accordingly.
