The given program implements a version of the disjoint-set data structure, which is a data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint subsets. It provides near-constant-time operations for adding new sets, merging sets (replacing them by their union), and determining whether two elements are in the same set. The implementation uses path compression in the 'find' function to make subsequent searches for the same element faster. However, it does not currently implement union by rank, which can help to keep the tree of elements flat and improve the time complexity of the operations.

The main optimizations that can be applied to the given program are:

1. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` in the `main()` function. This will disable the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams if it is called before the program performs its first input or output operation. Adding `cin.tie(NULL);` can help to untie `cin` from `cout`, which can speed up `cin` and `cout`.

2. The `find()` function uses a recursive call, which can lead to a stack overflow for large inputs. We can modify the function to use a loop instead, which will avoid this problem.

3. Use `printf` and `scanf` instead of `cout` and `cin` for IO operations. They are faster.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int find(int join[], int x) {
  while (x != join[x])
    x = join[x];
  return x;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, m, join[100000], num[100000], s, t;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    join[i] = i;
    num[i] = 0;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d", &s, &t);
    s = find(join, s);
    t = find(join, t);
    if (s != t) {
      if (num[s] < num[t])
        join[s] = join[t];
      else {
        join[t] = join[s];
        if (num[s] == num[t])
          num[s]++;
      }
    }
  }
  int q;
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d", &s, &t);
    if (find(join, s) == find(join, t))
      printf("yes\n");
    else
      printf("no\n");
  }
}
```

Please note that the use of `scanf` and `printf` should be done carefully and only when necessary, as they can lead to security vulnerabilities if not used properly.
