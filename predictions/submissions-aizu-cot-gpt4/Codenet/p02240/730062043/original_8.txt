The given C++ program uses an array-based disjoint set data structure to keep track of connections between elements. There are two main operations: `find` and `union`. The `find` operation is used to find the root of a particular element, and the `union` operation is used to connect two elements together.

One optimization that could be made is to use path compression in the `find` operation. Path compression is a technique where when we find the root of an element, we make the element and all of its ancestors in the tree directly point to the root. This significantly reduces the tree height and subsequently improves the time complexity of future operations.

Here's the optimized code with path compression:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int find(int join[], int x) {
  if (x != join[x])
    join[x] = find(join, join[x]);
  return join[x];
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int n, m, join[100000], num[100000], s, t;
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    join[i] = i;
    num[i] = 0;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> s >> t;
    s = find(join, s);
    t = find(join, t);
    if (s != t) {
      if (num[s] < num[t])
        join[s] = join[t];
      else {
        join[t] = join[s];
        if (num[s] == num[t])
          num[s]++;
      }
    }
  }
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    cin >> s >> t;
    if (find(join, s) == find(join, t))
      cout << "yes\n";
    else
      cout << "no\n";
  }
}
```
This modification makes the `find` operation more efficient, which consequently makes the program run faster.
