The given program is a bit complex and seems to be a Boolean Expression Parser, which analyzes the truthiness of a given string of logical expression for all possible boolean values of its variables. In terms of optimization, the program seems to be well-structured and efficient, but there are still a few things that can be optimized to improve performance. 

Here are the steps that can be taken to optimize the program:

1. Avoid using the 'std' namespace globally: This is considered bad practice because it can lead to name collisions which can cause bugs that are hard to detect.

2. Make use of 'constexpr': Make use of the 'constexpr' keyword for compile-time constant initializations. This will help the compiler optimize the program.

3. Avoid unnecessary object creation: The 'Parser' object is created for every calculation, which can be adjusted to only create once and used multiple times.

4. Use 'std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)': This can speed up the I/O operations. This can be significant when dealing with large amounts of I/O.

5. Use '\n' instead of `std::endl`: `std::endl` causes a flush operation which can be slower compared to '\n'.

Step-by-step optimized program would look like this:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cctype>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int mask;
template <class T> struct Parser {
  typedef std::string::const_iterator State;
  T solve(const std::string &S) {
    State begin = S.begin();
    return equation(begin);
  }
  //... keep the other functions as is
};

void solve(std::string S, Parser<bool>& ps) {
  for (mask = 0; mask < (1 << 11); mask++) {
    if (!ps.solve(S)) {
      std::cout << "NO" << '\n';
      return;
    }
  }
  std::cout << "YES" << '\n';
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::string S;
  Parser<bool> ps;
  while (std::cin >> S && S != "#") {
    solve(S, ps);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Here, we made sure that the parser object is not created multiple times and also optimized the I/O operations.
