The given program is a parser for boolean equations. It checks if a given boolean equation is "tautology" (i.e., always true). It does this by looping over all possible boolean values of the variables in the equation and evaluating the equation for each possible assignment. If the equation is not satisfied for any assignment, it outputs "NO", otherwise it outputs "YES". 

The program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Remove the `std::vector` and `std::algorithm` libraries because they are not used. This will save some compilation time and might save some runtime depending on the compiler's implementation of these libraries.

2. The `solve` function can be optimized by breaking the loop as soon as the equation is not satisfied for some assignment. This will save time because it avoids unnecessary iterations. 

3. The `formula` function can be optimized by using a switch statement instead of multiple if-else statements. This will speed up the program because switch statements are usually implemented with jump tables, which are faster than if-else chains.

4. The `boolean` function can be optimized by using a switch statement instead of multiple if-else statements. This will speed up the program because switch statements are usually implemented with jump tables, which are faster than if-else chains.

5. The `deduce` function can be optimized by using a switch statement instead of multiple if-else statements. This will speed up the program because switch statements are usually implemented with jump tables, which are faster than if-else chains.

After these optimizations, the optimized program is:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int mask;

template <class T> struct Parser {
  typedef string::const_iterator State;
  T solve(const string &S) {
    State begin = S.begin();
    return equation(begin);
  }
  
  T equation(State &begin) {
    T left = formula(begin);
    begin++;
    T right = formula(begin);
    return left == right;
  }
  
  T formula(State &begin) {
    switch(*begin) {
      case '(':
        begin++;
        T left = formula(begin);
        char op = *begin;
        begin++;
        if (op == '-')
          begin++;
        T right = formula(begin);
        begin++;
        return deduce(left, op, right);
      case '-':
        begin++;
        return !formula(begin);
      default:
        return boolean(begin);
    }
  }
  
  T deduce(T x, char op, T y) {
    switch(op) {
      case '*':
        return x and y;
      case '+':
        return x or y;
      default:
        return !x or y;
    }
  }
  
  T boolean(State &begin) {
    T ret;
    switch(*begin) {
      case 'T':
        ret = 1;
        break;
      case 'F':
        ret = 0;
        break;
      default:
        ret = (mask >> (*begin - 'a')) & 1;
    }
    begin++;
    return ret;
  }
};

void solve(string S) {
  Parser<bool> ps;
  for (mask = 0; mask < (1 << 11); mask++) {
    if (!ps.solve(S)) {
      cout << "NO" << endl;
      return;
    }
  }
  cout << "YES" << endl;
}

int main() {
  string S;
  while (cin >> S && S != "#") {
    solve(S);
  }
  return 0;
}
