This program is already quite optimized, but there are a few small changes we can make to improve it:

1. Instead of using `#define` to create macros for common for-loops, we can use normal for-loops. This makes the code clearer and can help to avoid bugs that are sometimes caused by `#define` macros.

2. When calculating the maximum score in the `mul` function, we don't need to update `res[i][j]` on every iteration of the loop. Instead, we can calculate the maximum score in a local variable, and then update `res[i][j]` once at the end of the loop.

3. Similarly, when calculating the maximum score in the `calcMinStep` function, we can use a local variable to store the maximum score, and then update `x` once at the end of the loop.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef vector<int> Ary;
typedef vector<Ary> Mat;
struct Edge {
  int to, c;
};
vector<vector<Edge>> adj;
int V, K, E, dp[155][155], prv[155][155];

void maxUpdate(int &a, int b) { a = max(a, b); }

void mul(Mat &res, Mat &a, Mat &b) {
  int N = a.size();
  res = a;
  for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {
    for(int j=0; j<N; j++) {
      int maxScore = res[i][j];
      for(int k=0; k<N; k++) {
        if (a[i][k] >= 0 && b[k][j] >= 0)
          maxScore = max(maxScore, a[i][k] + b[k][j]);
      }
      res[i][j] = maxScore;
    }
  }
}

// ... rest of the code is the same ...
```

Remember that optimizing code can make it harder to read and debug, so it's important to keep the code as simple and clear as possible, especially if the performance improvement is small.
