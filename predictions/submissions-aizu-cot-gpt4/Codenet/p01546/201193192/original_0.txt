The given code is a C++ program that finds a path in a directed graph with maximum total edge weight using dynamic programming and matrix multiplication. To optimize this code, we can follow three main steps:

1. Avoiding unnecessary copying of data: The C++ code currently makes unnecessary copies of data in some places. This happens, for instance, in the `mul` function where the matrix `res` is assigned the entirety of matrix `a`. This results in a time complexity of O(N^2) and space complexity of O(N^2) because the function creates a copy of a two-dimensional vector. We can optimize this by passing the matrices by reference and modifying them directly.

2. Avoiding unnecessary iterations: In the `mul` function, the third loop iterates over all elements regardless of whether they are non-negative or not. This isn't necessary. We can add a condition inside the second loop to check if `a[i][k]` is non-negative and if it's not, we can skip the iteration over `j`.

3. Using `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This line of code can significantly speed up C++ I/O, which can be helpful when dealing with large amounts of input and output.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define for_(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); ++i)
#define for_rev(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i >= (b); --i)
typedef vector<int> Ary;
typedef vector<Ary> Mat;
struct Edge {
  int to, c;
};
void maxUpdate(int &a, int b) { a = max(a, b); }
void mul(Mat &res, Mat &a, Mat &b) {
  int N = a.size();
  for_(i, 0, N) {
    bool skip = a[i][k] < 0;
    if (!skip) {
      for_(j, 0, N) for_(k, 0, N) {
        if (b[k][j] >= 0)
          maxUpdate(res[i][j], a[i][k] + b[k][j]);
      }
    }
  }
}
// rest of the code remains the same
int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  // rest of the main function
}
```
This version of the code avoids unnecessary copying of data, reduces the number of iterations in the `mul` function, and speeds up I/O operations in C++. These optimizations should improve both the running time and the memory usage of the program.
