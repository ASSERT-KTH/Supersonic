This program attempts to solve a graph problem by finding the minimum number of steps to achieve a score (K) by traversing the graph. There are several ways to optimize this program. Here are the following steps:

1. **Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`:** This header file includes almost all standard C++ libraries. This dramatically increases compilation time and is generally discouraged. Instead, you should include only the libraries you need.

2. **Avoid using macros for loops:** Using the `#define` directive to create macros for loops is not a good practice as it makes the code less readable and can lead to bugs. You should replace these macros with actual for loops.

3. **Avoid global variables:** Global variables can lead to code that is difficult to debug and understand. You should try to encapsulate your variables inside classes or at least functions as much as possible.

4. **Use `std::array` instead of C-style arrays where possible:** C-style arrays do not contain information about their length and are not as safe to use as `std::array`. `std::array` is part of the Standard Library and should be preferred where possible.

5. **Use `constexpr` for constant expressions:** By using `constexpr`, you are telling the compiler that the expression is constant and can be evaluated at compile time. This can help the compiler optimize the code.

6. **Initialize variables at the point of definition where possible:** It can make the code more readable and less prone to errors.

Here is your optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <array>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

constexpr int MAX_SCORE = -1;
constexpr int MAX_V = 155;
constexpr int MAX_E = 155;

struct Edge {
  int to, c;
};

void maxUpdate(int &a, int b) { a = max(a, b); }

void mul(vector<vector<int>> &res, vector<vector<int>> &a, vector<vector<int>> &b) {
  int N = a.size();
  res = a;
  for(int i=0; i<N; ++i) {
    for(int j=0; j<N; ++j) {
      for(int k=0; k<N; ++k) {
        if (a[i][k] >= 0 && b[k][j] >= 0)
          maxUpdate(res[i][j], a[i][k] + b[k][j]);
      }
    }
  }
}

bool shortPhase(int V, int K, vector<vector<Edge>> adj) {
  array<array<int, MAX_V>, MAX_V> dp;
  array<array<int, MAX_V>, MAX_V> prv;
  memset(dp.data(), -1, dp.size()*sizeof(int));
  memset(prv.data(), -1, prv.size()*sizeof(int));
  for(int v=0; v<V; ++v) {
    dp[0][v] = 0;
  }

  int max_score = MAX_SCORE;
  int step = MAX_SCORE;
  int terminal = MAX_SCORE;

  for(int i=0; i<150; ++i) {
    for(int v=0; v<V; ++v) {
      if (dp[i][v] == -1)
        continue;
      for (Edge e : adj[v]) {
        if (dp[i + 1][e.to] < dp[i][v] + e.c) {
          dp[i + 1][e.to] = dp[i][v] + e.c;
          prv[i + 1][e.to] = v;
          if (max_score < dp[i + 1][e.to]) {
            max_score = dp[i + 1][e.to];
            terminal = e.to;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    if (max_score >= K) {
      step = i + 1;
      break;
    }
  }

  if (max_score >= K) {
    cout << step << endl;
    restore(step, terminal);
    return true;
  }

  if (max_score == MAX_SCORE) {
    cout << -1 << endl;
    return true;
  }

  return false;
}

int main() {
  int V, K, E;
  cin >> V >> E >> K;
  
  vector<vector<Edge>> adj(V, vector<Edge>());
  for(int i=0; i<E; ++i) {
    int u, v, c;
    cin >> u >> v >> c;
    adj[u].push_back(Edge{v, c});
  }

  solve(V, E, K, adj);
}
```
