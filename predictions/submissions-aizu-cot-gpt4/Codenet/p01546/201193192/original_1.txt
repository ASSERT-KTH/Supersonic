The given C++ program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Use #pragma to enable parallel execution: Using #pragma in front of for loops will enable parallel execution. This can significantly improve the execution speed for large data inputs.

2. Avoid copying vectors when not necessary: The 'mul' function is currently copying the entire matrix 'a' to 'res'. We can avoid this by passing the matrices as const references and creating the result matrix inside the function.

3. Avoid unnecessary operations in loops: In the 'mul' function, some operations are being redundantly performed in each iteration of the loop. We can minimize this by storing the results of a[i][k] and b[k][j] in variables.

4. Use 'reserve' for vectors when the size is known: This will prevent the vector from resizing which can be a costly operation. In the 'solve' function, the size of the 'path' vector is known in advance, so we can use the 'reserve' function.

Following these steps, the given program can be optimized as follows:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define for_(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); ++i)
#define for_rev(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i >= (b); --i)
typedef vector<int> Ary;
typedef vector<Ary> Mat;
struct Edge {
  int to, c;
};
void maxUpdate(int &a, int b) { a = max(a, b); }
void mul(Mat &res, const Mat &a, const Mat &b) {
  int N = a.size();
  res.resize(N, Ary(N));
  #pragma omp parallel for
  for_(i, 0, N) {
    for_(j, 0, N) {
      for_(k, 0, N) {
        int aik = a[i][k], bkj = b[k][j];
        if (aik >= 0 && bkj >= 0)
          maxUpdate(res[i][j], aik + bkj);
      }
    }
  }
}
// rest of the code remains the same...
void restore(int step, int v) {
  int c = step;
  vector<int> path;
  path.reserve(step + 1);
  while (v != -1) {
    path.push_back(v);
    v = prv[c--][v];
  }
  reverse(path.begin(), path.end());
  for_(i, 0, step + 1) cout << path[i] << (i < step ? " " : "\n");
}
// rest of the code remains the same...
```

Note: The #pragma pragma omp parallel for directive is used to enable parallel processing in for loop. This might not give any speedup in single-core processors but can give significant speedup in multi-core processors.
