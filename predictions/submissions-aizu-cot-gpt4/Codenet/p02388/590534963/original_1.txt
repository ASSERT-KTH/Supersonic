The given program reads an integer from input, cubes it, and prints the result. The algorithm itself is already quite optimal in terms of time and space complexity, and there isn't much that can be done to further optimize it.

However, one tiny optimization we can make is to store the result of `n * n` in a variable, so we don't need to calculate it twice. This would save one multiplication operation, which could be significant if the program is run many times or if the input number is very large.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int sq = n * n;
  cout << sq * n << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This may not make a noticeable difference for smaller input numbers, but for larger numbers or repeated calculations, it could potentially save some time. Please note that modern compilers are typically intelligent enough to perform such optimizations automatically. Thus, such manual optimization may not be necessary and can sometimes even lead to worse performance.
