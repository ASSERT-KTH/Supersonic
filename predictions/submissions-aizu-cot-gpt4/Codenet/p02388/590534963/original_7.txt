The given program already seems to be quite optimized as it only takes an integer input, calculates its cube and prints it. However, we can make a minor optimization in terms of memory usage by eliminating the use of the extra variable 'n'. We can directly read the input integer, calculate its cube and print it.

Let's go through the steps:

1. Directly read input from `cin` and cube it within `cout`.
2. There is no need to store the input in 'n', thus reducing memory usage.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << (int)pow(cin.get(), 3) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that this optimization would not result in any significant changes in running time or memory usage for such a simple program. For complex real-world applications, optimizations would involve algorithmic improvements, data structure optimizations, parallel processing, etc. depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the program.
