The given C/C++ program is already quite optimized. It reads an integer from the input, calculates its cube, and outputs the result. The time complexity of the program is O(1) and the space complexity is also O(1), which means it runs in constant time and uses a constant amount of memory.

However, if you want to nitpick, you could argue that the multiplication operation which is used to calculate the cube could be slightly faster if it is replaced with bit shifting and addition for powers of two. However, in this case it is not applicable as we are computing a cube and not a power of two. Modern compilers also optimize these operations, so this change would probably not result in a noticeable difference in performance.

The only minor optimization that could be applied here is to reserve the standard output to avoid multiple heap allocations when the program writes to the console. This can be done with the `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` line.

Here is the slightly optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  cout << n * n * n << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` can potentially increase the performance of I/O operations if you are only using C++ style I/O (cin, cout, etc.). However, it should be used with caution because it will make C++ iostreams and C stdio (printf, scanf, etc.) unsynchronized, which could lead to unexpected behavior if your program uses both.
