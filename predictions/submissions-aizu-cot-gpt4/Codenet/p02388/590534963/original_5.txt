The provided C/C++ program is already quite simple and efficient. It extracts an integer from input, calculates the cube of the number, and prints it.

But if we really want to optimize it, we could potentially save a bit of computation by storing the square of the number in a variable instead of calculating it twice.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int square = n * n; // Store the square of n in a variable to avoid calculating it twice
  cout << square * n << endl; // Use the stored square value
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that modern compilers are smart enough to perform such optimizations automatically. Therefore, this tiny optimization may not have a substantial impact on performance in real-world scenarios.
