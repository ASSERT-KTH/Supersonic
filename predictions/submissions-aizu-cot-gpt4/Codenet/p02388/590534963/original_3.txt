The given program reads an integer from the user, calculates its cube and prints the result. The program is already quite simple, but there is a small optimization we could do to improve it.

Currently, the program performs two multiplications to calculate the cube of the number. We can reduce this to a single multiplication by storing the result of the first multiplication and reusing it.

The optimized program would then look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int square = n * n;
  cout << square * n << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This change will make the program run slightly faster in theory, because it avoids one multiplication. However, the difference will likely be imperceptible in practice, because modern CPUs are capable of performing arithmetic operations very quickly. Also, modern compilers are generally smart enough to perform this kind of optimization automatically, so it might not make a difference in the compiled code.

As for memory usage, both versions of the program use the same amount of memory. Both have three integer variables (n, the temporary result of the multiplication, and the final result), so neither version is better than the other in this respect.
