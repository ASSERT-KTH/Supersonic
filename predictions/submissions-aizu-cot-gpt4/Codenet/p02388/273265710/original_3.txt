Optimizations:

1. There is no need for a loop to calculate the cube of a number. Multiplying the number by itself twice will give the same result.
2. The "while(1)" loop is used to check for a valid input. This can be simplified by using a "do-while" loop, which guarantees that the block of code will be executed at least once before the condition is checked.
3. The function "cubedNum" doesn't need to be void. It can simply return the result of the cube calculation.
4. Instead of "using namespace std", it's more efficient to use specific elements from the namespace to avoid any potential name collisions. In this case, we only need "std::cin", "std::cout" and "std::endl".

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int cubedNum() {
  int inputNum;
  do {
    std::cin >> inputNum;
  } while (inputNum < 0 || inputNum > 100);

  return inputNum * inputNum * inputNum;
}

int main() {
  std::cout << cubedNum() << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code will have a slightly faster runtime because it removes the unnecessary for loop. It also uses slightly less memory because it doesn't need an extra variable to store the result.
