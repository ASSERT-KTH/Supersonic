The given program calculates the cube of a number between 0 and 100. The program uses a loop to do this, but it's actually unnecessary. The cube of a number can be calculated directly by multiplying the number by itself twice.

Optimization Steps:

1. Remove the for-loop and directly calculate the cube of the number by multiplying the number by itself twice.

Let's apply this optimization:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void cubedNum(void) {
  int inputNum = -1;
  while (1) {
    cin >> inputNum;
    if ((0 <= inputNum) && (inputNum <= 100)) {
      break;
    }
  }
  int result = inputNum * inputNum * inputNum;
  cout << result << endl;
  return;
}
int main(void) {
  cubedNum();
  return 0;
}
```
As you can see, the program has been simplified and should run faster because it no longer uses a loop to calculate the cube. It also uses less memory because it doesn't have to store the intermediate results of the multiplication.
