The given C++ program is already quite simple and efficient. It reads an integer from the user, computes the cube of the integer, and prints it.

However, the variable 'y' is not necessary. We can reduce memory usage slightly by directly print the calculated value instead of storing it into 'y'.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int x;
  std::cin >> x;
  std::cout << x * x * x << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This optimization reduces the memory usage of the program by eliminating the unnecessary variable 'y'. It does not affect the running time significantly as the time complexity remains the same.
