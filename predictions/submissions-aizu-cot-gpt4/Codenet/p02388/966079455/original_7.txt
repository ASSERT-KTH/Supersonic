This simple program takes a number as input and computes its cube. The calculation is straightforward, and it doesn't use any data structures that would cause significant memory usage.

However, there is a small optimization that can be done to reduce the number of multiplications. Instead of calculating `x * x * x`, we can calculate `x * x` once and store the result in a temporary variable, then multiply that result by `x` again. This reduces the number of multiplications from two to one.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int x, y;
  std::cin >> x;
  int temp = x * x; // Calculate x * x once
  y = temp * x; // Multiply the result by x
  std::cout << y << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This change reduces the number of multiplications, which are relatively expensive operations, but it doesn't significantly improve the runtime or memory usage of the program. In most cases, this optimization would be negligible and wouldn't noticeably affect the program's performance. This is because modern compiler optimizations likely already handle this situation.
