The given program reads an integer from the user, cubes it and prints the result. 

To optimize the program, you can follow these steps:

1. Avoid using std::endl because it causes unnecessary flush of the buffer. So use "\n" instead, which you already did.
2. Use ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) function, which unties C++ standard streams from their corresponding C streams. It makes input and output operations faster because it eliminates overhead of synchronization with C streams.
3. Use cin.tie(NULL), which unties cin from cout. It means that cout does not need to be flushed before each i/o operation with cin, which optimizes the code.
4. There are no other major optimizations required in the provided code. 

Here is the optimized code.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  int x, y;
  std::cin >> x;
  y = x * x * x;
  std::cout << y << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
