The provided C++ program is already relatively simple, efficient, and does not contain any apparent performance issues. However, if we really want to make some minor optimizations, we can consider the following:

1. Avoid unnecessary flushing of the output stream: 
   In C++, std::endl is used to insert a new line and flush the stream. However, flushing can be a potentially time-consuming operation and in most cases, it's not necessary to flush the stream every time. Instead, we can insert a new line character ('\n') without flushing the stream.

2. Reduce the scope of variables:
   For better practice and to slightly optimize the memory, we can reduce the scope of the variables 'x' and 'y' by declaring them just before they are needed.

Let's see the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int x;
  std::cin >> x;
  int y = x * x * x;
  std::cout << y << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized program, we declare 'y' just before we need it and initialize it directly with the calculated value. Also, we use '\n' instead of std::endl to avoid an unnecessary flush of the std::cout buffer. Please note that these changes will not give any significant improvement in performance because the original program is already quite efficient. However, these are good programming practices.
