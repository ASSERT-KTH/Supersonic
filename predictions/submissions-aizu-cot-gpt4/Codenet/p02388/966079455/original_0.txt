The given code is already quite efficient. However, a slight optimization can be made by removing the extra variable y. We can calculate and print the result in a single step. This way, we can save a bit of memory by not having to store the result in a separate variable. 

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int x;
  std::cin >> x;
  std::cout << x * x * x << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

In this code, we only use one variable, x, to read the input. We then calculate x^3 and print it directly, without storing the result in another variable. This optimization won't have a significant impact on the runtime, but it does save a small amount of memory.
