This program is pretty straightforward and well-optimized already. However, there are slight improvements that we can make.

1. Using namespace std: 

We can use "using namespace std;" at the top of the code to avoid writing "std::" each time we use a function from the standard library.

2. Direct Output:

Instead of storing the result in a variable (y) and then outputting this variable, we can directly output the result. This will save some memory since we won't need to create the variable "y".

3. Return statement:

The return statement at the end of the main() function is not necessary. If control reaches the end of the main function, the compiler will automatically insert "return 0;".

4. Input Validation:

Though it's not necessary for this simple program, in more complex scenarios, it's always a good idea to validate user input. In this case, we could check if the user's input is a number.

Let's apply these changes to the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int x;
  cin >> x;
  cout << x * x * x << "\n";
}
``` 

That's it! This version is a bit more streamlined and saves a tiny bit of memory by eliminating the "y" variable. Please note that the optimizations are minimal as the initial program was already quite efficient.
