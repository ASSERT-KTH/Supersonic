The provided C++ code is a simple one. It takes an input integer 'x', calculates the cube of 'x' and assigns it to 'y', then prints 'y'. However, there is a minor optimization that could be made to reduce the number of multiplications.

Optimization Steps:

1. Reduce the number of multiplications: In the existing code, the cube of 'x' is calculated as 'x' multiplied by 'x' and then the result is multiplied by 'x' again which involves two multiplication operations. However, the cube of a number can be calculated using only one multiplication operation by using the pow() function from the <cmath> library.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    int x;
    std::cin >> x;
    int y = std::pow(x, 3);
    std::cout << y << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

This version of the program still accomplishes the same task but does so with one less multiplication operation, which could speed up the execution time in a situation where this code was part of a larger, more complex program or if it was being run a large number of times. However, for such a simple program, the difference in execution time will likely be negligible.
