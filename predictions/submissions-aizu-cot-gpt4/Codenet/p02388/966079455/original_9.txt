The provided C++ program is already quite optimized in terms of both running time and memory usage. It performs a single mathematical operation and prints out the result, which is about as efficient as it gets.

However, there's only one minor optimization we can do here. We can avoid using the extra variable 'y'. Instead of storing the result of the calculation in 'y' and then printing 'y', we can perform the calculation directly within the output statement.

Optimization Steps:

1. Remove the declaration and initialization of the 'y' variable.
2. Perform the cubing operation directly within the output statement.

Here is the optimized version of the provided code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int x;
  std::cin >> x;
  std::cout << x * x * x << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program has the same running time as the original, but it uses slightly less memory because it doesn't need to store the result of the cubing operation in a separate variable.
