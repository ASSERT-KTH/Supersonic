The given code is simple and straightforward. It takes an integer as input, computes its cube and prints it. The code is already pretty optimized for such a small task. However, there are still a minor change that can be made to improve performance:

1. The usage of std::endl: Instead of using "\n", we can use std::endl. The difference between the two is that std::endl causes a flush operation on the output stream, which can slow down the program if used frequently. However, in this case, as we have only one output operation, it can be used for a safer output operation.

Here is the updated code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int x, y;
  std::cin >> x;
  y = x * x * x;
  std::cout << y << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Another possible optimization could be to lessen the variable usage. We're using variable 'y' just to store the cubed value of 'x', which is not actually needed. We can directly calculate and print the cubed value of 'x'. Here is the updated code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int x;
  std::cin >> x;
  std::cout << x * x * x << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This will not have any significant impact on running time but it will save a small amount of memory by not using an extra integer variable.
