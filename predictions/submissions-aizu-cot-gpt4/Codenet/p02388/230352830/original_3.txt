This program isn't very complex, and it's pretty efficient already. The program reads an integer from the user, calculates the cube of that integer, and prints it out. 

However, there is a tiny optimization that can be done here. Instead of performing the multiplication operation twice, we can perform it once and store the result in a variable. This won't make a noticeable difference in this specific case as modern compilers are smart enough to optimize such things, but it's a good practice in general to avoid redundant operations.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  int x_squared = x * x;
  printf("%d\n", x_squared * x);
  return 0;
}
```

In this version, we calculate `x * x` only once and store the result in `x_squared`. Then we multiply `x_squared` by `x`. 

Again, in this specific case, the optimization gain is negligible, but it can be beneficial in more complex cases.
