The program you have provided is pretty much optimized for both time complexity and space complexity. It's a simple program that reads an integer from input, cubes it, and prints the result. Its time complexity is O(1), which means it takes a constant time to execute irrespective of the size of the input. Its space complexity is also O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of memory.

However, there can be a small modification in terms of the way the cubing operation is done. Rather than performing multiplication twice, you can perform the multiplication once and store the result in a variable. Then, use this variable to perform the second multiplication. This may slightly reduce the time taken by the program, but the effect would be negligible for most systems.

Here's the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int x, x_squared;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  x_squared = x * x;
  printf("%d\n", x_squared * x);
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the variable `x_squared` is used to store the result of `x * x`, and then this result is multiplied by `x` to get the cube. This may eliminate some computations and hence may slightly improve the performance. But again, the improvement would be negligible as the original program is already highly optimized.
