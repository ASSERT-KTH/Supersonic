The given C program reads an integer from input, calculates its cube, and then prints the result. This program is already quite optimal, as the time complexity of the multiplication operation is O(1) and it only uses a small, constant amount of memory.

However, one small optimization we can make here is to reduce the number of multiplications from 2 to 1 by using the pow() function from the math library, which calculates the power of a number. This is a negligible optimization in this particular case, but for larger computations, reducing the number of operations can make a difference.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Include the math.h header file to use the pow() function.

2. Replace the expression `x * x * x` with `pow(x, 3)`.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main(void) {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  printf("%d\n", (int)pow(x, 3));
  return 0;
}
```

Note that the pow() function returns a double, so we need to cast its result back to int to match the format specifier in the printf() function.
