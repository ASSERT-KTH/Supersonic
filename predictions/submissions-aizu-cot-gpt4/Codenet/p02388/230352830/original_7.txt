The given program reads an integer from the user, calculates the cube of the integer, and prints the result. 

The program is already quite efficient. However, one potential performance issue is the multiplication operation. In the current program, the cube of the number is calculated using two multiplication operations. Depending on the platform and the compiler, these operations can be expensive in terms of the time taken to execute them.

One potential optimization is to calculate the square of the number first, store it in a variable, and then use this variable to calculate the cube. This way, the number is only multiplied twice (once to calculate the square and once more to calculate the cube), and the result of the first multiplication operation is reused.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  int square = x * x;
  printf("%d\n", square * x);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimization reduces the number of multiplication operations from two to one at the cost of slightly increased memory usage (to store the result of the first multiplication operation). However, the increase in memory usage is negligible (only one integer variable), and the reduction in the number of multiplication operations can potentially lead to a significant increase in performance.
