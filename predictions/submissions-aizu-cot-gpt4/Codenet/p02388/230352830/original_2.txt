The given program is a simple one that reads an integer, calculates its cube, and then prints the result. This program is already quite efficient, but there's one small optimization we can make.

In the original program, the cube of the number is calculated by multiplying the number with itself twice (`x * x * x`). This involves two multiplication operations. However, we can reduce this to a single multiplication operation by first calculating the square of the number (`x * x`) and storing the result in a variable. Then, we can multiply the square by the original number to get the cube.

Here's the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  int square = x * x; // Calculate the square of x
  printf("%d\n", square * x); // Calculate the cube by multiplying the square by x
  return 0;
}
```

This small optimization reduces the number of multiplication operations from two to one, which can result in a small speedup, especially if this code is executed many times. It also doesn't change the memory usage of the program, as it still uses the same number of variables.
