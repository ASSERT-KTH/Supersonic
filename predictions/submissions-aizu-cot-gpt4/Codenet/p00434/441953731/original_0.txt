The program reads 28 integers, saves them in a set, and then prints out the numbers from 1 to 30 that are not in the set. The set data structure is used for fast lookup, but its memory usage can be high.

One optimization would be to use an array of boolean values instead of a set. The array would be of size 30 (since the numbers range from 1 to 30), and each index i would represent the number i+1. If the number i+1 is read, the ith element of the array is set to true. To find the missing numbers, we simply need to find the indices of the array that are still false. This reduces the memory usage from O(n) to O(1), as the size of the array does not depend on the number of elements read.

Also, it is generally not recommended to include the whole `<bits/stdc++.h>` header as it includes a large number of standard C++ libraries, which can lead to slower compilation times. Instead, include only the specific headers that you need. In this case, we need `<iostream>` for standard I/O operations and `<vector>` for using the vector STL.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  vector<bool> data(30, false);
  int n;
  for (int i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
    cin >> n;
    data[n-1] = true;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
    if (!data[i])
      cout << (i+1) << endl;
  }
}
```

This program has the same functionality as the original but uses less memory and runs faster. Its time complexity is O(n), which is the same as the original, but the constant factor is smaller because array access is faster than set operations. Its space complexity is O(1), which is better than the original's O(n).
