The given C/C++ program is reading 28 integers from standard input and inserting them into a set. Then it checks for each number from 1 to 30 if it is not in the set, and if so, it prints the number. 

The program can be optimized in the running time and memory usage by using a bitset instead of a set. A bitset is a special container class in C++ STL that is designed to store bits (elements with only two states, true and false, or 0 and 1). Using a bitset has two main advantages:

1. Space-efficient: a boolean array consumes a byte per index, while a bitset consumes only a bit per index. 
2. Time-efficient: operations on bitset (like set, reset, flip, etc) are faster than that on set or vector.

Here are the optimization steps: 

1. Replace set<int> with bitset<30>.
2. Change the insert operation to set operation.
3. Change the count operation to test operation. 

The optimized program is given below:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  bitset<30> data;
  int n;
  for (int i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
    cin >> n;
    data.set(n-1); // bitset is 0-indexed
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= 30; i++) {
    if (!data.test(i-1)) // bitset is 0-indexed
      cout << i << endl;
  }
}
```
Please note that bitset is 0-indexed, so when we set or test the bit, we need to subtract 1 from the number.
