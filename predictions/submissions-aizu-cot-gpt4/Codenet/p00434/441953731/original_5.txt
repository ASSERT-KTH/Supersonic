The given program takes 28 integer inputs and inserts them into a set. Then, it prints the integers from 1 to 30 that are not in the set.

One optimization to this program would be replacing the `set` with a `vector` and `bool` array. This would reduce the time complexity from O(logN) to O(1) when checking if a number is in the data structure and also reduce the memory usage.

Step by Step Optimization:

1. Replace the `set<int> data;` with `vector<bool> data(31, false);`. This initializes a boolean vector of size 31 (0 to 30) with all elements set to `false`.

2. Replace `data.insert(n);` with `data[n] = true;`. This sets the value at index `n` of the vector to `true`.

3. Replace `if (!data.count(i))` with `if (!data[i])`. This checks if the value at index `i` of the vector is `false`.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  vector<bool> data(31, false);
  int n;
  for (int i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
    cin >> n;
    data[n] = true;
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= 30; i++) {
    if (!data[i])
      cout << i << endl;
  }
}
```

Remember, this optimization assumes that the input numbers are between 1 and 30, inclusive. If the range of possible numbers is larger, you may need to adjust the size of the boolean vector accordingly.
