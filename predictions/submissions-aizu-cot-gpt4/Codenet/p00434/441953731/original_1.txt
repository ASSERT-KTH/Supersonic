The given C++ code reads 28 numbers, stores them in a set, and then checks every number from 1 to 30 to see if it is in the set or not. If a number is not in the set, it is printed. 

The usage of set here is unnecessary as the range of the numbers is quite small (1 to 30). Using a boolean array to represent the numbers can save memory and potentially speed up the program. 

Also, including the whole standard library with `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a bad practice. It includes more than you need, which can slow down the compilation. It's better to include only the libraries that you actually use.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    bool data[31] = {false}; // Initialize all elements to false
    int n;

    for (int i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
        cin >> n;
        data[n] = true; // Mark number as present
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= 30; i++) {
        if (!data[i]) // If number is not present
            cout << i << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we use a boolean array 'data' of size 31 (we ignore index 0) instead of a set. When we read a number, we mark the corresponding index in the array as true. To check if a number is present, we just need to check the value at the corresponding index in the array. This is faster than using a set and uses less memory.
