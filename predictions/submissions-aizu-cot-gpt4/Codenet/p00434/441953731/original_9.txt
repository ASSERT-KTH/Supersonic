Optimization Steps:

1. The C++ STL set is not a memory efficient data structure because it needs to store additional information to maintain the order and uniqueness of elements. Here, we only need to track if a number between 1 and 30 is present or not. Hence, a more memory efficient approach is to use an array or vector of boolean values.

2. In the given code, the time complexity of the operation data.count(i) is O(log(n)). However, the time complexity of accessing an element in an array or vector by its index is O(1). Thus, using an array or vector will also improve the runtime of the program.

3. The use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is discouraged as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, leading to increased compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary headers.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  vector<bool> data(31, false);
  int n;
  for (int i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
    cin >> n;
    data[n] = true;
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= 30; i++) {
    if (!data[i])
      cout << i << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, the vector data is used to keep track of the numbers that are present. When a number is read from the input, the corresponding index in the data vector is marked as true. Later, the program checks for each number from 1 to 30, and prints the numbers that are not present.
