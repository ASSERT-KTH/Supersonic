Here are the steps that could be taken to optimize the program:

1. Instead of using `set<int>`, we can use a `bitset<30>`. This will save memory as a bitset uses only one bit per boolean. 

2. We can use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to make the I/O operations faster.

3. Instead of using `data.count(i)`, we can directly access the bitset to check if the bit is set or not. This will make the operation faster as we are not calling a function.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  bitset<30> data;
  int n;
  for (int i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
    cin >> n;
    data.set(n - 1); //subtracting 1 because bitset is 0-indexed
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= 30; i++) {
    if (!data.test(i - 1))
      cout << i << '\n';
  }
}
```
This optimized program reduces the memory usage by using a bitset instead of a set, and improves the execution time by removing the function calls for `set::count` and `set::insert`, and by speeding up the I/O operations. The bitset uses bitwise operations which are faster than regular operations.
