This code reads 28 integers and inserts them into a set. Then it prints the numbers between 1 and 30 that are not in the set. 

1. The first optimization is to use an array instead of a set. This way, the space complexity will be O(1) instead of O(n), and the time complexity will be O(1) for checking if an element is in the array compared to O(log n) for a set. This is possible because the range of the numbers is known to be from 1 to 30.

2. The second optimization is to use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` before the input operation. This will speed up the cin operations. 

3. The third optimization is to use `'\n'` instead of `endl` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output buffer.

Below is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    bool data[31] = {false}; // Initialize all elements to false
    int n;
    for (int i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
        cin >> n;
        data[n] = true; // Set the corresponding index to true
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= 30; i++) {
        if (!data[i])
            cout << i << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that the space complexity is still O(1) because the size of the array is constant and does not grow with the size of the input.
