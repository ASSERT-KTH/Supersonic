This program is a complex geometry program that uses many calculations including cross product, dot product, line intersection, point projection etc. It's difficult to optimize this program as many calculations are already optimized and any further optimization may lead to incorrect results. However, there are few areas that could be improved:

1. Use of Precision Constants: The constants EPS and M_PI have many decimal places. This high precision is not always needed and could slow down the program. 

2. Use of `assert()`: There are a few assert statements in the code. While these are good for debugging, they can slow down the execution of the program in the production environment. 

3. Use of `std::vector`: There are multiple instances where a vector is created and used only for a short period of time. These could possibly be replaced with a stack allocated array or other data structure to save on the overhead of dynamic memory allocation. 

4. Redundant Calculations: There are cases where the same calculation is performed multiple times. Storing the result of these calculations and reusing them could potentially speed up the program. 

5. Use of `fabs()`: The fabs function is used in several places in the code. This function can be slow, and in some cases it might be possible to replace it with a faster alternative. 

6. Use of `std::sort()`: The sort function is used in several places in the code. Depending on the size of the data being sorted, a different sorting algorithm might be more efficient. 

Now, I will try to apply these optimizations to the code. Please note that due to the complexity of the program, some of these optimizations might not be possible or could lead to incorrect results.
