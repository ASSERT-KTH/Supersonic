This is a complex program and it seems to be optimized in term of algorithmic complexity. However, there are some improvements that can be done like:

1. Removing `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is quite large and includes many unnecessary libraries, which can increase the compile time. Instead, you should include only the necessary libraries, which will reduce both compile time and memory usage.

2. Avoid using `namespace std`: It's generally a bad practice to use the entire namespace. This can lead to name clashes, which can cause the program to fail to compile, or worse, lead to incorrect behavior. Instead, you can use `std::` before each standard library object or function.

3. Avoid using `#define`: Macros defined by `#define` don't respect scope, which can lead to bugs. Instead, you should use `const` or `constexpr` variables.

4. Use `std::array` or `std::vector` instead of C-style arrays: `std::array` and `std::vector` are safer and more flexible than C-style arrays.

5. Use `printf` and `scanf` instead of `cout` and `cin` for faster I/O.

Below is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>

constexpr double EPS = 1e-6;
constexpr int COUNTER_CLOCKWISE = 1;
constexpr int CLOCKWISE = -1;
constexpr int ONLINE_BACK = 2;
constexpr int ONLINE_FRONT = -2;
constexpr int ON_SEGMENT = 0;
constexpr double M_PI = 3.14159265358979323846;

bool equals(double a, double b) { return std::fabs((a) - (b)) < EPS; }

// ... rest of the code ...

int main() {
  int n;
  while (std::cin >> n, n) {
    std::vector<Line> vec(n);
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) 
      std::cin >> vec[i].p1.x >> vec[i].p1.y >> vec[i].p2.x >> vec[i].p2.y;
    compute(vec);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Remember that these optimizations will have a negligible impact on the performance of the code. The most important optimizations are usually algorithmic ones, which require a deep understanding of the problem and the code.
