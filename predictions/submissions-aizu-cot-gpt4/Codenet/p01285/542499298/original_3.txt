This program is quite complex and involves lots of mathematical computations related to Points, Lines, and Vectors in the 2D space. Here are a few places where this program could be optimized:

1. **Avoiding unnecessary computations**: A good example is the function `double toRad(double agl)`. This function is used to convert degrees to radians. Instead of computing `M_PI / 180.0` every time the function is called, we could compute it once and store it in a constant. This way, we would simply multiply `agl` by this constant whenever the function is called.

2. **Avoiding unnecessary memory allocations**: In function `crosspoint(Line l, Line m)`, there is a vector `vec` that is being used to store 4 points. Instead of using a vector, we can use an array as we know the size is fixed. This would avoid the overhead of memory allocation/deallocation associated with vectors.

3. **Optimizing the way we use the standard library functions**: For example, in the `compute` function, there is a call to `sort` and `unique` on the `candidatePoints` vector. We could use a `std::set` instead, which keeps the elements sorted and doesn't allow duplicates.

Based on the above points, here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define REP(i, s, n) for (int i = s; i < n; i++)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define EPS (1e-6)
#define equals(a, b) (fabs((a) - (b)) < EPS)
#define COUNTER_CLOCKWISE 1
#define CLOCKWISE -1
#define ONLINE_BACK 2
#define ONLINE_FRONT -2
#define ON_SEGMENT 0
using namespace std;
const double PI_OVER_180 = M_PI / 180.0; // New constant for toRad function
//... rest of the code remains the same...
double toRad(double agl) { return agl * PI_OVER_180; } // Uses the new constant
//... rest of the code remains the same...
Point crosspoint(Line l, Line m) {
  //... code before this remains the same...
  if (abs(A) < EPS && abs(B) < EPS) {
    array<Point, 4> arr = {l.p1, l.p2, m.p1, m.p2}; // Using array instead of vector
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    assert(arr[1] == arr[2]);
    return arr[1];
  }
  //... code after this remains the same...
}
//... rest of the code remains the same...
void compute(vector<Line> &vec) {
  //... code before this remains the same...
  set<Point> candidatePoints; // Using set instead of vector
  // ... rest of the code remains the same...
  for(auto p : candidatePoints) { // Using range-based for loop
    //... rest of the code remains the same...
  }
  //... rest of the code remains the same...
}
//... rest of the code remains the same...
```
These are small optimizations and the overall structure of the program remains the same. The performance improvement may not be significant, but these best practices can lead to improvements in larger programs.
