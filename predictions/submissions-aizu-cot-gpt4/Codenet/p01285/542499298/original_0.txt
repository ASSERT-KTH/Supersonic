This code is already highly optimized for the task it is performing - finding the intersecting point of multiple lines. However, there are a couple of small changes that could potentially improve the performance slightly:

1. Use pre-increment (++i) instead of post-increment (i++) in for loops. In C++, post-increment requires a copy of the object to be made, which can be slower than pre-increment. In this case, the difference will be negligible, but it is a good habit to get into for when it can make a difference.

2. Avoid using the std::endl manipulator to output a newline character and flush the output buffer. Instead, output '\n' and only flush the output buffer when necessary. Flushing the output buffer is a relatively expensive operation that can slow down a program if done unnecessarily.

3. Avoid using unnecessary temporary variables and computations. For example, in the function crosspoint(), the computations for A and B could be inlined into the if statements that use them.

4. The function compute() is very long and complex, which can make it hard to optimize. Breaking it down into smaller functions could help make it clearer where optimizations can be made.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define REP(i, s, n) for (int i = s; i < n; ++i)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define EPS (1e-6)
#define equals(a, b) (fabs((a) - (b)) < EPS)
#define COUNTER_CLOCKWISE 1
#define CLOCKWISE -1
#define ONLINE_BACK 2
#define ONLINE_FRONT -2
#define ON_SEGMENT 0
using namespace std;

// ... rest of the code ...

void compute(vector<Line> &vec) {
  // ... same code ...
  
  if (answer.size() == 1)
    printf("%.10f %.10f\n", answer[0].x, answer[0].y);
  else if (answer.empty())
    cout << NONE << '\n';
  else
    cout << MANY << '\n';
}

int main() {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    vector<Line> vec(n);
    rep(i, n) cin >> vec[i].p1.x >> vec[i].p1.y >> vec[i].p2.x >> vec[i].p2.y;
    compute(vec);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
