The program above is quite well written and efficient as it is. However, there are a few minor optimizations that can be done for running time and memory usage:

1. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);`: These two lines of code are used to speed up cin and cout. `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` unties C++ and C streams, and `cin.tie(NULL);` unties cin and cout which by default are tied. This will make the input and output operations faster and hence reduces the running time.

2. Use `reserve()` for string `S`: This will preallocate memory for string `S` and hence reduce the time required for memory allocation when the string size increases. This will reduce both running time and memory usage.

3. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes a lot of unnecessary headers which increases the compilation time. Instead, use only the required headers.

4. Reduce the scope of variable `t`: The scope of variable `t` can be reduced to the loop where it is used.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cctype>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
string S;
int p, ch[1 << 8];
ll bnf();
ll getNum() {
  ll res = 0;
  while (isdigit(S[p]))
    res = res * 10 + S[p++] - '0';
  return res;
}
ll get(ll &a, ll b, char c) {
  if (c == '+')
    a += b;
  if (c == '-')
    a -= b;
  if (c == '*')
    a *= b;
  return a;
}
ll calc(int c) {
  ll res;
  if (S[p] == '(')
    p++, res = bnf(), p++;
  else
    res = getNum();
  while (p < S.size() && S[p] != ')' && ch[S[p]] > c) {
    char t = S[p++];
    get(res, calc(ch[t]), t);
  }
  return res;
}
ll bnf() {
  ll res = calc(-1);
  while (p < S.size() && S[p] != ')') {
    char t = S[p++];
    get(res, calc(ch[t]), t);
  }
  return res;
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  S.reserve(100);
  cin >> S;
  ll res = bnf();
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
        ch['+'] = i, ch['-'] = j, ch['*'] = k;
        p = 0;
        res = max(res, calc(-100));
      }
  cout << res << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
