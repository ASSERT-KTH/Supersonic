This program is a mathematical expression evaluator. It evaluates expressions with +, -, and * operations while also considering parentheses. The code is already quite efficient, but there are a few small changes that could potentially enhance performance:

1. Avoid using <bits/stdc++.h>: This header file includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which increases the compilation time. Instead, we can include only the libraries that we need, which are <iostream>, <string>, <algorithm>, and <cctype>.

2. Use const references in function parameters: In the function 'get', we can use const reference for 'b' and 'c' to avoid unnecessary copy of parameters.

3. Reduce global variable usage: Global variables are generally slower to access than local variables and can cause problems with threading. In this case, 'p' could be a local variable.

4. Inline small functions: Small functions like 'getNum' and 'get' that are called frequently can be inlined for better performance.

5. Use prefix increment: Using prefix increment (++p) instead of postfix increment (p++) can be faster because postfix increment creates a temporary copy of the object.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cctype>

using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
string S;
int ch[1 << 8];

ll bnf(int& p);
ll getNum(int& p) {
  ll res = 0;
  while (isdigit(S[p]))
    res = res * 10 + S[p++] - '0';
  return res;
}

inline ll get(ll &a, const ll &b, const char &c) {
  if (c == '+')
    a += b;
  if (c == '-')
    a -= b;
  if (c == '*')
    a *= b;
  return a;
}

ll calc(int& p, int c) {
  ll res, t;
  if (S[p] == '(')
    ++p, res = bnf(p), ++p;
  else
    res = getNum(p);

  while (p < S.size() && S[p] != ')' && ch[S[p]] > c)
    t = S[p++], get(res, calc(p, ch[t]), t);
  return res;
}

ll bnf(int& p) {
  ll res = calc(p, -1), t;
  while (p < S.size() && S[p] != ')')
    t = S[p++], get(res, calc(p, ch[t]), t);
  return res;
}

int main() {
  cin >> S;
  ll res;
  int p = 0;
  res = bnf(p);
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
        ch['+'] = i, ch['-'] = j, ch['*'] = k;
        p = 0;
        res = max(res, calc(p, -100));
      }
  cout << res << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should perform better due to the reduced number of libraries included, use of const reference, reduced global variables, inlining of small functions, and use of prefix increment. However, the performance improvement might be insignificant and only noticeable for large inputs or repeated executions.
