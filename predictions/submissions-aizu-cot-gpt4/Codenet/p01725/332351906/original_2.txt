This is a C++ program to solve the expression parsing problem. This program calculates the maximum value for a given expression by prioritizing arithmetic operations. The expression can contain three types of operations: '+', '-', '*'. The program checks all the possible prioritizations of operations to find the maximum result.

Let's optimize the given program step by step:

1. Avoid the use of "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers and increases the compile time. Instead, include only the necessary headers. 

2. The use of "using namespace std;" is generally considered bad practice. It's better to use std:: before each standard library object.

3. In the "get" function, instead of checking the conditions for each operator, a better way would be to use a switch statement. 

4. Optimize the reading of characters from the string 'S'. Instead of checking the condition 'p < S.size()' each time in the while loop, we can save the size of 'S' in a variable and use that variable for the check.

5. The variables 'res' and 't' are declared in multiple functions. Instead, declare these variables globally to reduce memory usage.

Now, let's rewrite the program with these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

typedef long long ll;

std::string S;
int p, ch[1 << 8];
ll res, t;
int len;

ll bnf();
ll getNum() {
  ll res = 0;
  while (std::isdigit(S[p]))
    res = res * 10 + S[p++] - '0';
  return res;
}

ll get(ll &a, ll b, char c) {
  switch(c) {
    case '+': a += b; break;
    case '-': a -= b; break;
    case '*': a *= b; break;
  }
  return a;
}

ll calc(int c) {
  if (S[p] == '(')
    p++, res = bnf(), p++;
  else
    res = getNum();
  while (p < len && S[p] != ')' && ch[S[p]] > c)
    t = S[p++], get(res, calc(ch[t]), t);
  return res;
}

ll bnf() {
  res = calc(-1);
  while (p < len && S[p] != ')')
    t = S[p++], get(res, calc(ch[t]), t);
  return res;
}

int main() {
  std::cin >> S;
  len = S.size();
  res = bnf();
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
        ch['+'] = i, ch['-'] = j, ch['*'] = k;
        p = 0;
        res = std::max(res, calc(-100));
      }
  std::cout << res << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program should be faster and use less memory than the original version.
