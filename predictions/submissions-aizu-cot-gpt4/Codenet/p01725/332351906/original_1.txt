The code is performing calculations on the string input. This code is already optimized in terms of running time complexity and memory usage.

However, there are still a few minor changes we can make to further optimize the code:

1. We can use 'iosteam' and 'vector' libraries instead of 'bits/stdc++.h'. The 'bits/stdc++.h' is quite heavy because it includes all the standard libraries which can slow down the compilation process.

2. The use of global variables is generally not advised because it can lead to errors in large programs and make the program harder to understand and maintain. But in competitive programming, it's somewhat accepted for the sake of faster coding and execution speed.

3. The 'get' function can be optimized by using else-if statements to avoid unnecessary condition checks.

4. 'll' is being used as a type name for long long which might be confusing, we can replace it with a more meaningful name.

5. Instead of using a for loop to initialize the array ch, we can use fill_n function from algorithm library which might be faster. 

Here is the optimized code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cctype>
using namespace std;

typedef long long LongInt;
string S;
int p;
vector<int> ch(1 << 8);
LongInt bnf();
LongInt getNum() {
  LongInt res = 0;
  while (isdigit(S[p]))
    res = res * 10 + S[p++] - '0';
  return res;
}
LongInt get(LongInt &a, LongInt b, char c) {
  if (c == '+')
    a += b;
  else if (c == '-')
    a -= b;
  else if (c == '*')
    a *= b;
  return a;
}
LongInt calc(int c) {
  LongInt res, t;
  if (S[p] == '(')
    p++, res = bnf(), p++;
  else
    res = getNum();
  while (p < S.size() && S[p] != ')' && ch[S[p]] > c)
    t = S[p++], get(res, calc(ch[t]), t);
  return res;
}
LongInt bnf() {
  LongInt res = calc(-1), t;
  while (p < S.size() && S[p] != ')')
    t = S[p++], get(res, calc(ch[t]), t);
  return res;
}
int main() {
  cin >> S;
  LongInt res = bnf();
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
        fill_n(ch.begin(), ch.size(), 0);
        ch['+'] = i, ch['-'] = j, ch['*'] = k;
        p = 0;
        res = max(res, calc(-100));
      }
  cout << res << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
