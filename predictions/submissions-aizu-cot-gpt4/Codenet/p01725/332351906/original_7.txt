Here are some steps to optimize this C/C++ program:

1. In the `main` function, do not run `bnf()` before the triple `for` loop. Because it's used to calculate the maximum result based on different operator priorities, but the result is overwritten in the loop and not used before that. 

2. The function `get(ll &a, ll b, char c)` returns the value of `a` after modifying it, which is not necessary as `a` is passed by reference and the changes will be reflected in the calling function. We can make this function `void`.

3. The `ch` array is of size `1 << 8`, which is too large for the purpose. Since only three characters ('+', '-', '*') are used as indices, we can replace the array with a `std::map<char, int>` to save memory.

4. In `getNum()` function, while calculating the number, instead of multiplying `res` with 10 every time (which is a costly operation), we can multiply the digit with the appropriate power of 10 and add it to `res`. It reduces the number of multiplications.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
string S;
int p;
map<char, int> ch;

ll bnf();
ll getNum() {
  ll res = 0, mul = 1;
  string num_str = "";
  while(isdigit(S[p]))
    num_str = S[p++] + num_str;
  for(char c : num_str)
    res += (c - '0') * mul, mul *= 10;
  return res;
}
void get(ll &a, ll b, char c) {
  if (c == '+')
    a += b;
  if (c == '-')
    a -= b;
  if (c == '*')
    a *= b;
}
ll calc(int c) {
  ll res, t;
  if (S[p] == '(')
    p++, res = bnf(), p++;
  else
    res = getNum();
  while (p < S.size() && S[p] != ')' && ch[S[p]] > c)
    t = S[p++], get(res, calc(ch[t]), t);
  return res;
}
ll bnf() {
  ll res = calc(-1), t;
  while (p < S.size() && S[p] != ')')
    t = S[p++], get(res, calc(ch[t]), t);
  return res;
}
int main() {
  cin >> S;
  ll res = -1e18;
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
        ch['+'] = i, ch['-'] = j, ch['*'] = k;
        p = 0;
        res = max(res, calc(-100));
      }
  cout << res << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Remember that the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` library is widely used in competitive programming but it's not a good practice to use it in production code. It includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can slow down the compilation process. Consider replacing it with the specific headers that you need.
