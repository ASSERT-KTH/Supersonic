The given C++ program uses a priority queue to store and retrieve data structures based on their scores and numbers. However, the program can be optimized to improve its performance.

Here are few steps to optimize the program:

1. Avoid using both cstdio and iostream: Both of these libraries are used for input/output operations and having both of them is unnecessary. We can replace the scanf function with cin and remove the cstdio library. This will reduce the memory footprint of the program.

2. Reduce the frequency of I/O operations: I/O operations are time-consuming and can significantly slow down the performance of the program. We can use a string stream to concatenate the outputs and print them at once instead of printing them separately.

3. Minimize unnecessary memory allocations: The program unnecessarily creates a new instance of the data structure in each iteration of the while loop. We can avoid this by creating a single instance and reusing it.

4. Minimize unnecessary queue operations: The program unnecessarily pushes an element onto the queue and then pops it off if its score is not equal to its corresponding score in the S array. We can avoid this by checking the scores before pushing the element onto the queue.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;
const int MAX = 1000001;
int S[MAX];
struct data {
  int num, score;
  data() {}
  data(int n, int s) : num(n), score(s) {}
  bool operator<(const data &d) const {
    if (score != d.score)
      return score < d.score;
    return num > d.num;
  }
};
int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  priority_queue<data> Q;
  Q.push(data(0, 0));
  data now;
  stringstream ss;
  while (m--) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    S[a] += b;
    now = data(a, S[a]);
    if (now.score == S[now.num]) {
      Q.push(now);
    }
    now = Q.top();
    ss << now.num << " " << now.score << "\n";
    Q.pop();
  }
  cout << ss.str();
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version of the program should run faster and use less memory than the original version.
