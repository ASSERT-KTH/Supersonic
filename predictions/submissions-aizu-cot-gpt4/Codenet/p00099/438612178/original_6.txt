The optimizations that can be done on the given program are:

1. Use faster input/output methods. `scanf` and `printf` are faster than `cin` and `cout`.

2. The `while(1)` loop is potentially dangerous as it can lead to infinite loops if not handled properly. In this case, it would be better to use a `while(!Q.empty())` loop to ensure that we are not trying to access elements from an empty priority queue.

3. Instead of creating a new `data` object every time, we can reuse the existing one to reduce memory usage.

4. Instead of reassigning `now` with `Q.top()` and then popping the top element of the queue, we can pop the top element and assign it to `now` in one statement with `now = Q.top(); Q.pop();`

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;
const int MAX = 1000001;
int S[MAX];
struct data {
  int num, score;
  data() {}
  data(int n, int s) : num(n), score(s) {}
  bool operator<(const data &d) const {
    if (score != d.score)
      return score < d.score;
    return num > d.num;
  }
};
int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  priority_queue<data> Q;
  Q.push(data(0, 0));
  data now;
  while (m--) {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    S[a] += b;
    Q.push(data(a, S[a]));
    while (!Q.empty()) {
      now = Q.top(); Q.pop();
      if (now.score == S[now.num]) {
        printf("%d %d\n", now.num, now.score);
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This code is optimized for faster execution and lower memory usage. It uses faster input/output methods, checks that the priority queue is not empty before accessing its top element, and reuses the `now` object instead of creating a new one every time.
