The given C++ program performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a graph. The graph is represented by an adjacency matrix 'm'. Each node 'i' in the graph is assigned a distance 'd[i]' from the source node (node '0' in this case). The BFS traverses the graph in a breadthward motion and uses a queue data structure.

The optimizations that can be done to this program are:

1. Use 'std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)' and 'cin.tie(NULL)' at the beginning of the main() function to disable the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams. This can significantly increase the performance of cin and cout operations.

2. When reading the input graph, we can directly update the adjacency matrix 'm' without the need for the intermediate variables 'u', 'v', and 'k'. This would save unnecessary space and time.

3. When outputting the results, we can use 'endl' after the full output has been printed. This is because 'endl' in C++ not only adds a newline character, but also flushes the stream, which can be a costly operation if done many times.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;
int m[105][105], n, v[105], d[105];
void bfs(int s) {
  v[s] = true;
  d[s] = 0;
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(s);
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int u = q.front();
    q.pop();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (m[u][i] && !v[i]) {
        d[i] = d[u] + 1;
        v[i] = true;
        q.push(i);
      }
    }
  }
}
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    d[i] = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int k;
    cin >> k >> k;
    for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      int v;
      cin >> v;
      m[i][v - 1] = true;
    }
  }
  bfs(0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cout << i + 1 << ' ' << d[i] << ' ';
  cout << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimizations made might not result in significant runtime improvements, depending on the input size and the specific system the program is run on.
