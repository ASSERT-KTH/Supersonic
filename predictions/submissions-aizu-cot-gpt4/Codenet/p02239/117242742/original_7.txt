The given C++ program implements the Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm on a graph. The graph is represented using an adjacency matrix 'm'. The 'bfs' function traverses the graph starting from a given source vertex 's'.

Here are some possible optimizations:

1. **Change the data type of the adjacency matrix:** The adjacency matrix 'm' is currently an integer matrix. However, it is only used as a boolean matrix where 'true' indicates an edge between two nodes and 'false' indicates no edge. Changing 'm' to a boolean matrix reduces memory usage.

2. **Avoid redundant memory initialization:** The array 'v' is used to store whether a node has been visited or not. It's unnecessary to initialize all the elements of 'v' to 'false' before starting BFS. During BFS, once a node is visited, it's marked as 'true'. So, initializing 'v' to 'false' using memset function is a waste of running time. We can eliminate this.

3. **Avoid unnecessary computations in the loop:** In the while loop inside 'bfs' function, 'm[u][i]' is checked for every i in [0, n). However, only a few 'i' values (those corresponding to the neighbors of 'u') will have 'm[u][i]' as 'true'. To avoid unnecessary computations, we can keep a list of neighbors for each node. But this will increase memory usage. Since we want to optimize for both running time and memory, we won't apply this optimization here.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized program is:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;
bool m[105][105];
int n, v[105], d[105];
void bfs(int s) {
  d[s] = 0;
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(s);
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int u = q.front();
    q.pop();
    if (v[u]) continue;
    v[u] = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (m[u][i] && !v[i]) {
        d[i] = d[u] + 1;
        q.push(i);
      }
    }
  }
}
int main() {
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    d[i] = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int u, k;
    cin >> u >> k;
    for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      int v;
      cin >> v;
      m[u - 1][v - 1] = true;
    }
  }
  bfs(0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cout << i + 1 << ' ' << d[i] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This program uses less memory due to the boolean adjacency matrix and runs faster due to the elimination of redundant memory initialization.
