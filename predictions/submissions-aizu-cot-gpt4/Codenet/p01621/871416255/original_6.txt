This C++ program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Instead of using the `bits/stdc++.h` library which includes almost all the standard C++ libraries, you can use the specific libraries that are needed. This can reduce the compilation time.

2. The `pow` function in the `ck` function calculates the same `1.0 - 1.0 / p` multiple times. This can be moved outside of the loop and stored in a variable.

3. The `minutes` array can be an array of `char` instead of `bool` to optimize memory usage.

4. The assignment of the `minutes` array can be simplified. Instead of checking `wbits` and `tbits` every time in the loop, you can calculate them once outside of the loop.

Here is the optimized version of the provided C++ code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <cmath>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

char minutes[7 * 24 * 60];
int s, n, t, m, p;
int wbits, tbits;

double ck(int start, double diff) {
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++, start += t) {
        bool flag = true;
        for (int j = 0; j <= s; j++) {
            if (!minutes[(start + j) % (7 * 24 * 60)]) {
                flag = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        cnt += flag;
    }
    return (1.0 - pow(diff, (double)cnt * n));
}

int main() {
    string weekday, time;
    while (cin >> s >> n >> t >> weekday >> time >> p >> m, m) {
        if (weekday == "All")
            wbits = (1 << 7) - 1;
        else
            wbits = 1;
        if (time == "Night")
            tbits = 1;
        else if (time == "Day")
            tbits = 2;
        else
            tbits = 3;
        double ans = 0.0;
        double diff = 1.0 - 1.0 / p;
        for (int i = 7 * 24 * 60 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            minutes[i] = (wbits & (1 << i / 1440)) && (tbits & (1 << ((i / 360 + 1) % 4 / 2)));
        }
        for (int i = 24 * 60 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            ans = max(ans, ck(i, diff));
        }
        cout << fixed << setprecision(16) << ans << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the specific libraries were included instead of `bits/stdc++.h`. The `pow` function was optimized to only calculate `1.0 - 1.0 / p` once. The `minutes` array was changed to an array of `char`. The `ck` function was modified to take `diff` as a parameter to avoid calculating `1.0 - 1.0 / p` multiple times. The assignment of the `minutes` array was simplified.
