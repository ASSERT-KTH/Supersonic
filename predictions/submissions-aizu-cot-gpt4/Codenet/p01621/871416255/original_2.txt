This is a C++ program that uses a combination of bitwise operations, loops, and mathematical calculations. The optimization process will focus on improving the memory usage and the running time. Here are the steps:

1. The first optimization step involves reducing the amount of memory used by the `minutes` array. The boolean values in C++ occupy one byte of memory, not just one bit. Instead of using a boolean array, we can use an array of `std::bitset` objects, which is a template class that allows the manipulation of fixed-size sequence of bits.

2. The second optimization step is about the calculation of `ans` in the main function. Instead of checking all possible start times (24*60 - 1 times), we can use a binary search to find the maximum value of `ck(i)`. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int s, n, t, m, p;
bitset<7 * 24 * 60> minutes;
int wbits, tbits;

double ck(int start) {
  int cnt = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++, start += t) {
    bool flag = true;
    for (int j = 0; j <= s; j++) {
      if (!minutes[(start + j) % (7 * 24 * 60)]) {
        flag = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    cnt += flag;
  }
  return (1.0 - pow(1.0 - 1.0 / p, (double)cnt * n));
}

inline int todays(int i) { return (i / (24 * 60)); }

inline bool totime(int i) {
  int tm = i % (24 * 60) / 24;
  return (tm >= 18 || tm < 6);
}

int main() {
  string weekday, time;
  while (cin >> s >> n >> t >> weekday >> time >> p >> m, m) {
    if (weekday == "All")
      wbits = (1 << 7) - 1;
    else
      wbits = 1;
    if (time == "Night")
      tbits = 1;
    else if (time == "Day")
      tbits = 2;
    else
      tbits = 3;

    for (int i = 7 * 24 * 60 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if ((wbits & (1 << i / 1440)) && (tbits & (1 << ((i / 360 + 1) % 4 / 2))))
        minutes[i] = true;
      else
        minutes[i] = false;
    }

    int l = 0, r = 24 * 60 - 1;
    while (r - l > 1) {
      int mid = (l + r) / 2;
      if (ck(mid) < ck(mid + 1)) {
        l = mid;
      } else {
        r = mid;
      }
    }

    double ans = max(ck(l), ck(r));
    cout << fixed << setprecision(16) << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
In this optimized version of the program, the `minutes` array is now declared as a `bitset` which saves memory. Also, in the main function, we perform a binary search instead of a full scan to find the maximum value of `ck(i)`, which reduces the time complexity.
