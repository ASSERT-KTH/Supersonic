The given code is a counting sort algorithm in C++. It reads an integer `n` from the input, then reads `n` integers and sorts them using counting sort. The sorted array is then printed to the output.

Here are some optimization steps:

1. The function `counting_sort` makes a copy of the array `v` in `tmp`. Instead, we can directly use the values from `v` and eliminate the need for `tmp`.
2. In the last loop in `counting_sort`, `cnt[tmp[i]]--` is executed even when it's not necessary. We can move this statement inside the condition where it's actually needed.
3. The `counting_sort` function can be simplified by directly writing back into `v` without the need of additional loops.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;

void counting_sort(vector<int> &v) {
  int n = v.size(), k = *max_element(v.begin(), v.end());
  vector<int> cnt(k + 1, 0);

  for (int x : v)
    cnt[x]++;

  int index = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < cnt[i]; j++)
      v[index++] = i;
}

signed main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { cin >> A[i]; }
  counting_sort(A);
  for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
    if (i > 0) cout << " ";
    cout << A[i];
  }
  cout << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The `counting_sort` function now directly writes back into `v` in sorted order, this eliminates the need for the `tmp` vector and the final loop, thus reducing memory usage.
2. Removed the unnecessary decrement of `cnt[tmp[i]]`.
3. Moved the `cout << " "` inside a conditional to avoid trailing space after the last number in the output.
