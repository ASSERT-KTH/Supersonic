This program seems to be well written and optimized already. However, there are few things we can still improve to optimize it a bit more.

1. **Avoid using `#include "bits/stdc++.h"`**: This header file includes quite a lot of standard library headers. Including it will definitely increase the compilation time. Instead, we should only include the headers that we actually use in our program.

2. **Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(NULL);`**: This would help in faster I/O operations.

3. **Avoid unnecessary usage of `tmp` vector**: The `tmp` vector in the `counting_sort` function is unnecessary. We can directly use the original vector `v` instead.

4. **Avoid calculating size in loop condition**: The size of vector `A` is calculated in every iteration of the loop `rep(i, 1, A.size())`. We can avoid it by storing the size in a variable before the loop.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

void counting_sort(vector<int> &v) {
  int n = v.size(), k = *max_element(v.begin(), v.end());
  vector<int> cnt(k + 1);
  cnt[0]--;
  for (int x : v)
    cnt[x]++;
  for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
    cnt[i + 1] += cnt[i];
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    v[cnt[v[i]]] = v[i];
    cnt[v[i]]--;
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { cin >> A[i]; }
  counting_sort(A);
  cout << A[0];
  int size = A.size();
  for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) { cout << " " << A[i]; }
  cout << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
