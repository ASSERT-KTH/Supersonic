The given program seems to be a reasonably optimized program already. It reads a list of integers from input, sorts them using counting sort, and then prints them out.

There are several things we can do to optimize the program further:

1. Input/Output operations: The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations can be slow if we are dealing with a lot of data. To speed up these operations, we can add `ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` at the beginning of the main function.

2. Unnecessary vector copying: In the counting sort function, a copy of the original vector, `tmp`, is made. This increases memory usage. Instead, we can directly use the original vector, `v`, reducing the memory footprint.

3. The `signed main()` can be simply written as `int main()`. The `signed` keyword is unnecessary.

Here's the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
#define all(c) begin(c), end(c)

const int INF = sizeof(int) == sizeof(long long) ? 0x3f3f3f3f3f3f3f3fLL : 0x3f3f3f3f;
const int MOD = (int)(1e9 + 7);

void counting_sort(vector<int> &v) {
  int n = v.size(), k = *max_element(all(v));
  vector<int> cnt(k + 1);
  cnt[0]--;
  for (int x : v)
    cnt[x]++;
  for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
    cnt[i + 1] += cnt[i];
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int tmp = v[i];
    v[cnt[tmp]] = tmp;
    cnt[tmp]--;
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n);
  rep(i, 0, n) { cin >> A[i]; }
  counting_sort(A);
  cout << A[0];
  rep(i, 1, A.size()) { cout << " " << A[i]; }
  cout << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations will have a minor impact unless you are dealing with huge data or a highly performance-sensitive application. The original code is quite efficient, and these changes will only slightly increase the performance.
