Before we dive into the optimization, let's understand what the program does. 

The program does the following steps:

1. Reads an integer 'n' from the standard input.
2. Reads 'n' integers into a vector named 'A'.
3. Sorts the vector 'A' using counting sort.
4. Prints the sorted array.

Now, let's discuss the possible optimizations:

1. **Avoid unnecessary copies:** The function counting_sort is taking vector v as an argument by value, which creates a copy of the original vector. As the vector v is not being used after calling this function, we can pass it by reference to avoid unnecessary copying which saves both time and space.

2. **Prefer pre-increment over post-increment:** In C++, pre-increment (++i) is generally faster than post-increment (i++) because post-increment involves keeping a copy of the previous value that is not needed in this case. So, we can replace post-increment with pre-increment in the loops.

3. **Reserve memory for vector:** The vector 'cnt' grows dynamically as we insert elements into it. This can be inefficient as it may involve multiple allocations and deallocations. As we know the maximum size of the vector at the time of its creation, we can reserve the required memory upfront using the reserve function.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;

#define rep(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); ++i)
#define rrep(i, a, b) for (int i = (b)-1; i >= (a); --i)
#define all(c) begin(c), end(c)

void counting_sort(vector<int> &v) {
  int n = v.size(), k = *max_element(v.begin(), v.end());
  vector<int> cnt(k + 1), tmp(v);
  cnt[0]--;
  for (int x : v)
    ++cnt[x];
  for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i)
    cnt[i + 1] += cnt[i];
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
    v[cnt[tmp[i]]] = tmp[i];
    --cnt[tmp[i]];
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n);
  rep(i, 0, n) { cin >> A[i]; }
  counting_sort(A);
  cout << A[0];
  rep(i, 1, A.size()) { cout << " " << A[i]; }
  cout << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Remember, these are micro-optimizations and might not affect the performance significantly for smaller inputs but can be beneficial for larger inputs.
