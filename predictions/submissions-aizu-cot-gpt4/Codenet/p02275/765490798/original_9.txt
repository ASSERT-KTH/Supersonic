The given C++ code uses counting sort to sort an array of integers. The main area that can be optimized is the counting sort function. The current counting sort function is implemented with an extra copy of the input vector, which increases memory usage. We can avoid this by not creating the 'tmp' vector and instead reusing the 'v' vector.

Another optimization can be to replace the 'max_element' function with a manual loop to find the maximum element. This can avoid the overhead of function calls and also allow us to count the occurrence of each number in the same loop, which can save time.

The 'A.size()' inside the final loop in the 'main' function is also computed on every iteration. To avoid this, the size can be stored in a variable before the loop.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)

const int MOD = (int)(1e9 + 7);

void counting_sort(vector<int> &v) {
  int n = v.size();
  int k = v[0];
  vector<int> cnt;
  
  for (int x : v) {
    if(x > k) k = x; // find the maximum element
    if(x >= cnt.size()) cnt.resize(x + 1); // resize the count vector if necessary
    cnt[x]++;
  }

  int pos = 0;
  for(int i = 0; i <= k; i++) {
    while(cnt[i] > 0) {
      v[pos++] = i;
      cnt[i]--;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n);
  rep(i, 0, n) { cin >> A[i]; }

  counting_sort(A);

  int ASize = A.size();
  cout << A[0];
  rep(i, 1, ASize) { cout << " " << A[i]; }
  cout << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation of optimizations:
1. Instead of using a separate vector 'tmp' to store the original array, we directly modify the 'v' vector to save space.
2. The 'max_element' function is replaced with a manual loop to calculate the maximum, which also counts the occurrences of each number in the same loop, saving time.
3. The size of the 'A' vector is computed once and stored in 'ASize', rather than being calculated in each iteration of the last loop.
