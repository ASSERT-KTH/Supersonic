The program is already quite efficient, but there are a few minor improvements that can be made:

1. Avoiding usage of `#include<bits/stdc++.h>`: It is not a good practice to include this header file as it includes quite a lot of files, which increases compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary header files.

2. Avoid the usage of `using namespace std;` since it might lead to naming conflicts in larger programs.

3. Use pre-increment `++i` instead of post increment `i++` in loops: This is because post increment involves a little more computation as it involves keeping a copy of the previous value and then incrementing. 

4. Avoid defining `#define r(i, n) for (auto i = 0; i < n; i++)` and `#define s(c) static_cast<int>((c).size())` as it reduces readability of the code.

5. Usage of `scanf` and `printf` in place of `cin` and `cout` for faster IO operations. 

6. To reduce memory usage, we could use a std::map instead of an array. The array `A[10001]` takes up space for 10001 integers, regardless of how many we actually need. A std::map only uses as much memory as it needs for the elements it actually contains. However, this might add a bit of overhead in terms of speed due to the extra lookups required.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <map>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::scanf("%d", &n);
  int min = 2000000, t;
  std::map<int, int> A;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::scanf("%d", &t);
    if (t < min)
      min = t;
    A[t]++;
  }
  A[min]--;
  std::printf("%d", min);
  for (auto it = A.begin(); it != A.end(); ++it) {
    for(int i = 0; i < it->second; ++i) {
      std::printf(" %d", it->first);
    }
  }
  std::printf("\n");
  return 0;
}
```
Remember that optimization often involves a trade-off between speed and memory. The original program was more optimized for speed, while the revised program is more optimized for memory.
