The provided C++ program seems to read a list of integers, find the minimum and then output the numbers in a sorted manner. This sorting is done by counting the occurrence of each number (counting sort). The program is already quite optimal, but there are few small optimizations that can be made:

1) Instead of using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a lot of unnecessary headers, use only the required headers. This will reduce the overall compilation time.

2) The macro `#define r(i, n) for (auto i = 0; i < n; i++)` is not needed and can make the code harder to understand. Use regular for loops instead.

3) The macro `#define s(c) static_cast<int>((c).size())` is not used at all in the code, so it can be removed.

4) Instead of initializing min to 2000000, you can initialize it to INT_MAX which is more clear and safe.

5) Instead of using `scanf` and `cout` for input and output, use `cin` and `cout` for consistency.

The optimized program would look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  int min = INT_MAX, t, A[10001]{};
  
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> t;
    if(t < min)
      min = t;
    A[t]++;
  }
  
  A[min]--;
  cout << min;
  
  for(int i = min; i < 10001; i++) {
    for(int j = 0; j < A[i]; j++) {
      cout << ' ' << i;
    }
  }
  
  cout << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
