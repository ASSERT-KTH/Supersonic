This C++ program reads a series of integers from the standard input, finds the smallest integer, and then prints all the numbers in non-decreasing order. Here are some steps we can take to optimize this program:

1. Using `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout` for IO operations. The reason is `scanf` and `printf` are faster than `cin` and `cout`.

2. Removing the `#define r(i, n) for (auto i = 0; i < n; i++)` and `#define s(c) static_cast<int>((c).size())` macros. These macros are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Removing the decrement of `A[min]` and the if condition inside the first loop. Instead, we can start the second loop from `i = min + 1`. This will optimize the program by decreasing the number of iterations in the second loop.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int min = 2000000, t, A[10001] = {};
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &t);
    if (t < min)
      min = t;
    A[t]++;
  }
  printf("%d", min);
  for (int i = min + 1; i < 10001; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < A[i]; j++) { printf(" %d", i); }
  }
  printf("\n");
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code will run faster and use less memory than the original code.
