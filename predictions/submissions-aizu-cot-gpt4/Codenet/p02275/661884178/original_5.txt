The given C/C++ program is already quite efficient in terms of time complexity. However, there are a few minor modifications we could make to improve its performance:

1. Array size: The array size is initialized as 10001, which may not be necessary. If 'n' is significantly smaller than 10001, allocating such a large array would be wasteful. We can dynamically allocate the array based on 'n' to save memory.

2. I/O operations: scanf and printf are faster than cin and cout in C++. So, we can replace cout with printf for faster output.

3. Macro usage: Although macros such as 'r' and 's' can make the code more concise, they can also make it harder to read and understand. It would be better to use normal loops instead.

4. Since we are using C++, we should avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;`. The first header file includes a lot of unnecessary stuff that can slow down the compilation process, and the second line can lead to naming conflicts. We should only include the libraries that we need and use the std:: prefix when necessary.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int min = 2000000, t;
  std::vector<int> A(n+1, 0); // dynamically allocate based on n
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { // replace macro with normal loop
    scanf("%d", &t);
    if (t < min)
      min = t;
    A[t]++;
  }
  A[min]--;
  printf("%d", min);
  for (int i = min; i <= n; i++) { // replace macro with normal loop
    for (int j = 0; j < A[i]; j++) { 
      printf(" %d", i);
    }
  }
  printf("\n");
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the above modifications won't drastically reduce the time complexity or memory usage of the program. The original program is already quite efficient, and these are just minor optimizations.
