The provided code is a C++ program that uses complex numbers and some mathematical operations to perform calculations. The `project` function is used to calculate the projection of point `c` on the line segment `ab`. The main function reads the coordinates of points `a`, `b`, and `n` points `c` from the user, then for each `c` it calculates the projection and outputs the result.

To optimize the code, we can make the following changes:

1. **Avoid Including `<bits/stdc++.h>`:** This header file includes quite a lot of headers, which can slow down the compilation process. Instead, include only the necessary headers. In this case, we will need `<iostream>`, `<complex>`, and `<cstdio>`.

2. **Use cin/cout Consistently:** For input/output operations, it's better to use `cin` and `cout` consistently, or `scanf` and `printf` consistently. Mixing them can cause synchronization issues and slow down the program. In this program, we will use `cout` to replace `printf` for consistency.

3. **Reduce the Scope of Variables:** Variables `ax`, `ay`, `bx`, `by`, `cx`, `cy` can be declared inside the while loop to reduce their scope, thereby reducing memory usage.

4. **Avoid Unnecessary Complex Number Conversions:** Avoid creating new complex numbers in every loop iteration for `P(ax, ay)`, `P(bx, by)`. Create them before the loop and use them inside the loop.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
typedef complex<double> P;

P project(P a, P b, P c) {
  b -= a, c -= a;
  return a + b * real(c / b);
}

int main() {
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by;
  cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by >> n;
  P a(ax, ay), b(bx, by);
  while (n--) {
    double cx, cy;
    cin >> cx >> cy;
    P c(cx, cy);
    P p = project(a, b, c);
    cout << fixed << setprecision(8) << p.real() << " " << p.imag() << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The code is now more consistent, efficient, and also has a reduced scope of variables. The optimization will save both compile time and runtime, and also reduce memory usage.
