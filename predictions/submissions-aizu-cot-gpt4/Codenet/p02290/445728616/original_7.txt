Step by Step Optimization:

1. Include only necessary headers: Including `<bits/stdc++.h>` is not a good practice as it includes all the standard library headers in C++, which may slow down the compilation process. In your code, we only need `<iostream>` and `<complex>`.

2. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(NULL);`. These two lines will make the input and output more efficient by removing the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams.

3. Use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl`. The `std::endl` not only adds a newline character but also flushes the output buffer, which can slow down the output operation. In your case, it's better to use `'\n'` to add a newline character.

4. Use pre-increment operator instead of post-increment: For primitive types like int, there is no performance difference between pre and post-increment, but as a good practice, it's recommended to use pre-increment as it can be faster in case of complex objects because post-increment creates a copy.

5. In the function `project`, the `complex<double>` objects `b` and `c` are being modified. But in C++, the arguments are passed by value, which means a copy of those objects is created and then modified. To avoid this, we can pass these parameters by reference to the function.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>

using namespace std;
typedef complex<double> P;

P project(P &a, P &b, P &c) {
  b -= a; 
  c -= a;
  return a + b * real(c / b);
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy;
  cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by >> n;
  
  P a(ax, ay), b(bx, by);
  
  while (--n >= 0) {
    cin >> cx >> cy;
    P c(cx, cy);
    P p = project(a, b, c);
    printf("%.8f %.8f\n", p.real(), p.imag());
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the optimization here focuses on the coding style and practices, not on the algorithmic level, as the algorithm seems to be optimal already.
