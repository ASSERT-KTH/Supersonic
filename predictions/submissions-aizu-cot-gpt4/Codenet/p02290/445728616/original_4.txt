This program doesn't include many parts that can be significantly optimized. However, there are few small things that can be done.

1. Rather than using `cin` and `cout` for input and output, we can use `scanf` and `printf` that are faster. The `cin` and `cout` operations have a higher overhead.

2. Also, use `\n` instead of `std::endl`. `std::endl` causes flushing of the output stream, which increases the time taken for I/O.

3. We can avoid creating temporary complex variables in the project function by doing all computations in the return statement.

4. Instead of using `typedef complex<double> P;`, you can directly use `complex<double>` which will improve readability.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

complex<double> project(complex<double> a, complex<double> b, complex<double> c) {
  return a + (b - a) * real((c - a) / (b - a));
}

int main() {
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy;
  scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %d", &ax, &ay, &bx, &by, &n);
  while (n--) {
    scanf("%lf %lf", &cx, &cy);
    complex<double> p = project(complex<double>(ax, ay), complex<double>(bx, by), complex<double>(cx, cy));
    printf("%.8f %.8f\n", p.real(), p.imag());
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This is a minor optimization and the actual impact on performance can be negligible. The main point here is to follow good programming practices.
