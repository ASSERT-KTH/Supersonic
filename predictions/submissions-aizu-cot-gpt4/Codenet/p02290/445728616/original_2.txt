The given program is already quite optimized, but there are a few small changes that could potentially improve performance:

1. Object Reuse: In the main function, a new complex number is created each time `project()` is called. This could be optimized by reusing the same object for each computation.
2. Efficient I/O: Using `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations can make the program faster.
3. Avoiding Division: Division is a costly operation in terms of CPU cycles. In the `project` function, `c / b` can be replaced with `c * conj(b) / norm(b)` to avoid division operation.

Below is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef complex<double> P;

P project(P& a, P& b, P& c) {
  b -= a, c -= a;
  return a + b * real(c * conj(b) / norm(b));
}

int main() {
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy;

  scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %d", &ax, &ay, &bx, &by, &n);

  P a(ax, ay), b(bx, by), c;

  while (n--) {
    scanf("%lf %lf", &cx, &cy);
    c = P(cx, cy);
    P p = project(a, b, c);
    printf("%.8f %.8f\n", p.real(), p.imag());
  }

  return 0;
}
```
Keep in mind that the changes might not significantly improve the program's performance as the given code was already quite efficient. The actual performance gain might vary depending on the input size and the specific hardware and compiler used.
