The given C/C++ program projects a point onto a line. The code is already fairly well optimized in terms of time complexity, as it operates in constant time per iteration. However, there are still some optimizations that can be done in terms of memory usage and code readability.

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. The header file `bits/stdc++.h` is not a standard library and it includes practically everything, which increases the compilation time. It's better to include only the libraries that are needed for a program.

2. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(NULL);`. These lines can speed up the input/output operations by decoupling `cin` and `cout` from C's stdin and stdout.

3. Avoid creating temporary complex objects. In the current code, `P(ax, ay)`, `P(bx, by)`, and `P(cx, cy)` are temporary complex objects that are created and destroyed for each iteration. Instead of creating and destroying these objects each time, we can create them once and update their values as needed.

4. Use `std::cout` instead of `printf` for consistency. It's better to stick with C++ style I/O for consistency, especially since `std::cin` is used elsewhere in the program.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>

using namespace std;
typedef complex<double> P;

P project(P& a, P& b, P& c) {
  b -= a; 
  c -= a;
  return a + b * real(c / b);
}

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy;
  cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by >> n;

  P a(ax, ay), b(bx, by), c;

  while (n--) {
    cin >> cx >> cy;
    c.real(cx); 
    c.imag(cy);
    
    P p = project(a, b, c);
    cout << setprecision(8) << p.real() << " " << p.imag() << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```
