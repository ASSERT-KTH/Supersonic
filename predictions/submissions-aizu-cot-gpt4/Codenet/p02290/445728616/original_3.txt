The given program doesn't have any major optimization issues. It already has a good time complexity due to its simple structure and tasks. However, there are a few minor optimizations that can be made.

Steps to optimize the program:

1. Do not use `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because it includes quite a lot of libraries, which increases the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries.

2. Replace `typedef complex<double> P` with `using P = complex<double>;`. The `using` keyword is more modern and preferred.

3. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(NULL);` to untie `cin` and `cout` streams. This can potentially speed up I/O operations in some cases.

4. Instead of using `printf` for output, use `cout`. This is more consistent with the rest of the code and more idiomatic in C++.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>
using namespace std;

using P = complex<double>;

P project(P a, P b, P c) {
  b -= a, c -= a;
  return a + b * real(c / b);
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy;
  cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by >> n;
  
  while (n--) {
    cin >> cx >> cy;
    P p = project(P(ax, ay), P(bx, by), P(cx, cy));
    cout << fixed << setprecision(8) << p.real() << " " << p.imag() << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the potential speed up by these modifications may not be significant, because the original code was already quite efficient. The changes are more about adhering to good coding practices than about improving performance.
