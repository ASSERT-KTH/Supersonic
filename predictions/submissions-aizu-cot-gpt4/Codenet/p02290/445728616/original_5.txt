Let's go through the program and optimize it:

1. The first thing to note is the use of "#include <bits/stdc++.h>". This library includes almost all C++ libraries, which increases the compilation time. We should only include the libraries that we need.

2. Instead of using cin and cout for I/O operations, we can use scanf and printf which are faster. 

3. We are creating complex objects in every iteration of the loop in the main function for the project function call. We can create these objects once and just update their values in each iteration, which will save some time.

4. Also, instead of subtracting 'a' from 'b' and 'c' in the project function, we can subtract it when we pass the parameters to the function, which will save us some time.

5. We can also replace complex with pair to save memory, but in this case, it might increase the complexity of the code and make it less readable, so we won't do it.

Let's implement these changes:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <complex>

using namespace std;
typedef complex<double> P;
P project(P a, P b, P c) {
  return a + b * real(c / b);
}
int main() {
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy;
  scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %d", &ax, &ay, &bx, &by, &n);
  P a(ax, ay), b(bx - ax, by - ay), c;
  while (n--) {
    scanf("%lf %lf", &cx, &cy);
    c.real(cx - ax);
    c.imag(cy - ay);
    P p = project(a, b, c);
    printf("%.8f %.8f\n", p.real(), p.imag());
  }
  return 0;
}
```

After these changes, the program should run faster and use less memory.
