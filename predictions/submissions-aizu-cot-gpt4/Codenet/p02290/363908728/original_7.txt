The following optimization steps can be done:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because it includes more libraries than you actually need which increases compilation time. Instead, only include the libraries that you are actually using in your program. In this case, we are using `iostream`, `vector`, `complex`, and `iomanip`.

2. The `EPS` and `INF` constants are not used in the given program so they can be removed to reduce memory usage.

3. Remove the `CWW` struct and its instance `STAR`. This struct is designed to speed up cin/cout operations and set cout precision. However, in this scenario, cin/cout are not the bottleneck of the program, and it's not necessary to set cout precision at the beginning of the program. 

4. The `Circle` struct and `Polygon` type are not used in the given program so they can be removed to reduce memory usage.

5. Some of the operator overloads for reading (`>>`) and writing (`<<`) objects from/into streams are not used either, so they can be removed.

6. The `dot` and `cross` functions are not used in the given program so they can be removed to reduce memory usage.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <complex>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;
using D = double;
using Point = complex<D>;

struct Segment {
  Point p1, p2;
  Segment(const Point &p1 = Point(), const Point &p2 = Point())
      : p1(p1), p2(p2) {}
};

struct Line {
  Point p1, p2;
  Line(const Point &p1 = Point(), const Point &p2 = Point()) : p1(p1), p2(p2) {}
};

istream &operator>>(istream &is, Point &a) {
  D x, y;
  is >> x >> y;
  a = Point(x, y);
  return is;
}

ostream &operator<<(ostream &os, Point &a) {
  os << real(a) << " " << imag(a);
  return os;
}

istream &operator>>(istream &is, Line &l) {
  Point p1, p2;
  is >> p1 >> p2;
  l = Line(p1, p2);
  return is;
}

Point projection(const Point &a, const Point &b) { return a * real(b / a); }

int main() {
  Line L;
  cin >> L;
  int Q;
  cin >> Q;
  while (Q--) {
    Point p;
    cin >> p;
    Point w = L.p1 + projection(L.p2 - L.p1, p - L.p1);
    cout << w << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program is smaller and easier to read, which makes it easier to maintain and debug. It should also compile and run slightly faster due to the reduced amount of code and memory usage.
