The given C++ code is already quite optimized, but there are a few potential areas where we can improve it.

1. Remove the global STAR instance: We generally avoid using global variables or instances whenever possible. Since the only purpose of the STAR instance is to execute its constructor, we can move its contents directly into the main function.

2. Avoid using "using namespace std": It's a bad practice to use the "using namespace std" statement in C++. It can lead to naming conflicts.

3. Use Fast I/O: If you're dealing with lots of I/O operations, using fast I/O can help you speed up the process.

4. Avoid using complex numbers: The Point is implemented as a complex number, but the functionality of complex numbers isn't fully utilized, so it's more efficient to use a struct for Point with two double members representing x and y coordinates.

5. Use const references for complex objects: For complex objects like Points, passing by constant reference to avoid unnecessary copying can save time and memory.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <iomanip>
#include <cmath>

struct Point {
  double x, y;
};

struct Line {
  Point p1, p2;
};

double dot(const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  return a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y;
}

double cross(const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  return a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x;
}

Point projection(const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  double t = dot(a, b) / dot(a, a);
  return {a.x * t, a.y * t};
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(15);

  Line L;
  std::cin >> L.p1.x >> L.p1.y >> L.p2.x >> L.p2.y;
  
  int Q;
  std::cin >> Q;

  while (Q--) {
    Point p, w;
    std::cin >> p.x >> p.y;
    Point a = {L.p2.x - L.p1.x, L.p2.y - L.p1.y};
    Point b = {p.x - L.p1.x, p.y - L.p1.y};
    Point proj = projection(a, b);
    w = {L.p1.x + proj.x, L.p1.y + proj.y};
    std::cout << w.x << " " << w.y << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program avoids global instances, uses struct to represent a point, and uses const references to pass complex objects, all of which can help to improve the efficiency of the program.
