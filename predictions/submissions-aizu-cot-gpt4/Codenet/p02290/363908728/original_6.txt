Optimizations:

1. Use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is not recommended. It includes a lot of unnecessary headers which increases the compilation time. Instead, include only those libraries which are used in the program.
2. The `CWW` struct is not necessary. `cin.tie(0)`, `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0)`, and `cout << fixed << setprecision(15)` are only used once so they can be included in the main function.
3. Avoid using `endl` for line breaks as it also flushes the output stream, which can be slower than necessary. Use `"\n"` instead.
4. Use `auto` wherever possible to make the code more readable and maintainable.
5. Get rid of the `EPS` and `INF` constants if they are not being used.
6. Instead of reading `Q` and then running a `while` loop `Q` times, use a `for` loop. This makes it clearer that the loop will run `Q` times.
7. Instead of creating a new `Point` instance `p` for each query, declare it once outside the loop and reuse it, to minimize memory usage.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <complex>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;
using D = double;
using Point = complex<D>;
struct Line {
  Point p1, p2;
  Line(const Point &p1 = Point(), const Point &p2 = Point()) : p1(p1), p2(p2) {}
};

istream &operator>>(istream &is, Point &a) {
  D x, y;
  is >> x >> y;
  a = Point(x, y);
  return is;
}

ostream &operator<<(ostream &os, const Point &a) {
  os << real(a) << " " << imag(a);
  return os;
}

istream &operator>>(istream &is, Line &l) {
  is >> l.p1 >> l.p2;
  return is;
}

Point projection(const Point &a, const Point &b) { return a * real(b / a); }

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout << fixed << setprecision(15);

  Line L;
  cin >> L;
  int Q;
  cin >> Q;
  Point p;
  for(int i = 0; i < Q; ++i) {
    cin >> p;
    Point w = L.p1 + projection(L.p2 - L.p1, p - L.p1);
    cout << w << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
