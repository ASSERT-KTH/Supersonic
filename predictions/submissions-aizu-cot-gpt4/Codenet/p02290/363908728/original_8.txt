The program is already following a good amount of good programming practices. However, I can suggest a few changes to slightly optimize it:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is quite large and includes more files than you actually need, making compiling slower. Instead, include only the libraries you need.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: It might cause name clashing problems. It's better to prefix with `std::` where necessary.

3. The `EPS` and `INF` constants are declared but not used in the program. Remove them to reduce memory usage.

4. `cin.tie(0);` and `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);` are used to speed up the cin and cout operations, but you use these operations only once in this program. So, you can consider removing them.

5. The operator overloads for the `Point` and `Line` classes are not used frequently. You could remove them and directly use the members of the classes in your code.

6. You are calculating `projection` for each point inside the loop. If the points are not unique, you could store the results in a dictionary to avoid recalculating.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <complex>

struct CWW {
  CWW() {
    std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(15);
  }
} STAR;

using D = double;
using Point = std::complex<D>;

struct Segment {
  Point p1, p2;
  Segment(const Point &p1 = Point(), const Point &p2 = Point())
      : p1(p1), p2(p2) {}
};

struct Line {
  Point p1, p2;
  Line(const Point &p1 = Point(), const Point &p2 = Point()) : p1(p1), p2(p2) {}
};

struct Circle {
  Point c;
  D r;
  Circle(const Point &c = Point(), const D &r = 0.0) : c(c), r(r) {}
};

using Polygon = std::vector<Point>;

D dot(const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  return std::real(a) * std::real(b) + std::imag(a) * std::imag(b);
}

D cross(const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  return std::real(a) * std::imag(b) - std::imag(a) * std::real(b);
}

Point projection(const Point &a, const Point &b) { return a * std::real(b / a); }

int main() {
  Line L;
  D x1, y1, x2, y2;
  std::cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
  L = Line(Point(x1, y1), Point(x2, y2));
  
  int Q;
  std::cin >> Q;
  while (Q--) {
    D px, py;
    std::cin >> px >> py;
    Point p(px, py);
    Point w = L.p1 + projection(L.p2 - L.p1, p - L.p1);
    std::cout << std::real(w) << " " << std::imag(w) << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
