The given code is for the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. There are a few optimizations we can apply to the code:

1) The dynamic programming array "dp" is larger than it needs to be. We only reference "dp[i]" and "dp[i+1]", so we only need to maintain two rows at a time, which can reduce the size of "dp" from "dp[110][10010]" to "dp[2][10010]". This saves memory.

2) We don't need to initialize the first row of "dp" to 0 as C++ initializes arrays to 0 by default. This saves time.

3) The inner loop can start from "weight[i]" instead of 0 if "weight[i] <= W". It saves time by avoiding unnecessary iterations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N, W;
    cin >> N >> W;
    int value[N], weight[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
    int dp[2][10010] = {0};
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int w = weight[i]; w <= W; w++) {
            dp[(i+1)%2][w] = max(dp[i%2][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i%2][w]);
        }
        for (int w = 0; w < weight[i]; w++) {
            dp[(i+1)%2][w] = dp[i%2][w];
        }
    }
    cout << dp[N%2][W] << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, we used "dp[i%2]" and "dp[(i+1)%2]" to represent the current and next row. In the loop that calculates "dp" values, we first calculate the ones where the current item is included (and thus "w" starts from "weight[i]"), then the ones where the current item is not included (and thus "w" is less than "weight[i]").
