Step 1: Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes quite a lot of files which can slow down compilation process. I will include the necessary libraries only.

Step 2: Dynamic memory allocation. The array dp has fixed size, but it should be dynamically allocated according to the input size.

Step 3: Array initialization. The initialization of dp can be done more efficiently. Instead of a loop, I will use memset to initialize all elements to 0.

Step 4: Optimization of the dp filling loop. Instead of checking if the weight is greater or equal than the current weight for every item, we can start the inner loop from the weight of the item. This way, we don't need to check the condition and only calculate the maximum value.

Here is the optimized version of given code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  int value[N], weight[N];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  
  int **dp = new int*[N+1];
  for(int i = 0; i <= N; i++)
    dp[i] = new int[W+1];

  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp[0][0]) * (N + 1) * (W + 1));

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int w = weight[i]; w <= W; w++) {
      dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
    }
    for (int w = 0; w < weight[i]; w++) {
      dp[i + 1][w] = dp[i][w];
    }
  }

  cout << dp[N][W] << endl;

  for(int i = 0; i <= N; i++)
    delete [] dp[i];
  delete [] dp;

  return 0;
}
```
Please note that this optimization is mainly for runtime. The memory usage remains the same because the size of the dp array is determined by the input size.
