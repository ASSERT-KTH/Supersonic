The given C++ program is a typical 0/1 Knapsack problem. It uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The two-dimensional array dp[i][j] represents the maximum value that can be achieved using the first i items and a total weight of j.

Optimization Steps:

1. Memory Optimization: Instead of using a two-dimensional array, we can use a one-dimensional array to save memory. The trick is to traverse the weight in reverse order in the inner loop. This ensures that when calculating dp[w], dp[w-weight[i]] is always a state of the previous round, which corresponds to dp[i-1][w-weight[i]].

2. Running Time Optimization: The first loop initializing dp[0][i] is unnecessary. The dp array is initialized to 0 by default.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N, W;
    cin >> N >> W;
    vector<int> value(N), weight(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
    vector<int> dp(W + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int w = W; w >= weight[i]; w--) {
            dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w - weight[i]] + value[i]);
        }
    }
    cout << dp[W] << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, the space complexity is reduced from O(NW) to O(W) and the time complexity remains O(NW). Note that the optimization does not change the time complexity, but it can significantly save memory when W is large.
