The optimizations that can be performed are:

1. Avoid Variable-length Arrays: C++ does not support variable-length arrays (array size cannot be determined at compile-time). Instead, use dynamic memory allocation (like the `new` operator in C++) or use STL containers like `vector`.

2. Minimize Dynamic Memory Allocation: Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation are expensive operations in terms of time and should be minimized. Here, the `dp` array can be optimized to use only a 1D array instead of a 2D array, because each dp[i][w] only relies on the previous items, i.e., dp[i-1][w']. This would also reduce the memory footprint of the program.

3. Selection of the right header files: Including `bits/stdc++.h` is not a good practice as it includes a lot of unnecessary header files, increasing the compilation time. We will replace it with the specific header files needed: `iostream` and `vector`.

4. Looping direction: When we reduce the `dp` table into a 1D array, the inner loop must iterate from `W` to `w` in reverse order to avoid overriding the `dp[w]` of the current iteration `i`.

The optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> value(N), weight(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  vector<int> dp(W+1, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int w = W; w >= weight[i]; w--) {
      dp[w] = max(dp[w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[w]);
    }
  }
  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This program has a better memory footprint and is efficient in terms of execution time.
