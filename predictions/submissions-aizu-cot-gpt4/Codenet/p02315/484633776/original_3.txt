Optimizations:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes too many unnecessary headers which increases compilation time. Instead, include only the libraries that are necessary.

2. Use `std::vector` instead of C-style arrays. The `std::vector` allows dynamic allocation of memory, which is more efficient and safe.

3. When declaring `std::vector`, initialize it with default values. This can reduce the time required to fill the vector later.

4. Reuse the `dp` vector for all `i` values. This reduces the memory usage from O(NW) to O(W).

Here is the optimized version:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int N, W;
  std::cin >> N >> W;
  std::vector<int> value(N), weight(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    std::cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  std::vector<int> dp(W + 1, 0); // Declare and initialize dp vector
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int w = W; w >= weight[i]; w--) {
      dp[w] = std::max(dp[w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[w]);
    }
  }
  std::cout << dp[W] << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

- In the original code, the `dp` array was a 2D array with dimensions of 110 x 10010, which is quite large and unnecessary. By reusing the `dp` vector for all `i` values, we only need a 1D vector with a size of W+1, which significantly reduces the memory usage.

- The original loop over `w` was from 0 to W. However, in the new code, we loop over `w` from W to `weight[i]`. This is because we want to avoid using an updated `dp[w - weight[i]]` value within the same `i` loop. This change also allows us to reuse the `dp` vector for all `i` values.
