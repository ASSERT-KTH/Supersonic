In the given C/C++ program, the following optimization steps can be made:

1. Instead of declaring a 2D array `dp` of fixed size `[110][10010]`, we can declare it dynamically based on the input `N` and `W` size to save memory.

2. The initialization of `dp` should fill the first row and first column with 0's. So, `dp[0][i] = 0` should be done for `i` ranging from `0` to `W+1`, not `W`.

3. The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes almost all standard C++ libraries, which can increase compilation time significantly. It's better to include only necessary libraries.

Optimized program:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> value(N), weight(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  vector<vector<int>> dp(N+1, vector<int>(W+1, 0));
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
      if (w >= weight[i])
        dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
      else
        dp[i + 1][w] = dp[i][w];
    }
  }
  cout << dp[N][W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
