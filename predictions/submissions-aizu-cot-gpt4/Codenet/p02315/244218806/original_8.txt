This program is used for solving the 0/1 knapsack problem where the total weight of the selected items is <= W and the total value is maximized. The dynamic programming (DP) approach is used to solve this problem. The time complexity of this program is O(N*W) and the space complexity is O(N*W) where N is the number of items and W is the total weight.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. We can optimize the space complexity from O(N*W) to O(W) by using only 2 rows in the DP table because the value of dp[i+1][j] only depends on the values in the i-th row.

2. The inner loop that goes from 0 to W can be optimized. Since we're only interested in the case where j >= w[i], we can start the loop from w[i] instead of 0.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> v(N), w(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> v[i] >> w[i];
    
  vector<int> dp(W+1, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = W; j >= w[i]; j--) {
        dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - w[i]] + v[i]);
    }
  }
  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program has a time complexity of O(N*W) and a space complexity of O(W), which is an improvement in terms of memory usage.
