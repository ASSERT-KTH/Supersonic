The given program is a simple implementation of the 0/1 Knapsack problem using Dynamic Programming. However, it's not the most efficient way to implement it, both in terms of memory and time complexity. The memory usage can be optimized by using a 1D array instead of a 2D array, and the running time can be improved by going through the weight limit (W) in a reversed manner.

Optimization steps:

1. Instead of using a 2D array (dp[1001][10001]), we can use a 1D array (dp[10001]). This reduces the space complexity from O(NW) to O(W), which is a significant improvement when W is large. The idea is to maintain only the current and previous row in the table, which can be achieved in a 1D array.

2. Instead of iterating over the weight limit (W) from 0 to W, we can iterate in a reversed manner, i.e., from W to 0. This ensures that when we're considering whether to include an item, the dp value we're comparing against is from the previous round (which is equivalent to not having included the item yet), not the current round.

Here is the optimized program:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> v(N), w(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> v[i] >> w[i];

  vector<int> dp(W+1, 0); // 1D array initialized with 0

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = W; j >= w[i]; j--) {
      dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - w[i]] + v[i]);
    }
  }
  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program uses less memory and has a smaller running time compared to the original program.
