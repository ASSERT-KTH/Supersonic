The given code uses dynamic programming to solve the knapsack problem, which is a problem in combinatorial optimization. The program reads the number of items and the maximum weight from the user, then for each item, it reads its value and weight. It then calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by picking up the items without exceeding the maximum weight.

The program uses a 2D array `dp` to store intermediate results, which is initialized with a size of 1001 * 10001. However, the actual size necessary depends on the number of items and the maximum weight. Therefore, it may waste a large amount of memory if the input is small.

The optimization can be done as follows:

1. Replace the global 2D array with a local one, and allocate the size dynamically according to the actual input. This can save a lot of memory if the input is small.
2. Instead of calculating and storing results for all weights from 0 to W, we can start from W and move towards 0. This way, we can use the result of `dp[i][j - w[i]]` immediately after it's calculated, because `j - w[i]` is always less than or equal to `j`. This can potentially increase cache hit rate and improve running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> v(N), w(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> v[i] >> w[i];
  vector<vector<int>> dp(N + 1, vector<int>(W + 1, 0));
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = W; j >= 0; j--) {
      if (j - w[i] < 0) {
        dp[i + 1][j] = dp[i][j];
      } else {
        dp[i + 1][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j - w[i]] + v[i]);
      }
    }
  }
  cout << dp[N][W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Remember that these optimizations may not always lead to significant improvements in running time and memory usage, especially for small inputs. However, they can be beneficial for large inputs and are good practices in general.
