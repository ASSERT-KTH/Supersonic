The given program is a C++ implementation of the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. It reads from the standard input the number of items (N), the maximum weight (W), and the value and weight of each item (v[i], w[i]). It then computes and prints the maximum value that can be obtained by choosing a subset of items with total weight not exceeding W.

Optimization steps:

1. Memory Usage: The 2D array dp is statically allocated with a size of 1001*10001, which can be quite large. If N is much less than 1001 or W is much less than 10001, a lot of memory will be wasted. So, we can dynamically allocate the memory for dp based on the actual values of N and W to save memory.

2. Running Time: The nested loop structure in the program is necessary for the dynamic programming approach and cannot be removed or significantly altered without changing the algorithm. However, a small optimization can be made by calculating 'dp[i + 1][j - w[i]] + v[i]' only once instead of potentially twice.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> v(N), w(N);
  vector<vector<int>> dp(N + 1, vector<int>(W + 1, 0)); // dynamic allocation based on N and W
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> v[i] >> w[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
      if (j - w[i] < 0) {
        dp[i + 1][j] = dp[i][j];
      } else {
        int newValue = dp[i][j - w[i]] + v[i]; // calculate this only once
        dp[i + 1][j] = max(dp[i][j], newValue);
      }
    }
  }
  cout << dp[N][W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The running time optimization here is quite minor and may not lead to noticeable improvement in execution time, because modern compilers are usually capable of performing such optimization automatically.
