The provided program finds the maximum value that can be achieved with a total weight less than or equal to 'W'. It uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the knapsack problem. 

While the given program is already fairly efficient, there are a few areas we could look into to optimize it:

1. Memory Optimization: Instead of using a 2D array for storing the states of all items and weights, we can use a 1D array. We only need the current and previous state, so we can keep overwriting the previous state in the array, which reduces the space complexity from O(W*N) to O(W).

2. IO Optimization: The 'cin' and 'cout' operations are slower, we can use faster input-output methods such as 'scanf' and 'printf' for a significant speed-up.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int dp[10001];

int main() {
  int N, W;
  scanf("%d%d", &N, &W);
  vector<int> v(N), w(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    scanf("%d%d", &v[i], &w[i]);

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = W; j >= w[i]; j--) {
      dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - w[i]] + v[i]);
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", dp[W]);
  return 0;
}
```

The inner loop now starts from 'W' and goes down to 'w[i]' which ensures that the previous state is not overwritten before being used. The 'scanf' and 'printf' functions are used instead of 'cin' and 'cout' for faster I/O operations. 

Please note, if multiple threads are using these functions simultaneously, it can cause data races. So 'cin' and 'cout' are safer in a multi-threaded environment.
