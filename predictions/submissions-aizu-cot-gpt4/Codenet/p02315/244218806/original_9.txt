The program is a Dynamic Programming (DP) solution to the 0/1 Knapsack problem. The optimization consists of two steps:

1. The first step is to reduce the memory usage. Currently, the program uses a 2D array `dp` of size `1001 x 10001` to store the intermediate results, which can be quite memory consuming. However, if we observe the program, we can see that each dp[i][j] only depends on the previous row's results (dp[i-1][j] and dp[i-1][j-w[i]]). So we can reduce the array to a 1D array.

2. The second step is to change the inner loop from forward to reverse. This is because each dp[j] depends on the previous dp[j] and dp[j-w[i]]. If we update dp[j] in forward order, then the dp[j-w[i]] we use to update dp[j] is already updated in the current round, not the value from the previous round. But if we update dp[j] in reverse order, the dp[j-w[i]] we use to update dp[j] is the value from the previous round, which is what we want.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int dp[10001];
int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> v(N), w(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> v[i] >> w[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = W; j >= w[i]; j--) {
      dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - w[i]] + v[i]);
    }
  }
  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized program, the memory usage is reduced to O(W) and the running time is still O(NW), which is the best we can do for this problem.
