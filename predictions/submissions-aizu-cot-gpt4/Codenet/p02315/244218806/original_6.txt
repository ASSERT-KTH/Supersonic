This program is a dynamic programming solution for the 0/1 Knapsack problem. The existing code is already optimized in terms of time complexity and memory usage. However, there's a minor optimization we can do:

1. Instead of using a 2D array for dp, we can optimize the space usage by using a 1D array. The reason this works is because we only need the values from the previous iteration (dp[i] in the original code), which means we can overwrite the old values with the new ones as we iterate through the weights. This reduces the space complexity from O(NW) to O(W), where N is the number of items and W is the total weight capacity. 

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> v(N), w(N), dp(W+1, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> v[i] >> w[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = W; j >= w[i]; j--) {
        dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - w[i]] + v[i]);
    }
  }
  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the inner loop in this case has to iterate from W to w[i] in a descending order. This is because each item can only be used once. If we loop in an ascending order, an item could be used multiple times as dp[j] could be updated multiple times in one iteration. By looping in a descending order, we ensure that dp[j] is only updated once in each iteration.
