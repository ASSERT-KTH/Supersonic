Let's go step by step:

1. Remove unnecessary macros: There are a lot of macros defined in the code which are not used and can be removed to clean up the code and make it more readable. These include `vvi`, `vec`, `pq`, `all`, `uniqueV`, `repp`, `debug`, `debug2`, `debug3`, `debugB`, `line`, `dx`, `dy`, `PI` and `printA`.

2. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This is a non-standard header file and it includes many standard library header files, which can lead to a slower compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary header files to improve compilation time.

3. Initialization of `dp` array: In the code, `dp[0][W]` is initialized in a loop, but this is not necessary because it's always set to 0. It's better to initialize the first row and first column of `dp` array to 0 outside the loops.

4. Use `std::vector` instead of arrays: Vectors are preferred over arrays in C++ as they are safer and more versatile. Vectors also help in reducing the memory usage as they dynamically allocate memory. We can replace `weight` and `value` arrays with vectors and `dp` array with a 2D vector.

5. Use `std::max()` function in a more efficient way: Instead of calling `std::max()` function every time in the loop, we can use an `if-else` statement to update `dp[i + 1][w]` value only when `w` is greater than or equal to `weight[i]`.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#define ll long long
#define rep(i, n) for (int(i) = (0); (i) < (n); ++(i))

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, W;
  cin >> n >> W;
  vector<int> weight(n), value(n);
  vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1, vector<int>(W+1, 0));

  rep(i, n) cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
      if (w >= weight[i]) {
        dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
      } else {
        dp[i + 1][w] = dp[i][w];
      }
    }
  }
  cout << dp[n][W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
