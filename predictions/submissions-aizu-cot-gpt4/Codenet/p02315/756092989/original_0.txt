The program you've provided is for solving a problem known as the knapsack problem using dynamic programming. Here are a few steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary macros, as they can sometimes slow down compilation time and make the code harder to read. For example, `rep`, `repp`, `debug`, `debug2`, `debug3`, `debugB`, and `line` are not used in this program.

2. The `uniqueV` macro is also not used, but it sorts the vector and removes duplicates. If this operation needs to be done frequently, it can be costly in terms of time complexity. If you don't use it, remove it. If you use it, think about whether sorting and uniqueness are necessary.

3. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes more libraries than are necessary for this program, which can slow down the compilation time. Replace it with the specific libraries that are used in the program, such as `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`, and `#include <algorithm>`.

4. The `printA` function is not used in the program. If it's not used, remove it.

5. Initialize `dp` array with 0 using memset. It's faster than a loop.

6. The line `rep(i, W + 1) dp[0][W] = 0;` is incorrect and should be `rep(i, W + 1) dp[0][i] = 0;` to initialize the first row of `dp` array.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int n, W;
int weight[110], value[110];
int dp[110][10010];

int main() {
  cin >> n >> W;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  
  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
      if (w >= weight[i]) {
        dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
      } else {
        dp[i + 1][w] = dp[i][w];
      }
    }
  }
  
  cout << dp[n][W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program is simpler and more efficient. The code is more readable, and the compilation time is reduced by removing unnecessary headers and macros. The runtime is also potentially improved by fixing an incorrect initialization of the `dp` array and initializing it with `memset`.
