First, let's break down the program and identify the potential optimization areas:

1. The given program is a solution to the knapsack problem using dynamic programming. The program is reading the number of items and the total weight the knapsack can hold. For each item, it reads the value and weight of the item.

2. The `dp` array is used to store the maximum value that can be obtained for each sub-problem. The size of the `dp` array is `(n+1)*(W+1)` which can use a significant amount of memory if `n` and `W` are large.

3. The `dp` array is filled using a nested loop which iterates `n*W` times. This can take a significant amount of time if `n` and `W` are large.

Optimization techniques:

1. Memory Optimized: We can optimize the space used by observing that the inner loop only uses the current and the previous value of `i`. So, we only need to keep track of two rows or columns at a time.

2. Time Optimized: The time complexity cannot be improved as each sub-problem needs to be solved.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, W;
  cin >> n >> W;
  vector<int> value(n), weight(n), dp(W+1, 0);
  
  for (int i=0; i<n; ++i) 
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
    
  for (int i=0; i<n; ++i) {
    for (int w=W; w>=weight[i]; --w) {
      dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w-weight[i]] + value[i]);
    }
  }
  
  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, I have changed the `dp` array into a 1D array of size `W+1`. Each element of the `dp` array is initialized to 0. The inner loop now starts from `W` and goes down to `weight[i]`. This is because we can only use the current item once, and if we started the loop from `weight[i]`, we would update `dp[w]` multiple times for the same item which is not correct. By starting from `W`, we ensure that each item is only used once.
