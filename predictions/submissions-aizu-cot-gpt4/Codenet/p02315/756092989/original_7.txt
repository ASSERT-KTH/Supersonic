The given program is a dynamic programming solution to the 0/1 Knapsack problem. It is already quite optimized in terms of algorithm complexity. However, there are a few small changes we can make to slightly reduce the memory usage and maybe increase the speed a bit.

Optimization Steps:
1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This is a convenience header file that includes quite a lot of libraries. While it's fine for competitive programming, it's not recommended in production code since it will increase the compilation time. Instead, we should only include the necessary libraries.

2. The macros `debug`, `debug2`, `debug3`, `debugB`, `line`, `printA` and some others are not used in the code, so we can remove them to clean up the code.

3. In the `main` function, we can see that the DP table `dp` is initialized as `dp[0][W] = 0;`. However, the loop is intended to initialize the whole first row of the DP table. To fix this, we should replace `W` with `i` as `dp[0][i] = 0;`.

4. The `dp` table size can be reduced to `dp[2][10010]` from `dp[110][10010]` since we are only referring to the previous item's value in our DP equation. We just need to modify our DP equation to alternate between the two rows.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_W = 10010;
int n, W;
int weight[110], value[110];
int dp[2][MAX_W];

int main() {
    cin >> n >> W;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i <= W; i++) {
        dp[0][i] = 0;
    }
  
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
            if (w >= weight[i]) {
                dp[(i + 1) % 2][w] = max(dp[i % 2][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i % 2][w]);
            } else {
                dp[(i + 1) % 2][w] = dp[i % 2][w];
            }
        }
    }
  
    cout << dp[n % 2][W] << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Remember that this optimization only reduces the memory usage but doesn't necessarily speed up the execution time notably.
