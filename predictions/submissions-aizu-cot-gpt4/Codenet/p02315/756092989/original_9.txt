The original program is a dynamic programming solution to solve the Knapsack problem. It uses a 2-dimensional dp array to keep track of the maximum value that can be achieved with a certain weight limit.

Optimization Steps:

1. In the original code, dp is a 2-dimensional array of size [110][10010]. However, because in each iteration of the outer loop we only need values from the previous iteration, we can optimize it to a 1-dimensional array.

2. As we are updating the dp array in place, we need to ensure that we don't overwrite a value before it's used. To ensure this, we need to traverse the weight in reverse order in the inner loop.

3. The debug and printA functions are not used in the code, removing them will save memory.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define vvi vector<vector<int>>
#define vec vector
#define pq priority_queue
#define all(v) (v).begin(), (v).end()
#define uniqueV(x) sort(x.begin(), x.end()); x.erase(unique(x.begin(), x.end()), x.end());
#define rep(i, n) for (int(i) = 0; (i) < (n); ++(i))
#define repp(i, m, n) for (int(i) = (m); (i) < (n); ++(i))
const int dx[] = {1, -1, 0, 0};
const int dy[] = {0, 0, -1, 1};
const double PI = 3.14159265358979323846;
int n, W;
int weight[110], value[110];
int dp[10010];
int main() {
  cin >> n >> W;
  rep(i, n) cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int w = W; w >= weight[i]; w--) {
      dp[w] = max(dp[w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[w]);
    }
  }
  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we only use a single-dimensional dp array, which significantly reduces memory usage. And also, by traversing the weights in reverse order, we don't overwrite a dp value before it's used, ensuring the correctness of the result.
