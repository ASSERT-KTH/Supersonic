The given C++ program is a basic 0-1 knapsack problem. The optimization process involves reducing its time and memory consumption. 

1. Remove unnecessary headers and macros: The '#include <bits/stdc++.h>' header includes almost all standard library headers, which increases compilation time. Including only necessary headers will save time. Also, unused macros like 'debug', 'debug2', 'debug3', etc. don't need to be there.

2. Use std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false): This line of code allows C++ to disregard the synchronization with the C standard library streams, which can speed up input and output operations.

3. Use std::cin.tie(NULL): This line of code unties cin from cout, which can also speed up input and output operations.

4. Use std::vector instead of arrays: The use of vectors instead of arrays can save memory because vectors are dynamically allocated, meaning they only use the memory they need. 

So, the optimized code will look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, W;
  cin >> n >> W;
  vector<int> weight(n), value(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  
  vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1, vector<int>(W+1, 0));
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
      if (w >= weight[i]) {
        dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
      } else {
        dp[i + 1][w] = dp[i][w];
      }
    }
  }
  cout << dp[n][W] << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Note that the actual algorithm for solving the knapsack problem was not modified because it's already efficient (dynamic programming approach). The optimizations were done on the rest of the code to make it run faster and use less memory.
