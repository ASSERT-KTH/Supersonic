Step 1: Include Specific Libraries Instead of `<bits/stdc++.h>`
The header `<bits/stdc++.h>` includes most of the standard libraries, which can slow down the compilation time significantly. It's better to include only the specific libraries that the program needs.

Step 2: Avoid using `#define`
The use of `#define` can lead to code that is hard to debug and understand. It's better to use constants, inline functions, or templates instead.

Step 3: Avoid Global Variables
Global variables can lead to code that is hard to debug and understand. It's better to pass these as arguments to functions or use them as local variables.

Step 4: Avoid Using C-style Arrays
C-style arrays can lead to various issues, such as buffer overflow. It's better to use `std::vector` instead.

Step 5: Optimizing the DP Initialization
The line `rep(i, W + 1) dp[0][W] = 0;` is incorrect because it's setting `dp[0][W]` to zero `W+1` times instead of setting the first row of `dp` to zero. This problem can be fixed by using `std::fill` or `std::fill_n`.

The optimized code looks like this:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int dx[] = {1, -1, 0, 0};
const int dy[] = {0, 0, -1, 1};
const double PI = 3.14159265358979323846;

template <typename T> void printA(vector<T> &printArray, char between = ' ') {
  int paSize = printArray.size();
  for (int i = 0; i < paSize; i++) {
    cerr << printArray[i] << between;
  }
  if (between != '\n') {
    cerr << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  int n, W;
  cin >> n >> W;
  vector<int> weight(n), value(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  
  vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1, vector<int>(W+1, 0));
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (int w = 0; w <= W; ++w) {
      if (w >= weight[i]) {
        dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
      } else {
        dp[i + 1][w] = dp[i][w];
      }
    }
  }
  cout << dp[n][W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This code avoids global variables, uses vectors instead of arrays, and correctly initializes the dp array.
