This program is implementing a 0/1 Knapsack Problem. In this case, optimization can be done by:

1. Avoiding the use of the #include <bits/stdc++.h> header, because it includes a lot of unnecessary headers which can increase compilation time. We should include only the headers that we need.

2. Instead of using an array for storing the weights and values, you can use a vector. This will eliminate the need for a predefined size, hence making it dynamic.

3. Removing unused defined macros.

4. Reducing the size of the DP array from 2D to 1D. This can be done by iterating the weight in reverse order in the DP loop. This will reduce the memory used by the DP array.

5. Removing the initialization loop for dp[0][W] and directly initializing it to 0 while defining.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, W;
  cin >> n >> W;
  
  vector<int> weight(n), value(n);
  for(int i=0; i<n; i++) cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];

  vector<int> dp(W+1, 0); // initialise all to 0
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int w = W; w >= weight[i]; w--) {
      dp[w] = max(dp[w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[w]);
    }
  }
  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the optimization changes made to the program will not affect the functionality and the output of the program.
