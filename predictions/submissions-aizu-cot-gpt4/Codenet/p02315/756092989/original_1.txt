The current program is implementing the Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. But the initialization of the dp matrix is not correct, which might lead to wrong results. 

To optimize the running time, we can also apply a bit of memory optimization by reducing the dp matrix from 2D to 1D. Here's how we can do it:

1. Initialize `dp` as a 1D vector of size `W+1`, and fill it with `0`. This saves memory as we don't need to store the entire history of the dp calculation. This is because for each item, we only care about the maximum value we can get for each possible total weight, which can be stored in a single vector.

2. In the main loop, iterate `w` from `W` to `weight[i]`. In this way, each `dp[w]` is the maximum value we can get for weight `w`, considering only the first `i` items. This avoids using outdated values.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define vvi vector<vector<int>>
#define vec vector
#define pq priority_queue
#define all(v) (v).begin(), (v).end()
#define uniqueV(x) sort(x.begin(), x.end()); x.erase(unique(x.begin(), x.end()), x.end());
#define rep(i, n) for (int(i) = (0); (i) < (n); ++(i))
#define repp(i, m, n) for (int(i) = (m); (i) < (n); ++(i))
const int dx[] = {1, -1, 0, 0};
const int dy[] = {0, 0, -1, 1};
const double PI = 3.14159265358979323846;
int n, W;
int weight[110], value[110];
int dp[10010];
int main() {
  cin >> n >> W;
  rep(i, n) cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int w = W; w >= weight[i]; w--) {
      dp[w] = max(dp[w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[w]);
    }
  }
  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimized code has removed some unnecessary debug macros which can slow down the execution time and also removed the unused `printA` function.
