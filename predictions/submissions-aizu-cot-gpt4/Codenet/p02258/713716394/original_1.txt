The program reads a number `n` from the input, and then reads `n` numbers into a vector `R`. After that, the program iterates over the vector and computes the maximum difference between a number and the minimum number seen so far. 

The main inefficiencies in the original program are:

1. The vector `R` is not necessary and consumes `n` integers of memory. We can read the numbers one by one and update `maxProfit` and `Ri` as we go.
2. The iterators `itr` and `itrE` are not necessary either. We can use a simple loop with a loop variable instead.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    int maxProfit = 1 - 1000000000;
    int Ri = 2000000000;
    int temp;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> temp;
        maxProfit = max(maxProfit, temp - Ri);
        Ri = min(Ri, temp);
    }

    cout << maxProfit << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we:

1. Remove the vector `R` and the iterators `itr` and `itrE`.
2. Introduce a temporary variable `temp` to hold the current input number.
3. Use a simple loop to read the numbers one by one.
4. Update `maxProfit` and `Ri` as we read each number.
