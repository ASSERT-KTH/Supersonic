The program is intended to find the maximum difference between two numbers in an array, where the smaller number comes before the larger number.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the iterators. They are slower than simple indexing. Iterators are useful when you need to move forward and backward, or when working with different types of collections, but in this case, it's just an overhead.
2. Instead of reading the elements into the vector in a separate loop, do this in the same loop where the maximum profit is calculated. This reduces the number of traversals from 2 to 1.
3. Initialize `maxProfit` and `Ri` after reading the first element. This reduces the number of comparisons.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> R(n);
  cin >> R[0];
  int maxProfit = 0;
  int Ri = R[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> R[i];
    if (R[i] - Ri > maxProfit) {
      maxProfit = R[i] - Ri;
    }
    if (R[i] < Ri) {
      Ri = R[i];
    }
  }
  cout << maxProfit << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the program reads `n` from the input, then reads the first number into `R[0]`. `maxProfit` is initialized to 0 and `Ri` is initialized to the first number. Then, for each remaining number, the program reads it into `R[i]`, updates `maxProfit` if the current number minus `Ri` is greater than `maxProfit`, and updates `Ri` if the current number is less than `Ri`. Finally, the program prints `maxProfit`.
