The given program is a C++ program that reads an integer `n` from input and then reads `n` integers into a vector `R`. It then calculates the maximum difference between any two numbers in the vector such that the larger number comes after the smaller number. The result is then printed.

The main issues with the current program are:

1. It uses an iterator to fill and read the vector which is unnecessary and makes the code harder to read.
2. It iterates over the vector twice which can be avoided by performing the calculations while reading the input.
3. It's using a very large initial value for `Ri` which isn't needed.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int maxProfit = INT_MIN;
  int minVal = INT_MAX;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int num;
    cin >> num;
    if (i != 0) {
      maxProfit = max(maxProfit, num - minVal);
    }
    minVal = min(minVal, num);
  }
  cout << maxProfit << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version of the program:

1. I've eliminated the use of iterators and used a simple for loop instead. This makes the code more readable.
2. The vector `R` is not needed any more as we can perform the calculations while reading the input.
3. I've also optimized the variable initialization. `maxProfit` is initialized to `INT_MIN` which is the smallest integer and `minVal` is initialized to `INT_MAX` which is the largest integer.
4. Now, the program only has one loop that reads the input and performs the calculations at the same time. This reduces the time complexity from 2n to n.
