The provided program seems to be calculating the maximum profit that can be made by buying and selling stock, where the input is an array of stock prices for different days. However, there are several points that can be optimized in this code:

1. There is no need to use iterators to traverse the vector. In modern C++, range-based for loops are more efficient and readable.

2. The `Ri` variable is initialized with an extremely large value. This is not a good practice. It would be better to initialize it with the first element of the array.

3. The input is read into the array after it's created. This means that the program will first allocate memory for the array and then fill it. It would be more efficient to read the input directly into the array as it's being created.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> R(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> R[i];
    }

    int maxProfit = INT_MIN; // it's safer to use INT_MIN which is the lowest possible integer
    int Ri = R[0]; // initialize with the first element of the array

    for (const auto& price : R) {
        maxProfit = max(maxProfit, price - Ri);
        Ri = min(Ri, price);
    }

    cout << maxProfit << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, I have used range-based for loop which makes the code cleaner and slightly faster. Also, the variables `maxProfit` and `Ri` are initialized more appropriately.
