Step 1: Reserve Space in Advance

The first optimization can be done by reserving space for the R array in advance. This can be done by replacing the static array with a vector and using the vector's reserve function. This will prevent the vector from having to reallocate space as elements are added, which can be expensive in terms of time.

Step 2: Use std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

This line of code will allow the program to run faster by decoupling the C++ standard streams from their corresponding standard C streams. This is particularly useful when the program does a lot of small I/O operations.

Step 3: Use '\n' instead of endl

Using endl forces a flush of the output buffer, which is slower than just outputting a newline character ('\n'). Unless you specifically need to flush the buffer, it's better to just use '\n'.

Step 4: Remove the use of std::min

The use of std::min in the second loop is unnecessary. We can instead use a simple if statement to update minv only when a smaller value is found.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> R;
  R.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int temp;
    cin >> temp;
    R.push_back(temp);
  }
  int maxv = R[1] - R[0];
  int minv = R[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    maxv = max(maxv, R[i] - minv);
    if (R[i] < minv)
      minv = R[i];
  }
  cout << maxv << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
