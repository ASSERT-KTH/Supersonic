This program reads an array of data and calculates the maximum difference between any two numbers in the array, where the second number comes after the first.

The program is already quite efficient, but there are a few optimizations that we can make:

1. I/O operations are time-consuming. We can speed up cin and cout by disabling synchronization with the C standard I/O functions using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`. This can give a significant performance boost.

2. If the maximum size of the array is known in advance (as it appears to be, since it's declared as MAX = 200000), we can avoid dynamic allocation of the array by declaring it as a global variable.

Here's how the optimized version of the program would look:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
static const int MAX = 200000;
int R[MAX];

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> R[i];
  int maxv = R[1] - R[0];
  int minv = R[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    maxv = max(maxv, R[i] - minv);
    minv = min(minv, R[i]);
  }
  cout << maxv << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Note: Since we moved `R` to global scope, it's initialized to zero automatically. So, we don't need to initialize `R` explicitly. This can save some execution time. This optimization is quite minimal, but it can be significant in a very large program.
