The given C/C++ program seems to be handling a card game where the 'Cards' 2D array represents different types of cards and their numbers. The first loop reads the input and marks the corresponding card as present. The second set of loops display which cards aren't present.

Here are some optimization steps we can perform:

1. Use a switch-case statement instead of if-else statements in the first loop. The switch-case statement is more efficient in this scenario because it directly jumps to the matching case, while if-else statements require sequential checks. 

2. Merge the four loops used for printing into a single loop by using a nested loop. The outer loop can iterate over the card types (S, H, C, D) and the inner loop over the card numbers. This reduces redundancy in the code and makes it more maintainable.

Let's implement these optimizations:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int Cards[4][14] = {{}};
  int i, j, n, Num;
  char Mark;

  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
    scanf(" %c", &Mark);
    scanf("%d", &Num);
    switch (Mark) {
      case 'S':
        Cards[0][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
      case 'H':
        Cards[1][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
      case 'C':
        Cards[2][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
      case 'D':
        Cards[3][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
    }
  }
  
  char Marks[4] = {'S', 'H', 'C', 'D'};
  for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < 14; j++) {
      if (Cards[i][j] != 1) {
        printf("%c %d\n", Marks[i], j + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, a space character is added before the format specifier `%c` in `scanf` to skip any whitespace characters. This is done because `scanf("%c", &Mark);` does not ignore leading whitespace characters.
