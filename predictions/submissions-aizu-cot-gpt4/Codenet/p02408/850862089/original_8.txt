Optimization Steps:

1. The scanf("%c ", &Mark) has a trailing space, which should be removed. The space will cause the program to skip whitespaces which may lead to incorrect inputs.
2. There's a redundant 'else if' chaining for the Mark variable. We can optimize this by using a switch case statement instead.
3. The four for-loops for printing can be combined into one. We can create a char array with the four different marks and use it inside a nested loop.

Optimized Program:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int Cards[4][14] = {{}};
  int i, j, n, Num;
  char Mark;
  char Marks[4] = {'S', 'H', 'C', 'D'};

  scanf("%d", &n);

  for (i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
    scanf(" %c", &Mark);  // Removed trailing space
    scanf("%d", &Num);
    switch(Mark) {  // Replaced 'else if' chaining with switch case
      case 'S':
        Cards[0][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
      case 'H':
        Cards[1][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
      case 'C':
        Cards[2][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
      case 'D':
        Cards[3][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
    }
  }

  // Combined four for-loops for printing into one
  for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    for (j = 1; j < 14; j++) {
      if (Cards[i][j - 1] != 1) {
        printf("%c %d\n", Marks[i], j);
      }
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
By doing these optimizations, we reduce redundant code, making it more readable and maintainable, and potentially speed up the execution time as switch-case statements can be faster than if-else chains in some cases. Moreover, combining the four for-loops into one reduces the code size and complexity.
