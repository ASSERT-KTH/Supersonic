The program reads an integer n and then reads n more integers. If n is zero, it breaks the loop. For each integer k read, if k is zero, it reduces the count s by one, and if k is greater than or equal to 2, it sets a flag. At the end of the loop, if the flag is set, it outputs the count s plus one, otherwise it outputs "NA". The integer t is set to zero at each iteration but never used.

Step by step optimization:

1. Remove the unused variable `t`. This reduces the memory footprint of the program.

2. The flag `flg` can be a boolean instead of an integer. This further reduces the memory footprint.

3. You can combine the conditions `if (k == 0)` and `if (k >= 2)` into one, reducing the number of condition checks in each loop iteration.

4. The variable h is declared but never used. It can be removed.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

int main(void) {
  int s = 0, n, k, i;
  bool flg;
  
  while (1) {
    flg = false;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    s = n;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &k);
      if (k == 0)
        s = s - 1;
      else if (k >= 2)
        flg = true;
    }
    if (flg)
      printf("%d\n", s + 1);
    else
      printf("NA\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
