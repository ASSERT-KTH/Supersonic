The optimization steps are as follows:

1. First, unnecessary variables are removed. The variables `h` and `t` are not used in the program and can be removed.

2. The `s` variable is only used to store the value of `n` and decrement it when `k == 0`. Instead of storing `n` in `s`, we could decrement `n` directly when `k == 0`. This eliminates the need for the `s` variable.

3. The `flg` variable is used to check if there is any number `k >= 2` in the input. However, since `flg` is only set to `1` and never reset to `0` within the loop, we can break out of the loop immediately once `k >= 2` is found. This could potentially save a lot of time for large inputs.

4. Lastly, the program is doing some unnecessary work in the case where `n == 0`. In this case, the program enters a loop where it reads `n` numbers, but since `n == 0`, no numbers are actually read. We can eliminate this unnecessary work by checking `n == 0` immediately after reading `n`, and breaking out of the loop before any further work is done.

The optimized code looks like this:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int n, k, i, flg;
  while (1) {
    flg = 0;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &k);
      if (k == 0) {
        n--;
      } else if (k >= 2) {
        flg = 1;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (flg == 1) {
      printf("%d\n", n + 1);
    } else {
      printf("NA\n");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This code does exactly the same thing as the original code, but it does so more efficiently by eliminating unnecessary variables and work, and by terminating the loop early when possible.
