Step 1: Remove unused variable: The variable 'h' and 't' are declared but not used anywhere in the program. Removing these variables will save some memory.

Step 2: Change the location of variables: The variable 'k' and 'i' are declared outside the for loop. However, they are used only within the for loop, so we can declare them inside the for loop. This will reduce the scope of these variables and keep their usage more localized, which is generally a good practice.

Step 3: Reduce variable assignment: The variable 's' is assigned the value of 'n' and then potentially decremented. We can just initialize 's' as 'n - 1', which will handle the case when 'k' is 0, removing the need for the 'if' condition check 'if (k == 0)'.

Step 4: Combine conditions: The conditions 'if (k == 0)' and 'if (k >= 2)' can be combined into a single condition 'if (k != 1)'. This will reduce the number of condition checks, which can save some time when executing the program.

The optimized code is given below:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int n, s = 0, flg;
  while (1) {
    flg = 0;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    s = n - 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int k;
      scanf("%d", &k);
      if (k != 1) {
        s--;
      }
      if (k >= 2) {
        flg = 1;
      }
    }
    if (flg == 1) {
      printf("%d\n", s + 1);
    } else {
      printf("NA\n");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This program has the same functionality as the original, but is more optimized in terms of memory usage and running time.
