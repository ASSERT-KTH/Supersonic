Here are some optimizations that we can make:

1. Remove unused variable `h`. This will save some memory.
2. Remove unused variable `t`. This will save some memory.
3. We can use `--s` instead of `s = s - 1` for decrementing `s`. It's faster because it doesn't involve the use of an assignment operator.
4. Instead of resetting `flg` and `t` to 0 at the end of each loop, we can do it at the beginning. This will allow us to remove the assignment `t = 0` at the end of the loop, which is unnecessary because `t` is not used anywhere else in the program.
5. Instead of checking `if (flg == 1)`, we can just check `if (flg)`. In C and C++, any non-zero value is considered true in a boolean context, so there's no need to explicitly compare `flg` with 1.

Here's the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int s = 0, n, k, i, flg;
  while (1) {
    flg = 0;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    s = n;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &k);
      if (k == 0) {
        --s;
      }
      if (k >= 2) {
        flg = 1;
      }
    }
    if (flg) {
      printf("%d\n", s + 1);
    } else {
      printf("NA\n");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations will make the code run slightly faster and use slightly less memory, but the difference will likely be negligible in practice. The main benefit of these optimizations is that they make the code cleaner and easier to read.
