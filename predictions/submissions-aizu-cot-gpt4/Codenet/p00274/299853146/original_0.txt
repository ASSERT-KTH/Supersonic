The program receives a series of numbers through standard input. The first number in each series, n, represents the amount of numbers following it. If n is zero, the program ends. For each series, the program calculates the number of non-zero elements and if there is an element greater than or equal to 2, it increments the count by 1. The result is then printed. If there are no elements greater or equal to 2, "NA" is printed.

The optimization would involve removing unnecessary variables and operations, and simplifying the logic where possible:

1. The variables h and t are not used in the program, so they can be removed.
2. The variable s is just a copy of n, so we can use n directly.
3. The variable flg is used to check if there's any number greater than or equal to 2. We can use a boolean type for it.
4. The decrement operation s = s - 1 can be replaced with the decrement operator --.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int n, k, i;
  bool hasTwoOrMore;
  while (1) {
    hasTwoOrMore = false;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &k);
      if (k == 0) {
        --n;
      }
      if (k >= 2) {
        hasTwoOrMore = true;
      }
    }
    if (hasTwoOrMore) {
      printf("%d\n", n + 1);
    } else {
      printf("NA\n");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
