This program reads an integer n and then reads n more integers. It decreases a count `s` each time it reads a zero, and sets a flag `flg` if it reads a number greater than or equal to 2. If the flag is set, it prints `s + 1`; otherwise, it prints "NA". It does this in a loop until it reads a zero for n.

Here are some optimizations for this code:

1. Remove unused variables: The variables `h` and `t` are declared but not used in the program, so they can be removed to reduce memory usage.

2. Move variable declaration as close as possible to its usage: To increase code readability, the variable `flg` can be declared inside the loop where it's used.

3. Combine condition in loop: Instead of having two separate if conditions inside the loop to check for `k == 0` and `k >= 2`, we can combine them into a single if-else if condition.

4. Initialize `s` with `n` inside the loop: `s` is always initialized with `n` at the start of each loop, so we can declare `s` inside the loop and initialize it with `n` at the same time.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int n, k, i;
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    int s = n;
    int flg = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &k);
      if (k == 0) {
        s = s - 1;
      } else if (k >= 2) {
        flg = 1;
      }
    }
    if (flg == 1) {
      printf("%d\n", s + 1);
    } else {
      printf("NA\n");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program should run with the same logic as the original, but uses less memory and is easier to read.
