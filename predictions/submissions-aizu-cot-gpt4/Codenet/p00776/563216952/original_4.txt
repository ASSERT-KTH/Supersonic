To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes too many libraries which increases the compilation time. We can include only the libraries that we need, reducing memory usage.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std`: It's considered bad practice as it can lead to name clashes, which can be hard to debug.

3. Avoid string copying: In the dfs function, we create a temporary string for every recursive call. This can be avoided by passing the string by reference and undoing the changes before returning from the function.

4. Avoid unnecessary sorting: We sort the vector vs regardless of its size. However, the output only needs the strings to be sorted when there are more than 10 strings in the vector.

5. Avoid using global variables: Global variables are usually considered bad practice and can be avoided. In this case, we can pass `vs` as a parameter to the `dfs` function.

6. Minimize variable scope: The variable `ans` is defined before it's needed. We can define it when we first assign to it.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for cin, cout
#include <vector> // for vector
#include <algorithm> // for sort

#define rep(i, a, n) for (int i = a; i < n; i++)

void dfs(std::string& t, int now, std::vector<std::string>& vs) {
  if (now == t.size()) {
    vs.push_back(t);
    return;
  }
  int d[26] = {};
  rep(i, 0, now) d[t[i] - 'a']++;
  char orig = t[now];
  if (t[now] != 'z' && d[t[now] + 1 - 'a'] == 0) {
    t[now] = t[now] + 1;
    dfs(t, now + 1, vs);
  }
  t[now] = orig;
  if (t[now] == 'a' || d[t[now] - 'a'] != 0)
    dfs(t, now + 1, vs);
}

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::string s;
  while (1) {
    std::cin >> s;
    if (s == "#")
      break;
    std::vector<std::string> vs;
    dfs(s, 0, vs);
    int ans = vs.size();
    if (ans > 10) {
      std::sort(vs.begin(), vs.end());
    }
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
    if (ans <= 10) {
      rep(i, 0, ans) { std::cout << vs[i] << std::endl; }
    } else {
      rep(i, 0, 5) { std::cout << vs[i] << std::endl; }
      rep(i, ans - 5, ans) { std::cout << vs[i] << std::endl; }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the code will have improved memory usage and running time due to the changes we made.
