This program seems to be generating permutations of an input string and storing those in a vector. Then it sorts the vector and prints out the size of the vector and some of the strings in the vector. 

Here are some optimization steps we can apply:

1. The array 'd' is repeatedly initialized to zero in every call to the 'dfs' function. This is not necessary and can be moved outside the function. 

2. The boolean array 'f' is declared but not used anywhere, so it can be removed. 

3. The 'tmp' string is copied from 't' which is unnecessary, we can directly modify the 't' string as strings are passed by value in C++. 

4. We can avoid creating a new string in the 'dfs' function by passing the string 't' by reference and undoing changes to 't' before recursive calls return.

5. Sorting the entire vector can be costly in terms of time complexity. If we only need to print the smallest and largest 5 elements, we can use a priority_queue to keep track of the smallest and largest 5 elements as we generate them.

Below is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define rep(i, a, n) for (int i = a; i < n; i++)
using namespace std;
string s;
priority_queue<string, vector<string>, greater<string>> smallest;
priority_queue<string> largest;
int d[26] = {};

void dfs(string &t, int now) {
  if (now == s.size()) {
    if (smallest.size() < 5) {
      smallest.push(t);
      largest.push(t);
    } else {
      if (t < smallest.top()) {
        smallest.pop();
        smallest.push(t);
      }
      if (t > largest.top()) {
        largest.pop();
        largest.push(t);
      }
    }
    return;
  }
  d[t[now] - 'a']++;
  if (t[now] != 'z' && d[t[now] + 1 - 'a'] == 0) {
    t[now] = t[now] + 1;
    dfs(t, now + 1);
    t[now] = t[now] - 1;
  }
  if (t[now] == 'a' || d[t[now] - 'a'] != 0)
    dfs(t, now + 1);
  d[t[now] - 'a']--;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  while (1) {
    cin >> s;
    if (s == "#")
      break;
    while (!smallest.empty()) smallest.pop();
    while (!largest.empty()) largest.pop();
    dfs(s, 0);
    int ans = smallest.size() + largest.size();
    cout << ans << endl;
    while (!smallest.empty()) {
      cout << smallest.top() << endl;
      smallest.pop();
    }
    while (!largest.empty()) {
      cout << largest.top() << endl;
      largest.pop();
    }
  }
}
```

Please note that the given program and the optimized version have a complexity of O(n!). This is because it generates all the permutations of the input string. This is an inherently exponential operation and cannot be significantly optimized. The modifications I have made slightly optimize the memory usage and time taken for each permutation. The overall complexity remains the same.
