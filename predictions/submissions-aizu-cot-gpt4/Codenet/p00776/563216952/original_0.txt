The given C++ code is a program that takes a string as input and then forms all possible unique substrings from that string. These substrings are stored in a vector, sorted and then a certain amount is printed out. There are two main areas where the code can be optimized to reduce memory usage and improve runtime:

1. String Copying: Given code makes unnecessary string copies in the dfs function. This can be avoided by passing the string by reference, instead of by value, which would reduce the memory usage.

2. Unnecessary Sorting: The vector of strings is sorted completely before printing. But the requirement of printing only the first 5 and last 5 strings (if the total is more than 10) means that we don't need to sort the entire vector. We can use a priority queue to keep track of the smallest and largest 5 strings, which would reduce the time complexity.

Let's optimize the code accordingly:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define rep(i, a, n) for (int i = a; i < n; i++)
using namespace std;
string s;
vector<string> vs;
bool f[26];
void dfs(string &t, int now) { // pass string by reference
  if (now == s.size()) {
    vs.push_back(t);
    return;
  }
  int d[26] = {};
  rep(i, 0, now) d[t[i] - 'a']++;
  if (t[now] != 'z' && d[t[now] + 1 - 'a'] == 0) {
    t[now] = t[now] + 1; // modify string in-place
    dfs(t, now + 1);
    t[now] = t[now] - 1; // revert the change
  }
  if (t[now] == 'a' || d[t[now] - 'a'] != 0)
    dfs(t, now + 1);
}
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  while (1) {
    cin >> s;
    if (s == "#")
      break;
    vs.clear();
    dfs(s, 0);
    int ans = vs.size();
    cout << ans << endl;
    if (ans <= 10) {
      sort(vs.begin(), vs.end());
      rep(i, 0, ans) { cout << vs[i] << endl; }
    } else {
      priority_queue<string, vector<string>, less<string>> maxHeap;
      priority_queue<string, vector<string>, greater<string>> minHeap;
      for (const auto &str : vs) {
        minHeap.push(str);
        if (minHeap.size() > 5) minHeap.pop();
        maxHeap.push(str);
        if (maxHeap.size() > 5) maxHeap.pop();
      }
      while (!minHeap.empty()) {
        cout << minHeap.top() << endl;
        minHeap.pop();
      }
      while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
        cout << maxHeap.top() << endl;
        maxHeap.pop();
      }
    }
  }
}
```
In the optimized code, we pass the string to the dfs function by reference to avoid unnecessary copying. We also maintain two heaps to keep track of the smallest and largest 5 strings, instead of sorting the entire vector. This greatly reduces the time complexity from O(n log n) to O(n log k), where n is the number of strings and k is the number of strings we need to print.
