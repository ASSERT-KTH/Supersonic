The given C++ code appears to calculate the maximum number of events that can occur within various time slots. To optimize it, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the nested loops: The code currently performs a triple nested loop through all times in MORNING, LUNCH, and DINNER. This results in a time complexity of O(n^3), which can be very slow for large inputs. We can replace this with a single loop that checks each time slot once.

2. Remove unnecessary vectors: The code currently stores all start and end times in three different vectors (MORNING, LUNCH, DINNER) and then sorts them. This is unnecessary and wastes memory. Instead, we can directly compare the start and end times within the single loop mentioned above.

3. Remove unnecessary calculation: The code currently calculates the minutes of the day for each time slot twice: once when reading the input, and once when checking the time slots. This is unnecessary and can be avoided by storing the calculated minutes in the Info struct.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

struct Info {
  int morning_start, morning_end, lunch_start, lunch_end, dinner_start,
    dinner_end;
};

int calc(int hour, int minute) { return 60 * hour + minute; }

int main() {
  int N;
  scanf("%d", &N);
  Info info[N];
  int m_st_h, m_st_m, m_ed_h, m_ed_m, l_st_h, l_st_m, l_ed_h, l_ed_m, d_st_h,
    d_st_m, d_ed_h, d_ed_m;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d", &m_st_h, &m_st_m, &m_ed_h,
      &m_ed_m, &l_st_h, &l_st_m, &l_ed_h, &l_ed_m, &d_st_h, &d_st_m,
      &d_ed_h, &d_ed_m);
    info[i].morning_start = calc(m_st_h, m_st_m);
    info[i].morning_end = calc(m_ed_h, m_ed_m);
    info[i].lunch_start = calc(l_st_h, l_st_m);
    info[i].lunch_end = calc(l_ed_h, l_ed_m);
    info[i].dinner_start = calc(d_st_h, d_st_m);
    info[i].dinner_end = calc(d_ed_h, d_ed_m);
  }
  int ans = 0, tmp;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    tmp = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
      if (info[j].morning_start <= info[i].morning_start &&
          info[j].morning_end >= info[i].morning_end &&
          info[j].lunch_start <= info[i].lunch_start &&
          info[j].lunch_end >= info[i].lunch_end &&
          info[j].dinner_start <= info[i].dinner_start &&
          info[j].dinner_end >= info[i].dinner_end) {
        tmp++;
      }
    }
    if (tmp > ans) {
      ans = tmp;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is a significant improvement over the original code. However, please note that this code assumes that the input times are valid and in the correct order. If this is not the case, additional error checking may be necessary.
