Here are the possible optimization steps:

1. Reduce unnecessary computation in the nested loops by breaking the loop as soon as a condition is met. In the part of the code where we are searching for a node that can reach all A[j] nodes, if a node is found, we can break the loop early rather than checking all nodes.

2. The vectors G and idx don't need to be resized each time they are used. Instead, they can be cleared with the clear() function.

3. The 'used' array can be initialized to false at the time of declaration. This will save some runtime.

4. The 'dp' array is quite large. If N is small, this is not an issue, but if N is large, this consumes a lot of memory. The 'dp' array is essentially a 3D array, and each value is either true or false. We could use std::bitset instead of bool array, which will use 1 bit instead of 1 byte for each boolean value.

5. #include <bits/stdc++.h> is not a standard header file and it includes quite a lot of files, which increases compilation time. It's better to include only those header files which are actually used.

Now, let's go ahead and implement these optimizations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 51;
const int MAXM = 101;
int N, M;
int A[3];
vector<int> G[MAXN];
bitset<MAXN> used = 0;
bitset<MAXM> dp[MAXM][MAXN];

int main() {
    cin >> N >> M;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        cin >> A[i];
    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
        int f, t;
        cin >> f >> t;
        f--; t--;
        G[f].push_back(t);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        dp[0][i][i] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < MAXM; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
                if (dp[i - 1][j][k]) {
                    for (int to : G[k]) {
                        dp[i][j][to] = 1;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    used[N - 1] = 1;
    for (int ite = 1;; ite++) {
        bool ok = false;
        vector<int> idx;
        idx.clear();
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (used[i])
                continue;
            int cnt = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                int a = A[j];
                for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
                    if (dp[a][i][k] && used[k]) {
                        cnt++;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (cnt == 3) {
                    ok = true;
                    idx.push_back(i);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        if (ok) {
            for (int i : idx) {
                used[i] = 1;
            }
            if (used[0]) {
                cout << ite << endl;
                return 0;
            }
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    cout << "IMPOSSIBLE" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
