The given program is a shell sort program which uses a vector G to store the interval values (gaps) and a function "insertionSort" is used to sort elements using the current gap. The function "selectionSort" generates the gaps and calls "insertionSort" for each gap. In the main function, the input is read, sorted, and the result is printed.

To optimize this code:

1. Avoid using global variables: Using global variables can lead to code that is hard to debug and understand. It's better to pass these variables as parameters to your functions.
2. Use reserve for vector: If we know the maximum size of a vector in advance, we can use the reserve function to allocate memory for the vector at once. This can reduce the time spent on memory reallocation.
3. Avoid using C-style arrays: Use vector instead of C-style arrays. Vectors are safer and more flexible.
4. Use standard algorithms: C++ STL provides a lot of standard algorithms which are usually optimized and tested. In this case, we can use "std::swap" function from STL instead of manually swapping the elements.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void insertionSort(vector<int>& a, int g, int& cnt) {
    int n = a.size();
    for (int i = g - 1; i < n; i++) {
        int j = i;
        while (j - g >= 0 && a[j - g] > a[j]) {
            swap(a[j], a[j - g]);
            j = j - g;
            cnt++;
        }
    }
}

void shellSort(vector<int>& a) {
    int n = a.size();
    vector<int> G;
    G.reserve(20); // assuming the size won't exceed 20
    int cnt = 0;

    for (int h = 1;;) {
        if (h > n)
            break;
        G.push_back(h);
        h = 3 * h + 1;
    }

    for (int i = G.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        insertionSort(a, G[i], cnt);
    }

    cout << G.size() << endl;
    for (int i = G.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (i != G.size() - 1) cout << " ";
        cout << G[i];
    }
    cout << endl;
    cout << cnt << endl;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }

    shellSort(a);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << a[i] << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program avoids global variables, reserves space for the vector, uses vectors instead of C-style arrays, and uses standard algorithms to improve the performance.
