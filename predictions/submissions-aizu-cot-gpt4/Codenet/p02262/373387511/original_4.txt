Sure, I can help with that. The main optimization opportunities in this code are:

1. Avoiding unnecessary memory allocation: The array `a` is declared as a local variable. Local variables are stored on the stack and can cause a stack overflow if the size is too large. Instead, you can allocate the memory dynamically which will be stored on the heap.

2. Reducing the number of global variables: The variable `cnt` is declared as a global variable which is not a good practice. It's better to pass it as a parameter to the functions where it is used.

3. Reducing the number of I/O operations: Instead of printing the elements of an array one by one, you can store them in a string and print the string at once. This can significantly reduce the time of execution of your program because each I/O operation takes significant time.

4. Optimizing the swap operation: Instead of using a temporary variable for swapping, we can use the standard function `std::swap` which is optimized and can provide better performance.

Here's the optimized version of your code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;

vector<int> G;

void insertionSort(int *a, int g, int n, int &cnt) {
  for (int i = g - 1; i < n; i++) {
    int j = i;
    while (j - g >= 0 && a[j - g] > a[j]) {
      swap(a[j], a[j - g]);
      j = j - g;
      cnt++;
    }
  }
}

void selectionSort(int *a, int n, int &cnt) {
  cnt = 0;
  for (int h = 1;;) {
    if (h > n)
      break;
    G.push_back(h);
    h = 3 * h + 1;
  }
  for (int i = G.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    insertionSort(a, G[i], n, cnt);
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int* a = new int[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  int cnt = 0;
  selectionSort(a, n, cnt);
  cout << G.size() << endl;
  ostringstream oss;
  for (auto it = G.rbegin(); it != G.rend(); ++it) {
    oss << *it << " ";
  }
  cout << oss.str() << endl;
  cout << cnt << endl;
  oss.str("");
  oss.clear();
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    oss << a[i] << endl;
  }
  cout << oss.str();
  delete[] a;
  return 0;
}
```
