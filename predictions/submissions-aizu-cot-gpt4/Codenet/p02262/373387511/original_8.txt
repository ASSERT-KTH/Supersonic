The given program is a C++ program that sorts an array using the Shell Sort algorithm, which is a generalized version of insertion sort. The optimization process involves the following steps:

1. **Avoid using dynamic array size in C++**: In your program, you are using a dynamic size array (int a[n];), which is not supported by standard C++. The size of an array must be a constant integral expression. Use a vector instead of an array for dynamic sizing.

2. **Reduce the amount of memory used by G vector**: G vector is used to store the gap sequence for the shell sort. The gap is calculated by 3*h+1 and stored in G. After the calculation, G is used in reverse order. We can reduce the amount of memory used by G by calculating the gap on-the-fly during the sorting process.

3. **Avoid using global variables**: cnt and G are used as global variables. It's better to avoid global variables and pass them as arguments to the functions if required.

4. **Avoid unnecessary computation**: In the insertion sort function, we are calculating j - g twice, which is not necessary. We can calculate it once, store it in a variable and use it.

Here is the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void insertionSort(vector<int>& a, int g, int& cnt) {
    int n = a.size();
    for (int i = g; i < n; i++) {
        int j = i;
        int jMinusG = j - g;
        while (jMinusG >= 0 && a[jMinusG] > a[j]) {
            swap(a[j], a[jMinusG]);
            j = jMinusG;
            jMinusG = j - g;
            cnt++;
        }
    }
}

void shellSort(vector<int>& a) {
    int n = a.size();
    int cnt = 0;
    int h = 1;
    while (h <= n) {
        insertionSort(a, h, cnt);
        h = 3 * h + 1;
    }
    cout << cnt << endl;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    shellSort(a);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << a[i] << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Note: The original program output the gap sequence (G) as well. The optimized version does not, as G was removed to save memory. If you still want to output the gap sequence, you would need to store it, which would increase the program's memory usage.
