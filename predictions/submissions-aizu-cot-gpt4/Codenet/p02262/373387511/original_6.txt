The given program is performing a Shell sort, which is a sequence of insertion sorts with reducing gaps. The gaps are stored in a vector G, and the total number of swaps is counted in cnt. The program is written in a mix of C and C++.

Here are some optimizations that can be applied to the code:

1. Avoiding global variables: Global variables are usually a bad practice, especially when they can be easily avoided. Here, the vector G and the integer cnt can be passed as arguments to the functions that need them.

2. Reducing memory consumption: The vector G is only used to store the gaps and then print them out. Instead of storing them in a vector, we can print them directly in the loop that generates them, and keep track of the size and the last element for the final output.

3. Avoiding dynamic memory allocation: The array a is allocated on the stack with a size that is determined at runtime. This is a non-standard extension of some compilers, and it may cause a stack overflow for large inputs. It would be safer to use a vector, which is allocated on the heap.

4. Reducing function calls: The insertionSort function is called for every gap, even if the gap is larger than the array size. We can add a condition to skip the call in this case.

Here is the optimized code applying the above steps:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void insertionSort(vector<int>& a, int g, int& cnt) {
  int n = a.size();
  for (int i = g; i < n; i++) {
    int v = a[i];
    int j = i - g;
    while (j >= 0 && a[j] > v) {
      a[j + g] = a[j];
      j = j - g;
      cnt++;
    }
    a[j + g] = v;
  }
}

void shellSort(vector<int>& a) {
  int cnt = 0;
  int h = 1, size = 0, last;
  while (h <= a.size()) {
    if (size > 0) cout << " ";
    cout << h;
    last = h;
    h = 3 * h + 1;
    size++;
  }
  cout << endl;
  for (h = last; h > 0; h = (h - 1) / 3) {
    if (h < a.size()) insertionSort(a, h, cnt);
  }
  cout << size << endl << cnt << endl;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  shellSort(a);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << a[i] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In addition to the above, code readability and maintainability could be improved by using more descriptive variable names and adding comments to explain the algorithm. However, these changes would not affect the running time or memory usage.
