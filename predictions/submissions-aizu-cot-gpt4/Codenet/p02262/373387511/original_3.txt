Optimization Steps:

1. One of the key areas to optimize is the insertionSort function. The swapping operation within the while loop can be improved. Instead of swapping elements one by one, we can find the correct place for the 'a[j]' and place it there directly after the loop.

2. We can also optimize the selectionSort function. Instead of using a vector 'G' to store values of 'h', we can use a stack. This is because we're pushing values into 'G' and then using them in reverse order, which is exactly what a stack is designed for. This will reduce the overhead of dealing with a vector.

3. Moreover, we can reduce the number of calls to G.size() by storing it in a variable. Any function call in C++ has some overhead, so calling it once and storing the result is faster than calling it multiple times.

4. The array 'a' in the main function is created with a dynamic size which is not recommended because it may lead to undefined behavior.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;
int cnt;
stack<int> G;
void insertionSort(int *a, int g, int n) {
  for (int i = g; i < n; i++) {
    int v = a[i];
    int j = i - g;
    while (j >= 0 && a[j] > v) {
      a[j + g] = a[j];
      j = j - g;
      cnt++;
    }
    a[j + g] = v;
  }
}
void selectionSort(int *a, int n) {
  cnt = 0;
  for (int h = 1;;) {
    if (h > n)
      break;
    G.push(h);
    h = 3 * h + 1;
  }
  while (!G.empty()) {
    insertionSort(a, G.top(), n);
    G.pop();
  }
}
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  selectionSort(a.data(), n);
  cout << G.size() << endl;
  while (!G.empty()) {
    cout << G.top() << " ";
    G.pop();
  }
  cout << endl;
  cout << cnt << endl;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << a[i] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This program should run faster and use less memory than the original version.
