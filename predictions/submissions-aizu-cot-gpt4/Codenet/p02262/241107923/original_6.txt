This program implements the Shell Sort algorithm, which is a generalization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart. The algorithm sorts pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared. The gap sequence used in this implementation is `3*h[i] + 1`.

Here are the optimizations we can make:

1) Remove the global variables and pass them as arguments to the functions where they are needed. Global variables can lead to issues with re-entrancy and concurrency, and they can also increase memory usage when not necessary.

2) In the `ShellSort` function, there is no need to continue the loop up to 20 to calculate the gap sequence. We can stop the loop when `h[i] > num`.

3) In the `main` function, we can use `printf("%d ", h[i])` in all cases, and then print a newline character after the loop. This removes the need for the ternary operator inside the loop.

4) Remove the `temp_temp` variable and use `temp` directly.

5) The `insertionSort` function is called with the address of `h[i]`. There is no need to pass the address; we can pass the value directly.

Let's apply these optimizations:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void insertionSort(int *, int, int, int*);
void ShellSort(int, int *, int*, int*);

int main(void) {
  int num, *arr, i, j;
  int h[20];
  int count = 0;
  int temp = 0;

  scanf("%d", &num);
  arr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * num);
  for (i = 0; i < num; i++)
    scanf("%d", &arr[i]);

  ShellSort(num, arr, h, &temp);

  printf("%d\n", temp + 1);
  for (i = temp; i != -1; i--)
    printf("%d ", h[i]);
  printf("\n%d\n", count);

  for (i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", arr[i]);
  }
  return 0;
}

void ShellSort(int num, int *arr, int *h, int *temp) {
  int i, j, n, m;
  h[0] = 1;
  for (i = 0; h[i] < num; i++) {
    h[i + 1] = 3 * h[i] + 1;
  }
  *temp = i - 1;
  for (i = *temp; i != -1; i--) {
    insertionSort(arr, num, h[i], temp);
  }
}

void insertionSort(int *arr, int num, int h, int *count) {
  int i, j, v;
  for (i = h; i < num; i++) {
    v = arr[i];
    j = i - h;
    while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > v) {
      arr[j + h] = arr[j];
      j = j - h;
      (*count)++;
    }
    arr[j + h] = v;
  }
}
```
This version of the program is more memory efficient due to the removal of global variables, and should also run slightly faster due to the optimized gap sequence calculation. However, the main algorithmic complexity of Shell Sort remains the same.
