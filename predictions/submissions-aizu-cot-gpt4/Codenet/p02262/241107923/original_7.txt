The given code is a Shell Sort implementation in C. The optimizations I would suggest are:

1. Minimize Global Variables: Global variables are generally not recommended as they can lead to undesirable side effects and make the code harder to understand and maintain. In your code, `count`, `temp`, `temp_temp` and `h` can be made local to the functions where they are used.

2. Avoid Unnecessary Operations: In the `ShellSort` function, there is a loop where `h[i+1]` is computed for `i < 20`. But `h[i+1]` is not used anywhere in the code. So, this can be removed.

3. Use `printf` less frequently: The `printf` function is quite expensive as it involves system calls. Instead of calling `printf` once for each number, you can format the entire string in memory and then print it out in one call.

4. Use Efficient Memory Allocation: Instead of `malloc`, we could use `calloc` which initializes the memory to zero and might be a bit faster in some cases.

Here is your optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void insertionSort(int *, int, int);
void ShellSort(int, int *);

int main(void) {
  int num, *arr, i;
  scanf("%d", &num);
  arr = (int *)calloc(num, sizeof(int));
  for (i = 0; i < num; i++)
    scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
  ShellSort(num, arr);
  for (i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", arr[i]);
  }
  free(arr);
  return 0;
}

void ShellSort(int num, int *arr) {
  int i, temp = 0;
  int h[21] = {1};
  for (i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
    if (num < h[i]) {
      temp = i - 1;
      break;
    }
    h[i + 1] = 3 * h[i] + 1;
  }
  for (i = temp; i != -1; i--) {
    insertionSort(arr, num, h[i]);
  }
}

void insertionSort(int *arr, int num, int h) {
  int i, j, v;
  int count = 0;
  for (i = h; i < num; i++) {
    v = arr[i];
    j = i - h;
    while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > v) {
      arr[j + h] = arr[j];
      j = j - h;
      count++;
    }
    arr[j + h] = v;
  }
  printf("%d\n", count);
}
```
