Let's go through the code:

1. The `ShellSort` function is calculating the sequence `h[i + 1] = 3 * h[i] + 1` up to `i = 20`. However, it seems that `h[i]` is used only where `i` is less than `num`. We can calculate `h[i]` values inside a while loop until they are less than `num`, which can reduce unnecessary computation and memory usage.

2. The `insertionSort` function is called with `&h[i]`. You can pass `h[i]` directly because you don't modify it inside `insertionSort`.

3. The `count` variable is a global one and is increased inside the `insertionSort` function. You can pass it as a pointer to `insertionSort` and increase it locally, which can make your code more thread-safe.

4. The `temp_temp` variable seems to be used only to store the final value of `temp`. You can print `temp + 1` directly.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void insertionSort(int *, int, int, int *);
void ShellSort(int, int *);

int main(void) {
  int num, *arr, i, j, count = 0;
  scanf("%d", &num);
  arr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * num);
  for (i = 0; i < num; i++)
    scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
  ShellSort(num, arr, &count);
  printf("%d\n", count);
  for (i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", arr[i]);
  }
  return 0;
}

void ShellSort(int num, int *arr, int *count) {
  int i, temp = 0, h = 1;
  while (h < num) {
    h = 3 * h + 1;
  }
  for (i = h; i > 0; i /= 3) {
    insertionSort(arr, num, i, count);
  }
}

void insertionSort(int *arr, int num, int h, int *count) {
  int i, j, v;
  for (i = h; i < num; i++) {
    v = arr[i];
    j = i - h;
    while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > v) {
      arr[j + h] = arr[j];
      j = j - h;
      (*count)++;
    }
    arr[j + h] = v;
  }
}
```
This code is more efficient in terms of both running time and memory usage. It avoids unnecessary computation and memory allocation, and it passes all variables locally, making the code more thread-safe.
