The optimization of this program involves several steps:

1. Use of `scanf` and `printf`: `scanf` and `printf` are slower compared to `cin` and `cout`. This is due to the fact that `scanf` and `printf` have to parse the format string which adds extra overhead. However, in this case, replacing `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` may not be practical as the program heavily relies on the format string parsing of `scanf`. Therefore, we can use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams which can slightly speed up `cin` and `cout`. However, after this statement, we must not mix `cin/cout` and `scanf/printf`.

2. Use of `std::vector` instead of array for `dl`: `std::vector` allows for dynamic resizing, which could potentially save memory if `dl` does not need to be its maximum size all the time. 

3. Avoiding recalculations: Calculations that are repeated multiple times in the program can be stored in variables to avoid recalculating them. For example, `ls1.ztt / ddd[ls1.lwz] % 10` is calculated twice in the BFS function. We can store the result in a variable the first time it's calculated and then reuse that variable.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

          lsjr.step = ls1.step + 1;
          sb(lsjr.ztt);
          dl[back] = lsjr;
          back++;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  while (1) {
    if (!(cin >> bj[0])) {
      return 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {

Please note that this optimization process does not guarantee any significant speedup since the efficiency of a program depends on many factors, including the algorithm it uses and the input it processes. This process just helps to produce a more efficient version of the program by eliminating some unnecessary calculations and using more efficient data structures and library functions.
