The provided code is a bit complex and the variable names are not self-explanatory, which makes it hard to understand its purpose. The code appears to implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, but without a clear context, it's hard to determine what it's specifically doing.

However, based on the code, here are some general optimization steps:

1. Minimize the use of global variables: Global variables consume memory for the entire duration of the program, so minimizing their use can reduce memory consumption. For example, the 'bs', 'front', 'back', and 'tt' variables appear to only be used within the 'bfs' function, so they could be made local to that function.

2. Avoid unnecessary operations: For instance, in the 'bfs' function, the code calculates 'ls1.ztt / ddd[ls1.lwz] % 10' twice for different variables 'a' and 'b'. The result of this operation could be stored in a temporary variable to avoid the second calculation.

3. Use '++' and '--' operators for incrementing and decrementing variables: These are faster than using '+=' and '-='.

Remember that the compiler will also do its own optimizations, so not all of these may result in noticeable improvements, but they can help make the code cleaner and more efficient.

Here's an optimized version of the code:

```C++
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <functional>
#include <set>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

char zzzt[8] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
char bj[8];
char vis[80000000 / 8];

#define ck(x) (vis[(x) >> 3] & (1 << ((x)&7)))
#define sb(x) (vis[(x) >> 3] |= (1 << ((x)&7)))
#define cb(x) (vis[(x) >> 3] &= ~(1 << ((x)&7)))

struct pt {
  int ztt;
  int lwz;
  int step;
};

pt dl[1 << 16];
int ddd[8] = {10000000, 1000000, 100000, 10000, 1000, 100, 10, 1};

void bfs() {
  int tt = 0;
  int front = 1;
  int back = 1;
  int bs = 0;
  memset(vis, 0, sizeof(vis));
  int cs = atoi(bj);
  sb(cs);
  pt lsss;
  lsss.ztt = cs;
  lsss.lwz = strchr(bj, '0') - bj;
  lsss.step = 0;
  dl[back] = lsss;
  back++;
  while (front < back) {
    pt ls1 = dl[front++];
    if (ls1.ztt == 1234567) {
      bs = ls1.step;
      tt = 1;
      return;
    }
    pt lsjr;
    int kkk[4] = {-1, 1, -4, 4};
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      lsjr.lwz = ls1.lwz + kkk[i];
      if ((ls1.lwz == 3 && lsjr.lwz == 4) || (ls1.lwz == 4 && lsjr.lwz == 3))
        continue;
      if (lsjr.lwz >= 0 && lsjr.lwz <= 7) {
        int a, b;
        a = ls1.ztt / ddd[ls1.lwz] % 10;
        b = ls1.ztt / ddd[lsjr.lwz] % 10;
        lsjr.ztt = ls1.ztt + (b - a) * ddd[ls1.lwz] + (a - b) * ddd[lsjr.lwz];
        if (!ck(lsjr.ztt)) {
          lsjr.step = ls1.step + 1;
          sb(lsjr.ztt);
          dl[back++] = lsjr;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    if (scanf("%c", &bj[0]) == EOF) {
      return 0;
    }
    scanf("%*c");
    for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
      scanf("%c%*c", &bj[i]);
    }
    scanf("%c", &bj[7]);
    bfs();
    if (tt) {
      printf("%d\n", bs);
    } else {
      printf("-1\n");
    }
    while (getchar() != '\n')
      ;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimization is based on an assumption that the context of the code is not specific and the code is correct. However, without a clear context and understanding of what the code is supposed to do, it's hard to provide a more precise optimization.
