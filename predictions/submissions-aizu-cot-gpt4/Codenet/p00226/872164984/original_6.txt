Looking at the given program, it seems to be a C program that implements a kind of counter. It reads a character from standard input, uses it to adjust two counters (h and b), and prints the counters every 10 characters. However, there are several areas of the program that could be optimized for clarity, efficiency, and correctness.

Here's an explanation of the optimizations step by step:

1. Global variables: The global variables i, h, b are used without any initial value. This might cause undefined behavior. We should initialize them to zero.
2. The function main: The entry point of the program should be int main(void) or int main(int argc, char *argv[]). The current definition isn't standard. We should use a standard definition.
3. The read function: The read function is a Unix system call, which is less portable and less efficient than using standard C functions. We should replace it with getchar().
4. The memset function: The memset function is used to fill the array R with a value calculated from the printf function. This is inefficient and confusing. We should replace the memset function with a simple assignment statement.
5. The variable c: The variable c is used both as a function argument and as a local variable. To improve the readability of the code, we should use a different variable for the character input.

Here's the optimized program:

```C++
#include <stdio.h>

int R[99] = {0};
int i = 0, h = 0, b = 0;

int main(void) {
    int c;
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
        b += !!R[c];
        h += !(R[c] ^= 1 << i % 5);
        if (++i > 9) {
            printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h);
            for(int j=0; j<99; j++)
                R[j] = 0;
            i = h = b = 0;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
