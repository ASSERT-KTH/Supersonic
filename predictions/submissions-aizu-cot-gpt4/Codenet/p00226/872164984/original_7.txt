This is a bit of a tricky one because the code is written in a quite condensed and obfuscated way, so it's hard to understand what it's doing and therefore hard to optimize it. However, there are a few things that can be done to improve the performance:

1. The `read` function is called with a size of 1, which means it reads one byte at a time from the input. This is inefficient because system calls like `read` are expensive. It would be better to read larger chunks of data at once and then process each byte in a loop.

2. The `memset` function is called inside the loop condition. This means it is called for every iteration of the loop, even if it's not necessary. The `memset` function is relatively expensive because it has to set a large number of bytes to a specific value. It would be better to call `memset` only when necessary.

3. The `printf` function is also called inside the loop condition. This means it is called for every iteration of the loop, even if it's not necessary. Like `read` and `memset`, `printf` is also an expensive function because it involves formatting the output and writing it to the standard output. It would be better to call `printf` only when necessary.

So, here's the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define BUF_SIZE 4096

char R[99];
int i, h, b;
char buf[BUF_SIZE];
int c;

int main() {
  int n, j;
  while ((n = read(0, buf, BUF_SIZE)) > 0) {
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
      c = buf[j];
      b += !!R[c], h += !(R[c] ^= 1 << i % 5);
      if (++i > 9) {
        printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h);
        memset(R, i = h = b = 0, 232);
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

First, I included the necessary header files. Then I defined a buffer size `BUF_SIZE` that is quite large (4096 bytes) to minimize the number of `read` calls. I read from the input into a buffer `buf` of size `BUF_SIZE`, and then I process each byte in the buffer in a loop. The `printf` and `memset` calls are moved inside the loop, but they are only executed when `i > 9`. This should make the program faster and use less memory. Note that I also added a return value to the `main` function to make it more standard-compliant.
