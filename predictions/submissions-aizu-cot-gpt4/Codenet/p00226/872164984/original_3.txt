The provided code seems to perform some sort of frequency calculation over the input. It's written in an obfuscated way, which makes it hard to understand and optimize. This code is not well-structured, and it's hard to read and understand, but based on my experience as a C++ developer, I can point out some general optimization guidelines:

1. Avoid using global variables: Global variables are stored in heap memory, which is slower to access compared to stack memory. If a variable is used only in a function, it's better to declare it inside the function.

2. Use data types of appropriate size: If you know the maximum size of a value a variable can take, choose the data type accordingly. For example, if a variable will never be greater than 255, you can use 'unsigned char' instead of 'int'.

3. Avoid using bitwise operations when not necessary: Bitwise operations can make code harder to understand and debug.

4. Avoid calling functions in conditions of loops: The condition of a loop is checked every iteration. If you call a function there, it will be called every time, which can be a major slowdown.

5. Avoid performing computations inside the arguments of functions: This can make code harder to understand and debug.

6. Use appropriate data structures: The use of arrays in this code is not clear, but in general, using the right data structure can greatly improve performance.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

void calculate_frequency() {
    char R[99] = {0};
    int i = 0, h = 0, b = 0;
    char c;
    while (read(0, &c, 1)) {
        int temp = !!R[c];
        b += temp;
        R[c] ^= 1 << i % 5;
        h += !temp;
        if (++i > 9) {
            printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h);
            memset(R, 0, sizeof(R));
            i = h = b = 0;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    calculate_frequency();
    return 0;
}
```

The code is now more structured and readable, which makes it easier to understand and debug. Each variable is declared in the function where it's used, and their purpose is more clear. The loop condition and the inner computation are separated, which improves performance and readability. The array 'R' is reset not by a hardcoded value but by 'sizeof(R)', which is more robust and understandable. The computations inside the printf function are moved out of it, which makes the code easier to understand and debug.
