The code you've given is already optimized in terms of logic and algorithm use. However, we can make some minor tweaks to make it more readable and efficient. Here are some optimizations that can be done:

1. Removing the use of dynamic memory allocation. Dynamic memory allocation is costly in terms of time. If the value of `L` is not extraordinarily large, it's better to use an array of fixed size. This will reduce the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, and will prevent potential memory leak as there is no `delete` to free the memory allocated by `new`.

2. Instead of pushing back elements to `XY[0]` and `XY[1]`, we can reserve memory for them in advance, reducing the cost of dynamic memory reallocation.

3. The `max` variable can be initialized to `-1` instead of `0`. This way, the first comparison `max < temp` will always be true, removing the need to reset `max` to `0` in each outer loop.

4. Instead of using `scanf` and `printf`, we can use `cin` and `cout` for I/O operations which are more C++ style and safer.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  long long sum = 0LL, osum = 0LL;
  long long f1, f2, f3, w, h, L, HL, temp, oxy[2][2], LXY[2][1000], ox, oy, max = -1, dx, dy;
  vector<long long> XY[2];
  
  cin >> w >> h;
  cin >> L;
  
  XY[0].reserve(L);
  XY[1].reserve(L);
  
  for (f1 = 0; f1 < L; f1++) {
    cin >> LXY[0][f1] >> LXY[1][f1];
    XY[0].push_back(LXY[0][f1]);
    XY[1].push_back(LXY[1][f1]);
  }
  
  stable_sort(XY[0].begin(), XY[0].end());
  stable_sort(XY[1].begin(), XY[1].end());
  
  HL = (L + 1) / 2;
  
  if (L == 1) {
    cout << "0\n";
    cout << LXY[0][0] << " " << LXY[1][0] << "\n";
  } else {
    for (f1 = 0; f1 < 2; f1++) {
      oxy[0][f1] = XY[f1][HL - 1];
      oxy[1][f1] = XY[f1][HL];
    }
    
    dx = (oxy[0][0] == oxy[1][0]) ? 1 : 2;
    dy = (oxy[0][1] == oxy[1][1]) ? 1 : 2;
    
    for (f2 = 0; f2 < dx; f2++) {
      for (f3 = 0; f3 < dy; f3++) {
        sum = 0LL;
        for (f1 = 0; f1 < L; f1++) {
          temp = abs(LXY[0][f1] - oxy[f2][0]) + abs(LXY[1][f1] - oxy[f3][1]);
          sum += temp;
          if (max < temp)
            max = temp;
        }
        sum *= 2;
        sum -= max;
        if (osum == 0 || osum > sum) {
          osum = sum;
          ox = oxy[f2][0];
          oy = oxy[f3][1];
        }
      }
    }
    
    cout << osum << "\n";
    cout << ox << " " << oy << "\n";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
