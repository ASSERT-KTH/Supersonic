Optimization can be done in the following steps:

1. The use of dynamic memory allocation (`new`) for `LXY` is not necessary and can be replaced with a static array. This will reduce the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. In addition, this will reduce the chance of memory leaks if the program doesn't properly free the dynamic memory.

2. The `vector` class in C++ is a dynamic array, which means it can resize itself when needed, but this comes with a cost of time and memory. In this case, we know the size of the array when it's declared (`L`), so we can use a static array instead of `vector` for `XY`.

3. We can reduce the number of iterations in the nested for loop by calculating `dx` and `dy` in a different way. We can set `dx` as the difference between `oxy[0][0]` and `oxy[1][0]` and `dy` as the difference between `oxy[0][1]` and `oxy[1][1]`. This will reduce the number of operations in the loop.

4. The `std::stable_sort` function has a time complexity of O(n log n), but since the size of the array is already known, we can use a sorting algorithm with a better time complexity, such as `std::sort`, which has an average time complexity of O(n log n) but is generally faster than `std::stable_sort`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  long long sum = 0LL, osum = 0LL;
  long long f1, f2, f3, w, h, L, HL, temp, oxy[2][2], ox, oy, max = 0, dx, dy;
  long long LXY[2][1000], XY[2][1000];
  
  scanf("%lld %lld", &w, &h);
  scanf("%lld", &L);
  
  for (f1 = 0; f1 < L; f1++) {
    scanf("%lld %lld", &LXY[0][f1], &LXY[1][f1]);
    XY[0][f1] = LXY[0][f1];
    XY[1][f1] = LXY[1][f1];
  }
  
  sort(XY[0], XY[0] + L);
  sort(XY[1], XY[1] + L);
  
  HL = (L + 1) / 2;
  
  if (L == 1) {
    printf("0\n");
    printf("%lld %lld\n", LXY[0][0], LXY[1][0]);
  } else {
    for (f1 = 0; f1 < 2; f1++) {
      oxy[0][f1] = XY[f1][HL - 1];
      oxy[1][f1] = XY[f1][HL];
    }
    
    dx = abs(oxy[0][0] - oxy[1][0]) + 1;
    dy = abs(oxy[0][1] - oxy[1][1]) + 1;
    
    for (f2 = 0; f2 < dx; f2++) {
      for (f3 = 0; f3 < dy; f3++) {
        sum = 0LL;
        max = 0LL;
        for (f1 = 0; f1 < L; f1++) {
          temp = (long long)abs(LXY[0][f1] - oxy[f2][0]) +
                 abs(LXY[1][f1] - oxy[f3][1]);
          sum += temp;
          if (max < temp)
            max = temp;
        }
        sum *= 2;
        sum -= max;
        if (osum == 0 || osum > sum) {
          osum = sum;
          ox = oxy[f2][0];
          oy = oxy[f3][1];
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%lld\n", osum);
    printf("%lld %lld\n", ox, oy);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that this optimized code assumes that the value of `L` does not exceed 1000. If `L` could be larger than 1000, you should consider using dynamic memory allocation but ensure to deallocate after use to prevent memory leaks.
