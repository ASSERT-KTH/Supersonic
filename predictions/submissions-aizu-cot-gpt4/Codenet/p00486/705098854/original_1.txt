Here are the steps to optimize the given C/C++ program:

1. Remove the redundant `#include <cstdio>` and `#include <iostream>`. In this case, `#include <cstdio>` is redundant because it's only used for `printf` and `scanf` functions, which can be replaced with `cout` and `cin` from `<iostream>`. Removing unused includes reduces the compilation time.

2. Use `std::array` in place of raw arrays. This is because `std::array` has the same performance as an array but with more safety because it includes bounds checking.

3. Avoid dynamic memory allocation with `new`. In this case, `LXY[f1] = new long long[L];` is not needed. Dynamic memory allocation is expensive in terms of performance and can lead to memory leaks if not properly managed.

4. Use `std::array` instead of `std::vector` for small, fixed-size arrays. Vectors are heap-allocated and have overhead for resizing.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  long long sum = 0LL, osum = 0LL;
  long long f1, f2, f3, w, h, L, HL, temp, max = 0LL, dx, dy;
  array<long long, 2> ox, oy, oxy[2];
  array<vector<long long>, 2> XY;
  array<array<long long, 2>, 2> LXY;

  cin >> w >> h;
  cin >> L;

  for (f1 = 0; f1 < L; f1++) {
    cin >> LXY[0][f1] >> LXY[1][f1];
    XY[0].push_back(LXY[0][f1]);
    XY[1].push_back(LXY[1][f1]);
  }

  stable_sort(XY[0].begin(), XY[0].end());
  stable_sort(XY[1].begin(), XY[1].end());
  
  HL = (L + 1) / 2;

  if (L == 1) {
    cout << "0\n" << LXY[0][0] << " " << LXY[1][0] << "\n";
  } else {
    for (f1 = 0; f1 < 2; f1++) {
      oxy[0][f1] = XY[f1][HL - 1];
      oxy[1][f1] = XY[f1][HL];
    }
    dx = (oxy[0][0] == oxy[1][0]) ? 1 : 2;
    dy = (oxy[0][1] == oxy[1][1]) ? 1 : 2;
    for (f2 = 0; f2 < dx; f2++) {
      for (f3 = 0; f3 < dy; f3++) {
        sum = 0LL;
        max = 0LL;
        for (f1 = 0; f1 < L; f1++) {
          temp = abs(LXY[0][f1] - oxy[f2][0]) + abs(LXY[1][f1] - oxy[f3][1]);
          sum += temp;
          if (max < temp)
            max = temp;
        }
        sum *= 2;
        sum -= max;
        if (osum == 0 || osum > sum) {
          osum = sum;
          ox = oxy[f2];
          oy = oxy[f3];
        }
      }
    }
    cout << osum << "\n" << ox[0] << " " << oy[1] << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the main part of the code logic is untouched, meaning the optimization is mainly focused on memory management and runtime efficiency.
