Step 1: Avoid using dynamic allocation

The LXY array is dynamically allocated. This can be avoided by declaring the array with a maximum size instead. This will improve speed because dynamic allocation is slower than static allocation. Also, it will reduce memory usage because no extra memory is needed to store the dynamic array's size and other information.

Step 2: Initialize variables when they are declared

The variables sum and max are assigned to 0LL inside a loop. It's more efficient to initialize them at the point of declaration. This makes the code simpler and easier to read.

Step 3: Avoid using std::vector when not necessary

The XY array is a vector, which is dynamically sized. However, the size of this array is known in advance (it's the same as the size of LXY), so it can be replaced with a regular array. This will improve speed because dynamic size adjustments are not needed. Also, it will reduce memory usage because no extra memory is needed to store the vector's size and other information.

Step 4: Remove unnecesary condition checks

There is a condition check for L == 1 to print "0\n" and the values of LXY[0][0] and LXY[1][0]. The rest of the code can handle this case correctly without the need for a special case, so this check can be removed.

Optimized Program:

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cmath>
#define MAXL 100000
using namespace std;
int main() {
  long long sum = 0LL, osum = 0LL, max = 0LL;
  long long f1, f2, f3, w, h, L, HL, temp, oxy[2][2], LXY[2][MAXL], ox, oy, dx, dy;
  scanf("%lld %lld", &w, &h);
  scanf("%lld", &L);
  for (f1 = 0; f1 < L; f1++)
    scanf("%lld %lld", &LXY[0][f1], &LXY[1][f1]);
  sort(LXY[0], LXY[0] + L);
  sort(LXY[1], LXY[1] + L);
  HL = (L + 1) / 2;
  for (f1 = 0; f1 < 2; f1++) {
    oxy[0][f1] = LXY[f1][HL - 1];
    oxy[1][f1] = LXY[f1][HL];
  }
  dx = (oxy[0][0] == oxy[1][0]) ? 1 : 2;
  dy = (oxy[0][1] == oxy[1][1]) ? 1 : 2;
  for (f2 = 0; f2 < dx; f2++) {
    for (f3 = 0; f3 < dy; f3++) {
      sum = max = 0LL;
      for (f1 = 0; f1 < L; f1++) {
        temp = abs(LXY[0][f1] - oxy[f2][0]) + abs(LXY[1][f1] - oxy[f3][1]);
        sum += temp;
        if (max < temp) max = temp;
      }
      sum = 2 * sum - max;
      if (osum == 0 || osum > sum) {
        osum = sum;
        ox = oxy[f2][0];
        oy = oxy[f3][1];
      }
    }
  }
  printf("%lld\n", osum);
  printf("%lld %lld\n", ox, oy);
  return 0;
}
