The given code is already well-optimized in terms of time and space complexity. However, there are few points where it can be improved for better readability and efficiency. Here they are:

1. Use of `std::map::emplace`: Instead of using `std::map::operator[]` which performs a search operation twice (once for checking and once for insertion), use `std::map::emplace` which performs the search operation only once.

2. Use of `std::unordered_map`: If the order of elements in the map doesn't matter, `std::unordered_map` can be used instead of `std::map`. It provides an average complexity of O(1) for search, insert, and delete operations compared to O(log n) in `std::map`.

3. Use of `std::array` instead of a C-style array: `std::array` is a container that encapsulates fixed size arrays and does not decay to a pointer when passed to a function. It also provides useful functions like `fill`, `swap`, etc.

4. Use of `constexpr`: `constexpr` specifies that the value of an object or a function can appear in constant expressions. It can be used for variables like `V_MAX`, `CAPA_INF`, and `COST_INF`.

5. Use of `reserve` method for vectors: If you know the size of a vector beforehand, you can use the `reserve` method to avoid unnecessary reallocations.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <queue>
#include <array>
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (n); i++)
using namespace std;
constexpr int V_MAX = 6000;
constexpr int CAPA_INF = 1 << 29;
constexpr int COST_INF = 1 << 29;
template <class T, class U> struct edge {
  int v, rev;
  T capa;
  U cost;
  T flow;
};
template <class T, class U>
void add_directed_edge(vector<edge<T, U>> *G, int u, int v, T capa, U cost) {
  G[u].push_back((edge<T, U>){v, G[v].size(), capa, cost, 0});
  G[v].push_back((edge<T, U>){u, G[u].size() - 1, 0, -cost, 0});
}
// ... rest of the code ...
int main() {
  for (int n; scanf("%d", &n), n;) {
    vector<train> T[99];
    rep(i, n - 1) {
      int m;
      scanf("%d", &m);
      T[i].reserve(m);
      rep(j, m) scanf("%d%d%d", &T[i][j].t1, &T[i][j].t2, &T[i][j].cost);
    }
    // ... rest of the code ...
    unordered_map<int, int> f[100][2];
    unordered_map<int, int>::iterator it, jt;
    rep(i, n - 1) rep(j, T[i].size()) {
      int t1 = T[i][j].t1, t2 = T[i][j].t2;
      f[i][0].emplace(t1, V++);
      f[i + 1][0].emplace(t2, V++);
      f[i + 1][1].emplace(t2, V++);
    }
    // ... rest of the code ...
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The time and space complexity of the program remains the same after the optimizations. The optimizations primarily improve the performance by reducing unnecessary operations and making better use of data structures and C++ features.
