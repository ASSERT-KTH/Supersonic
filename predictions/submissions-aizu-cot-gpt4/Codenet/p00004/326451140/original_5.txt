The program consists of a main function calling a matrix function which performs Gauss-Jordan elimination on a 2x3 matrix. The main function reads the matrix from the console, performs the elimination, and prints the result. The matrix function itself can be optimized by removing redundant calculations and optimizing the loops.

Here are the steps to optimize this program:

1. In the initial program, the double variables su1 and su2 are recalculated in each iteration of the loop in the matrix function. To avoid this, we can calculate these variables only once before the loops start.
2. The division operation is more expensive than multiplication in terms of CPU cycles. So, instead of dividing by su1 in each iteration, we can calculate its reciprocal once and use multiplication instead.
3. The limit of the loop i can be replaced with the macro N+1, which is more meaningful and understandable.
4. The use of pointer array y[] seems unnecessary as it simply points to the elements of array x[]. We can directly pass x to the matrix function.

Here is the optimized code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#define N 2
int matrix(double x[N][N+1]);

int main(void) {
  double x[N][N + 1];
  int i;
  char str[100];
  while (fgets(str, sizeof(str), stdin) != NULL) {
    sscanf(str, "%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &x[0][0], &x[0][1], &x[0][2],
           &x[1][0], &x[1][1], &x[1][2]);
    matrix(x);
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      if (i)
        printf(" ");
      printf("%3.3f", x[i][N]);
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
  return 0;
}

int matrix(double x[N][N+1]) {
  int i, j, k;
  double su1, su2;
  for (k = 0; k <= N - 2; k++) {
    su1 = 1.0 / x[k][k];
    for (j = k + 1; j <= N - 1; j++) {
      su2 = x[j][k];
      for (i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
        x[j][i] -= x[k][i] * su2 * su1;
      }
    }
  }
  for (k = 0; k <= N - 2; k++) {
    su1 = 1.0 / x[1 - k][1 - k];
    for (j = k + 1; j <= N - 1; j++) {
      su2 = x[1 - j][1 - k];
      for (i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
        x[1 - j][i] -= x[1 - k][i] * su2 * su1;
      }
    }
  }
  for (j = 0; j <= N - 1; j++) {
    su1 = 1.0 / x[j][j];
    for (i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
      x[j][i] *= su1;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, the expensive division operation is reduced, redundant calculations are removed, and unnecessary pointer array is eliminated. Thus, it should be faster and use less memory than the original one.
