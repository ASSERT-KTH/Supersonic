The given program seems to be a dynamic programming solution for a problem. Here are some possible optimizations:

1. Avoid using global variables: This is good practice in general for programming. You should avoid using global variables unless absolutely necessary. This makes your code easier to understand and debug.

2. Avoid using 'magic numbers': Magic numbers are numbers that occur in the program without any explanation. It's better to define such numbers as constants with descriptive names.

3. Reduce the scope of variables: Some variables, such as `x`, `y`, `flag`, and `sum`, are only used inside the while loop. It's better to declare them within the loop.

4. Use `std::vector` instead of C-style arrays: `std::vector` is a safer and more flexible alternative to C-style arrays. You can resize it, and it will deallocate its memory automatically when it goes out of scope.

5. Use `std::string` instead of C-style strings: Similar to the above, `std::string` is safer and provides more functionality than C-style strings.

6. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: This is more idiomatic in C++, and it can improve readability.

7. Avoid unnecessary computations: In the loop that calculates `dp1` and `dp2`, the expression `j - x` is computed twice. You can compute it once and store the result in a variable.

Here is the optimized code:
```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#define ll long long
#define maxn 100009
#define inf 999999999999
using namespace std;
const int MAX_NUM = 10009;
vector<ll> dp1(MAX_NUM);
vector<ll> dp2(MAX_NUM);
vector<int> num(105);
string s;
int main() {
  int n, m, x, y;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> num[i];
    sort(num.begin(), num.begin() + n);
    fill(dp2.begin(), dp2.end(), -inf);
    dp2[0] = 0;
    fill(dp1.begin(), dp1.end(), 0);
    cin >> m;
    bool flag = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      cin >> s >> x >> y;
      if (x == 0 && y > 0)
        flag = 1;
      if (s[0] == 'S') {
        for (int j = x; j < MAX_NUM; j++) {
          int diff = j - x;
          dp1[j] = max(dp1[j], dp1[diff] + y);
        }
      } else {
        for (int j = x; j < MAX_NUM; j++) {
          int diff = j - x;
          dp2[j] = max(dp2[j], dp2[diff] + y);
        }
      }
    }
    if (flag) {
      cout << "0\n";
      continue;
    }
    ll ans = 1ll << 60, sum;
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_NUM; i++) {
      if (dp2[i] < 0)
        continue;
      sum = i;
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        sum += lower_bound(dp1.begin(), dp1.begin() + MAX_NUM, num[j] - dp2[i]) - dp1.begin();
      }
      ans = min(ans, sum);
    }
    cout << ans << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
