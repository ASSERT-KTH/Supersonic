This program is quite optimized already, but there are a few changes that could potentially improve its efficiency:

1. **Use pre-increment operator (`++i`) instead of post-increment operator (`i++`)**: In C++, the pre-increment operator is generally faster than the post-increment operator. This is because the post-increment operator involves a copy operation, while the pre-increment operator does not.
2. **Remove unnecessary `memset` function call**: The `memset` function is not necessary because the `dp1` array is already initialized to 0 when it is declared. Removing this function call can save time.
3. **Reduce the scope of variables**: Variables such as `ll sum` can be defined within the loop where they are used. This can potentially optimize memory usage by reducing the lifetime of the variable.
4. **Use `std::fill` instead of `memset` for initializing `dp2`**: `memset` treats data as raw bytes, which is not safe for types other than `char` or `unsigned char`. For types like `ll` (`long long`), it's better to use `std::fill`.

The optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#define ll long long
#define maxn 100009
#define inf 999999999999
using namespace std;
ll dp1[10009];
ll dp2[10006];
char s[25];
int num[105];
int main() {
  int n, m, x, y;
  while (scanf("%d", &n) != EOF) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      scanf("%d", &num[i]);
    sort(num, num + n);
    fill(dp2, dp2+10006, -inf);
    dp2[0] = 0;
    scanf("%d", &m);
    bool flag = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
      scanf("%s", s);
      scanf("%d", &x);
      scanf("%s", s);
      scanf("%d", &y);
      if (x == 0 && y > 0)
        flag = 1;
      if (s[0] == 'S') {
        for (int j = x; j <= 10000; ++j)
          dp1[j] = max(dp1[j], dp1[j - x] + y);
      } else {
        for (int j = x; j <= 10000; ++j)
          dp2[j] = max(dp2[j], dp2[j - x] + y);
      }
    }
    if (flag) {
      puts("0");
      continue;
    }
    ll ans = 1ll << 60;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10001; ++i) {
      if (dp2[i] < 0)
        continue;
      ll sum = i;
      for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        sum += lower_bound(dp1, dp1 + 10000, num[j] - dp2[i]) - dp1;
      }
      ans = min(ans, sum);
    }
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
