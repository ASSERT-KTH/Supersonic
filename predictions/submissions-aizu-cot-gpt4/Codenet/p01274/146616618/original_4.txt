Sure, let's optimize this program step by step.

1. Include specific headers: The first optimization is to avoid including the whole "bits/stdc++.h" file. This file includes a lot of unnecessary standard library headers that are not used in your program. Instead, we should only include the headers that we actually need. In this case, we need headers for std::cin, std::cout, std::endl, std::vector, std::pair, std::string, and std::min. These functions and types are defined in the headers <iostream>, <vector>, <utility>, <string>, and <algorithm> respectively.

2. Avoid using 'using namespace std;': The 'using namespace std;' line can potentially cause name clashes, which can lead to bugs that are hard to find. It is better to use the std:: prefix when you want to use something from the standard library.

3. Avoid macros for constants: The use of macros for constants (such as INF and N) is not recommended in C++. It is better to use constant variables instead. Constant variables are type-safe, while macros are not.

4. Use std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false): Adding 'std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);' will turn off the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams which can potentially speed up the input/output operations. 

5. Reserve space for vector: We can use the reserve() function to pre-allocate memory for the vectors mg[0] and mg[1], which can result in better performance because it reduces the number of memory reallocations.

6. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment: In the for loop, use pre-increment (i.e., ++i) instead of post-increment (i.e., i++) because pre-increment could be faster as it doesn't need to create a temporary object.

Now, let's put these optimizations into the code.

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

constexpr int INF = 1e9;
constexpr int N = 100000;
using P = std::pair<int, int>;
using ll = long long;

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    int n, m, hp[101];
    while (std::cin >> n, n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            std::cin >> hp[i];
        std::vector<P> mg[2];
        mg[0].reserve(N);
        mg[1].reserve(N);
        std::cin >> m;
        for (int i = 0, cost, dam; i < m; ++i) {
            std::string name, type;
            std::cin >> name >> cost >> type >> dam;
            if (dam)
                mg[type == "All"].push_back(P(dam, cost));
        }
        int dp[2][N + 10] = {};
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i)
            for (int j = 1; j < N + 10; ++j)
                dp[i][j] = INF;
        for (int k = 0; k < 2; ++k)
            for (size_t i = 0; i < mg[k].size(); ++i)
                for (int j = mg[k][i].first; j <= (N / mg[k][i].first + 1) * mg[k][i].first; ++j)
                    dp[k][std::min(N, j)] = std::min(dp[k][std::min(N, j)], dp[k][j - mg[k][i].first] + mg[k][i].second);
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i)
            for (int j = N; j >= 0; --j)
                dp[i][j] = std::min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j + 1]);
        ll ans = INF;
        for (int i = 0; i <= N; ++i) {
            ll cost = dp[1][i];
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                cost += dp[0][std::max(0, hp[j] - i)];
            ans = std::min(ans, cost);
        }
        std::cout << ans << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
