The optimization process would consist of the following steps:

1. Avoid the use of `#include "bits/stdc++.h"`: This header file includes a lot of unnecessary stuff that our program doesn't need. This can slow down the compilation process. Instead, we should only include what we need.

2. Reduce repetitive calculations: The `pass[u].size()` in for loop is calculated during each iteration which is unnecessary. We can store its value before the loop and use it inside the loop.

3. Use of array instead of vector: In the current program, we are using a vector of arrays `vector<int> pass[6000]` which is an overhead for memory. Since the maximum size is known, we can use a 2D array instead.

4. Use of constants: We can use a constant to represent the maximum size 6000, this makes the code more flexible and easy to modify.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#define MAX_SIZE 6000

using namespace std;

int pass[MAX_SIZE][MAX_SIZE];
int n, k;
int c[MAX_SIZE];
int r[MAX_SIZE];
int d[MAX_SIZE];
bool used[MAX_SIZE];
const int INF = INT_MAX;

void dfs(int v, int u, int f, int end, bool visited[MAX_SIZE]) {
  if (visited[u])
    return;
  visited[u] = true;
  d[u] = min(d[u], d[v] + c[v]);
  if (f >= end)
    return;
  int size = pass[u].size();
  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { dfs(v, pass[u][i], f + 1, end, visited); }
}

int dijk(int s, int g) {
  for (int i = 0; i < MAX_SIZE; i++) {
    d[i] = INF;
    used[i] = false;
  }
  d[s] = 0;
  while (1) {
    int v = -1;
    for (int u = 0; u < n; u++) {
      if (!used[u] && (v == -1 || d[u] < d[v]))
        v = u;
    }
    if (v == -1)
      break;
    used[v] = true;
    bool visited[MAX_SIZE] = {};
    int size = pass[v].size();
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { dfs(v, pass[v][i], 1, r[v], visited); }
  }
  return d[g];
}

int main() {
  cin >> n >> k;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> c[i] >> r[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    a--, b--;
    pass[a][i] = b;
    pass[b][i] = a;
  }
  cout << dijk(0, n - 1) << endl;
}
```
Please note that the optimization depends on the input size and the specific requirements of your use case. Sometimes, vector might be better than array if the size is not fixed.
