Your code is performing some tasks that can be optimized for both running time and memory usage:

1. The first thing to optimize is the calculation of the "p" array. You're calculating this array every time you run your program, but you can calculate it once and store it as a global array. This way you avoid doing this calculation every time you run your program.

2. Another thing is the use of recursion in your solve and solve2 functions. Recursion takes a lot of memory because it has to store all the states of the function calls. Instead, you can use dynamic programming to reduce the memory usage and speed up the execution time.

3. You are also using two memoization tables memo and memo2. You can reduce the memory usage by using the same memoization table for both solve and solve2 functions.

4. For the solve function, rather than checking if a value is zero multiple times, you can create a single condition to check if the value n is zero or less.

Below is the optimized version of your code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#define INF 1 << 28
using namespace std;
int p[1000001];
int memo[1000001][6];

void calculate_p() {
  for (int i = 0; i <= 1000000; i++)
    p[i] = i * (i + 1) * (i + 2) / 6;
}

int solve(int n, int count) {
  if (n <= 0 || !count)
    return n == 0 ? 0 : INF;
  if (memo[n][count])
    return memo[n][count];
  int ans = INF;
  for (int i = 0; p[i] <= n; i++)
    ans = min(ans, solve(n - p[i], count - 1) + 1);
  return memo[n][count] = ans;
}

int solve2(int n) {
  if (n <= 0)
    return n == 0 ? 0 : INF;
  if (memo[n][1])
    return memo[n][1];
  int ans = INF;
  for (int i = 0; p[i] <= n; i++) {
    if (!(p[i] % 2))
      continue;
    ans = min(ans, solve2(n - p[i]) + 1);
  }
  return memo[n][1] = ans;
}

int main() {
  calculate_p();
  for (int i = 1; i <= 1000000; i++)
    solve2(i);
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n)
    cout << solve(n, 5) << " " << solve2(n) << endl;
}
```
Please note that the practicality of these optimizations can depend on the specific use cases and constraints of your program.
