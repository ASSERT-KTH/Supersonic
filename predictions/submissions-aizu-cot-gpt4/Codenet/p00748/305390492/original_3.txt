The given C++ program seems to be solving some kind of dynamic programming problem where it uses memoization to store intermediate results to avoid redundant computations. This program can be optimized in a few ways:

1. Reduce the unnecessary use of recursion: The recursive calls to `solve` and `solve2` functions are creating overhead in terms of recursion stack and time. Iterative solutions are generally more efficient than recursive ones. So, we can replace the recursion with iteration where possible.

2. Reduce the number of function calls: The function calls to `min` and `solve` within the loop can be optimized. We can calculate the minimum value within the loop itself without calling `min` function again and again.

3. Remove unnecessary computations: In the `solve2` function, instead of checking if a number is divisible by 2 inside the loop, we can exclude the even numbers from the start. This reduces computations inside the loop.

4. The bit shift operator (`<<`) is used to define the `INF` constant. The result of this operation is not guaranteed to be `INF` in all cases as it depends on the maximum integer size of the system. So, it's better to define `INF` as a large constant integer value instead.

5. The value of `p[i]` is computed inside the loop in the `main` function. This computation can be moved outside the loop to improve performance.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define INF 10000000
using namespace std;
int p[1000001];
int memo[1000001][6];
int memo2[1000001];

int solve(int n, int count) {
  for(int i=0; i<=n; i++) {
    for(int j=0; j<=count; j++) {
      if(i==0) memo[i][j] = 0;
      else if(j==0 || i<0) memo[i][j] = INF;
      else {
        if(p[j-1] <= i) {
          memo[i][j] = min(memo[i][j-1], memo[i - p[j-1]][j-1] + 1);
        } else {
          memo[i][j] = memo[i][j-1];
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return memo[n][count];
}

int solve2(int n) {
  for(int i=0; i<=n; i++) {
    if(i==0) memo2[i] = 0;
    else if(i<0) memo2[i] = INF;
    else {
      for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
        if (j % 2 != 0 && p[j] <= i) {
          int res = memo2[i - p[j]] + 1;
          if (res < memo2[i]) {
            memo2[i] = res;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return memo2[n];
}

int main() {
  int n;
  for (int i = 0; i <= 1000000; i++)
    p[i] = i * (i + 1) * (i + 2) / 6;
  while (cin >> n, n)
    cout << solve(n, 5) << " " << solve2(n) << endl;
}
