The given C/C++ program calculates pentagonal numbers and solves two problems using dynamic programming. The first problem tries to find the minimum number of pentagonal numbers that sum to a given number, using at most five pentagonal numbers. The second problem tries to find the minimum number of odd pentagonal numbers that sum to a given number.

There are two main areas where the program can be optimized: the calculation of pentagonal numbers and the dynamic programming solution.

The calculation of pentagonal numbers is currently done in the main function and uses a loop that calculates the pentagonal number for every number from 0 to 1,000,000. This can be optimized by calculating only the pentagonal numbers that will be used in the solve functions. Since the maximum value that the solve functions will use is the input number, we can calculate the pentagonal numbers up to that number. This will reduce the number of loop iterations and the number of pentagonal numbers that need to be stored in memory.

The dynamic programming solution currently uses recursion and memoization to avoid recalculating the same subproblems. This can be optimized by using a bottom-up approach instead of a top-down approach. This will avoid the overhead of recursion and will also ensure that the subproblems are solved in the optimal order. This is particularly important for the solve2 function, which currently calls itself recursively for every pentagonal number less than or equal to the input number. With a bottom-up approach, the function will be called only once for each input number.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#define INF 1 << 28
using namespace std;
int p[1000001];
int memo[1000001][6];
int memo2[1000001];
int solve(int n, int count) {
  for (int j = 0; j <= count; j++)
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
      if (!i)
        memo[i][j] = 0;
      else if (i < 0 || !j)
        memo[i][j] = INF;
      else {
        memo[i][j] = INF;
        for (int k = 0; p[k] <= i; k++)
          memo[i][j] = min(memo[i][j], memo[i - p[k]][j - 1] + 1);
      }
  return memo[n][count];
}
int solve2(int n) {
  for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
    if (!i)
      memo2[i] = 0;
    else if (i < 0)
      memo2[i] = INF;
    else {
      memo2[i] = INF;
      for (int j = 0; p[j] <= i; j++)
        if (p[j] % 2)
          memo2[i] = min(memo2[i], memo2[i - p[j]] + 1);
    }
  return memo2[n];
}
int main() {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
      p[i] = i * (i + 1) * (i + 2) / 6;
    cout << solve(n, 5) << " " << solve2(n) << endl;
  }
}
```

Note: This optimization reduces the time complexity of the program, but it does not reduce the space complexity. The program still requires O(n) space to store the pentagonal numbers and the memoization tables.
