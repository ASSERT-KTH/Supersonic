This program is already optimized in many aspects. However, there are a few areas where we could make some changes to potentially improve performance:

1. **Repeated Computations**: In several functions the same computation is done multiple times. For instance, the abs function is called multiple times on the same values in functions like area, heron, dist etc. We can store the results of these computations in variables and use these instead of calling the function repeatedly.

2. **Function Inlining**: Some small functions like dist, col, etc., are called frequently. We can make these inline functions. Inline functions are a C++ enhancement feature to increase the execution time of a program. Functions can be instructed to compiler to make them inline so that compiler can replace those function definition wherever those are being called. Compiler replaces the definition of inline functions at compile time instead of referring function definition at runtime.

3. **Use of std::array instead of raw arrays**: For arrays of fixed size, std::array is safer and more convenient to use than C-style arrays (e.g., r[111], mb[111]). It will not degrade performance. 

4. **Loop Unrolling**: In simple words, loop unrolling is a technique that duplicates the contents of loop body to reduce the overhead of loop control mechanism (initialization, condition checking, and increment/decrement of the variable). Although modern compilers do this automatically, manually doing it in the right places could bring a performance gain.

5. **Avoiding std namespace**: Using the entire std namespace is generally considered bad practice because it can lead to name conflicts. It's better to specify which functions you're using from the std namespace with a using declaration.

6. **Avoiding unnecessary #define macros**: For example, the macros curr, next, and self are unnecessary and confusing. It's better to just use the normal C++ syntax instead of creating a macro.
