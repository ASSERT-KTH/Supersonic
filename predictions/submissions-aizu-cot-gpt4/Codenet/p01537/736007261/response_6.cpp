This C++ program seems to be a combination of geometric algorithms such as calculating the minimum enclosing circle of a set of points, checking for intersections between different geometric shapes, etc. It's a bit hard to optimize without a clear understanding of the problem you're trying to solve. However, there are a few general improvements that can be made:

1) Avoid unnecessary calculations: For instance, the "dist" function calculates the distance between two points multiple times. This can be avoided by storing the calculated distance in a variable and reusing it.

2) Use const references when passing complex objects: This avoids the overhead of copying the object. For example, change "vector<P> hit(C const &c, L const &l)" to "vector<P> hit(const C& c, const L& l)".

3) Avoid using global variables: The variables n, m, r[], mb[], ans and used[] are global variables. It's considered a good practice to avoid global variables as they can lead to side effects and make the code harder to understand and debug. If possible, these variables should be moved inside functions or be passed as parameters.

4) Use of modern C++ practices: The code could use more modern C++ practices like auto keyword, range-based for loops and smart pointers. This doesn't necessarily optimize the program but makes it more readable and maintainable.

5) Use of more efficient data structures: Depending on the usage, some data structures could be replaced with more efficient ones. For example, if you're doing a lot of searching in a vector, replacing it with a set could improve the performance from O(n) to O(log n).
