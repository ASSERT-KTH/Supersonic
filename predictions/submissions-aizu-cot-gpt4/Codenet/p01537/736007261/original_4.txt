This code is quite complex and it is not straightforward to optimize as it contains many calculations and mathematical operations. However, there are a few steps we can take to improve its performance:

1. Avoid redundant computations by storing the results of frequently used operations: For operations that are frequently used in loops, saving the results to a variable can significantly improve performance. This is especially true for operations that involve floating point calculations, as they are typically costly.

2. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment: In loops, use pre-increment (++i) instead of post-increment (i++). In some cases, pre-increment can be faster because it doesn't need to create a temporary variable to hold the original value. However, the impact on performance is usually negligible and can be ignored in most cases.

3. Avoid unnecessary type casting: In several places, the code casts integer values to long double type. If it's not necessary, you should avoid it, as type casting can lead to performance degradation.

4. Minimize the use of the 'auto' keyword: While 'auto' can make the code more readable, it can also lead to inefficiencies because it might cause the compiler to use a larger or more complex type than necessary. Therefore, you should minimize the use of 'auto' and use explicit types where possible.

5. Replace recursion with iteration where possible: Recursion can be slower than iteration due to the overhead of function calls. If it's possible to rewrite recursive functions using loops, you should do so.

6. Use 'const' where possible: If a variable is not modified, you should declare it as 'const'. This can help the compiler optimize the code.

7. Optimize I/O operations: If the program reads or writes a lot of data, I/O operations can become a bottleneck. In such cases, you can use faster I/O methods, such as fread/fwrite or memory-mapped I/O.

However, the code you provided seems heavily optimized already. It uses many advanced C++ features and techniques, and it seems to be written by an experienced programmer. Therefore, it's hard to find specific parts of the code that can be optimized without a deeper understanding of the problem the code is trying to solve.
