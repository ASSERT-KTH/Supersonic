The given code is already quite optimized in terms of running time and memory usage. However, there are small modifications we can make that can potentially improve the performance of the code.

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of libraries, which makes the compilation process slower. We should only include the libraries that we are using in our program.

2. Use `std::array` instead of C-style arrays: This can improve the performance of the code as `std::array` is a container that encapsulates fixed size arrays.

3. Use `std::vector::reserve` for vector initialization: If you know the number of elements that will be inserted into a vector, you can use the reserve function to allocate the required space in memory. This can potentially speed up the program as it prevents multiple reallocations and copying of the entire vector when the vector needs to grow.

4. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up cin and cout. This can make a big difference in terms of performance when dealing with large input/output data.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <complex>
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(n); ++i)
using ld = long double;
using P = complex<ld>;
using G = vector<P>;
const ld pi = acos(-1);
const ld eps = 1e-10;
using C = pair<ld, P>;
#define rad first
#define pnt second

// ... Rest of the code is same ...

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  vector<int> ans;
  ans.reserve(m);
  cin >> n >> m;
  array<ld, 111> r;
  array<ld, 111> mb;
  array<bool, 111> used;

  // ... Rest of the code is same ...

}
```
Please note that the modifications we made are not guaranteed to improve the performance in all scenarios. It depends on many factors such as the compiler, the system architecture and the input size. In some cases, these modifications may even degrade the performance. Therefore, it's important to test the performance of the code with different inputs.
