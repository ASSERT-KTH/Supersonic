The provided C++ program is already well-optimized in terms of time complexity and memory usage. However, there are still few things that could be optimized:

1. Instead of using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes all the standard libraries, which can increase the compile time, use only the necessary libraries. This is not an optimization for runtime but for the compile time.

2. Use of `std::endl` can be replaced with `"\n"` as `std::endl` forces a flush operation which can be expensive in terms of speed.

3. The boolean array `used` can be replaced with a `std::vector<bool>`. `std::vector<bool>` is a specialized version of `std::vector` which uses less memory than a normal array.

4. The program uses `std::random_shuffle` which has been removed in C++17 and is marked as deprecated in C++14. Instead, `std::shuffle` should be used.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <complex>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <random>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(n); i++)
#define all(c) begin(c), end(c)
#define dump(x) cerr << __LINE__ << ":\t" #x " = " << x << endl
using ld = long double;
using P = complex<ld>;
using G = vector<P>;
const ld pi = acos(-1);
const ld eps = 1e-10;
const ld inf = 1e12;

// rest of the code remains same

int main() {
    vector<int> ans;
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    ld r[111], mb[111];
    vector<bool> used(n, false);

    // rest of the code remains same

    if (f) {
        rep(i, m) cout << ans[i] + 1 << "\n";
    } else {
        cout << "NG\n";
    }
}
```
Please note that the actual runtime or memory usage improvement may not be significant with these changes because most of the time and space is consumed by the algorithm itself, which cannot be improved without changing the algorithm.
