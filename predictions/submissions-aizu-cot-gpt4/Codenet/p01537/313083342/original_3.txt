This program is fairly optimized in terms of its algorithmic approach, however, there are several steps that can be taken to further optimize the program:

1. **Avoid unnecessary use of complex data type**: The usage of complex data type (P) in the code is unnecessary and can be replaced by using a pair of doubles (pair<ld, ld>) which is simpler and consumes less memory.

2. **Avoid unnecessary function definition inside function**: Functions c3, c2, and in_circle are defined inside function smallest_enclosing_disc which makes them local to the function and they are redefined every time the function is called. We can define these functions globally to avoid unnecessary redefinition.

3. **Replace Macros with Inline Functions**: Macros are not type safe and can lead to hard-to-find bugs. Therefore, it's better to replace them with inline functions.

4. **Avoid std::endl**: std::endl forces a flush operation, which can be costly in terms of performance. We can use '\n' to output a newline character instead.

5. **Avoid unnecessary use of #define**: We can use the static const for defining constant values instead of #define to take advantage of type checking.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ld = long double;
using Point = pair<ld, ld>;
using Circle = pair<ld, Point>;
const ld pi = acos(-1);
const ld eps = 1e-10;
const ld inf = 1e12;

ld cross(const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  return a.first * b.second - a.second * b.first;
}

ld dot(const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  return a.first * b.first + a.second * b.second;
}

Circle c3(const Point &a, const Point &b, const Point &c) {
    ld A = norm(b - c);
    ld B = norm(c - a);
    ld C = norm(a - b);
    ld S = abs(cross(b - a, c - a));
    Point p = (A * (B + C - A) * a + B * (C + A - B) * b + C * (A + B - C) * c) /
          (4 * S * S);
    ld r = abs(p - a);
    return make_pair(r, p);
}

Circle c2(const Point &a, const Point &b) {
    Point c = (a + b) / (ld)2;
    ld r = abs(a - c);
    return make_pair(r, c);
}

bool in_circle(const Point &a, const Circle &c) {
    return norm(a - c.second) <= c.first * c.first + eps;
}

// ... rest of the code ... 
```

Please note that I did not change the whole code to make it more readable and because the original request was to make small changes to the original code.
