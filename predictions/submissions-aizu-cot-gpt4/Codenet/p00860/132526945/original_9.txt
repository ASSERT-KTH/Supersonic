The given code is a BFS (Breadth First Search) solver for a 3D maze game. The main area of optimization would be in the BFS function itself, specifically the triple nested loop. 

Let's go step by step:

1. The triple nested for loop is used to generate all possible moves. But we can see that dif array is of size 5, and only 4 different moves are possible: up, down, left and right. So, the condition in the for loop can be simplified to i1 < 4, i2 < 4, i3 < 4. This would reduce the number of iterations and thus improve the performance.

2. The check function is called for every possible move to see if it's valid. This function can be optimized by returning false as soon as a condition is not met, rather than checking all conditions every time.

3. The queue q is used to store the current state of the maze. It's better to use a deque instead of a queue because deque provides an efficient way to insert and delete elements from both ends.

4. The wall array is used to check if a cell is a wall or not. But this information can be obtained directly from the c array, so the wall array can be eliminated to save memory.

5. The vis array is used to check if a state has been visited or not. But this can be done more efficiently by using a set instead of an array. A set can insert and find elements in O(log n) time, which is faster than an array for large n.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cctype>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <deque>
#include <set>
using namespace std;
set<int> vis;
char c[16][20];
int tm0;
inline bool check(int u, int v) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 24; i += 8) {
    int p1 = v >> i & 255;
    if (p1) {
      int j = i == 16 ? 0 : i + 8;
      if (c[p1 >> 4][p1 & 15] == '#') {
        return false;
      }
      int p2 = (v >> j % 24) & 255;
      if (p1 == p2) {
        return false;
      }
      if (p1 == (u >> j % 24 & 255) && p2 == (u >> i % 24 & 255)) {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }
  return true;
}
int solve(int start, int goal) {
  const int dif[4] = {-1, 1, -16, 16};
  deque<int> q;
  q.push_back(start);
  q.push_back(-1);
  int tm = tm0 + 1;
  vis.insert(start);
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int u = q.front();
    q.pop_front();
    if (u < 0) {
      if(!q.empty()) q.push_back(-1);
      ++tm;
    } else {
      for (int i1 = u & 255 ? 3 : 0; i1 >= 0; --i1)
        for (int i2 = u >> 8 & 255 ? 3 : 0; i2 >= 0; --i2)
          for (int i3 = u >> 16 ? 3 : 0; i3 >= 0; --i3) {
            int v = u + dif[i1] + (dif[i2] << 8) + (dif[i3] << 16);
            if (vis.count(v) > 0) {
              continue;
            }
            if (check(u, v)) {
              if (v == goal) {
                return tm;
              }
              vis.insert(v);
              q.push_back(v);
            }
          }
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
int main() {
  int w, h;
  while (scanf("%d%d%*d ", &w, &h), w) {
    for (int i = 0; i < h; ++i) {
      fgets(c[i], 20, stdin);
    }
    int goal = 0;
    int start = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; ++i) {
      for (int j = 0; j < w; ++j) {
        if (isupper(c[i][j])) {
          goal |= (i << 4 | j) << (c[i][j] - 'A') * 8;
        } else if (islower(c[i][j])) {
          start |= (i << 4 | j) << (c[i][j] - 'a') * 8;
        }
      }
    }
    int tm = solve(start, goal);
    printf("%d\n", tm - tm0);
    tm0 = tm + 1;
    if (tm0 > 55000) {
      vis.clear();
      tm0 = 0;
    }
  }
}
```
In the optimized code, we used deque instead of queue, set instead of array, and removed the wall array. The loop conditions were also simplified, and the check function was optimized.
