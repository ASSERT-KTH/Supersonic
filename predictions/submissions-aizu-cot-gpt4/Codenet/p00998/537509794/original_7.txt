The given code is already quite optimized in terms of algorithmic efficiency and it's using AVL trees for data structure which provides good time complexity for insertion, deletion and search operations. But there are few improvements that can be done:

1. Using `#include<bits/stdc++.h>`: This is not a standard library and it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increases the compilation time. We should replace it with the necessary libraries.

2. Using `ios::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(0);`: While this line of code is used to speed up cin and cout operations, it can cause issues if we mix cin/cout and scanf/printf in the code. So, we should stick to one type of input/output operation.

3. Using 'printf' for output: Instead of 'printf', we can use 'cout' for consistency and to prevent potential issues due to mixing of 'cin/cout' and 'scanf/printf'.

4. Memory management: In the given code, new nodes are created using `new` operator but it is not freed/deleted which can lead to memory leak. We need to delete the nodes when they are no longer in use.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct RMQ {
  using type = int;
  static type id() { return INT_MAX; }
  static type op(type l, type r) { return min(l, r); }
};

template <typename M>
class avl_tree {
  //... same as before ...
  node *erase(node *t) {
    if (!t)
      return t;
    if (!t->ch[0] && !t->ch[1]) {
      delete t;
      return nullptr;
    }
    if (!t->ch[0] || !t->ch[1]) {
      node* temp = t->ch[t->ch[0] == nullptr];
      delete t;
      return temp;
    }
    //.. same as before ..
  }
  //.. same as before ..
};

int main() {
  int n, q;
  cin >> n >> q;
  avl_tree<RMQ> tree;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    tree.insert(i, a);
  }
  while (q--) {
    int x, y, z;
    cin >> x >> y >> z;
    if (x == 0) {
      int val = tree.find(z);
      tree.erase(z);
      tree.insert(y, val);
    } else if (x == 1) {
      cout << tree.find(y, z + 1) << "\n";
    } else {
      tree.erase(y);
      tree.insert(y, z);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have replaced `#include<bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary libraries, used 'cout' instead of 'printf' and added memory management for the nodes of AVL tree.
