This program is quite efficient already. There are only a few minor improvements that can be made to it. 

Optimization Steps:

1. The first step would be to replace the "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" with only the necessary headers. The "bits/stdc++.h" is not standard and it includes a lot of unnecessary headers that we don't need in this program, which can slow down the compilation time.

2. The second optimization is to replace "ios::sync_with_stdio(false)" with "ios::sync_with_stdio(true)" and "cin.tie(0)" with "cin.tie(NULL)". This will untie cin from cout and can make I/O operations faster.

3. The third optimization is to replace printf with cout. While printf is often faster, cout can be made nearly as fast by using "ios::sync_with_stdio(false)" and provides type safety, so it's generally preferred in C++.

4. The fourth optimization is to avoid creation of temporary objects where possible. For example, instead of "return fix(update(new node(find(t->ch[1], 0)->val, t->ch[0], erase(t->ch[1], 0))));", we can store the result of find in a variable and use that.

5. The fifth optimization is to use pre-increment instead of post-increment. Pre-increment can be a bit faster because it doesn't need to make a copy of the original value.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;
struct RMQ {
  using type = int;
  static type id() { return INT_MAX; }
  static type op(type l, type r) { return min(l, r); }
};

//... rest of the code remains unchanged ...

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(true), cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, q;
  cin >> n >> q;
  avl_tree<RMQ> tree;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    tree.insert(i, a);
  }
  while (q--) {
    int x, y, z;
    cin >> x >> y >> z;
    if (x == 0) {
      int val = tree.find(z);
      tree.erase(z);
      tree.insert(y, val);
    } else if (x == 1) {
      cout << tree.find(y, z + 1) << "\n";
    } else {
      tree.erase(y);
      tree.insert(y, z);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: These optimizations are relatively minor and are unlikely to have a noticeable impact on the performance of the code. The primary bottlenecks in this code are likely to be the AVL tree operations themselves, which are already quite efficient.
