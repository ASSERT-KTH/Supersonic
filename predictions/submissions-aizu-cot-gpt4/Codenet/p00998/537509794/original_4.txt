The given C++ code is quite optimized, but there are few modifications which can make it more efficient.

1. **Using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` with `std::cin.tie(NULL);`** - This can optimize the input/output operations. By doing this, the C++ standard streams are decoupled from the standard C streams. This can help speed up the input/output operations as it avoids unnecessary synchronization.

2. **Avoid using `printf` if `cin` and `cout` are used** - It's recommended not to mix C-style and C++-style I/O as it may cause synchronization issues. So, replace `printf` with `cout`.

3. **Use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl`** - Using `std::endl` can cause unnecessary flushing of the stream which can slow down the program.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct RMQ {
  using type = int;
  static type id() { return INT_MAX; }
  static type op(type l, type r) { return min(l, r); }
};

// Remaining code of avl_tree class remains same

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, q;
  cin >> n >> q;
  avl_tree<RMQ> tree;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    tree.insert(i, a);
  }
  while (q--) {
    int x, y, z;
    cin >> x >> y >> z;
    if (x == 0) {
      int val = tree.find(z);
      tree.erase(z);
      tree.insert(y, val);
    } else if (x == 1) {
      cout << tree.find(y, z + 1) << '\n';
    } else {
      tree.erase(y);
      tree.insert(y, z);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this code still includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard C++ library. It's actually a GCC specific library which includes almost all the standard C++ libraries. It's not recommended to use it in production code because it's non-portable and can slow down the compilation process. But since it's a competitive programming style code, it's fine to use it here.
