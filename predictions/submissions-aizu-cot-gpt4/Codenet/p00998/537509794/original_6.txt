The given code is quite optimized in terms of algorithmic complexity, as it uses AVL tree, a balanced binary search tree, which has a logarithmic time complexity for operations like insertion, deletion, and searching. However, there are still a few areas where we can slightly optimize the code:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of standard C++ libraries, which can increase the compilation time. Instead, include only the libraries that you are using in your program.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std`: This can lead to name clashes, which can cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

3. Use fast input/output: The `cin` and `cout` objects in C++ are slower compared to `scanf` and `printf` in C. So, for faster input/output, you can switch to `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout`.

4. Inline small functions: Inlining a function can save the overhead of a function call, providing a small speedup. Note that overusing inline can lead to the code size increases, which might increase the cache miss rate and slow down the program.

Here's how the optimized code might look like:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <climits>

struct RMQ {
  using type = int;
  static inline type id() { return INT_MAX; }
  static inline type op(type l, type r) { return std::min(l, r); }
};

template <typename M> class avl_tree {
  // ... rest of the avl_tree class ...

public:
  avl_tree() : root(nullptr) {}
  inline int size() const { return count(root); }
  void insert(int k, M::type b) { root = insert(root, k, b); }
  void erase(int k) { root = erase(root, k); }
  M::type find(int k) const { return find(root, k)->val; }
  M::type find(int l, int r) const { return find(root, l, r); }
};

int main() {
  int n, q;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &q);
  avl_tree<RMQ> tree;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int a;
    scanf("%d", &a);
    tree.insert(i, a);
  }
  while (q--) {
    int x, y, z;
    scanf("%d %d %d", &x, &y, &z);
    if (x == 0) {
      int val = tree.find(z);
      tree.erase(z);
      tree.insert(y, val);
    } else if (x == 1) {
      printf("%d\n", tree.find(y, z + 1));
    } else {
      tree.erase(y);
      tree.insert(y, z);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimization is quite marginal and won't drastically improve the performance of the program. The main optimization is focused on reducing the compilation time and slightly reducing the runtime by using faster I/O operations and inlining the small functions.
