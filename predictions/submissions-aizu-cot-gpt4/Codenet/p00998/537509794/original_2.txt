The given program is an implementation of AVL Tree (a self-balancing binary search tree) with Range Minimum Query (RMQ) operation. The optimization of this code can be done by making the following changes:

1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is not a standard C++ library. It's actually a GCC extension that includes most of the standard C++ libraries. However, it can slow down the compilation process because it includes more files than needed. It's better to include only the required libraries. In this code, we need `iostream`, `algorithm`, and `climits`.

2. Remove `using namespace std;`: It's a bad practice to use this statement in the global scope because it can lead to naming conflicts. It's better to use the `std::` prefix when needed.

3. Use `std::endl` instead of `'\n'`: The `'\n'` character does not flush the output buffer, while `std::endl` does, which can be useful when you need to ensure that the output is printed immediately.

4. Use `std::cout` instead of `printf`: To keep consistency in the code, as we are using C++ standard libraries, it's better to use `std::cout` for output.

5. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment: Pre-increment (`++i`) can be faster than post-increment (`i++`) in some cases because post-increment needs to create a temporary copy.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

struct RMQ {
    using type = int;
    static type id() { return INT_MAX; }
    static type op(type l, type r) { return std::min(l, r); }
};

// ... rest of the code remains the same ...

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(0);
    int n, q;
    std::cin >> n >> q;
    avl_tree<RMQ> tree;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int a;
        std::cin >> a;
        tree.insert(i, a);
    }
    while (q--) {
        int x, y, z;
        std::cin >> x >> y >> z;
        if (x == 0) {
            int val = tree.find(z);
            tree.erase(z);
            tree.insert(y, val);
        } else if (x == 1) {
            std::cout << tree.find(y, z + 1) << std::endl;
        } else {
            tree.erase(y);
            tree.insert(y, z);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
