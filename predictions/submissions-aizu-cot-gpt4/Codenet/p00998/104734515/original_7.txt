This program is quite optimized in terms of functionality. However, there are some areas that can be optimized further:

1. The use of the `bits/stdc++.h` header file is discouraged because it includes all the standard library headers which can slow down the compilation time. It is better to include only those header files that are needed.

2. Instead of using `scanf` and `printf` for input/output, you can use `cin` and `cout` with `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up I/O operations.

3. The `pair<Treap::node *, Treap::node *> a, b, c;` can be declared inside the if condition as they are not used elsewhere.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdlib>

using namespace std;
const int INF = 1 << 30;

struct Treap {
  // Rest of the code is same until main function

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, q;
  Treap tree;
  cin >> n >> q;

  for (int i = 0, a; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a;
    tree.insert(i, a);
  }

  while (q--) {
    int x, y, z;
    cin >> x >> y >> z;

    if (x == 0) {
      z++;
      pair<Treap::node *, Treap::node *> a, b, c;
      c = tree.split(tree.root, z);
      b = tree.split(c.first, z - 1);
      a = tree.split(b.first, y);
      tree.root = tree.merge(a.first, b.second);
      tree.root = tree.merge(tree.root, a.second);
      tree.root = tree.merge(tree.root, c.second);
    } else if (x == 1) {
      cout << tree.rmq(y, z + 1) << '\n';
    } else {
      tree.erase(y);
      tree.insert(y, z);
    }
  }
}
```

Please note that the changes are subtle and might not result in drastic improvements as the given code is already quite efficient.
