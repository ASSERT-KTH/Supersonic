Optimization steps:

1. The `#import` directive is typically used in Objective-C. For portability, in C++ we should use `#include` instead.
2. The `#define z std::cin >>` might save some typing, but it decreases readability and might lead to bugs and confusion in larger programs. It is better to use `std::cin >>` directly where needed.
3. Allocating an array with 256 integers `int d[256] = {};` for each iteration of the outer for loop may be unnecessary and slow down the program, depending on the usage.
4. The `puts("");` statement in the for loop is used to print a newline. It's clearer to use `std::cout << std::endl;` or `std::cout << '\n';`
5. The `putchar(a + d[a])` is a C-style output. It's better to use `std::cout << char(a + d[a]);` for C++ style output.
6. We can use pre-increment/decrement (`--n`) instead of post-increment/decrement (`n--`) where the result is not used. It can be faster because post-increment/decrement need to increment/decrement the value and return the original value that was not incremented/decremented.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  for (char a, b; std::cin >> n, n; std::cout << '\n') {
    int d[256] = {};
    for (; n--; d[a] = b - a)
      std::cin >> a >> b;
    for (std::cin >> n; n--; std::cout << char(a + d[a]))
      std::cin >> a;
  }
}
```

Please note that the optimization here is minor, and the main difference is the style of the code, which is more in line with common C++ practices. The runtime and memory usage are essentially the same. Whether pre or post increment/decrement operators make a difference in performance is highly dependent on the compiler and the specific situation. In most cases, modern compilers can optimize this so that there is no difference in performance.
