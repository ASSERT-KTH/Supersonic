This program reads pairs of characters and their offsets from the input, stores these offsets in an array, and then applies these offsets to a new set of input characters.

The optimizations that can be applied to this program are:

1. Avoid using macros unnecessarily: In C++, macros are often avoided because they can lead to hard-to-debug errors. In this case, `#define z std::cin >>` does not save any significant amount of typing, and it makes the program harder to understand.

2. Use `std::endl` instead of `puts("")`: `puts("")` writes a newline and then immediately flushes the stream, which can be slower than necessary. `std::endl` does the same thing, but in C++, it is usually preferred over `puts("")`.

3. Pre-declare variables outside the loop: Variables `a` and `b` can be declared once outside the loop instead of being re-declared in each iteration.

4. Use `std::cout` instead of `putchar`: `putchar` is a C-style function that can be slower than `std::cout` in C++. Also, `std::cout` is generally more idiomatic in C++.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  char a, b;
  int n;
  while (std::cin >> n && n) {
    int d[256] = {};
    for (; n--; d[a] = b - a)
      std::cin >> a >> b;
    std::cin >> n;
    for (; n--; std::cout << static_cast<char>(a + d[a]))
      std::cin >> a;
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }
}
```
Note: The original program has a non-traditional structure which makes it a bit hard to understand. The optimized version might look quite different, but it is doing the same thing.
