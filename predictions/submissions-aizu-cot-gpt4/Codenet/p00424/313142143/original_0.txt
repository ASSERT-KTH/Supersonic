Step 1: Use scanf and printf functions instead of cin and cout because they are faster. The reason for this is that cin and cout need to keep synchronization with the stdio streams, which makes them slower.

Step 2: Use a constant for the size of the array instead of hardcoding it. This makes maintenance easier because you only need to change the value in one place if you want to change the size of the array.

Step 3: Use pre-increment and pre-decrement operators instead of post-increment and post-decrement operators because they are faster. The post-increment and post-decrement operators create a temporary copy of the object, increment or decrement the value, and then return the temporary copy. The pre-increment and pre-decrement operators increment or decrement the value and return the reference to the object.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary std:: prefixes because we have already used the using directive.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary puts("") because putchar('\n') is enough to add a newline.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

#define SIZE 256
#define z scanf("%c", &

int main() {
    int n;
    for (char a, b; z n) && n; putchar('\n')) {
        int d[SIZE] = {};
        for (; --n; d[a] = b - a)
            z a), scanf("%c", &b);
        for (z n); --n; putchar(a + d[a]))
            z a);
    }
}
```
