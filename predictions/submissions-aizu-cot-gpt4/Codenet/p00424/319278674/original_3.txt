The given C code seems to have a lot of issues and it's not clear what the code is trying to accomplish, but here are some optimizations and improvements that could be applied to the code:

1. Use meaningful variable names: This is not an optimization for running time or memory usage, but it's an essential part of writing good, maintainable code. Use names that describe what the variable is used for.

2. Avoid using `scanf` in condition: `scanf` returns the number of items successfully read. This count can match the expected number of readings, or fewer, or even zero, if a matching failure occurs. In the event of an input failure before any data could be successfully interpreted, EOF is returned. So, using `scanf` in the condition of the outer `for` loop could potentially lead to an infinite loop if the input is not an integer.

3. Avoid unnecessary `bzero`: The `bzero` function sets the first n bytes of the area starting at s to zero. It's used here to initialize the array `t` to zero. However, the second `for` loop immediately overwrites this memory, so the `bzero` call is unnecessary and could be removed.

4. Avoid unnecessary multiplication: The `bzero` function takes the number of bytes as an argument, not the number of elements. The size of an int in C is 4 bytes, so `999 * 4` is the correct size. However, this multiplication is unnecessary since we can use the `sizeof` operator, which returns the size in bytes, to get the size of the array.

5. Avoid using `scanf` and `putchar` in the loop: These functions are much slower than simple arithmetic and array access. We can read all input at once before the loop, and write all output at once after the loop. This is called "buffering" the input/output, and it can greatly improve the performance of the program.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int arrSize = 999;
char n, t[999];

int main() {
  while (scanf("%d", &n) == 1) {
    memset(t, 0, sizeof(t));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf(" %c %c", &n, &t[i]);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
      printf("%c", !t[i] * i + t[i]);
      
    printf("\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note this optimised version is still unclear and it's based on assumptions. The original version of the program seems to have a lot of issues, and it's unclear what it's supposed to be doing. The best way to optimize it would be to rewrite it from scratch, with a clear understanding of the problem it's trying to solve.
