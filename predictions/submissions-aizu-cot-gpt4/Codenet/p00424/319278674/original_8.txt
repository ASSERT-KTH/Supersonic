The program provided is already quite optimized in terms of lines of code, but there are a few points that can be improved for better performance and readability:

1. Use of `bzero` function: The `bzero` function is deprecated and its use is not recommended. Instead, `memset` function can be used which provides a better and more efficient way to set the memory.
2. The use of `scanf` function: The `scanf` function is used in a loop which can be expensive in terms of performance. It's better to read the input once and process it later. However, in this case it seems that the nature of the program doesn't allow that.
3. Variable declaration: The variables in the main function are declared without type which is not good practice and can lead to confusion. It's better to explicitly specify the type of the variables.

Optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int n, t[999];
int main() {
  int i;
  for (; n *= scanf("%d", &n); puts("")) {
    memset(t, 0, sizeof(t));
    for (; n--; t[i] = *t)
      scanf(" %c %c", &i, t);
    for (scanf("%d", &n); n--; putchar(!t[i] * i + t[i]))
      scanf(" %c", &i);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, `bzero` function is replaced with `memset` function. Also, type of variable `i` is explicitly specified.
