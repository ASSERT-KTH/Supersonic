I'll make a few assumptions about your code given that it's quite difficult to read in its current state. I am assuming that `n` is the number of inputs, `t` is an array that stores character inputs and their corresponding ASCII values, and `i` is the input character.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the optimizations:

1. **Variable Initialization**: `n` and `i` are not explicitly initialized. This can potentially lead to undefined behavior. 

2. **Array Size**: The size of array `t` is unnecessarily large. This wastes memory. 

3. **Using `bzero`**: `bzero` is an old function and isn't a standard C function. It's better to use `memset` instead, which is a standard C function.

4. **Input/Output Methods**: Using `scanf` and `printf` is slower than using `getchar` and `putchar`. This is because `scanf` and `printf` have to parse the format string, which takes extra time.

5. **Multiplication in Loop Condition**: The multiplication operation `n *= scanf("%d", &n)` in the first `for` loop is unnecessary and can cause problems if `scanf` doesn't return `1`.

Here's the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h> 

int main() {
    int n = 0, i = 0;
    char t[128]; // Assuming ASCII values

    while ((n = getchar()) != EOF) {
        memset(t, 0, sizeof(t));

        while (n--) {
            i = getchar();
            t[i] = getchar();
        }
        
        n = getchar();
        while (n--) {
            i = getchar();
            putchar(!t[i] ? i : t[i]);
        }
        putchar('\n');
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code assumes that `n` and `i` are single characters, and that `getchar()` reads them correctly. If `n` and `i` are integers or some other data type, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.

Please note that the above program is optimized based on certain assumptions. The original code lacks clarity for a precise optimization.
