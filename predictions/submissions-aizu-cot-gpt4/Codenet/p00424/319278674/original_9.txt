The given C/C++ program has a lot of inefficiencies and some parts of the code that can be improved. Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Avoid using bzero: it is an old function and memset is preferred over it for setting memory to a particular value. Also, we use sizeof to get the correct size of the array.

2. The 'n' variable is used without any initialization. It should be initialized.

3. The 'i' variable is used as a character in scanf and as an index in the array. This can lead to problems as it's not clear if it's meant to be a character or an integer.

4. The variable 'i' is used as a parameter in the main function which is not a standard practice. It is better to use int main(void) or int main(int argc, char *argv[]).

5. The 'scanf' function is used without checking its return value. If it fails to read the input, it can lead to problems.

6. The 'scanf' is used with a space before '%c' which can cause performance issues as it will skip all whitespace characters until a non-whitespace is found.

Given these issues, the optimized code is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int n, t[999];
int main(void) {
  char i;
  while (scanf("%d", &n) == 1) {
    memset(t, 0, sizeof t);
    while (n--) {
      scanf(" %c", &i);
      t[i] = *t;
    }
    if(scanf("%d", &n) == 1) {
      while (n--) {
        scanf(" %c", &i);
        putchar(!t[i] * i + t[i]);
      }
    }
    puts("");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This code is more efficient in terms of both memory usage and running time. It is also easier to read and understand.
