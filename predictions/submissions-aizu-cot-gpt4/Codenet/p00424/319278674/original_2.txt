The given program is already quite optimized. It appears to be an obfuscated C program, which makes it tricky to optimize further without losing its obfuscation.

However, there are still a few small improvements we can make:

1. The use of `bzero` function to reset the array `t` is deprecated in some systems. Instead, we can use `memset`, which is more standard and portable.

2. Although the program is obfuscated, it seems to be using `scanf` and `putchar` in a loop to read and write characters. This is inefficient because each call to `scanf` and `putchar` has a significant overhead. Instead, we can read and write all characters at once using `fgets` and `fputs`, which are much faster for large amounts of data.

3. The condition in the first loop `n *= scanf("%d", &n)` is cryptic. Since `scanf` returns the number of input items successfully matched and assigned, this condition is true if `n` is non-zero and the input is successfully read. We can simplify this condition to `while(scanf("%d", &n) == 1 && n != 0)`.

4. The `putchar(!t[i] * i + t[i])` line is a cryptic way of printing either `i` or `t[i]`, depending on whether `t[i]` is 0. We can make this clearer by using a conditional expression `putchar(t[i] ? t[i] : i)`.

5. The `t[i] = *t` line is a cryptic way of setting `t[i]` to the first character of the input string. We can make this clearer by using `t[i] = t[0]`.

After making these changes, the optimized program is:

```c
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>

n, t[999];
int main(i) {
  while (scanf("%d", &n) == 1 && n != 0) {
    memset(t, 0, 999 * sizeof(int));
    for (; n--; t[i] = t[0])
      scanf(" %c %c", &i, t);
    scanf("%d", &n);
    char buf[1000];
    fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), stdin);
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      i = buf[j];
      putchar(t[i] ? t[i] : i);
    }
    puts("");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the obfuscation level of the code has been reduced and the readability has been improved to some extent. This is a trade-off when we optimize the code.
