The given C/C++ program is quite complex and hard to understand due to its unconventional syntax and usage of variables. However, I will try my best to provide some optimization steps:

1. The variable 'n' is used before it's initialized, this is undefined behavior in C/C++. Initialize it before using.
2. The array 't' is declared with size 999. This could be a waste of memory if n is much less than 999. Consider using dynamic memory allocation to only allocate as much memory as required.
3. The function 'bzero' is deprecated and might not be portable. It's better to use 'memset' instead.
4. The 'i' variable is declared in the function parameter list, it would be better to declare it in the local scope for better readability.
5. The '*t' seems to be implicitly cast to int in 'putchar', this could lead to unexpected values if '*t' is not 0 or 1. It's better to explicitly cast it to int.

Now let's implement these optimizations:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  int n = 0;
  int* t = NULL;
  int i = 0;

  while(scanf("%d", &n), n) {
    t = (int*)realloc(t, n * sizeof(int));
    memset(t, 0, n * sizeof(int));
    
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf(" %c %c", &i, &t[i]);
    
    for(scanf("%d", &n); n--; putchar(!t[i] * i + (int)t[i]))
      scanf(" %c", &i);
    putchar('\n');
  }

  free(t);
  return 0;
}
```

Notice: This optimized version assumes that the input is always valid, which is the same assumption as the original version. If the input might not be valid, you might need to add some error checking code.
