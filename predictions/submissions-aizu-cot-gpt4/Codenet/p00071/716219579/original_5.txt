This program is already quite optimized, but there are few steps we can take to make it even more efficient. 

1. Reducing the scope of variable declarations: Variables 's', 'n', 'y', 'x' and 'M' are declared at the global scope but they are only used in the 'main' function. We can move these declarations to main(). This will make the memory usage more efficient, as these variables will only exist during the execution of the main function. Also, it's a good practice to limit the scope of variables as much as possible.

2. Using 'constexpr' for constants: Constants 'dx' and 'dy' can be declared with the 'constexpr' keyword. This keyword tells the compiler that the value of the variable is constant and known at compile time. This can optimize the runtime as the compiler can substitute the value of the constant directly in the compiled code. 

3. Reducing array size: In 'solve' function, for each direction, the loop runs up to 3 times. This means, the function at most checks the neighbors which are 3 steps away. So, there is no need for the 'M' array to have a size of 9x9. It can be reduced to 8x8 which will save some memory. 

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
#include <fstream>
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <numeric>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <sstream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
#include <utility>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;
#define FOR(i, a, b) for (long long i = (a); i < (b); i++)
#define REP(i, N) for (long long i = 0; i < (N); i++)
#define ALL(s) (s).begin(), (s).end()
#define fi first
#define se second
#define PI acos(-1.0)
#define INF 1e9 + 7
#define MOD 1e9 + 7
#define EPS 1e-10

typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<ll, ll> P;
typedef vector<ll> V;

constexpr int dx[] = {1, 0, -1, 0};
constexpr int dy[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};

void solve(int y, int x, int M[8][8]) {
  M[y][x] = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
      int ny = y + dy[i] * j, nx = x + dx[i] * j;
      if (ny >= 0 && ny < 8 && nx >= 0 && nx < 8) {
        if (M[ny][nx] == 1)
          solve(ny, nx, M);
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  string s;
  int n;
  int y, x, M[8][8];
  cin >> n;
  REP(i, n) {
    REP(j, 8) {
      cin >> s;
      REP(k, 8) { M[j][k] = s[k] - '0'; }
    }
    cin >> x >> y;
    solve(y - 1, x - 1, M);
    cout << "Data " << i + 1 << ":" << endl;
    REP(j, 8) {
      REP(k, 8) { cout << M[j][k]; }
      cout << endl;
    }
  }
}
```
Note: This optimization won't make a noticeable difference in the running time or memory usage for this specific program, but it's a good practice to follow these steps for larger and complex programs.
