The program seems to be performing depth-first search on an 8x8 grid. The optimizations I can suggest are:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program has included many libraries that it doesn't seem to use. This can potentially slow down the compilation time. We should only include what we need.

2. Unnecessary macro definitions: Macros like FOR, ALL, fi, se, PI, INF, MOD, EPS are not used in the code. We can remove these.

3. Redundant calculations: In the solve function, the calculation of nx and ny can be moved inside the if condition to save some computations.

4. Avoid using global variables: The input grid M, s, and the variables x, y, n were declared as global variables. It's better practice to pass these as parameters to functions whenever possible.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
typedef vector<ll> V;

void solve(int M[9][9], int y, int x) {
    int dx[] = {1, 0, -1, 0};
    int dy[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
    M[y][x] = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
            if (y + dy[i] * j >= 0 && y + dy[i] * j < 8 && x + dx[i] * j >= 0 && x + dx[i] * j < 8) {
                int ny = y + dy[i] * j, nx = x + dx[i] * j;
                if (M[ny][nx] == 1)
                    solve(M, ny, nx);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, x, y;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int M[9][9];
        string s;
        for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
            cin >> s;
            for (int k = 0; k < 8; k++) {
                M[j][k] = s[k] - '0';
            }
        }
        cin >> x >> y;
        solve(M, y - 1, x - 1);
        cout << "Data " << i + 1 << ":" << endl;
        for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k < 8; k++) {
                cout << M[j][k];
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    }
}
```

In the optimized version, I have moved the dx[] and dy[] arrays to the scope of the solve function as they are not needed elsewhere. I have also removed all the unused includes and macros. I have made the M matrix, s, x, y, n local to the main function and pass M as an argument to the solve function. The calculation of nx and ny is now inside the if condition to avoid unnecessary calculations.
