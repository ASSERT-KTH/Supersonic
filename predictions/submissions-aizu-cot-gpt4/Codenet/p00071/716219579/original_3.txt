The above program seems to be a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm on a 2D grid. It reads a given number of 8x8 grids from the input, applies the DFS from a given point, and outputs the resulting grid.

Optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary imports: The code imports several libraries that it doesn't use, such as algorithm, bitset, cmath, complex, functional, map, numeric, queue, set, stack, utility, and vector. Removing these will improve the compilation time.

2. Use bool array instead of int: The matrix M only stores 0s and 1s, so you can use a boolean array instead of an integer array to save memory.

3. Limit the scope of variables: The variables y, x, and s are only used inside the main function, so they should be declared there to limit their scope and improve readability.

4. Avoid multiplication in the loop: In the solve function, y and x coordinates are calculated in the loop with multiplication operation. We can avoid this by simply adding dx[i] and dy[i] iteratively.

5. Remove unnecessary checks: In the solve function, we're checking if ny and nx are within the bounds of the matrix for every j, but we only need to do this once per i.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
#define REP(i, N) for (long long i = 0; i < (N); i++)
typedef long long ll;
bool M[9][9];
int dx[] = {1, 0, -1, 0};
int dy[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
void solve(int y, int x) {
  M[y][x] = false;
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    int ny = y, nx = x;
    for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
      ny += dy[i]; nx += dx[i];
      if (ny >= 0 && ny < 8 && nx >= 0 && nx < 8) {
        if (M[ny][nx])
          solve(ny, nx);
      } else break;
    }
  }
}
int main() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  REP(i, n) {
    string s;
    REP(j, 8) {
      cin >> s;
      REP(k, 8) { M[j][k] = s[k] - '0'; }
    }
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    solve(y - 1, x - 1);
    cout << "Data " << i + 1 << ":" << endl;
    REP(j, 8) {
      REP(k, 8) { cout << M[j][k]; }
      cout << endl;
    }
  }
}
```

This optimized code should run faster and use less memory than the original version.
