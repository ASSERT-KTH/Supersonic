Optimization Steps:

1. One of the most noticeable optimization that we can do is to avoid the multiplication inside the loop of the solve function. Instead of multiplying j with dx[i] and dy[i] for each iteration, we can add dx[i] and dy[i] to ny and nx respectively in each iteration.

2. Another thing is to replace the long long data type with int. Long long takes 8 bytes while int takes 4 bytes. Since we do not have any large numbers that need long long data type, replacing it with int will save memory.

3. We don't need to use 'long long' for the loop variables, as they will never exceed the size of an 'int'.

4. Variables 'y', 'x', and 's' are declared globally but they can be declared locally which will make the scope smaller thus improving memory usage.

5. We can also remove some of the unused includes which will reduce compile time.

6. The macros PI, INF, MOD, EPS are defined but never used. We can remove them.

Now let's write the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define REP(i, N) for (int i = 0; i < (N); i++)
typedef vector<int> V;
int M[9][9];
int dx[] = {1, 0, -1, 0};
int dy[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
void solve(int y, int x) {
  M[y][x] = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    int ny = y, nx = x;
    for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
      ny += dy[i]; nx += dx[i];
      if (ny >= 0 && ny < 8 && nx >= 0 && nx < 8) {
        if (M[ny][nx] == 1)
          solve(ny, nx);
      }
    }
  }
}
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  REP(i, n) {
    string s;
    REP(j, 8) {
      cin >> s;
      REP(k, 8) { M[j][k] = s[k] - '0'; }
    }
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    solve(y - 1, x - 1);
    cout << "Data " << i + 1 << ":" << endl;
    REP(j, 8) {
      REP(k, 8) { cout << M[j][k]; }
      cout << endl;
    }
  }
}
```
This code should perform better in terms of memory and runtime.
