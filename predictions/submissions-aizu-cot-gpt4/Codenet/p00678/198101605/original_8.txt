# Optimizations:

1. **Avoiding redundant computations:** The `dist()` function is called twice in the loop for the same set of points. The result of the first call can be stored in a variable and reused in the second call. This will cut the computation time in half for this line of code.

2. **Reducing function overhead by direct calculations:** The function `add()` is called inside the `operator+` and `operator-` methods of struct `point`. This function is simply adding two numbers with a minor condition. Replacing the function call with the direct implementation can eliminate the function call overhead.

3. **Eliminating redundant object construction:** In the `operator+` and `operator-` methods of struct `point`, a new `point` object is created and returned. The current object's (`this`) attributes can be updated directly to avoid new object creation.

4. **Using `reserve()` for vectors:** The `push_back()` method of vectors can possibly cause a reallocation of the entire vector when the vector's capacity is exceeded. By using the `reserve()` method, we can preallocate memory for the vector and avoid this reallocation.

5. **Reducing memory consumption by using `std::array` instead of `std::vector` for `P` and `V`:** Since `n` is a fixed size, we know the maximum size of `P` and `V` in advance. Therefore, it's more memory-efficient to use `std::array` instead of `std::vector`.
