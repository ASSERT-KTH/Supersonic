Here is the step by step optimization for the given C/C++ program:

1. Remove Unused Libraries: The program includes many libraries that are not used in the code. Removing these will not directly impact run time, but it will decrease the compilation time and the program's memory footprint.

2. Avoid Global Variables: The program uses global variables for array data. It's generally a good idea to avoid global variables if possible. They can make a program difficult to understand and debug. However, in this case, we will keep them as is due to the size constraint of function stack memory for arrays.

3. Avoid Unnecessary Copy: The program is using std::queue to store and retrieve elements. In this scenario, std::queue is not the best choice because it unnecessarily copies objects when inserting and removing them from the queue. We can use std::deque instead, which allows efficient insertion and removal of elements from both ends of the container.

4. Avoid Memory Allocation: The program is using a two-dimensional array to store the field. This can lead to unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation. We can avoid this by using a one-dimensional array and accessing it as a two-dimensional array.

5. Use Fast I/O Operations: The program uses cin and cout for input and output. These are slower compared to scanf and printf. So, we can use scanf and printf for faster I/O operations. However, in this case, the difference is negligible and does not affect the running time significantly.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <algorithm>
#include <deque>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, x) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(x); ++i)
#define all(a) a.begin(), a.end()
#define PB push_back

      if (0 <= tx1 && tx1 <= w)
        xs.PB(tx1);
      if (0 <= tx2 && tx2 <= w)
        xs.PB(tx2);
    }
  }
  sort(all(xs));
  xs.erase(unique(all(xs)), end(xs));

    x1[i] = lower_bound(all(xs), x1[i]) - begin(xs);
    x2[i] = lower_bound(all(xs), x2[i]) - begin(xs);
  }
  return xs.size();
}

    memset(fld, 0, sizeof fld);
    rep(i, n) { scanf("%d%d%d%d", &x1[i], &y1[i], &x2[i], &y2[i]); }
    w = compress(x1, x2, w);
    h = compress(y1, y2, h);

      if (fld[y][x])
        continue;
      ans++;
      deque<pii> q;
      q.push_back(pii(y, x));
      while (!q.empty()) {
        pii p = q.front();
        q.pop_front();
        rep(i, 4) {
          int ny = p.first + dy[i], nx = p.second + dx[i];
          if (ny < 0 || ny >= h - 1 || nx < 0 || nx >= w - 1 || fld[ny][nx])
