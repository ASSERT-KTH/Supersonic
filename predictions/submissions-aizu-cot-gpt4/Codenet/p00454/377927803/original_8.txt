Here are some steps that could potentially optimize this program:

1. Reduce the scope of the variables: Many variables are declared at the top of the program, making their scope throughout the entire program. This could potentially lead to unwanted side effects if a variable is accidentally used in the wrong place. Declare the variables in the smallest scope possible.

2. Use standard functions: The program has defined its own min, max functions. It would be beneficial to use the standard functions provided by C++ STL.

3. Avoid using macros: Macros are preprocessed and can lead to unintended side-effects. Use functions or constants instead.

4. The size of the 2D array fld can be reduced. It is currently larger than required. The extra space could be used by other programs or by the same program in different parts.

5. Prefer ++i over i++ in loops: This avoids unnecessary temporary object creation and destruction.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

constexpr int inf = 1e9;
constexpr long long linf = 3e18;
constexpr double eps = 1e-9;
constexpr int dx[4] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
constexpr int dy[4] = {0, -1, 0, 1};

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);

  int w, h, n;
  while (cin >> w >> h, w) {
    cin >> n;

    vector<int> x1(n), x2(n), y1(n), y2(n);
    vector<vector<bool>> fld(h, vector<bool>(w, false));

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> x1[i] >> y1[i] >> x2[i] >> y2[i];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      for (int y = y1[i]; y <= y2[i] - 1; ++y) {
        for (int x = x1[i]; x <= x2[i] - 1; ++x) {
          fld[y][x] = true;
        }
      }
    }

    int ans = 0;
    for (int y = 0; y < h - 1; ++y) {
      for (int x = 0; x < w - 1; ++x) {
        if (fld[y][x])
          continue;
        ans++;
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        q.push(make_pair(y, x));
        while (!q.empty()) {
          pair<int, int> p = q.front();
          q.pop();
          for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
            int ny = p.first + dy[i], nx = p.second + dx[i];
            if (ny < 0 || ny >= h - 1 || nx < 0 || nx >= w - 1 || fld[ny][nx])
              continue;
            fld[ny][nx] = true;
            q.push(make_pair(ny, nx));
          }
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
