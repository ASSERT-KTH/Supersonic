This given program is written in C++. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) to solve a problem. There are several ways to optimize this program, including reducing function calls, optimizing input/output, and removing unnecessary calculations.

Optimization Steps:

1. Input/output optimization: `iostream` is much slower than `stdio.h`. So, if we replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`, the program will run faster. Also, we can turn off synchronization with the C standard I/O, which will speed up `cout` and `cin`.

2. Function Call Optimization: In the given program, function dfs is called inside a loop. Recursive function calls are generally slower and consume more memory. We can try to convert the DFS function to use iteration instead of recursion, but here it's not so simple as the function contains complex logic and multiple recursive calls. So, it's better to keep it with some small optimizations, like avoiding multiple accesses to arrays inside conditions.

3. Memory Usage: The 'v' array is reset in a separate loop before DFS. It can be reset during DFS itself, reducing one complete cycle of loop.

Here is the optimized program based on these steps:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#define MAX 100100

int n, b[2][MAX], f[2][MAX];
bool v[MAX];

int dfs(int s, int now, int maxi, int num) {
  v[now] = true;
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    int b_now = b[i][now];
    int f_now = f[i][now];
    if (!v[b_now]) {
      if (maxi == f_now)
        num++;
      else if (maxi < f_now) {
        maxi = f_now;
        num = 1;
      }
      if (b_now == s)
        return num;
      return dfs(s, b_now, maxi, num);
    }
  }
  if (maxi == f[1][s])
    return num + 1;
  else if (maxi < f[1][s])
    return 1;
  else
    return num;
}

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  while (scanf("%d", &n), n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d %d %d %d", &b[0][i], &f[0][i], &b[1][i], &f[1][i]);
      v[i] = false;
    }
    int ans = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (!v[i]) {
        v[i] = true;
        ans = (ans * dfs(i, b[0][i], f[0][i], 1)) % 10007;
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that while these optimizations can improve the program's performance, they don't guarantee that the program will always run faster, especially for the larger inputs. The actual performance can depend on various factors, including the compiler, the hardware, and the specific inputs to the program.
