This program can be optimized by eliminating the recursion in the `dfs` function and replacing it with a loop. Recursion is generally slower due to the overhead of function calls and could lead to stack overflow for large inputs. The advantage of using a loop is not only that it's faster, but it also avoids the risk of a stack overflow.

Firstly, we remove the recursion and replace it with a while loop. This loop will continue until we encounter a node that we have visited before.

Secondly, we modify the for loop to continue to the next iteration when encountering a visited node, instead of returning immediately. This allows the function to consider all neighbors of the current node, not just the first one it encounters.

Lastly, we move the conditions after the for loop inside the while loop, to check them for each visited node. We also add a condition to break the loop when we return to the starting node.

The optimized code is as follows:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int n, b[2][100100], f[2][100100];
bool v[100100];

int dfs(int s, int now, int maxi, int num) {
  v[now] = true;
  while (true) {
    bool found = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
      if (!v[b[i][now]]) {
        found = true;
        if (maxi == f[i][now])
          num++;
        else if (maxi < f[i][now]) {
          maxi = f[i][now];
          num = 1;
        }
        now = b[i][now];
        v[now] = true;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (!found) {
      if (maxi == f[1][s])
        return num + 1;
      else if (maxi < f[1][s])
        return 1;
      else
        return num;
    }
    if (now == s)
      break;
  }
  return num;
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> b[0][i] >> f[0][i] >> b[1][i] >> f[1][i];
      v[i] = false;
    }
    int ans = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (!v[i]) {
        v[i] = true;
        ans = (ans * dfs(i, b[0][i], f[0][i], 1)) % 10007;
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

The optimization here focuses on improving the running time of the program by removing recursion and replacing it with a while loop. This change should make the program both faster and safer for large inputs.
