Here are the steps to optimize this program:

1. Reduce the use of global variables: Global variables are generally slower to access than local variables because they can be located anywhere in memory. They also consume memory for the entire duration of the program. In this program, the variables `n`, `b`, `f`, and `v` are global. We can make them local by passing them as parameters to the `dfs` function and defining them in the `main` function.

2. Use more efficient I/O operations: The `cin` and `cout` operations are slower than the C-style `scanf` and `printf` operations. We can replace them to improve the program's runtime.

3. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: In this program, the 2D arrays `b` and `f` have fixed sizes. However, if `n` is less than `100100`, then a lot of memory is being wasted. We can allocate memory dynamically based on the value of `n` to avoid this.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool dfs(int s, int now, int maxi, int num, vector<vector<int>>& b, vector<vector<int>>& f, vector<bool>& v) {
  v[now] = true;
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    if (!v[b[i][now]]) {
      if (maxi == f[i][now])
        num++;
      else if (maxi < f[i][now]) {
        maxi = f[i][now];
        num = 1;
      }
      if (b[i][now] == s)
        return num;
      return dfs(s, b[i][now], maxi, num, b, f, v);
    }
  }
  if (maxi == f[1][s])
    return num + 1;
  else if (maxi < f[1][s])
    return 1;
  else
    return num;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  while (scanf("%d", &n), n) {
    vector<vector<int>> b(2, vector<int>(n));
    vector<vector<int>> f(2, vector<int>(n));
    vector<bool> v(n, false);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d %d %d %d", &b[0][i], &f[0][i], &b[1][i], &f[1][i]);
    }
    
    int ans = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (!v[i]) {
        v[i] = true;
        ans = (ans * dfs(i, b[0][i], f[0][i], 1, b, f, v)) % 10007;
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
  }
}
```

This optimized program has the same functionality as the original one, but it is more efficient in terms of running time and memory usage.
