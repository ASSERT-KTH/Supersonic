1. Optimize the Initialization: Instead of using `fill()` function to initialize the array `dp` in each iteration of the loop, we can initialize it once at the beginning of the `main()` function. This will reduce the time complexity of the program, as the `fill()` function has a time complexity of O(n^2) for each call.

2. Optimize the Calculation: Instead of multiplying the result of `solve()` by 1 when `times` is 0, we can directly use the result of `solve()` as it is. This will not reduce the time complexity of the program, but it will make the program cleaner and more readable.

3. Optimize the Precision: The precision of the final result is being reduced to two decimal places twice, once when it is being multiplied by 100 and once when it is being divided by 100. We can reduce the precision only once at the end, which will make the program cleaner and more efficient.

4. Optimize the Input/Output: Instead of using `cin` and `cout`, we can use `scanf` and `printf` which are faster.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
int n, m;
double dp[101][101];
double t[101][101];

double solve(int times, int prev) {
  if (dp[times][prev] != -1)
    return dp[times][prev];
  if (times == m)
    return dp[times][prev] = 1;
  double tmp = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    tmp = max(tmp, solve(times + 1, i) * (times == 0 ? 1 : t[prev][i]));
  }
  return dp[times][prev] = tmp;
}

int main(void) {
  fill((double *)dp, (double *)dp + 101 * 101, -1);
  while (scanf("%d %d", &n, &m), n | m) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        scanf("%lf", &t[i][j]);
      }
    }
    double retd = solve(0, 0) * 100;
    printf("%.2lf\n", round(retd) / 100);
  }
}
```
