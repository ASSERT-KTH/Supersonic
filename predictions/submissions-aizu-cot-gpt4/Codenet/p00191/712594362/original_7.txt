This C++ program can be optimized in a few ways:

1. Avoid Casting: Instead of casting the dp array to a double pointer and then filling it with -1, we can use the `fill_n` function from the `<algorithm>` library to fill the 2D array directly. This can save some memory and computation time.

2. Avoid Redundant Computation: Inside the `solve` function, there is redundant computation in the loop for `times == 0`. Instead of checking this condition inside the loop, we can check it outside and use the loop accordingly. This can save some running time.

3. Use Fast I/O: The `cin` and `cout` functions are slower as compared to `scanf` and `printf` functions. So, using `scanf` and `printf` can save some running time.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
int n, m;
double dp[101][101];
double t[101][101];
double solve(int times, int prev) {
  if (dp[times][prev] != -1)
    return dp[times][prev];
  if (times == m)
    return dp[times][prev] = 1;
  double tmp = -1;
  if (times == 0) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      tmp = max(tmp, solve(times + 1, i));
  } else {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      tmp = max(tmp, solve(times + 1, i) * t[prev][i]);
  }
  return dp[times][prev] = tmp;
}
int main(void) {
  while (scanf("%d %d", &n, &m), n | m) {
    fill_n(*dp, 101 * 101, -1);
    double retd;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        scanf("%lf", &t[i][j]);
      }
    }
    retd = solve(0, 0) * 100;
    printf("%.2lf\n", round(retd) / 100);
  }
}
```
Please note that these optimizations might not make a significant difference for small inputs but for large inputs and complex programs, such optimizations can lead to better performance.
