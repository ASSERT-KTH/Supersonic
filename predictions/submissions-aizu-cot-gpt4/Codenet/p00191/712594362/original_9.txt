The given C++ program is already quite optimized in terms of algorithmic approach. It uses dynamic programming to solve the problem, which is a very efficient way to solve this kind of problems. However, there are still some minor improvements that can be made.

Optimizations to be made:

1. Rather than filling the `dp` array using `std::fill` on each iteration of the main loop, we can initialize it once at the start of the program. This will make the program slightly faster and reduce memory usage, as we're not creating and destroying the `std::fill` object on each iteration.

2. `tmp` variable doesn't need to be reinitialized to `-1` each time the `solve` function is called. Instead, we can initialize it to `-1` once at the start of the program and then just update its value in the loop.

3. The condition `times == 0` is checked on each iteration of the loop inside the `solve` function. This is unnecessary, as the value of `times` doesn't change during the loop. We can move this check outside the loop to optimize the program.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int n, m;
double dp[101][101];
double t[101][101];
double tmp = -1;

double solve(int times, int prev) {
  if (dp[times][prev] != -1)
    return dp[times][prev];
  if (times == m)
    return dp[times][prev] = 1;
  if (times == 0) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      tmp = max(tmp, solve(times + 1, i));
    }
  } else {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      tmp = max(tmp, solve(times + 1, i) * t[prev][i]);
    }
  }
  return dp[times][prev] = tmp;
}
int main(void) {
  fill((double *)dp, (double *)dp + 101 * 101, -1);
  while (cin >> n >> m) {
    if (!(n | m))
      break;
    int ret;
    double retd;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        cin >> t[i][j];
      }
    }
    retd = solve(0, 0) * 100;
    printf("%.2lf\n", round(retd) / 100);
  }
}
```

Keep in mind that these changes are very minor and may not result in a significant improvement in performance. However, they are still good practices to follow when writing efficient code.
