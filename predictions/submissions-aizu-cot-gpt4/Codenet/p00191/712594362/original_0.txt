The given program is a Dynamic Programming (DP) solution for some problem. Here are some optimizations we can make:

1. Declare loop variables outside of the loop to avoid repeated declarations.
2. Replace cin and cout with scanf and printf. The former are slower because they have to sync with the stdio streams, while the latter are simple C functions that don't have that overhead.
3. The round function is not necessary as printf with "%.2lf" already rounds off to 2 decimal places.
4. The multiplication by 1 in the if condition is redundant and can be removed.

Let's implement these optimization steps:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
int n, m, i, j;
double dp[101][101];
double t[101][101];
double solve(int times, int prev) {
  if (dp[times][prev] != -1)
    return dp[times][prev];
  if (times == m)
    return dp[times][prev] = 1;
  double tmp = -1;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    tmp = max(tmp, solve(times + 1, i) * (times == 0 ? 1 : t[prev][i]));
  }
  return dp[times][prev] = tmp;
}
int main(void) {
  while (scanf("%d %d", &n, &m), (n | m)) {
    fill((double *)dp, (double *)dp + 101 * 101, -1);
    double retd;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        scanf("%lf", &t[i][j]);
      }
    }
    retd = solve(0, 0) * 100;
    printf("%.2lf\n", retd);
  }
}
```
Please note that declaring loop variables globally is generally not a good practice. However, in competitive programming, it is common to see this due to the tiny speed boost it can provide. In actual software development, you should usually avoid this.
