The program is a dynamic programming solution. It's already quite optimized in terms of the approach, but there are a few things we can tweak to potentially improve its performance.

Optimization steps:

1. Pass-by-reference: The function `solve` is recursive and it uses two integer parameters, `times` and `prev`. These parameters are passed by value, which means a copy is made for each function call. This is unnecessary and can slow down the program, especially for deep recursion. We can pass these parameters by reference instead.

2. Avoid repeated calculations: Inside the `for` loop in the `solve` function, there's a conditional that checks whether `times` is zero. If it's not, it multiplies `solve(times + 1, i)` by `t[prev][i]`. However, `solve(times + 1, i)` is calculated regardless of whether `times` is zero or not. We can move this calculation outside the conditional to avoid calculating it twice.

3. Use `std::fill_n` instead of `std::fill`: `std::fill` is not a good choice here because it requires two iterators. We can use `std::fill_n` instead, which takes a pointer and a size. This is a simpler and potentially faster approach.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int n, m;
double dp[101][101];
double t[101][101];

double solve(int &times, int &prev) {
  if (dp[times][prev] != -1)
    return dp[times][prev];
  if (times == m)
    return dp[times][prev] = 1;
  double tmp = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    double calc = solve(times + 1, i);
    if (times == 0) {
      tmp = max(tmp, calc);
    } else {
      tmp = max(tmp, calc * t[prev][i]);
    }
  }
  return dp[times][prev] = tmp;
}

int main(void) {
  while (cin >> n >> m) {
    if (!(n | m))
      break;
    fill_n(*dp, 101 * 101, -1);
    int ret;
    double retd;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        cin >> t[i][j];
      }
    }
    retd = solve(0, 0) * 100;
    printf("%.2lf\n", round(retd) / 100);
  }
}
```

Note: The optimization benefits may be small, as modern C++ compilers are highly optimized and sometimes can do these optimizations automatically. However, these steps are generally good practices from a software engineering perspective.
