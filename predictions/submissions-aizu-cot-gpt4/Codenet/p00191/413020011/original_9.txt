The main optimization that can be done in this program is using a bottom-up approach instead of a top-down approach. Currently, the solve function is using a top-down approach i.e., it calculates the value for a higher state using the values of lower states and if the value for the current state is already calculated, it just returns it. This approach is also known as Memoization. Although it saves computation time, it still takes stack space for the recursion. 

By changing it to a bottom-up approach (also known as Tabulation), we will compute the values for lower states first and use them to calculate the value of higher states. This will save both computation time and stack space as it removes the need for recursion. 

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#define REP(i, a, b) for (i = (a); i < (b); ++i)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
double a[101][101];
double dp[101][101];

double solve(int n, int m) {
  int i, j, k;
  for(i=0; i<n; i++) dp[i][1] = 1;
  for(i=2; i<=m; i++)
    for(j=0; j<n; j++)
      for(k=0; k<n; k++)
        dp[j][i] = MAX(dp[j][i], dp[k][i-1] * a[k][j]);
  double res = 0;
  for(i=0; i<n; i++) res = MAX(res, dp[i][m]);
  return res;
}

int main(void) {
  int n, m, i, j, k;
  double res;
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &m), n | m) {
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    rep(i, n) rep(j, n) scanf("%lf", &a[i][j]);
    res = solve(n, m);
    printf("%.2f\n", res);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This program is now optimized for both running time and memory usage. In addition to the change in approach, the memo array has been changed to a 2D array dp because we no longer need to store the state of p and k in the array. Instead, we iterate through all possible values of p and k in the solve function. This reduces the memory usage of the program. Also, the solve function no longer takes p and k as arguments. Instead, it calculates the maximum value for all possible values of p and k and returns it. This reduces the number of function calls which in turn reduces the running time of the program.
