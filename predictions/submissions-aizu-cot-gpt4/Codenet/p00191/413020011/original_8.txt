The given C/C++ program can be optimized by making the following modifications:

1. **Avoiding Recalculation**: The memoization technique is already used in the 'solve' function to avoid recalculating the same subproblems. However, the comparison `memo[p][m][k] > 0` also includes the case when memo[p][m][k] is exactly 0 but does not include negative values. We should use `isnan(memo[p][m][k])` instead, to check if memo[p][m][k] is not a number (which means it has not been computed yet). This way, even negative and zero values will be included in the memoization process.

2. **Memory Efficiency**: The program uses a 3D array `memo[101][101][101]` to store the results of subproblems. But it seems that the third dimension is never used (k is never used in the 'solve' function), so we can reduce the array to 2D: `memo[101][101]`.

3. **Floating-Point Comparisons**: Directly comparing floating-point numbers can sometimes lead to incorrect results due to precision issues. We can instead use a small threshold value, epsilon, to compare the floating-point numbers.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <cmath>
#define REP(i, a, b) for (i = (a); i < (b); ++i)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
double a[101][101];
double memo[101][101];
double epsilon = 1e-9;

double solve(int n, int m, int p) {
  double res;
  int i;
  if (m == 1)
    return 1;
  if (!isnan(memo[p][m]))
    return memo[p][m];
  res = 0;
  rep(i, n) res = MAX(res, solve(n, m - 1, i) * a[p][i]);
  return memo[p][m] = res;
}

int main(void) {
  int n, m, i, j;
  double res;
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &m), n | m) {
    for(i = 0; i < 101; i++)
      for(j = 0; j < 101; j++)
        memo[i][j] = NAN;
    rep(i, n) rep(j, n) scanf("%lf", &a[i][j]);
    res = 0;
    rep(i, n) rep(j, n) res = MAX(res, solve(n, m, i));
    printf("%.2f\n", res);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please, make sure to include the `<cmath>` library to use `isnan` and `NAN`.
