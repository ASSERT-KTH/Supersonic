The program can be optimized in a few ways.

1. **Memoization**: The solve function is called multiple times with the same parameters, which leads to redundant computation. This can be avoided by storing the results of the function calls in a memoization table (which you are already doing but not effectively). The memoization table should be checked at the beginning of the function, and if the result is present, it should be returned. This will greatly improve the runtime of the program.

2. **Avoiding redundant computation**: In the main function, the solve function is called multiple times with the same parameters. The results of these calls can be stored in a separate array and used when needed, instead of calling the function again. This will also reduce the runtime of the program.

3. **Variable Initialization**: Variables should be initialized at the time of declaration. This is a good practice and also helps avoid any issues related to uninitialized variables.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#define REP(i, a, b) for (i = (a); i < (b); ++i)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
double a[101][101];
double memo[101][101][101];

double solve(int n, int m, int k, int p) {
  if (m == 1)
    return 1;
  if (memo[p][m][k] > 0)
    return memo[p][m][k];
  
  int i;
  double res = 0;
  rep(i, n) res = MAX(res, solve(n, m - 1, p, i) * a[p][i]);
  return memo[p][m][k] = res;
}

int main(void) {
  int n, m, i, j, k;
  double res;
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &m), n | m) {
    memset(memo, 0, sizeof(memo));
    rep(i, n) rep(j, n) scanf("%lf", &a[i][j]);
    res = 0;
    rep(i, n) {
      double temp = 0;
      rep(j, n) temp = MAX(temp, solve(n, m, i, j));
      res = MAX(res, temp); 
    }
    printf("%.2f\n", res);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, we've avoided redundant computation by storing the result of `solve` function call into a `temp` variable. We then take the maximum of `res` and `temp` which essentially avoids redundant computations. This change will noticeably improve the runtime of the program. Also, the memoization in the `solve` function is now more effective.
