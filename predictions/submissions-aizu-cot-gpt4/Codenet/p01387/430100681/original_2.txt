This code is already fairly optimized, it uses efficient data structures and algorithms. However, there are a few micro-optimizations that can be made:

1. Avoid calling functions in a loop, especially when the function result does not change. This can be seen in the while loop in the `query` function where `Centroids[TreeIdxA].Deep` and `Centroids[TreeIdxB].Deep` are called multiple times. We can store the results in a variable and use it in the loop.

2. The `scanf` and `printf` functions are slower than `cin` and `cout` with ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), especially when dealing with large amounts of input/output.

3. The `RBST::build(RBST::dump(r))` call in the `rebuild` function creates a new vector, which can be expensive in terms of memory usage and time. It could be replaced by a function that modifies the existing tree in place.

4. The `dump` function can be optimized by reserving space for the vector before the loop.

5. The `Information` function is called multiple times with the same argument, the result can be stored to avoid repeated calculations.

Here is the optimized version of the code based on the points above:

```C++
...
void query(int a, int b, const function<void(int, int, int)> &f) {
  int TreeIdxA, TreeDepthA, TreeIdxB, TreeDepthB;
  tie(TreeIdxA, TreeDepthA) = Information(a);
  tie(TreeIdxB, TreeDepthB) = Information(b);
  int depthA = Centroids[TreeIdxA].Deep;
  int depthB = Centroids[TreeIdxB].Deep;
  while (TreeIdxA != TreeIdxB) {
    if (depthA > depthB) {
      f(TreeIdxA, 0, TreeDepthA + 1);
      tie(TreeIdxA, TreeDepthA) = Centroids[TreeIdxA].Up();
      depthA = Centroids[TreeIdxA].Deep;
    } else {
      f(TreeIdxB, 0, TreeDepthB + 1);
      tie(TreeIdxB, TreeDepthB) = Centroids[TreeIdxB].Up();
      depthB = Centroids[TreeIdxB].Deep;
    }
  }
  ...
}
...
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  ...
}
...
Node *rebuild(Node *r) {
  // some function that modifies the existing tree in place
  return modifyTreeInPlace(RBST::dump(r));
}
...
vector<Key> dump(Node *r) {
  vector<Key> v;
  v.reserve((size_t)count(r));
  auto it = begin(v);
  dump(r, it);
  return v;
}
...
inline pair<int, int> Information(int idx) {
  if (storedInformation.find(idx) == storedInformation.end()) { 
    storedInformation[idx] = make_pair(TreeIndex[idx], TreeDepth[idx]);
  }
  return storedInformation[idx];
}
...
```
Note that the actual performance gain from these optimizations may vary depending on the specific usage of the program. It's always a good idea to measure performance before and after applying optimizations to ensure they are effective.
