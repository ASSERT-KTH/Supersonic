This program is already well written and optimized to some extent, but there's a few things we can do to make it a bit more efficient. The changes include:

1. Minimize the use of dynamic memory allocation: The vector types in the program, such as `field`, `vertex`, `edge`, are dynamically allocated and de-allocated multiple times. This operation is costly. To speed up the program, we can allocate these vectors once and clear them instead of de-allocating and re-allocating them.

2. Avoid unnecessary copying of `visited` bitset in `cut_vertex`: The code is making a copy of the `visited` bitset in `cut_vertex`, which is not necessary. We can modify the `visited` bitset directly and restore it to its original state at the end of the function.

3. Minimize the number of times `bitset::count` is called: The function `bitset::count` is called multiple times in the program, it counts the number of bits set in the bitset and this operation is costly. We can minimize the number of times this function is called by storing the count in a variable and updating this variable whenever we set or reset a bit in the bitset.

Below is the optimized version of the program, with the above changes:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int N = 49;
int w, h;
vector<vector<int>> field(N, vector<int>(N));
int size;
vector<vector<int>> vertex(N, vector<int>(N));
vector<vector<int>> edge(N * N);
bitset<N> visited;
set<unsigned long long> memo;
int visitedCount = 0;
void make_graph() {
  // ... same code as before ...
}
void reachability(const int &from) {
  visited.set(from);
  ++visitedCount;
  for (const auto &to : edge[from])
    if (!visited[to])
      reachability(to);
}
bool cut_vertex(const int &from) {
  visited.set(from);
  ++visitedCount;
  for (const auto &to : edge[from]) {
    if (visited[to])
      continue;
    reachability(to);
    if (visitedCount != size) {
      visited.reset(from);
      --visitedCount;
      return true;
    }
  }
  if (visitedCount != size) {
    visited.reset(from);
    --visitedCount;
    return true;
  }
  visited.reset(from);
  --visitedCount;
  return false;
}
bool dfs(const int &start, int from) {
  // ... same code as before ...
}
bool solve() {
  visited.reset();
  visitedCount = 0;
  for (auto &vec : vertex)
    fill(vec.begin(), vec.end(), -1);
  for (auto &vec : edge)
    vec.clear();
  make_graph();
  memo.clear();
  for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y)
    for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x)
      if (!field[y][x])
        return dfs(vertex[y][x], vertex[y][x]);
  return false;
}
int main() {
  while (cin >> w >> h, w | h) {
    for (auto &line : field)
      for (auto &v : line)
        cin >> v;
    cout << (solve() ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
  }
}
```

Please note that the optimized program has to be tested to confirm that the optimization does not introduce any bugs and it actually improves the performance.
