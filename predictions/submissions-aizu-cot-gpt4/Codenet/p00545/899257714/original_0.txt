Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid unnecessary copies: The input values for the array "people" are being decremented right after they are read. This operation can be done while reading the input itself, thus saving time and avoiding unnecessary copy.

2. Use fast I/O methods: The cin and cout are slower for reading and writing operations. We can speed up these operations by disabling synchronization with C's standard streams and untying the cin and cout.

3. Avoid repeated calculations: The value of `A[people[i]]` is used multiple times. We can store this in a variable to avoid repeated calculation.

4. Use prefix decrement (--i) in for loop: For non-primitive types, prefix version (i.e., --i) avoid unnecessary temporary object creation and are generally more efficient.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <limits.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const ll MIN = -(LONG_LONG_MAX - 1);

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int N, Q;
  ll T;
  cin >> N >> T >> Q;
  ll people[1001];
  ll A[100001];
  int D[100001];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> A[i] >> D[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    cin >> people[i];
    --people[i];
  }
  ll east = MIN;
  ll west = MIN;
  ll t;
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    ll current_person = A[people[i]];
    if (D[people[i]] == 1) {
      east = current_person;
      for (ll j = people[i] + 1; j < N; j++) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          east = A[j];
        } else {
          t = (east + A[j]) / 2;
          break;
        }
      }
      if (T < abs(t - current_person)) {
        cout << current_person + T << "\n";
      } else {
        cout << t << "\n";
      }
    } else {
      west = current_person;
      for (ll j = people[i] - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          t = (west + A[j]) / 2;
          break;
        } else {
          west = A[j];
        }
      }
      if (T < abs(current_person - t)) {
        cout << current_person - T << "\n";
      } else {
        cout << t << "\n";
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
