The current implementation has a for loop that performs a linear search for every query. This is inefficient and leads to a time complexity of O(N*Q) in the worst case. As the number of elements (N) or queries (Q) increases, the program will take a longer time to execute. 

To optimize this, we can avoid unnecessary looping for each query. We can go through the array once, keep track of the east and west values, and calculate the t value in the same loop. 

The program is also using arrays to store a large amount of data. In C++, it's generally more efficient to use std::vector instead of arrays for dynamic data because vectors are dynamically sized and can grow as needed, which could potentially save memory. But in this case, as the size is not changing, we don't need to switch to vectors.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const ll MIN = -(LONG_LONG_MAX - 1);
int main() {
  int N, Q;
  ll T;
  cin >> N >> T >> Q;
  ll people[1001];
  ll A[100001];
  int D[100001];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> A[i] >> D[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    cin >> people[i];
    people[i]--;
  }
  ll east = MIN;
  ll west = MIN;
  ll t_east, t_west;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (D[i] == 1) {
      east = A[i];
      if (i < N - 1 && D[i + 1] == 2) {
        t_east = (east + A[i + 1]) / 2;
      }
    } else {
      west = A[i];
      if (i > 0 && D[i - 1] == 1) {
        t_west = (west + A[i - 1]) / 2;
      }
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    if (D[people[i]] == 1) {
      if (T < abs(t_east - A[people[i]])) {
        cout << A[people[i]] + T << endl;
      } else {
        cout << t_east << endl;
      }
    } else {
      if (T < abs(A[people[i]] - t_west)) {
        cout << A[people[i]] - T << endl;
      } else {
        cout << t_west << endl;
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The time complexity of the optimized program is O(N+Q), which is a great improvement over the previous version.
