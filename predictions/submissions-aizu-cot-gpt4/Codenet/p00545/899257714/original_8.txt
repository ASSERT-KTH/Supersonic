This code appears to be well-optimized already, but there are a few modifications we can make to improve it slightly.

Optimization Steps:

1. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` at the beginning of the main function. This will untie `cin` from `cout`, and disable synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding C streams. This can potentially speed up input and output operations.

2. Use `std::vector` instead of C-style arrays for `people`, `A` and `D`. This will provide better memory management as the size of the vectors can be adjusted dynamically based on the inputs, reducing unnecessary memory usage.

3. The `people` array can be filled in the same loop where its elements are read. This reduces the number of operations and can lead to a small speedup.

4. Instead of using `endl` to print a newline and flush the output stream, use `'\n'` to print a newline without flushing the stream. Flushing the stream is a relatively expensive operation and should be avoided if possible.

5. The variable `t` is not always initialized before being used. This can lead to unpredictable behavior. Initialize `t` to a known value before using it.

Now, let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const ll MIN = -(LONG_LONG_MAX - 1);

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int N, Q;
  ll T;
  cin >> N >> T >> Q;

  std::vector<ll> people(Q);
  std::vector<ll> A(N);
  std::vector<int> D(N);

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> A[i] >> D[i];
  }

  // Fill people array in the same loop where its elements are read
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    cin >> people[i];
    people[i]--;
  }

  ll east = MIN;
  ll west = MIN;
  ll t = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    if (D[people[i]] == 1) {
      east = A[people[i]];
      for (ll j = people[i] + 1; j < N; j++) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          east = A[j];
        } else {
          t = (east + A[j]) / 2;
          break;
        }
      }
      if (T < abs(t - A[people[i]])) {
        cout << A[people[i]] + T << '\n';
      } else {
        cout << t << '\n';
      }
    } else {
      west = A[people[i]];
      for (ll j = people[i] - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          t = (west + A[j]) / 2;
          break;
        } else {
          west = A[j];
        }
      }
      if (T < abs(A[people[i]] - t)) {
        cout << A[people[i]] - T << '\n';
      } else {
        cout << t << '\n';
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
