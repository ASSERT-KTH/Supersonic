The main optimization we can make here is to reduce the number of iterations in the for loop. We can do this by using binary search instead of linear search for finding the respective east and west values. 

For the optimization process:

1. Declare `A` and `D` as vectors because the size is initially unknown.
2. Sort the `A` and `D` vectors in ascending order. This will allow us to perform binary search on them.
3. Replace the linear search for `east` and `west` with binary search. This will reduce the time complexity from `O(N)` to `O(logN)`.
4. Remove the `people` array and directly take the input in a variable because we are using the value immediately in the loop and it's not being used anywhere else. This will reduce the memory usage.

Now, the optimized code will look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits.h>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const ll MIN = -(LONG_LONG_MAX - 1);

int main() {
  int N, Q;
  ll T;
  cin >> N >> T >> Q;
  
  vector<ll> A(N);
  vector<int> D(N);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> A[i] >> D[i];
  }
  
  sort(A.begin(), A.end());
  sort(D.begin(), D.end());

  ll east = MIN;
  ll west = MIN;
  ll t;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    int person;
    cin >> person;
    person--;
    
    if (D[person] == 1) {
      auto it = upper_bound(A.begin(), A.end(), A[person]);
      if (it != A.end()){
        east = *it;
        t = (east + A[person]) / 2;
      } else {
        t = A[person];
      }
      if (T < abs(t - A[person])) {
        cout << A[person] + T << endl;
      } else {
        cout << t << endl;
      }
    } else {
      auto it = lower_bound(A.begin(), A.end(), A[person]);
      if (it != A.begin()){
        west = *(--it);
        t = (west + A[person]) / 2;
      } else {
        t = A[person];
      }
      if (T < abs(A[person] - t)) {
        cout << A[person] - T << endl;
      } else {
        cout << t << endl;
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimized code assumes that the direction of the people (`D[i]`) is also sorted in the same order as their positions (`A[i]`). If this is not the case, the code will need further adjustments.
