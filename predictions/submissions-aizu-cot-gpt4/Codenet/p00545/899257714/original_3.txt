The given program reads N, T, Q, and arrays A and D from input. It then performs some computations based on the values of the arrays A and D for each value in the people array, and outputs the result. 

Optimizations:

1. Reduce the size of the arrays. Currently, the program uses fixed-size arrays of size 1001 and 100001, which may result in a waste of memory if the actual data is much smaller. To optimize memory usage, we could use dynamic arrays (std::vector in C++).

2. Avoiding unnecessary calculations. The program currently calculates `abs(t - A[people[i]])` twice when `D[people[i]] == 1` and `D[people[i]] != 1`. We can optimize this by calculating it once and storing it in a variable.

3. Avoiding unnecessary `endl`. Using `endl` flushes the output buffer, which can be a slow operation. If we only need to print a newline, we can use `"\n"` instead.

4. Using prefix increment (++i) instead of postfix (i++). In C++, the prefix increment operator can be more efficient than the postfix increment operator, because the postfix operator involves a copy operation.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits.h>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const ll MIN = -(LONG_LONG_MAX - 1);
int main() {
  int N, Q;
  ll T;
  cin >> N >> T >> Q;
  vector<ll> people(Q);
  vector<ll> A(N);
  vector<int> D(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    cin >> A[i] >> D[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; ++i) {
    cin >> people[i];
    --people[i];
  }
  ll east = MIN;
  ll west = MIN;
  ll t;
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; ++i) {
    ll diff;
    if (D[people[i]] == 1) {
      east = A[people[i]];
      for (ll j = people[i] + 1; j < N; ++j) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          east = A[j];
        } else {
          t = (east + A[j]) / 2;
          break;
        }
      }
      diff = abs(t - A[people[i]]);
      if (T < diff) {
        cout << A[people[i]] + T << "\n";
      } else {
        cout << t << "\n";
      }
    } else {
      west = A[people[i]];
      for (ll j = people[i] - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          t = (west + A[j]) / 2;
          break;
        } else {
          west = A[j];
        }
      }
      diff = abs(A[people[i]] - t);
      if (T < diff) {
        cout << A[people[i]] - T << "\n";
      } else {
        cout << t << "\n";
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program ensures a more efficient use of memory by using dynamic arrays. It also avoids unnecessary calculations and output buffer flushes.
