Here are the potential optimizations in the given program:

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is actually not a standard C++ library. It is a GCC specific library that includes all standard C++ libraries. It can slow down the compile time because it includes more files than you need. Therefore, it's better to include only the libraries that you actually use.

2. `using namespace std;`: It's not recommended to use this line in a large program because it can lead to name collision.

3. `#define rep(i, buckets, y) for (int i = (buckets); i < (y); ++i)`: This macro is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simple loop. Macros can lead to unreadable or confusing code and are discouraged in modern C++.

4. `#define debug(buckets) #buckets << "=" << (buckets)`: This macro is not used in the code and can be removed.

5. `#ifdef DEBUG #define _GLIBCbucketsbuckets_DEBUG #define print(buckets) std::cerr << debug(buckets) << " (L:" << __LINE__ << ")" << std::endl #else #define print(buckets) #endif`: This chunk of code is not used in the program and can be removed.

6. `const int inf = 1e9; const int64_t inf64 = 1e18; const double eps = 1e-9;`: These constants are not used in the program and can be removed.

7. `template <typename T> ostream &operator<<(ostream &os, const vector<T> &vec)`: This function is not used in the program and can be removed.

8. `using i64 = int64_t;`: This type alias is not used in the program and can be removed.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

struct sqrt_decomp {
  const int bucket_size = 256;
  int length, bucket_num;
  std::vector<std::vector<int>> buckets;
  std::vector<int> update, bucket_sum;
  sqrt_decomp(const std::vector<int> &x)
      : length(x.size()),
        bucket_num((x.size() + bucket_size - 1) / bucket_size) {
    buckets.resize(bucket_num);
    update.resize(bucket_num);
    bucket_sum.resize(bucket_num);
    for (int i = 0; i < x.size(); ++i) {
      buckets[i / bucket_size].push_back(x[i]);
      bucket_sum[i / bucket_size] += x[i];
      update[i / bucket_size] = 2;
    }
  }
  // other member functions...
};

int main() {
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cout.setf(std::ios::fixed);
  std::cout.precision(10);
  // function calls...
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, all the unused macros, functions, and constants are removed, and the problematic `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;` lines are replaced with more specific includes and namespace qualifications. The remaining code is the same.
