Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` since it includes more libraries than required which increases the compilation time. Instead, only include the libraries that are needed.
2. In the given code, `#define f first` and `#define s second` are used. It's not a good practice to use macros like this as they can lead to confusing code. Instead of macros, use the actual names `first` and `second`.
3. The array `book` has a fixed size of `1001`. If `n` is smaller than `1001`, some space is wasted. To avoid this, use a dynamic array or a vector.
4. The dynamic programming array `dp` is re-initialized in every call to `solve()` function which is inefficient. If the `solve()` function is called multiple times, the same work is done again and again. To avoid this, we can declare `dp` as a global variable and initialize it only once.
5. Try to minimize the use of `std` namespace to avoid name conflicts.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::pair;
using std::vector;
using std::greater;

typedef pair<int, int> Pair;
vector<Pair> book;
int dp[3000] = {1};

int solve(int n) {
  int sumf = 0, sums = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    sumf += book[i].first, sums += book[i].second;
  if (2 * book[0].first <= sumf)
    return sumf + sums;
  int d = 2 * book[0].first - sumf, D = d;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    for (int j = d - book[i].second; j >= 0; j--)
      dp[j + book[i].second] |= dp[j];
  while (!dp[D])
    D--;
  return sumf + sums + (d - D);
}

int main() {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    book.resize(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> book[i].first >> book[i].second;
    sort(book.begin(), book.end(), greater<Pair>());
    cout << solve(n) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
