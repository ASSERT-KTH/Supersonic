This C++ program seems to be a solution for a problem related to dynamic programming. The given code is already quite optimized, but there are some improvements that can be made.

1. Use of '#include <bits/stdc++.h>': This header file includes basically every standard library. Including it increases the compile time as the compiler has to parse all of them, which is not efficient. Include only those libraries which are being used in the program.

2. Initialization of Array: Avoid initializing a large array like 'dp' inside a function like 'solve'. It can cause stack overflow if the size is too large. Instead, make it a global array.

3. Use of Bitwise OR Operator: In the nested loop inside the 'solve' function, the bitwise OR operator is used to set the value of 'dp[j + book[i].s]'. This operation can be a bit slow. Instead, we can set the value directly to 1 if 'dp[j]' is 1.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#define f first
#define s second

using namespace std;

typedef pair<int, int> P;
int n;
P book[1001];
int dp[3000];

int solve() {
  int sumf = 0, sums = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    sumf += book[i].f, sums += book[i].s;
  if (2 * book[0].f <= sumf)
    return sumf + sums;
  int d = 2 * book[0].f - sumf, D = d;
  dp[0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    for (int j = d - book[i].s; j >= 0; j--)
      if (dp[j])
        dp[j + book[i].s] = 1;
  while (!dp[D])
    D--;
  return sumf + sums + (d - D);
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> book[i].f >> book[i].s;
    sort(book, book + n, greater<P>());
    cout << solve() << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This code is more optimal as it avoids unnecessary library inclusions, reduces potential for stack overflow, and improves the efficiency of the bitwise OR operation.
