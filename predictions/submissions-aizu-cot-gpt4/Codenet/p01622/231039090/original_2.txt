This C++ program is already written in an optimized way, but there are still a few improvements that can be made to optimize it further:

1. Include Necessary Libraries: The code uses `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a convenience header file that includes almost all standard library headers. This isn't great for compile time, so we should replace it with the specific header files we need.

2. Use More Descriptive Variable Names: While it doesn't impact performance, using more descriptive variable names makes the code easier to read and maintain.

3. Avoid Global Variables: Global variables increase memory usage. We can pass `book` and `n` as parameters to the `solve` function to reduce global scope.

4. Move Variable Declarations: Variables `sumf`, `sums`, `d`, `D` are declared upfront, but they don't need to be. We can declare them where they're first initialized to avoid unnecessary memory usage.

5. Use `std::vector` Instead of Arrays: `std::vector` is more flexible and safer to use than arrays, and can be resized dynamically which could save memory if `n` is usually smaller than 1001.

6. Use `auto` Keyword: For the iterator used in the `sort` function, we can use the `auto` keyword to let the compiler infer the type. This can make the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

typedef std::pair<int, int> P;

int solve(std::vector<P>& book, int n) {
  int sumf = std::accumulate(book.begin(), book.end(), 0, [](int sum, const P& p){return sum+p.first;});
  int sums = std::accumulate(book.begin(), book.end(), 0, [](int sum, const P& p){return sum+p.second;});

  if (2 * book[0].first <= sumf)
    return sumf + sums;

  int d = 2 * book[0].first - sumf;
  std::vector<int> dp(3000, 0);
  dp[0] = 1;
  int D = d;
  
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    for (int j = d - book[i].second; j >= 0; j--)
      dp[j + book[i].second] |= dp[j];
  while (!dp[D])
    D--;
  return sumf + sums + (d - D);
}

int main() {
  int n;
  while (std::cin >> n, n) {
    std::vector<P> book(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      std::cin >> book[i].first >> book[i].second;
    std::sort(book.begin(), book.end(), std::greater<P>());
    std::cout << solve(book, n) << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: As the question asked not to completely rewrite the program, I've kept the overall structure and logic the same. There may be further optimizations possible with a more significant rewrite, depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the program.
