The given C++ program uses a Dynamic Programming (DP) approach to solve a problem. The optimization can be made in the following areas:

1. Avoid the use of bits/stdc++.h: This header file includes too many unnecessary files which increases the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries.
2. Use vector instead of array: Dynamic arrays or vectors are better to use instead of static arrays as they provide dynamic memory allocation, efficient inserts and deletes, and reduce waste of memory.
3. Use ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0);: These lines of code make input and output more efficient by decoupling cin from cout, so they can be buffered independently. This can significantly improve the runtime of the program.
4. Avoid using macros for simple constructs: Macros like #define f first and #define s second can impact readability. It's better to use the direct pair.first and pair.second.
5. Avoid redundant calculations: In the solve() function, 2 * book[0].f - sumf is calculated twice. You can store the result in a variable and reuse it.

Now, let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

typedef pair<int, int> P;

int n;
vector<P> book;
int solve() {
  int sumf = 0, sums = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    sumf += book[i].first, sums += book[i].second;
  int d = 2 * book[0].first - sumf;
  if (d <= 0)
    return sumf + sums;
  vector<int> dp(d+1, 0);
  dp[0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    for (int j = d - book[i].second; j >= 0; j--)
      dp[j + book[i].second] |= dp[j];
  while (!dp[d])
    d--;
  return sumf + sums + d;
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    book.resize(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> book[i].first >> book[i].second;
    sort(book.rbegin(), book.rend());
    cout << solve() << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized version, we have used vectors instead of an array to hold the book information and the dynamic programming solution. This makes the memory usage more efficient and flexible. Additionally, we have improved the code readability by avoiding the use of macros and unnecessary header files. Finally, we have also improved the input/output efficiency with the use of ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0);.
