The given C/C++ program is already quite optimized, but there are still a few changes we can make to further optimize it.

1. Avoid unnecessary computation:
    - In the solve() function, the same sumf and sums are calculated every time the function is called. We can calculate these sums once and pass them to the solve() function.

2. Reduce memory usage:
    - The size of the dp array is fixed at 3000, which may be too large if the value of d is much smaller. We can dynamically allocate the dp array to save memory.

3. Improve loop efficiency:
    - In the solve() function, the inner loop can be improved by starting from min(j + book[i].s, d) instead of d. This will avoid updating dp[k] where k > d, which is unnecessary.
    
Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define f first
#define s second
using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
int n;
P book[1001];
int solve(int sumf, int sums) {
  if (2 * book[0].f <= sumf)
    return sumf + sums;
  int d = 2 * book[0].f - sumf;
  vector<int> dp(d + 1, 0);
  dp[0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    for (int j = min(d, d - book[i].s); j >= 0; j--)
      dp[min(j + book[i].s, d)] |= dp[j];
  while (!dp[d])
    d--;
  return sumf + sums + d;
}
int main() {
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    int sumf = 0, sums = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> book[i].f >> book[i].s;
      sumf += book[i].f; 
      sums += book[i].s;
    }
    sort(book, book + n, greater<P>());
    cout << solve(sumf, sums) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, we calculate sumf and sums once outside the solve() function and pass them as arguments. This avoids the repeated calculation of the same values. We also dynamically allocate the dp array, which reduces memory usage when d is small. Finally, we improve the efficiency of the inner loop by avoiding unnecessary updates of dp[k] where k > d.
