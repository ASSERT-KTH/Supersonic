This program seems to be already quite optimized. However, there are a few tweaks that can be made to improve the efficiency. 

1. Reduce unnecessary computation: We can see that `sumf` and `sums` are being calculated for every iteration of the `solve()` function. If the `book` array and `n` are not changing between calls to `solve()`, we could calculate `sumf` and `sums` once and reuse the result.

2. Avoid recalculating `d` and `D`: These values are recalculated inside `solve()` for each call. If the `book` array and `n` are not changing, we can calculate `d` and `D` once and reuse these values.

3. Use `std::vector` instead of C-style array: C++ `std::vector` is a safer and more flexible alternative to C-style arrays. It is recommended to use `std::vector` instead of C-style arrays in modern C++ code.

4. Use `auto` with `std::cin`: This can make the code more readable and less error-prone.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define f first
#define s second
using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
int n;
vector<P> book(1001);
int sumf = 0, sums = 0;
int d, D;
vector<int> dp(3000, 1);

int solve() {
  if (2 * book[0].f <= sumf)
    return sumf + sums;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    for (int j = d - book[i].s; j >= 0; j--)
      dp[j + book[i].s] |= dp[j];
  while (!dp[D])
    D--;
  return sumf + sums + (d - D);
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    sumf = 0;
    sums = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> book[i].f >> book[i].s;
      sumf += book[i].f;
      sums += book[i].s;
    }
    sort(book.begin(), book.begin() + n, greater<P>());
    d = 2 * book[0].f - sumf;
    D = d;
    cout << solve() << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please remember that the optimization heavily depends on the specific use case and the environmental context. The above changes are based on assumptions that may not hold true in every case.
