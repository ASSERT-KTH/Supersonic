The provided program calculates the time left until 2 PM in a 24-hour format. It considers input as hours, minutes, and seconds. The program then calculates the remaining seconds until 2 PM and prints it out in two formats: once as is and once multiplied by 3.

Optimizations that can be made:

1. Specify types for function arguments: In C/C++, the type of function arguments need to be specified for avoiding any potential issues and improving code readability.

2. Check the result of scanf: It is better to check the result of scanf to ensure that the correct number of inputs was read.

3. Use int main instead of main: It's a good practice to use int main as it returns a value to the operating system about whether the program execution was successful or not.

Optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int h, m, s, t;
  while (scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) == 3) {
      for (t = (120 - h * 60 - m) * 60 - s, h = 2; h--; t *= 3)
          printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t / 3600, t / 60 % 60, t % 60);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the main function now specifically takes no arguments, and it returns an int. I have added the data types for the variables h, m, s, and t. I also added a check to ensure that scanf is reading the correct number of inputs. Finally, I added return 0 at the end of main to signify successful program execution.
