The existing program is already quite optimized, but there are a few small things that can be improved:

1. The first optimization is to specify the return type for the main function. This is not strictly an optimization for speed or memory, but it is good practice to always specify the return type of functions for better readability and maintainability.

2. The second optimization is to initialize variables at the time of declaration. This will make the program cleaner.

3. The third optimization is to break down the complex expression used to calculate 't' into simpler parts. This won't necessarily make the program run faster, but it will make it easier to understand and debug.

4. The fourth optimization is to replace the '* -~h' with '!= EOF'. This will make the program more readable and it will also avoid a multiplication operation.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int h = 0, m = 0, s = 0, t = 0;
  while (scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) != EOF) {
    int temp = 120 - h * 60 - m;
    t = temp * 60 - s;
    for (h = 2; h--; t *= 3) {
      printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t / 3600, t / 60 % 60, t % 60);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This code does exactly the same thing as the original code, but it is more structured and easier to read.
