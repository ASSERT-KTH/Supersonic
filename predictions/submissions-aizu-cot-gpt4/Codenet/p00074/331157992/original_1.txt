In the given code, we can do the following optimization steps:

1. Input Validation: The code does not validate the input. We can add some validation to this. But as per the problem statement, it's mentioned to do small modification, so I am not doing it here.
2. Function Signature: The main function does not have a proper signature. It should be `int main()`. This modification will not affect performance but will be correct in terms of C/C++ standards.
3. Variable Declaration: The variables `h`, `m`, `s`, and `t` are declared in the function signature which is not a good practice and may lead to confusion. It's better to declare them inside the function. This won't affect performance but it will improve code readability.
4. Constants: The values `60` and `3600` are used multiple times in the code. We can replace them with constants, which can make the code easier to maintain and understand. This won't affect performance.

Now, let's apply these changes to the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MINUTE 60
#define HOUR 3600

int main() {
  int h, m, s, t;
  while (scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) != EOF) {
    for (t = (120 - h * MINUTE - m) * MINUTE - s, h = 2; h--; t *= 3)
      printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t / HOUR, t / MINUTE % MINUTE, t % MINUTE);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the code's logic is not optimized as the problem statement mentions not to rewrite the program. This code remains functionally equivalent to the initial one, with the same complexity, but with improved standards compliance and readability.
