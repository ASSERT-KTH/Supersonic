Optimization steps:

1. Use int as type for main function and parameters to clarify the type of input.
2. Use while loop instead of for loop to improve readability.
3. Reuse the previously calculated values to reduce the number of operations.

Optimized program:

```c
int main() {
  int h, m, s, t;
  while (scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) != EOF) {
    t = (120 - h * 60 - m) * 60 - s;
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
      printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t / 3600, t / 60 % 60, t % 60);
      t *= 3;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code has improved readability and reuses calculated values, reducing the number of required operations. Also, the main function and parameters are clearly typed, which is good practice in C/C++ programming.
