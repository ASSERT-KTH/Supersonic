The program you provided has a very compact and obfuscated style, which makes it hard to understand and debug, and is generally not considered good practice. 

Here's a step by step guide to optimize the program:

1. First, we can improve the readability by adding the return type to the main() function and declaring the variables inside the function. This will avoid any warnings or errors, and it is also a better practice.

2. Declare the variables h, m, s, t inside the main function. Although in C/C++, if you do not specify the type, it is considered as int by default. But it is a good programming practice to declare the type of the variables.

3. The scanf function is used in the loop condition which is not a good practice, as it's not immediately clear what the loop condition is. We should use a while loop, read the inputs at the top of the loop, and break when appropriate.

4. Multiplying a variable with its complement, -~h, is not a good programming practice. It's better to use a while loop and break the loop when appropriate.

5. Here, the code is performing an operation t *= 3 inside the second loop, which is unnecessary and can be avoided by just printing the time format twice.

Here's the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int h, m, s, t;
  while(scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) != EOF) {
    if(h < 0) {
      break;
    }
    t = (120 - h * 60 - m) * 60 - s;
    printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t / 3600, t / 60 % 60, t % 60);
    printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t / 3600, t / 60 % 60, t % 60);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This code is more readable, easier to maintain and debug, and performs the same functionality.
