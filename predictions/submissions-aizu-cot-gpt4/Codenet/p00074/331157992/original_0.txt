This program reads hours, minutes, and seconds from the input, performs some calculations, and outputs the result in two different formats. Here are some ways to optimize this program:

1. Use int in function declaration: The function "main" is declared without specifying the type of the parameters. This could lead to undefined behavior. It's better to explicitly define the type of the parameters as int.

2. Use a while loop instead of a for loop for input: This is a more common way of reading input until there's no more left. It's clearer and more readable.

3. Avoid multiplication in the loop condition: The condition of the outer loop multiplies the result of scanf by "-~h", which equals to "1+h". Instead, we can check if scanf successfully read 3 inputs and if h is not equal to -1.

4. Avoid recalculating values: In the inner loop, the value of "t" is recalculated every time through the loop. We can store the original value of "t" so that we only have to calculate it once.

5. Avoid using magic numbers: The constants 120, 60, and 3600 are used in the code without explanation. It's better to define them as constants with meaningful names to make the code more readable.

6. Use meaningful variable names: The variable names "h", "m", "s", and "t" are not very descriptive. It's better to use meaningful names to make the code more understandable.

Here's the optimized program:

```c
#include<stdio.h>

#define HOURS_IN_DAY 24
#define MINUTES_IN_HOUR 60
#define SECONDS_IN_MINUTE 60
#define TWICE 2
#define TRIPLE 3

int main() {
  int hours, minutes, seconds, timeInSeconds, originalTime;
  while(scanf("%d%d%d", &hours, &minutes, &seconds) == 3 && hours != -1){
    timeInSeconds = (HOURS_IN_DAY * MINUTES_IN_HOUR - hours * MINUTES_IN_HOUR - minutes) * SECONDS_IN_MINUTE - seconds;
    originalTime = timeInSeconds;
    for (int i = TWICE; i--; timeInSeconds = originalTime * TRIPLE)
      printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", timeInSeconds / (MINUTES_IN_HOUR * SECONDS_IN_MINUTE), timeInSeconds / SECONDS_IN_MINUTE % MINUTES_IN_HOUR, timeInSeconds % SECONDS_IN_MINUTE);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This program is more readable and efficient. It avoids unnecessary calculations and uses clear, meaningful names for variables and constants.
