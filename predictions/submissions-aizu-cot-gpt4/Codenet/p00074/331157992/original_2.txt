This is a very concise program in C/C++ which reads the current time (hours, minutes, seconds) and calculates the time remaining until 2:00. It then prints this time twice, once for each of two remaining hours.

The program is already quite optimized in terms of running time and space usage, but there are a few potential improvements to be made, namely:

1. Declare the parameter types of the main function and return type: It's a good practice to explicitly declare the data types of the function parameters and the return type of the function.

2. Use more descriptive variable names: While this does not directly contribute to running time or memory usage, it makes the code more maintainable and readable.

3. Avoid using magic numbers: Instead of using obscure values directly in code, it's better to define them at the beginning of your program. This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.

4. Avoid multiple calls to printf: Each call to printf incurs some overhead. If we can achieve the same result with fewer calls, we can potentially speed up the program.

5. Avoid recalculating constants: The division and modulus operations are relatively expensive in terms of CPU time. If we calculate the constants only once, we can reduce the running time of the program.

Here's the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define HOUR_IN_SECONDS 3600
#define MINUTE_IN_SECONDS 60
#define TARGET_HOUR 120

int main() {
  int hours, minutes, seconds, time_remaining;

  while(scanf("%d%d%d", &hours, &minutes, &seconds) == 3) {
    time_remaining = (TARGET_HOUR - hours * 60 - minutes) * MINUTE_IN_SECONDS - seconds;
    
    int hour_part = time_remaining / HOUR_IN_SECONDS;
    int minute_part = time_remaining / MINUTE_IN_SECONDS % 60;
    int second_part = time_remaining % 60;

    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
      printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", hour_part, minute_part, second_part);
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
