This program seems to be already well-optimized. However, there are a few minor changes we can make.

1. The `bits/stdc++.h` header file is a GCC specific library that includes quite a number of standard C++ libraries. This can make compilation slow. It's better to include only the libraries that you use in your program.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;` as it may lead to name conflicts.

3. The `#define rep(i, n) for (ll i = 0; i < (ll)(n); i++)` macro could be replaced with a simple for loop. Modern compilers can optimize this well and it increases readability.

4. The `typedef long long ll;` and `typedef pair<int, int> pii;` are not used in the program and can be removed.

5. The `#define all(a) (a).begin(), (a).end()` macro is also not used and can be removed.

6. The `#define vi vector<int>` and `#define pb push_back` macros are not used and can be removed.

7. The `#define INF 999999999` macro is not used and can be removed.

8. The `EPS` value could potentially be moved to a const variable inside the class where it is used.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

class P {
public:
  double x, y;
  static const double EPS;
  P(double _x = 0, double _y = 0) : x(_x), y(_y){};
  P operator+(P &p) { return P(x + p.x, y + p.y); }
  P operator-(P &p) { return P(x - p.x, y - p.y); }
  P operator*(double k) { return P(x * k, y * k); }
  P operator/(double k) { return P(x / k, y / k); }
  bool operator==(const P &p) {
    return (fabs(x - p.x) < EPS && fabs(y - p.y) < EPS);
  }
  double norm() { return x * x + y * y; }
  double abs() { return sqrt(norm()); }
};

const double P::EPS = 1e-10;

// Remaining code is the same as before, just removed unused typedefs and macros.
```
