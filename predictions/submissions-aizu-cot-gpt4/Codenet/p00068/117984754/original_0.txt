The provided C++ program is quite efficient but there are a few areas that can be optimized:

1. Memory optimization: Referencing instead of copying. C++ creates a copy of the object when it is passed as a function parameter. So, for large objects, it's better to pass by reference to avoid unnecessary copying. This will save memory and also improve the running time of the program. In the current code, the objects of class P and Vector are passed as arguments to various functions which can be changed to pass by reference.

2. Optimizing includes: The first line "#include "bits/stdc++.h"" is a GCC extension that includes most of the standard libraries. It is convenient for competitive programming, but it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which can slow down the compilation time. So it's better to include only the necessary libraries.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;

#define rep(i, n) for (ll i = 0; i < (ll)(n); i++)
#define all(a) (a).begin(), (a).end()
#define vi vector<int>
#define pb push_back
#define INF 999999999
#define EPS (1e-10)

class P {
public:
  double x, y;
  P(double _x = 0, double _y = 0) : x(_x), y(_y){};
  P operator+(P &p) { return P(x + p.x, y + p.y); }
  P operator-(P &p) { return P(x - p.x, y - p.y); }
  P operator*(double k) { return P(x * k, y * k); }
  P operator/(double k) { return P(x / k, y / k); }
  bool operator==(const P &p) {
    return (fabs(x - p.x) < EPS && fabs(y - p.y) < EPS);
  }
  double norm() { return x * x + y * y; }
  double abs() { return sqrt(norm()); }
};

typedef P Vector;
double dot(Vector &a, Vector &b) { return a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y; }
double cross(Vector &a, Vector &b) { return a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x; }
int ccw(P &p0, P &p1, P &p2) {
  Vector a = p1 - p0;
  Vector b = p2 - p0;
  if (cross(a, b) > EPS)
    return 1;
  if (cross(a, b) < -EPS)
    return -1;
  if (dot(a, b) < -EPS)
    return 2;
  if (a.norm() < b.norm())
    return -2;
  return 0;
}
bool orthogonal(P &p1, P &p2, P &p3, P &p4) {
  return abs(dot(p1 - p2, p3 - p4)) < EPS;
}

// The rest of the code remains unchanged ...
```

I have replaced the objects of class P and Vector in function arguments with references to the same. Also, I have replaced the bits/stdc++.h with necessary libraries only. For brevity, I have shown only a part of the code, but these changes are to be applied to the entire program.
