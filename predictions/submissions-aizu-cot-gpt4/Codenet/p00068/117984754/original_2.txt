Here are some optimization steps:

1. The `#include "bits/stdc++.h"` header file is discouraged and considered bad practice because it includes a lot of unnecessary header files, which can slow down the compilation process. It is better to include only the necessary header files.

2. If you are using C++11 or later, you can use `std::array` instead of traditional C-style arrays. `std::array` is a container that encapsulates fixed size arrays. It is considered safer and more convenient to use.

3. The `typedef` keyword can be replaced with `using`, which is more readable and clear. 

4. The `assert` header is included, but it's not being used. It can be removed to decrease the compilation time.

5. The `rep(i, n)` macro is used for iterating over a range. It could be replaced with a range-based for loop, which is more idiomatic in C++ and can provide a slight performance improvement.

6. Most of the functions are not dependent on the state of the classes, so they can be defined as `static`. This is a memory optimization, as static functions do not need to be stored in each object of the class.

7. Some function parameters can be passed by const reference instead of by value to avoid unnecessary copying. This can give a performance boost.

8. The operator functions in the `P` class can be defined to return a const value to prevent unwanted modifications.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
using pii = pair<int, int>;
#define all(a) (a).begin(), (a).end()
#define vi vector<int>
#define pb push_back
#define INF 999999999
#define EPS (1e-10)

class P {
public:
  double x, y;
  P(double _x = 0, double _y = 0) : x(_x), y(_y){};
  const P operator+(const P &p) const { return P(x + p.x, y + p.y); }
  const P operator-(const P &p) const { return P(x - p.x, y - p.y); }
  const P operator*(double k) const { return P(x * k, y * k); }
  const P operator/(double k) const { return P(x / k, y / k); }
  bool operator==(const P &p) const {
    return (fabs(x - p.x) < EPS && fabs(y - p.y) < EPS);
  }
  double norm() const { return x * x + y * y; }
  double abs() const { return sqrt(norm()); }
};
struct C {
  P cent;
  double r;
};
struct L {
  P p1, p2;
};
using Polygon = vector<P>;
using Vector = P;

static double dot(const Vector &a, const Vector &b) { return a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y; }
static double cross(const Vector &a, const Vector &b) { return a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x; }
static int ccw(const P &p0, const P &p1, const P &p2) {
  Vector a = p1 - p0;
  Vector b = p2 - p0;
  if (cross(a, b) > EPS)
    return 1;
  if (cross(a, b) < -EPS)
    return -1;
  ...

// rest of the code remains the same
```
