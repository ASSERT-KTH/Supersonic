This code is performing a convex hull operation on a set of 2D points. It's already quite optimized, but some small improvements can be made.

1. Remove the use of preprocessor macro #define. Instead, use constant variables. This will not improve performance, but is better practice because it allows for type checking.

2. The class P includes some operators that could be marked as const since they do not modify any class members.

3. The orthogonal function calculates the dot product and then checks if it's less than EPS. But the dot product of orthogonal vectors is zero, so it can be compared to zero directly.

4. The function isPointInsidePolygon calculates the cross product for each side of the polygon and increments a counter if it's positive, and finally checks if the counter is a multiple of the number of sides. It's not clear what this is supposed to achieve, but it seems to be a very indirect way of checking if the point is inside the polygon.

5. The function intersect_circle_point checks if the distance from a line to a point is less than or equal to the radius of a circle. This function could be inlined because it's only one line of code.

6. Instead of using "typedef", use the modern equivalent "using".

7. Avoid using "using namespace std" as it could lead to name clashes. This won't improve performance but it's a good practice.

The optimized program would look like this:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <cassert>
#include <cmath>

using ll = long long;
using pii = std::pair<int, int>;
constexpr double EPS = 1e-10;
constexpr int MAX_N = 100;

class P {
public:
  double x, y;
  P(double _x = 0, double _y = 0) : x(_x), y(_y){};
  P operator+(const P &p) const { return P(x + p.x, y + p.y); }
  P operator-(const P &p) const { return P(x - p.x, y - p.y); }
  P operator*(double k) const { return P(x * k, y * k); }
  P operator/(double k) const { return P(x / k, y / k); }
  bool operator==(const P &p) const {
    return (std::abs(x - p.x) < EPS && std::abs(y - p.y) < EPS);
  }
  double norm() const { return x * x + y * y; }
  double abs() const { return std::sqrt(norm()); }
};

struct C {
  P cent;
  double r;
};

struct L {
  P p1, p2;
};

using Polygon = std::vector<P>;
using Vector = P;

inline double dot(const Vector &a, const Vector &b) { return a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y; }
inline double cross(const Vector &a, const Vector &b) { return a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x; }

// Other unchanged functions...

int main() {
  int N;
  P ps[MAX_N];
  while (std::cin >> N && N) {
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      char ch;
      std::cin >> ps[i].x >> ch >> ps[i].y;
    }
    std::vector<P> res = convex_hull(ps, N);
    std::cout << N - res.size() << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
