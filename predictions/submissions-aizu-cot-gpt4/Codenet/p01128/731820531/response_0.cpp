The given C++ program seems to be a complex geometric computation program that checks for intersections of segments, calculates the distance between points, lines, and segments, and performs other geometric operations. 

Optimization Step by Step:

1. Remove Unnecessary Includes: It seems that the program is including libraries that are not being used. Including unnecessary libraries can increase the compilation time. Remove unused includes to improve the compilation time of the program.

2. Avoid Using Namespace Std: The 'using namespace std' can lead to name clashes, which can cause bugs that are hard to track down. It's a good practice to use 'std::' prefix when using classes or functions from the standard library.

3. Optimize Input/Output (I/O): To speed up I/O operations, you can use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout for reading and writing data. Although in this program, the function 'fast_io()' is already optimizing I/O operations by untieing cin from cout and turning off synchronization with C-style I/O.

4. Avoid Using Exit(): The 'exit()' function is used in the program, which causes the program to terminate abruptly without properly cleaning up resources. It's better to avoid using 'exit()' and handle errors in a way that the program can clean up and terminate gracefully.

5. Remove Debugging Statements: The debugging statements like 'cerr' can slow down the program. It's better to remove these statements once the program is ready for production.

6. Use References in Function Arguments: If objects are passed by value to a function, a copy of the object is created which can be expensive in terms of memory and time. It's better to pass objects by reference to avoid unnecessary copy of objects.

7. Remove unused functions: If there are any functions in the program that are not being used, they should be removed to reduce the size of the executable file.

Please note that some of these changes may not significantly improve the performance of the program depending on the specific use case and the inputs of the program. The performance of the C++ program depends on various factors including the hardware it's running on and the compiler being used. The best way to optimize a program is to first profile the program to find out where the bottlenecks are and then focus on optimizing those parts of the program.
