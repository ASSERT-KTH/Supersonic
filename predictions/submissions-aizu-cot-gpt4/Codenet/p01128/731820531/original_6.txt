The given code seems to be a complex geometrical computation. However, the code is already pretty optimized. Here are few minor enhancements that can be done:

1. Avoid unnecessary namespace usage: The code uses the standard namespace std globally, which can cause conflicts when integrating with other code. It's better to use it in a limited scope or use fully qualified names.

2. Unnecessary headers: The code includes a lot of headers that are not used in the code. This increases the compile time and also the memory usage of the program. We should only include those headers that are needed.

3. Functionality duplication: The code contains several functions that perform similar tasks with minor differences. We can combine these functions into a single function with additional parameters.

4. Use const references: In several functions, objects are passed by value which means that a copy of the object is created. This is a costly operation especially for large objects. Instead, we can pass the objects as const references.

5. Use of exit(1): The code uses exit(1) to terminate the program in case of an error. This is not a good practice as it does not give a chance to the program to clean up. We should instead throw an exception and handle it at a higher level.

6. Function naming: The naming of the functions is not clear and does not follow any particular convention. This makes the code hard to read and understand. A good practice is to use descriptive names for functions and follow a naming convention.

7. Use of C-style macros: The code uses several C-style macros. In modern C++, it's better to use inline functions or constexpr for constants as they are safer and provide type checking.

8. Use of magic numbers: The code uses several magic numbers in the code. These should be replaced with named constants to make the code easier to understand.

9. Use of global variables: The code uses several global variables. These can lead to issues with concurrency and make the code hard to understand. It's better to pass these as parameters to functions or encapsulate them in classes.

10. Use of auto keyword: The auto keyword can be used to simplify the code and make it easier to read.
