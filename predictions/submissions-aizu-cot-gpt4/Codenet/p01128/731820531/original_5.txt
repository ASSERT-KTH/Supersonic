The given C++ program is already well-written and utilizes efficient data structures and algorithms. However, there are a few minor optimizations that can be done.

1. Remove Unused Libraries: For optimization, we need to remove unused libraries. This will reduce the program's size and possibly its start-up time as well. For example, the library `<bitset>` is included but never used in the program, so we can remove it.

2. Minimize Global Variables: Global variables consume memory for the entire runtime of the program. In this case, `dx[]`, `dy[]`, `PI`, and `EPS_FOR_LIB` are defined globally but used in only a few places. If possible, define them in the local scope.

3. Avoid Exit Calls: The program has several `exit(1)` calls after printing error messages to `cerr`. This is not an efficient way to handle errors because the program terminates immediately without cleaning up resources. It's better to throw exceptions and catch them where appropriate.

4. Preallocate Memory: If the maximum size of data structures like arrays, vectors, or maps is known beforehand, preallocate that amount of memory. This can prevent reallocations and copying of data, thus improving performance.

5. Use Fast I/O: This program already uses fast I/O (`ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(0)`), which can significantly speed up programs that do a lot of I/O operations.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(n); ++i)
#define all(c) (c).begin(), (c).end()
#define mp make_pair
typedef complex<double> Point;
typedef pair<int, int> pint;
const double PI = acos(-1.0);
const double EPS = 1e-9;
struct Line { Point first, second; };

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    Line s;
    cin >> s.first >> s.second;
    Point rota(1, -arg(s.second - s.first));
    s.first *= rota, s.second *= rota;
    vector<pair<Point, bool>> c;
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    rep(i, n) {
      Line t;
      int o, l;
      cin >> t.first >> t.second >> o >> l;
      t.first *= rota, t.second *= rota;
      if (abs(cross(s.second - s.first, t.first - s.first) *
                  cross(s.second - s.first, t.second - s.first)) <
              EPS &&
          (abs(s.first - t.first) + abs(t.first - s.second) <
           abs(s.first - s.second) + EPS))
        c.pb(mp(t.first + ((abs(cross(s.second - s.first, t.first - s.first)) /
                            (abs(cross(s.second - s.first, t.first - s.first)) +
                             abs(cross(s.second - s.first, t.second - s.first)))) *
                           (t.second - t.first)),
               (o ^ l)));
    }
    sort(all(c));
    int res = 0;
    rep(i, (int)c.size() - 1) if (c[i].second != c[i + 1].second)++ res;
    cout << res << endl;
  }
}
```
Please note that these optimizations are minor and may not significantly improve the program's performance. The major factors affecting performance are the algorithmic complexity, data structures, and I/O operations, which are already efficiently implemented in this program.
