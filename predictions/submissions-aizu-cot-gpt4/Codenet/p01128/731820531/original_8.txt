The given C/C++ program is a complex geometric program that involves a lot of computations and mathematical operations. Here are some possible optimizations focusing on running time and memory usage:

1. **Use preprocessor macros wisely**: Macros such as `#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(n); ++i)` can help reduce typing, but they also obscure the code and can introduce bugs. Consider replacing them with inline functions or lambda functions, which are type-safe.

2. **Avoid unnecessary use of complex data structures**: For example, the `vector<pair<Point, bool>> c;` can be a significant memory hog if `n` is large. If it's not necessary to store all these pairs, consider processing them on-the-fly.

3. **Avoid unnecessary copying and conversion**: For example, the function `template <class T> T to_T(const string &s)` creates a new istream object and then discards it, which could be expensive. If possible, try to avoid such unnecessary conversions.

4. **Use const references where possible**: For large objects, passing by value can be expensive because it involves copying. Consider using const references instead.

5. **Avoid unnecessary object creation**: The function `template <class T> void uniq(T &c)` creates and discards a number of temporary objects. If possible, consider using algorithms that operate in-place.

6. **Avoid using std::endl**: Using `std::endl` can be slower than using `'\n'` because `std::endl` flushes the buffer each time it's used, while `'\n'` does not.

7. **Avoid unnecessary mathematical calculations**: Many of the geometric computations can potentially be optimized by using more efficient mathematical methods or by taking advantage of properties of the specific problem you're solving.

Here's an example of how some of these optimizations might be applied:

```C++
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>
using namespace std;
typedef complex<double> Point;
typedef pair<Point, Point> Seg;
typedef vector<pair<Point, bool>> VecPair;

bool intersect_SS(const Seg& s1, const Seg& s2);
Point ip_SS(const Seg& s1, const Seg& s2);
void fast_io();

int main() {
  fast_io();
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    Seg s;
    cin >> s.first >> s.second;
    VecPair c;
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      Seg t;
      int o, l;
      cin >> t.first >> t.second >> o >> l;
      if (intersect_SS(s, t))
        c.push_back(make_pair(ip_SS(s, t), (o ^ l)));
    }
    sort(c.begin(), c.end());
    int res = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < c.size() - 1; ++i) 
      if (c[i].second != c[i + 1].second)
        ++res;
    cout << res << '\n';
  }
}
```
