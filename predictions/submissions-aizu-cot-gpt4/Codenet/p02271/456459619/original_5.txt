Given program is written in recursive manner, which is easy to understand but it is not efficient for large inputs due to its exponential time complexity and the overhead of recursive function calls. 

We can optimize this program by replacing the recursive function with a dynamic programming approach. We can use a two-dimensional boolean array dp, where dp[i][j] is true if we can get sum j by using the first i numbers. This approach reduces the time complexity from exponential to O(n*m), where n is the number of numbers and m is the target sum.

Please see the optimized version below:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> N(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> N[i];
    }
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int p;
        cin >> p;
        vector<vector<bool>> dp(n + 1, vector<bool>(p + 1, false));
        dp[0][0] = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= p; j++) {
                if (j < N[i]) {
                    dp[i + 1][j] = dp[i][j];
                } else {
                    dp[i + 1][j] = dp[i][j] || dp[i][j - N[i]];
                }
            }
        }
        if (dp[n][p]) {
            cout << "yes" << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "no" << endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized version avoids unnecessary function calls and re-computations, and uses less memory compared to the original program. It only includes the necessary headers and uses standard input/output streams for better performance. It also avoids the use of dynamically allocated memory for the array N, which reduces the memory usage and the risk of memory leaks.
