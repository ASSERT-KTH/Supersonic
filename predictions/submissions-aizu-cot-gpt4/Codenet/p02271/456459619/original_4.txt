The given program solves a subset sum problem using recursion. It checks if there is a subset of the array `N` that sums up to a given number `p`. 

Here are the possible optimizations:

1. **Removing unnecessary includes**: The program includes several libraries that are not used in the code. Removing these will reduce the compiling time and make the code cleaner.

2. **Using `vector<int>` instead of `int*`**: Using `vector<int>` instead of `int*` for N would be safer and more efficient. It automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation, reducing the risk of memory leaks and making the code cleaner.

3. **Avoiding unnecessary ternary operator in the solve function**: The ternary operator `m == 0 ? true : false` can be simplified to `m == 0` because the equality check itself returns a boolean.

4. **Using `printf()` instead of `cout`**: Since the code is already using `scanf()`, using `printf()` instead of `cout` for consistency and because it's faster.

5. **Optimizing the `solve()` function with memoization**: The `solve()` function can be optimized by using a technique called memoization to remember the results of function calls, thereby avoiding repeated calculations with the same inputs. This can significantly reduce the running time of the program.

Here's the optimized code according to these steps:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> N;
int n;
vector<vector<int>> dp;

bool solve(int i, int m) {
    if (m == 0) return true;
    if (i == n || m < 0) return false;
    if (dp[i][m] != -1) return dp[i][m];
    return dp[i][m] = solve(i + 1, m - N[i]) || solve(i + 1, m);
}

int main() {
    int t;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    N.resize(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &N[i]);
    }
    scanf("%d", &t);
    dp.resize(n, vector<int>(100005, -1));
    for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
        int p;
        scanf("%d", &p);
        if (solve(0, p)) {
            printf("yes\n");
        } else {
            printf("no\n");
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code assumes that the maximum possible value of `p` is 100000. If `p` can be larger, adjust the size of the `dp` vector accordingly.
