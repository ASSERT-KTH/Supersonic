This C++ program appears to be a solution for a subset sum problem using a recursive approach, which is not very efficient. It can be optimized by using a dynamic programming approach. However, since you've requested to make a small modification to the original one, we can do the following optimizations:

1. Avoid branching in recursion: The current function 'solve' has a return statement that checks two recursive calls. This could be optimized by checking the conditions before recursion and avoiding unnecessary recursive calls.

2. Use iostream instead of cstdio for input/output: The iostream library is more efficient and safer than the cstdio library. 'cin' and 'cout' are tied with the C++ standard streams, providing several benefits over 'scanf' and 'printf' functions.

3. Use vector instead of dynamic array: In C++, vectors are easier to handle, safer, and more efficient than C-style dynamic arrays. They also handle memory allocation/deallocation automatically.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> N;
int n;

bool solve(int i, int m) {
  if(m == 0) {
    return true;
  }
  if(i == n || m < 0) {
    return false;
  }
  return solve(i + 1, m - N[i]) || solve(i + 1, m);
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> n;
  N.resize(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> N[i];
  }
  cin >> t;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    int p;
    cin >> p;
    if (solve(0, p)) {
      cout << "yes\n";
    } else {
      cout << "no\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The solution is still not optimal in terms of time complexity. The best way to solve the subset sum problem is to use dynamic programming, which reduces the time complexity to O(n*sum), where 'n' is the number of elements and 'sum' is the sum of all elements.
