The given program is a recursive solution to a problem. The main issue with the code is that it is not optimized; it will try all possibilities which leads to a lot of repeated calculations. 

To optimize it, we can use dynamic programming to reduce the number of repeated calculations. We can create a 2D boolean array, `dp[i][j]`, where `dp[i][j]` is `true` if there is a subset of `N[0..i]` with sum equal to `j`, otherwise `false`. 

The base case will be `dp[i][0] = true` for all `i` (since a sum of 0 can always be formed by taking no elements), and `dp[0][j] = false` for all `j` except `j = 0`. 

Then we fill up the dp table in a bottom-up manner. For each number, we can choose to include it in our subset or exclude it. If we include it, our remaining sum is `j - N[i]`, and if we exclude it, our remaining sum is `j`.

Finally, for each test case, instead of calling `solve()`, we simply look up `dp[n][p]` to see if a subset sum of `p` can be formed.

Also, it's better to use a vector to handle the data instead of a raw pointer, as it will automatically deallocate the memory when it's out of scope. 

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, t;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> N(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> N[i];
  }
  cin >> t;
  int max_sum = 2000;  // Assume a reasonable maximum sum here
  vector<vector<bool>> dp(n+1, vector<bool>(max_sum+1, false));
  dp[0][0] = true;
  for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
    for(int j=0; j<=max_sum; j++){
      if(j < N[i-1]) dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];
      else dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] || dp[i-1][j-N[i-1]];
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    int p;
    cin >> p;
    if (p <= max_sum && dp[n][p]) {
      cout << "yes" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the maximum sum `2000` is just an example. In a real problem, you should calculate or estimate the maximum possible sum based on the problem's constraints.
