The provided program is a solution to the subset sum problem, where it checks if there's a subset in an array whose sum is equal to a given number. This is achieved through recursive function calls, which can be very expensive, both in terms of time and space, especially for large inputs.

Here, we can use dynamic programming to optimize our solution. This will eliminate the need for recursive function calls and will also allow us to store the results of subproblems, thus it would not need to compute the same subproblems again and again. This would greatly improve the runtime and memory usage.

Here are the step-by-step optimizations:

1. Remove the solve function and replace it with a dynamic programming solution.
2. Initialize a 2D boolean array dp, where dp[i][j] will be true if there is a subset of elements from 0 to i with sum equal to j.
3. Fill the array in a bottom-up manner. For every element at index i, consider each sum from 1 to the target sum, and fill dp[i][j] as true if either the sum j can be achieved by including the current element arr[i] or if the sum can be achieved by excluding the current element.
4. After filling the table, dp[n][sum] will denote whether it's possible to achieve the target sum with elements up to the nth element.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    vector<int> N(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &N[i]);
    }
    int t;
    scanf("%d", &t);
    while(t--) {
        int sum;
        scanf("%d", &sum);
        vector<vector<bool>> dp(n+1,vector<bool>(sum+1, false));
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
            dp[i][0] = true;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= sum; j++) {
                if (j < N[i - 1])
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                if (j >= N[i - 1])
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] || dp[i - 1][j - N[i - 1]];
            }
        }
        if (dp[n][sum]) {
            printf("yes\n");
        } else {
            printf("no\n");
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This modified version of the program utilizes Dynamic Programming to solve the problem which is more efficient than the recursive calls in the original version. The time complexity is O(n*sum), where n is the number of elements and sum is the target sum, and the space complexity is also O(n*sum), which is much better than the original program which has exponential time complexity due to multiple recursion calls.
