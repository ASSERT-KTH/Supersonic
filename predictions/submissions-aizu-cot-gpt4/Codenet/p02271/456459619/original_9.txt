This C++ program is a simple implementation of the subset sum problem. The function 'solve()' tries to find a subset of the array 'N' that sums up to 'p'.

The problem with this code is that it is currently using a recursive approach to solve the problem which leads to a time complexity of O(2^n), where 'n' is the size of the array. This is because for every element in the array, we have 2 choices - either we include it in our subset to form the sum or we exclude it. 

We can optimize this by using dynamic programming (DP) to avoid the recomputation of the subproblems. The idea is to construct a DP table where each cell dp[i][j] will be 'true' if there is a subset of elements from the first 'i' elements of the array that sums up to 'j'.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool isSubsetSum(vector<int>& set, int sum) {
    int n = set.size();
    vector<vector<bool>> dp(n + 1, vector<bool>(sum + 1, false));

    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
        dp[i][0] = true;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= sum; j++) {
            if (j >= set[i-1])
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] || dp[i-1][j-set[i-1]];
            else
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];
        }
    }

    return dp[n][sum];
}

int main() {
    int n, t, p;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> set(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> set[i];
    }
    cin >> t;
    for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
        cin >> p;
        if (isSubsetSum(set, p)) {
            cout << "yes" << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "no" << endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The optimized code is not only faster but also uses less memory as we are now using a 2D DP table instead of recursion. The time complexity of the optimized code is O(n*sum), where 'n' is the size of the array and 'sum' is the given sum. The space complexity is also O(n*sum). 

Also, the 'set' is now a vector instead of a dynamic array. This is because vectors are easier to use, more flexible, and less prone to errors.

Note: It is important to check if the sum 'j' is greater than or equal to the 'i-th' element of the array before including it in the subset. If 'j' is less than the 'i-th' element, we can only exclude the 'i-th' element.
