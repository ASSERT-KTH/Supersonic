The given program uses a recursive function to solve a problem. Recursion is often more readable and easier to understand, but it can be slower and consume more memory than iterative solutions due to the overhead of function calls.

In this specific case, however, the primary optimization would be to use memoization to avoid recalculating the same results multiple times. The function `solve` gets called with the same arguments multiple times, so caching the results can save a lot of time. This is a common technique for dynamic programming problems.

Here's the optimized version of the code with step-by-step explanation:

1. First, create a 2D boolean array `dp` to cache the results of the `solve` function. The array `dp` is of size `(n+1) x (m+1)`, where `n` is the size of array `N` and `m` is the target number to reach. `dp[i][j]` will store whether it is possible to reach the number `j` using the first `i` numbers of the array `N`. Initialize all elements of `dp` to `false`.

2. The base case for `dp` is that it is always possible to reach the number `0` using any number of elements, so `dp[i][0]` is `true` for all `i`.

3. For each element `N[i]`, for each number `j` from `N[i]` to `m`, if `dp[i-1][j-N[i]]` is `true`, then `dp[i][j]` is `true`.

4. Finally, the answer for the query `p` is `dp[n][p]`.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int *N;
bool dp[2000][2000];
int n;
void solve() {
  dp[0][0] = true;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= 2000; j++) {
      if (j < N[i]) {
        dp[i + 1][j] = dp[i][j];
      } else {
        dp[i + 1][j] = dp[i][j] || dp[i][j - N[i]];
      }
    }
  }
}
int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  N = (int *)calloc(n, sizeof(int));
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &N[i]);
  }
  solve();
  scanf("%d", &t);
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    int p;
    scanf("%d", &p);
    if (dp[n][p]) {
      cout << "yes" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
  free(N);
  return 0;
}
```

Also, I removed unused include directives to make the code cleaner. The array `N` is also deallocated at the end of the program to free up memory.
