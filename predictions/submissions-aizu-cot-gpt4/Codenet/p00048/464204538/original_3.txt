This program reads a float number from the standard input and prints a string according to the number's value. The program uses a nested ternary operator which makes it hard to read. Also, the program uses the scanf function in a loop condition without checking if the function was successful. The scanf function returns the number of successfully assigned items, which is 1 in this case, or EOF if there was an error or if the end of input was reached. In C, EOF is a negative number, and ~ operator makes it positive, which leads to an infinite loop if there was an error or the end of input was reached.

Optimization steps:

1. Replace the nested ternary operator with if-else statements to improve readability.
2. Move the scanf function from the loop condition to the loop body and break the loop if there was an error or if the end of input was reached.
3. Add int before main to specify the return type of the main function. The implicit int rule was removed in C99.

The optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  float f;
  while (1) {
    if (scanf("%f", &f) != 1)
      break;

    if (f > 91)
      puts("heavy");
    else if (f > 81)
      puts("light heavy");
    else if (f > 75)
      puts("middle");
    else if (f > 69)
      puts("light middle");
    else if (f > 64)
      puts("welter");
    else if (f > 60)
      puts("light welter");
    else if (f > 57)
      puts("light");
    else if (f > 54)
      puts("feather");
    else if (f > 51)
      puts("bantam");
    else if (f > 48)
      puts("fly");
    else
      puts("light fly");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized program, the nested ternary operator is replaced with if-else statements which makes the program more readable. Also, the program does not go into an infinite loop if there was an error or if the end of input was reached.
