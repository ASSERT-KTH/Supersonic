This program reads a floating-point number and checks it against several thresholds, printing different strings depending on which range the number falls into. The program is written in a somewhat complicated and deeply nested manner, which makes it hard to read and understand. The program is also not optimized in terms of running time because it checks every single condition until it finds the correct one.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Use `else if` statements instead of deeply nested ternary (`?:`) expressions to improve readability and maintainability. The program will still check every condition until it finds the correct one but it will be more readable and easier to modify in the future.

2. Use `int main()` instead of `main()`. While `main()` works in most compilers, `int main()` is the standard and more portable.

3. Add a check for the return value of `scanf()` to ensure that it correctly read a floating-point number.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  float f;

  while (scanf("%f", &f) == 1) {
    if (f > 91) {
      puts("heavy");
    } else if (f > 81) {
      puts("light heavy");
    } else if (f > 75) {
      puts("middle");
    } else if (f > 69) {
      puts("light middle");
    } else if (f > 64) {
      puts("welter");
    } else if (f > 60) {
      puts("light welter");
    } else if (f > 57) {
      puts("light");
    } else if (f > 54) {
      puts("feather");
    } else if (f > 51) {
      puts("bantam");
    } else if (f > 48) {
      puts("fly");
    } else {
      puts("light fly");
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This program does the same job as the original one, but it is easier to read and understand. It is also more likely to be compiled efficiently by modern optimizing compilers. The running time and memory usage should be roughly the same as in the original program.
