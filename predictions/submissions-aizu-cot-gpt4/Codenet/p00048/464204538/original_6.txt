The given program uses a nested ternary operator, which makes the code harder to read, maintain, and debug. The nested ternary operator also has a high space complexity due to the number of calls in the stack. This can be optimized by using an if-else structure instead, which is more straightforward and understandable. The time complexity will remain the same but the space complexity will be reduced.

Optimized version:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float f;
    while(scanf("%f", &f) != EOF){
        if (f > 91)
            puts("heavy");
        else if (f > 81)
            puts("light heavy");
        else if (f > 75)
            puts("middle");
        else if (f > 69)
            puts("light middle");
        else if (f > 64)
            puts("welter");
        else if (f > 60)
            puts("light welter");
        else if (f > 57)
            puts("light");
        else if (f > 54)
            puts("feather");
        else if (f > 51)
            puts("bantam");
        else if (f > 48)
            puts("fly");
        else
            puts("light fly");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The while(scanf("%f", &f) != EOF) is equivalent to ~scanf("%f", &f), but it is more readable and understandable. The EOF is a constant defined in the header file stdio.h and its typical value is -1, which indicates that the end of file is reached. This change is not an optimization, but a code cleanliness and readability improvement.
