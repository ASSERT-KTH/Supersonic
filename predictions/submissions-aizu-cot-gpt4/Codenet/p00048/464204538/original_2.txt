This program reads a float number from standard input and prints a corresponding string based on the value of the number. The program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Replace nested ternary operators with if-else conditions: Nested ternary operators are confusing and can lead to mistakes. It is better to use if-else conditions for better readability and maintainability.

2. Avoid multiple calls to puts: Instead of calling puts multiple times, we can store the string in a variable and call puts once.

3. Use while loop instead of for loop: This will make the program more readable because we will be able to see the condition of the loop more clearly.

4. Remove the bitwise complement operator (~): The bitwise complement operator is not necessary and removing it will not affect the functionality of the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float f;
    const char* result;
    while(scanf("%f", &f) != EOF) {
        if (f > 91)
            result = "heavy";
        else if (f > 81)
            result = "light heavy";
        else if (f > 75)
            result = "middle";
        else if (f > 69)
            result = "light middle";
        else if (f > 64)
            result = "welter";
        else if (f > 60)
            result = "light welter";
        else if (f > 57)
            result = "light";
        else if (f > 54)
            result = "feather";
        else if (f > 51)
            result = "bantam";
        else if (f > 48)
            result = "fly";
        else
            result = "light fly";
        
        puts(result);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This program is more readable, maintainable, and efficient. It also uses slightly less memory by not storing the strings directly in the call to `puts`.
