The following optimizations can be made:
1. The `algorithm` header is included but not used. We can remove this.
2. We're using both `cin` and `printf` for I/O. We can stick to one method for consistency and speed. `printf` and `scanf` are faster, so we'll use them.
3. We're storing all inputs in arrays before processing. We can process each as it comes in, reducing memory usage.
4. Instead of using two separate for loops to print each row and column, we can use `printf` with a format specifier to print each row at once.

Optimized program:

```C++
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int H, W;
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %d", &H, &W);
    if (H == 0 && W == 0)
      break;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < H; i++) {
      printf("%.*s\n", W, "##################################################");
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the `printf` call, we're using the `*` width specifier to print the first `W` characters of a string of `#` symbols. The string provided is long enough to accommodate reasonable values of `W`. If `W` could be large, it would be better to dynamically generate a string of `#` symbols of the necessary length.
