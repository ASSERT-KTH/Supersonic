Let's optimize the program in several ways:

1. Memory usage: The arrays `H` and `W` have a size of 100, which could be too much if the user just inputs a few lines. If the user only inputs a few lines, then most of the array is wasted. To optimize memory usage, we can utilize dynamic arrays (vectors in C++) that can grow and shrink as needed.

2. I/O operations: I/O operations such as `cin` and `printf` are often quite slow. Instead of `printf` in the inner loop, we can create the whole string first and then print it once.

3. Looping: Instead of using a while loop to input the data and a separate while loop to process the data, we can process each line immediately after it's inputted. This cuts down on the number of loop iterations.

Here is the optimized program based on the steps mentioned above:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int h, w;
    while (1) {
        cin >> h >> w;
        if (h == 0 && w == 0)
            break;

        string row(w, '#');
        for (int i = 0; i < h; i++) {
            cout << row << endl;
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized program, `h` and `w` are the height and width of the rectangle. If the user inputs `0` for both `h` and `w`, the program exits the loop and ends. If the user inputs numbers other than `0`, the program creates a string `row` with `w` number of `#` characters. Then the program prints this `row` `h` times, followed by a newline. This process repeats until the user inputs `0` for both `h` and `w`.
