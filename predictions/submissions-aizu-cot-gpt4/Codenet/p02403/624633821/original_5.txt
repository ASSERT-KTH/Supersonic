The given C++ program reads pairs of integers from standard input until it reads a pair of zeros. For each pair of integers, it prints a rectangle of '#' characters with the dimensions specified by the pair of integers.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. **Avoid using namespace std**: It's a good practice to avoid "using namespace std" in your programs because it can lead to naming conflicts in large programs. We can remove the "using namespace std" and replace "cin" with "std::cin" and "printf" with "std::printf".

2. **Use std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)**: Adding this line can speed up the I/O operations because it disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams.

3. **Reduce the size of arrays**: The arrays H and W have been given a size of 100 but they may not need to be this large. Consider using std::vector instead of C-style arrays. This would allow the arrays to grow as needed, rather than allocating a fixed size at the start of the program. But if we need to make a small modification, we can't do it. 

4. **Use putchar instead of printf for single character**: putchar function is faster than printf when printing a single character.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // make I/O operations faster
    int a = 0, b = 0, H[100], W[100];
    while (1) {
        std::cin >> H[a] >> W[a];
        if (H[a] == 0 && W[a] == 0)
            break;
        a++;
    }
    while (b < a) {
        for (int i = 0; i < H[b]; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < W[b]; j++) {
                putchar('#');
            }
            putchar('\n');
        }
        b++;
        putchar('\n');
    }
    return 0;
}
```
