The above C/C++ program input pairs of integers (H, W) until a pair of zeroes is entered, then prints a rectangle of # characters for each pair. The height and width of the rectangle correspond to H and W respectively. 

Let's break down the optimizations that can be done:

1. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up the I/O operations.

2. In the first while loop, there is no need to keep track of the pairs of zeros in the array. You can print the rectangle immediately after reading a pair of integers. This will save memory usage and also remove the need for the second loop.

3. Use `cout << string(n, '#') << '\n';` for printing a line of '#' characters. This would be faster than using a inner loop.

4. Remove unnecessary `printf("\n")` after each rectangle.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int H, W;
    while (cin >> H >> W && (H != 0 || W != 0)) {
        for (int i = 0; i < H; i++) {
            cout << string(W, '#') << '\n';
        }
        cout << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This version of the program uses less memory by not storing the input pairs. It also reduces the time complexity by removing the second loop and optimizing the inner loop in the rectangle printing section. The I/O operations are also sped up by using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);`.
