The main optimization for this program can be achieved by reducing the execution time of the nested loop that checks for common elements in the arrays S and T. As it is, the program has a complexity of O(n*q), which can be quite slow if both n and q are large.

One way to optimize this is by sorting the array S first, then using a binary search instead of a linear search to check if an element in T exists in S. The complexity of sorting S is O(n log n) and the complexity of binary searching q times is O(q log n). The overall complexity then becomes O(n log n + q log n), which is much faster than the original O(n*q) if n and q are large.

Here is the optimized program:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Function to compare two elements. It is used in qsort
int compare(const void * a, const void * b) {
  return ( *(int*)a - *(int*)b );
}

// Function to search y in arr[l..r] using binary search
int binary_search(int arr[], int l, int r, int y) {
  while (l <= r) {
    int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
    if (arr[m] == y)
      return m;
    if (arr[m] < y)
      l = m + 1;
    else
      r = m - 1;
  }
  return -1;
}

int main() {
  int i, n, q, t, C = 0, S[100], T[100];
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  }
  // Sort the array S
  qsort(S, n, sizeof(int), compare);
  
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &T[i]);
  }
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    if (binary_search(S, 0, n-1, T[i]) != -1) {
      C++;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", C);
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program will run faster for large inputs compared to the original one. It also doesn't use any extra memory, so the memory usage optimization is already at its best.
