Here are the optimizations that can be made:

1. In the nested loop inside main(), the outer loop iterates over the array S[] and the inner loop iterates over the array T[]. However, inside the inner loop, we are comparing S[k] with T[i] which is incorrect. This is not an optimization but a correction. We should compare S[i] with T[k].

2. The nested for loop results in a time complexity of O(n*q) which is not efficient. We can reduce the time complexity by sorting the array S[] and then using binary search for each element in T[].

3. We don't need to store the array T[]. We can read the elements one by one and check if it exists in the array S[].

The optimized program looks like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int i, n, q, t, C = 0, S[100];
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  }
  std::sort(S, S + n); // sort the array S[]
  scanf("%d", &q);
  while(q--) {
    scanf("%d", &t);
    if (std::binary_search(S, S + n, t)) { // binary search for t in S[]
      C++;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", C);
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the above solution uses C++ STL functions std::sort() and std::binary_search(). If only C language is allowed, then we need to implement our own sort function and binary search function. Also, this solution assumes that the input data can be modified (i.e., sorted). If not, another approach should be used.
