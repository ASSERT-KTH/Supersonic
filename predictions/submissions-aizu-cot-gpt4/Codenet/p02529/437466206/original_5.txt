The given C/C++ program compares two arrays of integers, S and T. It counts how many elements in array T are also present in array S. The program uses a nested loop to compare every element in the two arrays, resulting in a time complexity of O(n*q). This is inefficient.

We can optimize this program by using a Hash Table or Set (available in C++ STL). We can store all the elements of array S in a set, then, for each element in T, we check if it is present in the set or not. This approach has time complexity of O(n+q) which is much better than O(n*q).

Below is the optimized program in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, q, t, C = 0;
  unordered_set<int> S;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> t;
    S.insert(t);
  }
  cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    cin >> t;
    if (S.find(t) != S.end()) {
      C++;
    }
  }
  cout << C << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Note that this optimization significantly reduces the time complexity, but slightly increases the space complexity, as it uses a set to hold the elements of array S. In many cases, the time complexity is more critical than the space complexity, so this is a beneficial trade-off.

Also, this optimization is in C++. It may be more difficult to implement in C because C does not have a built-in set or hash table data structure like C++.
