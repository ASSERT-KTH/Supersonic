The original C program reads two sets of numbers from the standard input and counts the number of elements from the first set that are also in the second set. This is done by using two nested loops to compare each element from the first set with each element from the second set, which results in a time complexity of O(n*q).

The optimized program will make use of a data structure called a hash table to reduce the time complexity from O(n*q) to O(n+q). The hash table will store the elements of the first set and will allow us to check if an element is in the set in constant time. 

First, we will include the "unordered_set" header file to use the "unordered_set" data structure, which is a hash table. Then, we will create an "unordered_set" and insert each element of the first set into the set. Finally, when counting the number of elements from the first set that are also in the second set, instead of looping through each element in the first set, we will check if the element is in the hash table.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  int n, q, t, C = 0;
  std::unordered_set<int> S;
  
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &t);
    S.insert(t);
  }
  
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &t);
    if (S.find(t) != S.end()) {
      C++;
    }
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", C);
  return 0;
}
```
