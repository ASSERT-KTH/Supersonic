The provided program appears to be a simple search program that iterates through two arrays (S and T) and checks for common elements between them. However, it has a time complexity of O(n * q) due to the nested for loop, which can be quite inefficient if n and q are large.

Here's how we can optimize the program:

1. Use a data structure like a hash map/unordered set (if using C++) to store the first array elements. This allows for faster lookup times, reducing time complexity from O(n) to O(1) for each search.

2. Iterate through the second array and check if each element is present in the hash map/unordered set.

Please note that for C language, there's no standard library for HashTable or Set. So, if you're using C, you might need to either implement your own or use a third-party library. However, in C++, we can easily use std::unordered_set.

Here's the optimized code in C++:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unordered_set>
int main() {
  int i, n, q, C = 0;
  std::unordered_set<int> S;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int temp;
    scanf("%d", &temp);
    S.insert(temp);
  }
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    int temp;
    scanf("%d", &temp);
    if (S.find(temp) != S.end()) {
      C++;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", C);
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program has a time complexity of O(n + q), which is much better than the original O(n * q). It may use more memory to store the unordered_set but it will be faster especially when n and q are large. 

Remember that you can't always optimize for both time and space at the same time. There's usually a trade-off between the two. In this case, we've chosen to optimize for time at the cost of a bit more memory.
