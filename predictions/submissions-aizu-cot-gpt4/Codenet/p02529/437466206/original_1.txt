The provided code is a simple implementation of a linear search. It reads two arrays S and T of length n and q respectively, and then counts how many elements in S are also present in T.

Optimization Steps:
1. The main time complexity of the program comes from the nested loop structure used for searching the elements. A more efficient approach would be to use sorting and then binary search, which will reduce the time complexity.
2. Using a binary search requires the array to be sorted, but sorting the array in-place will reduce the memory usage.
3. Also, use of vectors instead of arrays in C++ will allow dynamic allocation of memory, reducing memory usage.
4. The current code is using scanf and printf for input and output. If we switch to cin and cout, it will make the code more readable and easier to understand.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int binary_search(vector<int> &S, int key) {
    int left = 0, right = S.size();
    while (left < right) {
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;
        if (S[mid] == key) return 1;
        else if (key < S[mid]) right = mid;
        else left = mid + 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    int n, q, key, sum = 0;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> S(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> S[i];
    sort(S.begin(), S.end());
    cin >> q;
    for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        cin >> key;
        if (binary_search(S, key)) sum++;
    }
    cout << sum << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
