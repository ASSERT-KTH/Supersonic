The program reads two lists of integers from input: S of size n and T of size q, and then counts how many elements of T are present in S. 

The main optimization target here is the two nested loops at the bottom. This is a common pattern that often can be optimized. In the current state, the program has a time complexity of O(n*q), because for each element in S, it checks all elements in T.

To optimize this, we can sort the array S in ascending order and then use binary search for each element in T. The time complexity of sorting is O(n log n) and the time complexity of binary search is O(log n), so the total time complexity after this optimization would be O(n log n + q log n) which is much better than O(n*q) especially when n and q are large.

Here is the optimized program:

```C++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <algorithm>

int binary_search(int* array, int size, int key) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = size;
    while (left < right) {
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;
        if (array[mid] == key)
            return 1;
        else if (key < array[mid])
            right = mid;
        else 
            left = mid + 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    int n, q, C = 0, S[100], T[100];
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &S[i]);
    }
    std::sort(S, S+n);

    scanf("%d", &q);
    for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &T[i]);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        C += binary_search(S, n, T[i]);
    }
    printf("%d\n", C);
    return 0;
}
```

In this updated program, I first read the array S and sort it. I then read array T. For each element in T, I use a binary search (implemented in the function `binary_search`) to check if it is present in S. This greatly reduces the number of comparisons and thus the running time.
