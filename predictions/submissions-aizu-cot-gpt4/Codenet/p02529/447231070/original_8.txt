The code seems to be trying to find the number of unique numbers in the input. The current implementation uses an array `c` of size 999 as a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number. Then it counts the number of unique numbers by adding up the counts.

This implementation could be optimized in a few ways:

1. If the range of numbers is known and small, we can reduce the size of the array `c` to the maximum number in the range. Right now, it's unnecessarily large at 999.

2. Rather than using an array to count occurrences, you could use a bitset. A bitset is a data structure that uses 1 bit per element to signify whether it's present or not. This drastically reduces memory usage compared to using an array of integers.

3. The use of macro `s` could be replaced with a function for better readability and maintainability.

4. Instead of adding up counts in the end, you could increment the count `d` immediately when a new number is found, reducing the need for a second loop.

The optimized code would look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#define MAX_NUM 100

std::bitset<MAX_NUM> numbers;
int num, count = 0;

int getNum() {
    std::cin >> num;
    return num;
}

int main() {
    for (int i = getNum(); i--; ) {
        if (!numbers[getNum()]) {
            numbers.set(num);
            count++;
        }
    }
    std::cout << count << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
In this version, a bitset is used to mark the presence of numbers, and the count is incremented as soon as a new number is found. This reduces memory usage and eliminates the need for the second loop. The `getNum` function replaces the `s` macro, improving readability. The size of the bitset is set to `MAX_NUM`, which should be defined as the maximum possible number that could be in the input. If the range of numbers is not known beforehand, a dynamic data structure like a `std::unordered_set` could be used instead, at the cost of slightly increased memory usage and time complexity.
