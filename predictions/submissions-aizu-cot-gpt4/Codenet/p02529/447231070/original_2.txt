The given code reads a series of integers from the input and stores them in an array 'c' as a flag. Then it reads another series of integers and for each integer, it checks if the flag in the array 'c' has been set (which means the integer has been read in the first series). It then sums up all the flags.

The code can be optimized in the following ways:

1. The macro 's' is used to read the integer 'b' from the input. Macros in C/C++ are used to increase code readability and to avoid writing the same code again and again. However, in this case, the macro 's' only replaces one line of code and it makes the code less readable because you always have to remember what 's' does. This does not directly affect the running time or memory usage, but it can reduce the time needed to understand and maintain the code.

2. The array 'c' is of size 999, but it is not clear how many elements will be used. If the input integers are always less than 999, then this size is sufficient. However, if the input integers can be larger, the program may write beyond the end of the array, causing undefined behavior. The size of the array should be determined according to the maximum possible input integer. If the maximum is not known in advance, a dynamic data structure like std::vector in C++ can be used.

3. The integers are read one by one in a loop. If the integers are read from a file or a network connection, this can be slow because each read operation has some overhead. It would be faster to read all integers at once into a buffer and then process them.

4. The array 'c' is not initialized. If an integer is read that has not been read in the first series, the program will access an uninitialized value in 'c', causing undefined behavior. The array 'c' should be initialized to zeros before it is used.

Here is the optimized code:

```
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX 999

int a, b, d;
int c[MAX] = {0};

int main() {
  // Read the first series of integers and set the flags in 'c'
  scanf("%d", &a);
  for (; a--;) {
    scanf("%d", &b);
    c[b] = 1;
  }

  // Read the second series of integers and sum up the flags in 'c'
  scanf("%d", &a);
  for (; a--;) {
    scanf("%d", &b);
    d += c[b];
  }

  printf("%d\n", d);

  return 0;
}
```

In this code, I have replaced the macro 's' with the scanf function for readability. I have also initialized the array 'c' to zeros. The size of the array is still 999, as it is not clear from the problem statement what the maximum possible input integer can be.
