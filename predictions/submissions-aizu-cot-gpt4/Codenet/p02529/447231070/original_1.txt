The given program counts the number of unique elements in the input sequence. Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. The array `c` is initialized with a size of `999`. This may not be enough for all inputs, and also may be wasteful for smaller inputs. To optimize memory usage, we can use a dynamic array or a `std::vector` in C++ to hold the elements. This will allow it to grow and shrink as necessary, using only as much memory as needed.

2. The program uses a macro `s` to read input, which is not a good practice as it decreases code readability. We can replace this macro with a function to improve code clarity.

3. The program uses global variables, which is not good practice as it can lead to unexpected behavior. We can move these variables into the `main` function to avoid this issue.

4. The program uses integer variable `d` to count the number of unique elements, but it doesn't initialize it. This can lead to undefined behavior. We can initialize `d` to `0` to avoid this issue.

5. The program uses `scanf` for input without checking its return value, which may lead to unexpected behavior if the input is not a number. We can add error checking to improve robustness.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int a, b, d = 0;
  std::vector<int> c(999, 0);

  if(scanf("%d", &a)!=1) return 1;
  for (b = a; b--; c[a] = 1)
    if(scanf("%d", &a)!=1) return 1;
    
  if(scanf("%d", &a)!=1) return 1;
  for (b = a; b--; d += c[a])
    if(scanf("%d", &a)!=1) return 1;

  printf("%d\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this version uses `std::vector`, which means it's a C++ version. If you want to keep using pure C, you would need to use dynamic memory allocation functions like `malloc` and `free` to resize the array, which is more complex and error-prone.
