The code above is a simple frequency counter. It reads a number of integers from the input, counts how often each integer appears, and then reads another list of integers and sums up the counts of the integers in the second list.

The optimization steps for the given program are:

1. Use a smaller size for the array. The current program uses an array of size 999. This may be unnecessarily large for this problem. The size of the array should be determined by the maximum number of different integers that are expected to be in the input.

2. Avoid calling scanf function repeatedly in the for loop to read the value for 'b'. It will be more efficient to read the value for 'b' once before each loop and then use the value of 'b' in the loop.

3. Initialize the sum 'd' to 0 before the second loop. Although the program seems to work correctly without this initialization because global and static variables in C/C++ are automatically initialized to 0, it is generally a good practice to always initialize variables explicitly.

4. Combine the declaration and initialization of variables. It can make the code cleaner, easier to read, and in some cases may also help the compiler to optimize the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, d = 0, c[100] = {0};
  
  scanf("%d", &a);
  for (; a--; ) {
    scanf("%d", &b);
    c[b] = 1;
  }
  
  scanf("%d", &a);
  for (; a--; ) {
    scanf("%d", &b);
    d += c[b];
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program should have the same functionality as the original program but with improved efficiency in terms of runtime and memory usage.
