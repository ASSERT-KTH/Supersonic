This program seems to be counting the number of occurrences of a certain set of numbers.

Here are some improvements:

1. Using `scanf` in a loop is time-consuming. Instead, we can use an array to store all the input first, and then use the data in the array for calculation.

2. We can use a smaller array if we know the maximum possible value of `b`. In the worst case, `b` can be `999`, and we can initialize an array of size `1000` (0-indexed) to store the occurrence of each number.

3. The array `c` is not initialized. We can initialize it to zeros at the beginning.

4. Instead of updating `d` in the second loop, we can count the occurrences in the first loop and directly print out the result.

Optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, d = 0, c[1000] = {0}, input[2000];
  
  scanf("%d", &a);
  for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &b);
    input[i] = b;
    c[b] = 1;
  }
  
  scanf("%d", &a);
  for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &b);
    input[i + a] = b;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < 2 * a; i++) {
    d += c[input[i]];
  }

  printf("%d\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we use only one `scanf` per number and reduce the size of array `c`. We also store all the input into an array `input` first, and then use the data in `input` for calculation, which is faster than using `scanf` in a loop.
