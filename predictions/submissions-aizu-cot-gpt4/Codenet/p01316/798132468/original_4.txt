The given program is a dynamic programming problem that calculates the minimum possible total difference between an array `a` and a sequence generated by adding or subtracting elements from an array `b`. The optimization can be done in the following ways:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The given program uses a 2D array `dp` of size `20001 x 256` which is initialized in every iteration of the `while` loop. This is inefficient and can lead to unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation. Instead, we can declare and initialize the array once and then just reset the values back to `INF` at the start of each iteration.

2. Avoid unnecessary computations: In the nested `for` loop where `dp` array is updated, the program checks if `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `INF` for every `j` from 0 to 255. This check is unnecessary if `dp[i][j]` has not been updated in the previous iterations. To avoid this, we can keep track of the minimum and maximum `j` for which `dp[i][j]` has been updated, and in the next iteration, we only need to iterate `j` from `minJ` to `maxJ`.

3. Use faster I/O methods: The `cin` and `cout` operations are slower compared to their `scanf` and `printf` counterparts. We can replace these with the latter for faster I/O.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
#define r(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define INF 100000000

int dp[20001][256];
int minJ[20001];
int maxJ[20001];

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::fill(&dp[0][0], &dp[0][0] + sizeof(dp) / sizeof(int), INF);
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &m), n) {
    int b[m];
    int a[n + 1];
    r(i, m) scanf("%d", &b[i]);
    r(i, n) scanf("%d", &a[i + 1]);

    std::fill(minJ, minJ+n+1, 256);
    std::fill(maxJ, maxJ+n+1, 0);

    dp[0][128] = 1;
    minJ[0] = maxJ[0] = 128;
    r(i, n) for (int j = minJ[i]; j <= maxJ[i]; ++j) r(k, m) {
      int p = std::clamp(j + b[k], 0, 255);
      dp[i + 1][p] = std::min(dp[i + 1][p], dp[i][j] + (a[i + 1] - p) * (a[i + 1] - p));
      minJ[i + 1] = std::min(minJ[i + 1], p);
      maxJ[i + 1] = std::max(maxJ[i + 1], p);
    }
    int p = *std::min_element(dp[n] + minJ[n], dp[n] + maxJ[n] + 1);
    printf("%d\n", p - 1);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version, the `minJ` and `maxJ` arrays are used to keep track of the range of `j` for which `dp[i][j]` has been updated. The `std::clamp` function is used to ensure `p` is within the range [0, 255]. The `std::min_element` function is used to find the minimum value in the range [minJ[n], maxJ[n]] of `dp[n]`. This avoids the need to check if `dp[n][i]` is not equal to `INF` for all `i` from 0 to 255.
