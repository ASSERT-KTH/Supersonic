Here are the steps to optimize the given C/C++ program:

1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes more than necessary header files which increases compilation time. Use only necessary headers like `#include <iostream>` and `#include <algorithm>`.

2. Avoid using macros for common loops, as it decreases readability and debugging becomes difficult. Also, macros are not type safe.

3. Instead of using `cin` and `cout` for input and output, use `scanf` and `printf` which are faster.

4. The code is using dynamic programming where `dp[i+1][p]` is calculated multiple times with same `(i, p)` values. To optimize, avoid unnecessary re-calculations.

5. Avoid using large global arrays. Here, `int dp[20001][256]` should be reduced in size. But for this problem, it's hard to reduce it without modifying the program significantly, as the dimensions of the array are dependent on the problem's constraints.

6. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` to disable the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams.

7. Use `return 0;` at the end of `main` function. Even though it's not necessary in C++, it's a good practice to include it.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
#define INF 100000000
int dp[20001][256];

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n, m;
  while (scanf("%d %d", &n, &m), n) {
    int b[m];
    int a[n + 1];
    for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) scanf("%d", &b[i]);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) scanf("%d", &a[i + 1]);
    for(int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) 
      for(int j = 0; j < 256; j++) 
        dp[i][j] = INF;
    dp[0][128] = 1;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
      for(int j = 0; j < 256; j++) 
        if (dp[i][j] != INF) 
          for(int k = 0; k < m; k++) {
            int p = j + b[k];
            if (p > 255)
              p = 255;
            if (p < 0)
              p = 0;
            dp[i + 1][p] =
                min(dp[i + 1][p], dp[i][j] + (a[i + 1] - p) * (a[i + 1] - p));
          }
    int p = 100000000;
    for(int i = 0; i < 256; i++) 
      if (dp[n][i] != INF) 
        p = min(p, dp[n][i]);
    printf("%d\n", p - 1);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimization still maintains the original logic of the program. To significantly improve the performance, we would have to modify the algorithm itself, which is not requested here.
