Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which will increase the compile time. We should only include the libraries we are using.

2. Use `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`: These two lines will make the input and output more efficient and improve the running time.

3. Use the `constexpr` keyword for `INF`: This keyword indicates that the value, or return value, is constant and, where possible, is computed at compile time.

4. Avoid using macro for loops: Macros can lead to hard-to-debug errors and generally less readable code. It's better to use normal for loops.

5. Use `std::vector` instead of raw arrays: Vectors are safer, more flexible and they don't need to know the size at compile time.

6. Use `std::array` for `dp array` since its size is known at compile time: It's safer and more modern than raw arrays.

7. Use `auto` for iteration: This is more modern and prevents type mismatches.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <array>
#include <algorithm>

constexpr int INF = 100000000;

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n, m;
  while (std::cin >> n >> m, n) {
    std::vector<int> b(m);
    std::vector<int> a(n + 1);
    for (auto& el : b) std::cin >> el;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) std::cin >> a[i];
    
    std::array<std::array<int, 256>, 20001> dp;
    for (auto& row : dp) std::fill(row.begin(), row.end(), INF);
    dp[0][128] = 1;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
      for (int j = 0; j < 256; j++) 
        if (dp[i][j] != INF) 
          for (const auto& k : b) {
            int p = j + k;
            p = std::max(0, std::min(255, p));
            dp[i + 1][p] = std::min(dp[i + 1][p], dp[i][j] + (a[i + 1] - p) * (a[i + 1] - p));
          }
    
    int p = INF;
    for (const auto& el : dp[n])
      if (el != INF) p = std::min(p, el);
    std::cout << p - 1 << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program should run faster and use memory more efficiently than the original one. It includes only the necessary libraries, avoids macros, uses modern C++ features like `constexpr`, `std::vector`, and `std::array`, and uses `std::min` and `std::max` functions to make the code more readable.
