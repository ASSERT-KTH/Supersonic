This program seems to be already well-optimized, it uses dynamic programming to solve a problem, and it's hard to see any clear areas for optimization without a deep understanding of the problem it solves. However, there are some minor optimizations that can be done:

1. Remove "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" and replace it with the specific libraries that are needed. This header file includes a lot of unnecessary dependencies, which can increase compile time.

2. Instead of using "r(i, n)" macro for loop, use the standard "for" loop. Macros in C++ should be avoided when possible because they can lead to code that is hard to read and debug. Also, modern compilers can optimize the "for" loop just as well.

3. Use pre-increment (++i) instead of post-increment (i++) in loops. Although for built-in types like int, there is no performance difference between pre-increment and post-increment in most cases, for other user-defined types, pre-increment can be more efficient.

4. The program is using "cin" and "cout" for I/O operations, these are much slower than printf and scanf. Replacing "cin" and "cout" with "scanf" and "printf" respectively can increase the speed of I/O operations.

5. Using "\n" instead of "endl" to end lines. The reason is that "endl" flushes the stream which can be a costly I/O operation.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

#define INF 100000000
int dp[20001][256];

int main() {
  int n, m;
  while (scanf("%d %d", &n, &m), n) {
    int b[m];
    int a[n + 1];
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) scanf("%d", &b[i]);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) scanf("%d", &a[i + 1]);
    for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; ++i) 
      for (int j = 0; j < 256; ++j) dp[i][j] = INF;
    dp[0][128] = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) 
      for (int j = 0; j < 256; ++j) 
        if (dp[i][j] != INF) 
          for (int k = 0; k < m; ++k) {
            int p = j + b[k];
            if (p > 255)
              p = 255;
            if (p < 0)
              p = 0;
            dp[i + 1][p] = std::min(dp[i + 1][p], dp[i][j] + (a[i + 1] - p) * (a[i + 1] - p));
          }
    int p = 100000000;
    for (int i = 0; i < 256; ++i) 
      if (dp[n][i] != INF) 
        p = std::min(p, dp[n][i]);
    printf("%d\n", p - 1);
  }
  return 0;
}
