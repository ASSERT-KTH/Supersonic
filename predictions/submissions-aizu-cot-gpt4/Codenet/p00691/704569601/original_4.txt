The given program is calculating the maximum sum of cubes of two numbers x and y, which is lesser than or equal to z^3 and then it is subtracting this sum from z^3 to get the answer.

The program can be optimized in following ways:

1. The function `b_pow` is not used in the program, so it can be removed, which will save memory.
2. The nested for loop can be optimized. Currently it is calculating x^3 and y^3 multiple times. We can calculate it once and then use it, which will save computation time.
3. The condition in the second for loop "y*y*y + x*x*x <= z*z*z" is recalculating z*z*z in each iteration, which is unnecessary. We can calculate it once and then use it in the loop, which will save computation time.
4. The use of multiplication operator (*) is more costly than the use of addition operator (+). So, we can replace the multiplication operator with addition operator where it's possible.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll z;
  while (cin >> z && z) {
    ll ans = 0;
    ll zCube = z * z * z; // calculate z^3 once
    for (ll x = 1, xCube = 1; xCube <= zCube; x++, xCube = x * x * x) {
      for (ll y = 1, yCube = 1; yCube + xCube <= zCube; y++, yCube = y * y * y) {
        ans = max(ans, xCube + yCube); // Use the calculated value of x^3 and y^3
      }
    }
    cout << zCube - ans << endl; // Use the calculated value of z^3
  }
}
```
This code will run faster and use less memory than the original code.
