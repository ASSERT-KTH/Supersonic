The given program calculates the maximum possible sum of cubes of two numbers less than a given number cubed. It does this by iterating through all possible pairs of numbers and keeping track of the maximum sum found. This approach results in a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loop. 

Here are some optimization steps:
1. Reduce the unnecessary computation: The cube of a number is being calculated many times which can be avoided by storing it in a variable.
2. Use a single loop: Instead of using nested loops, you can use a single loop and calculate the second number from the first one.
3. Avoid unnecessary calculations in the loop condition: Instead of calculating "z*z*z" for each iteration, you can store it in a variable outside the loop.

Now, let's optimize the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll z;
  while (cin >> z && z) {
    ll ans = 0;
    ll zCube = z * z * z; // store the cube of z
    for (ll x = 1; x * x * x <= zCube; x++) {
      ll xCube = x * x * x; // store the cube of x
      ll y = cbrt(zCube - xCube); // calculate y from x
      ll yCube = y * y * y; // store the cube of y
      ans = max(ans, xCube + yCube);
    }
    cout << zCube - ans << endl;
  }
}
```
Now the time complexity of the program is O(n), which is a significant improvement.
