The main optimization we can perform on this code is to reduce the number of times we calculate cube of the same number. The value of x^3 and y^3 are recalculated in every iteration of the loop which is not an efficient way. We can store these values in a variable and reuse it. This should significantly improve the performance.

Also, the function b_pow is never used in the code. So, we can remove this function to save memory.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll z;
  while (cin >> z && z) {
    ll ans = 0;
    ll z_cubed = z * z * z;
    for (ll x = 1; x * x * x <= z_cubed; x++){
      ll x_cubed = x * x * x;
      for (ll y = 1; y * y * y + x_cubed <= z_cubed; y++){
        ll y_cubed = y * y * y;
        ans = max(ans, x_cubed + y_cubed);
      }
    }
    cout << z_cubed - ans << endl;
  }
}
```

This code will execute significantly faster than the previous one as it reduces the number of redundant calculations. The space complexity also gets reduced as we removed an unused function.
