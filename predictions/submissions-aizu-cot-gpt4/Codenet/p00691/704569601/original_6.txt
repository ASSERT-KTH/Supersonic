The given program calculates the maximum sum of cubes of x and y, where both x and y are less than or equal to z. Then it subtracts this maximum sum from the cube of z.

To optimize this program, you can follow these steps:

1. Remove unused includes: The program doesn't use `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<map>`, `<set>`, and `<vector>`. Removing these includes will reduce the compilation time.

2. Optimize the inner loop: The inner loop starts from 1 and increments y until the condition `y * y * y + x * x * x <= z * z * z` is met. Instead of starting from 1, you can start from x, which will reduce the number of iterations.

3. Remove unused function: The function `b_pow(ll x, ll n)` is never used in the program and can be removed.

4. Use the power of 3 directly: Since x, y and z are all integers, there is no need to calculate x^3, y^3 and z^3 every time in the loop. Just calculate them once and use them directly.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll z;
  while (cin >> z && z) {
    ll ans = 0;
	ll z_cube = z * z * z;
    for (ll x = 1; x * x * x <= z_cube; x++) {
	  ll x_cube = x * x * x;
      for (ll y = x; y * y * y + x_cube <= z_cube; y++) {
	    ll y_cube = y * y * y;
        ans = max(ans, x_cube + y_cube);
	  }
	}
    cout << z_cube - ans << endl;
  }
}
```
This optimized program should execute faster and use less memory than the original one.
