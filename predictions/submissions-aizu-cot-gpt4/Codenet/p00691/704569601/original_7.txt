Here are the optimization steps for the given program:

1. In the b_pow function, the same function b_pow(x, n >> 1) is called twice. This is a redundant operation as it calculates the same value twice. You can store the result of the first call and use it in the next operation. This reduces the number of recursive calls and hence, the running time.

2. However, the b_pow function is not actually called anywhere in the program, so it can be removed, saving memory.

3. In the main function, the value of z*z*z is used multiple times. You can calculate it once and store it in a variable. This reduces the number of multiplications and hence, the running time.

4. The condition in the inner for loop is checked after each increment of y. However, because x*x*x is added to y*y*y, when x increases, the maximum possible y decreases. So, you can start y at min(z, x) and decrease it until y*y*y + x*x*x > z*z*z. This reduces the number of iterations and hence, the running time.

Now, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll z;
  while (cin >> z && z) {
    ll z_cubed = z * z * z;
    ll ans = 0;
    for (ll x = 1; x * x * x <= z_cubed; x++) {
      for (ll y = min(z, x); y > 0 && y * y * y + x * x * x <= z_cubed; y--) {
        ans = max(ans, x * x * x + y * y * y);
      }
    }
    cout << z_cubed - ans << endl;
  }
}
```
Please note that optimization sometimes depends on the specific characteristics of the input data. The above optimization may not always lead to the best performance under all circumstances.
