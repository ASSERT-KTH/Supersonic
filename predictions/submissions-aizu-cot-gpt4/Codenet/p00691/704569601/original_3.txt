Explanation:

1) We can optimize this program by reducing the redundant computation of the cube of z (z * z * z). We can calculate it once and store it in a variable.

2) The b_pow function is not used in this code, so it can be removed to save memory.

3) The end condition of the second loop can be optimized. After calculating y * y * y in each loop, we can compare it with the difference between z_cube and x_cube instead of z_cube itself. This will reduce the unnecessary loops when x * x * x + y * y * y is already greater than z_cube. 

4) We can calculate x_cube and y_cube once at the beginning of each loop and use them in the loop, instead of calculating x * x * x and y * y * y multiple times.

Below is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll z;
  while (cin >> z && z) {
    ll z_cube = z * z * z;
    ll ans = 0;
    for (ll x = 1; ; x++) {
      ll x_cube = x * x * x;
      if (x_cube > z_cube)
        break;
      for (ll y = 1; ; y++) {
        ll y_cube = y * y * y;
        if (x_cube + y_cube > z_cube)
          break;
        ans = max(ans, x_cube + y_cube);
      }
    }
    cout << z_cube - ans << endl;
  }
}
```
This optimized program has a better running time and uses less memory compared to the original one.
