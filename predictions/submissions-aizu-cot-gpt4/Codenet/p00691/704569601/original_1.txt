The provided code calculates the maximum value of x^3 + y^3 where x and y are integers and x^3 + y^3 <= z^3. Then it prints the difference between z^3 and the calculated maximum value. The calculation is done within a double loop which makes it highly inefficient and time-consuming for larger values of z.

Optimization Steps:

1. Since x^3 and y^3 are calculated multiple times within the loop, we can calculate them once and store them in variables to reduce the computation time.

2. Also, the condition (x * x * x <= z * z * z) and (y * y * y + x * x * x <= z * z * z) are calculated at each iteration. We can calculate z^3 once outside the loop and use it inside for comparison.

3. The inner loop starts from 1 every time. But it can start from x because x <= y is always true for the maximum value of (x^3 + y^3).

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll z;
  while (cin >> z && z) {
    ll z_cubed = z * z * z;
    ll ans = 0;
    for (ll x = 1; x * x * x <= z_cubed; x++) {
      ll x_cubed = x * x * x;
      for (ll y = x; x_cubed + y * y * y <= z_cubed; y++) {
        ll y_cubed = y * y * y;
        ans = max(ans, x_cubed + y_cubed);
      }
    }
    cout << z_cubed - ans << endl;
  }
}
```
This optimized version reduces the number of multiplications, which are expensive operations, and also makes the inner loop run less times by changing its starting point from 1 to x.
