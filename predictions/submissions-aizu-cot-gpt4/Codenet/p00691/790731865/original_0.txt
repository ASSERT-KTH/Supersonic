The given code is a C++ program that is trying to calculate some values and store them in the array 'ans'. The function 'calc' calculates these values and involves nested looping which can be optimized. The optimization here is mainly aimed at reducing the time complexity of the program. 

The function 'nr' calculates the cube root of a number, but the direct calculation can be used instead of looping over values, which will reduce the running time. 

In the 'calc' function, the 'i3' variable is recalculated in every iteration of the loop. We can modify this to calculate the next cube by adding '3*i*i+3*i+1' to the previous cube. This will avoid the need to do the multiplication operation in every iteration which is costly in terms of time complexity. Also, we do not need to calculate 'z3' again in 'min' function, we can store the value 'i3 + j3' in a variable and use it. 

In the main function, we are calculating the cubes of numbers from 1 to 1112 twice, so we can avoid the redundancy by calculating it only once.

Following is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int tb[1112], ans[1112], N;

int nr(int a) {
  int ret = cbrt(a);  // Use in-built function to calculate cube root
  return tb[ret];
}

int calc(int z) {
  int z3 = z * z * z, ret = z3;
  int i3 = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i < z; i++) {
    int j3 = nr(z3 - i3);
    int sum = i3 + j3;
    if (sum >= z3)
      break;
    ret = min(ret, z3 - sum);
    i3 += (3*i*i + 3*i + 1);  // Calculate the next cube
  }
  return ret;
}

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 1112; i++)
    tb[i] = i * i * i;
  for (int i = 1; i < 1112; i++)
    ans[i] = calc(i);
  while (cin >> N, N)
    cout << ans[N] << endl;
}
```
This optimized code reduces the time complexity of the program and avoids redundant calculations, making it more efficient.
