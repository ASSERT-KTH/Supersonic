The given code calculates the cube of numbers from 1 to 1111 and stores them in array tb[]. Then it calculates a certain value for each number from 1 to 1111 and stores them in array ans[]. The calculations are done in functions nr(int) and calc(int). The function nr(int) finds the highest index i whose cube (tb[i]) is less than or equal to the passed argument. The function calc(int) calculates a certain value based on the cubes of numbers and the calculated nr(). Finally, in the main function, it takes user input and prints the value from the ans[] array corresponding to the user input.

To optimize this program, here are the steps:

1. The call to nr(int) function inside calc(int) can be avoided by using binary search. The array tb[] is a sorted array, so binary search can be used to find the highest index whose cube is less than or equal to the passed argument. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

2. In the calc(int) function, the number is cubed three times, which can be reduced to only once by storing it in a variable. It will reduce the number of multiplications.

3. In the main function, instead of doing cin >> N, N can be read once and stored into a vector. Then a loop can be used to print the values. This will reduce the number of I/O operations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int tb[1112], ans[1112], N;

int nr(int a) {
  int start = 2, end = 1111, mid, ret = 1;
  while (start <= end) {
    mid = (start + end) / 2;
    if (tb[mid] > a)
      end = mid - 1;
    else {
      ret = mid;
      start = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  return tb[ret];
}

int calc(int z) {
  int z3 = z * z * z, ret = z3;
  for (int i = 1; i < z; i++) {
    int i3 = i * i * i, j3 = nr(z3 - i3);
    if (i3 + j3 >= z3)
      break;
    ret = min(ret, z3 - i3 - j3);
  }
  return ret;
}

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 1112; i++)
    tb[i] = i * i * i;
  for (int i = 1; i < 1112; i++)
    ans[i] = calc(i);

  vector<int> numbers;
  while (cin >> N, N)
    numbers.push_back(N);

  for (const auto &n : numbers)
    cout << ans[n] << endl;
}
```
This program is optimized for runtime by using binary search and reducing I/O operations and multiplications.
