Step by Step Optimization:

1. The first optimization would be for the function `nr(int a)`. This function tries to find the largest `i` such that `tb[i]` is less than or equal to `a`. Instead of running a loop from `2` to `1112`, we can use binary search to find the `i` as `tb` array is sorted. This would bring down the time complexity of this function from O(n) to O(log(n)).

2. The second optimization would be for the function `calc(int z)`. This function tries to find the minimum value of `z3 - i3 - j3` where `j3` is the largest cube less than or equal to `z3 - i3`. `j3` is equivalent to `nr(z3 - i3)`. Instead of running a loop from `1` to `z`, we can run a loop from `z` to `1`. This would allow us to break out of the loop as soon as `z3 - i3 - j3` is smaller than `ret`. This would reduce the number of unnecessary iterations.

3. The third optimization would be in the `main` function. Before entering the loop to read `N`, we can use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` to speed up the `cin` and `cout` operations.

4. The fourth optimization would be to declare `z3` and `i3` as `long long` instead of `int` to avoid overflow.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int tb[1112], ans[1112], N;
int nr(int a) {
  int low = 2, high = 1111, mid, ret = 1;
  while (low <= high) {
    mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
    if (tb[mid] <= a) {
      ret = mid;
      low = mid + 1;
    } else {
      high = mid - 1;
    }
  }
  return tb[ret];
}
int calc(int z) {
  long long z3 = 1LL * z * z * z, ret = z3;
  for (int i = z; i > 0; i--) {
    long long i3 = 1LL * i * i * i, j3 = nr(z3 - i3);
    if (i3 + j3 < z3)
      ret = min(ret, z3 - i3 - j3);
    else
      break;
  }
  return ret;
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  for (int i = 1; i < 1112; i++)
    tb[i] = i * i * i;
  for (int i = 1; i < 1112; i++)
    ans[i] = calc(i);
  while (cin >> N, N)
    cout << ans[N] << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program uses binary search, loop inversion, fast IO and for avoiding overflow, it ensures that the program runs faster and uses less memory.
