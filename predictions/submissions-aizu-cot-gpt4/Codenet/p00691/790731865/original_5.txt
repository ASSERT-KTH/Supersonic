The given program calculates and stores the cube of numbers from 1 to 1111 in an array 'tb'. Then it calculates another array 'ans' for each number from 1 to 1111 using the function 'calc'. 'calc' function calculates the minimum difference of the cube of 'z' and the sum of the cube of 'i' and the cube of 'j' where 'j' is the largest number whose cube is less than or equal to 'z^3 - i^3'. Finally, it takes an input 'N' and prints the value of 'ans[N]'. 

Optimization steps:

1. The function 'nr' is called for every 'i' in the 'calc' function, which results in a high time complexity. Instead of calculating 'nr' for every 'i', we can use binary search to find the largest number whose cube is less than or equal to 'z^3 - i^3'. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n).

2. The function 'calc' is calculated for every number from 1 to 1111. But it's not necessary to calculate 'calc' for every number, we just need to calculate 'calc' for the input number 'N'. So, we can remove the loop that calculates 'ans' for every number from 1 to 1111 and calculate 'calc' only for 'N'.

3. The 'ans' array is not necessary and can be removed to save memory. 

The optimized program is:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int tb[1112], N;

int nr(int a) {
  int left = 1, right = 1111;
  while (left < right) {
    int mid = left + (right - left + 1) / 2;
    if (tb[mid] > a)
      right = mid - 1;
    else
      left = mid;
  }
  return tb[left];
}

int calc(int z) {
  int z3 = z * z * z, ret = z3;
  for (int i = 1; i < z; i++) {
    int i3 = i * i * i, j3 = nr(z3 - i3);
    if (i3 + j3 >= z3)
      break;
    ret = min(ret, z3 - i3 - j3);
  }
  return ret;
}

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 1112; i++)
    tb[i] = i * i * i;
  while (cin >> N, N)
    cout << calc(N) << endl;
}
```
