The given C/C++ program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The main optimization to be made here is to avoid dead loops when the second number (b) is zero. 

The program can be optimized in several ways:

1. Use a do-while loop instead of a while loop. The do-while loop will terminate when `b` equals 0, preventing an unnecessary iteration in the case `b` is 0 on the first iteration. In the original code, the while loop will continue to run even if `b` is 0, which is not efficient.

2. Check if `b` equals 0 before the loop. If `b` equals 0, then the GCD is `a`, and there's no need to enter the loop. This will save computational resources.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
  if (b != 0) {
    int c;
    do {
      c = a % b;
      a = b;
      b = c;
    } while (b != 0);
  }
  printf("%d\n", a);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program will run faster and use less memory because it avoids unnecessary computation and iterations.
