The given program calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The current implementation continuously repeats the calculation until the remainder (c) is zero and then prints the GCD.

However, there are several improvements we can make:

1. We can use a do-while loop instead of a while loop. This way, we ensure that the loop body is executed at least once, removing the need for the initial assignment of c = 1 before the loop. This optimization can slightly improve memory usage.

2. To improve readability, instead of using scanf and printf, we can use cin and cout in C++, which are more flexible and easier to use.

3. We can reduce the number of variables. Instead of using a separate variable for the remainder (c), we can directly use b for the same purpose. This will reduce the memory usage of the program.

The optimized code then becomes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  do {
    a = a % b;
    swap(a, b);
  } while (b != 0);
  cout << a << endl;
}
```
Explanation:

- We read the input numbers a and b using cin.
- We enter a do-while loop, which will continue until b becomes 0. 
- In the loop, we calculate the remainder of a divided by b and assign it to a. Then we swap the values of a and b. 
- This process continues until b becomes zero, at which point a will contain the GCD of the input numbers.
- Finally, we output the GCD using cout. 

This optimized program uses less memory (due to fewer variables) and is more readable. It also ensures the loop body is executed at least once, potentially reducing the number of iterations.
