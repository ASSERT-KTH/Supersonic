The given C program appears to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers. However, the program is not efficient. The following are the optimizations that could be made:

1. The while loop is not efficient because it continues to loop even when `b` is zero. We can correct this by checking if `b` is not zero before doing the modulus operation.

2. The usage of `c` is not necessary. We can eliminate `c` by using `a` and `b` directly. This optimization reduces memory usage.

3. We are using `scanf` to get input which is a bit slow. We can use `getchar_unlocked` which is faster. However, it's a bit more complex and not as portable as `scanf`. If you want to prioritize speed over portability and simplicity, you can use `getchar_unlocked`. Otherwise, you can stick with `scanf`.

4. `printf` is also a bit slow. We can use `putchar_unlocked` which is faster. However, it's a bit more complex and not as portable as `printf`. If you want to prioritize speed over portability and simplicity, you can use `putchar_unlocked`. Otherwise, you can stick with `printf`.

Using these optimization steps, the new program would be:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
  while (b != 0) {
    int temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
  }
  printf("%d\n", a);
}
```
This code is optimized for both running time and memory usage.
