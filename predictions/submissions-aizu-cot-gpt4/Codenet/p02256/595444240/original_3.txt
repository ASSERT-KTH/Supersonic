This program seems to be finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, it uses an unnecessary `while` loop which continuously checks whether `c` is greater than `0`.

Optimization Steps:
1. Remove the `int c = 1` declaration and initialization at the start of the program.
2. Replace the `while` loop with a `for` loop that iterates until `b` is not equal to `0`. This is because in the Euclidean algorithm, we stop once the remainder is `0`.
3. Inside the loop, calculate `a % b` directly. If `b` becomes `0` in the process, the loop will stop, as required.
4. Swap the values of `a` and `b` using `std::swap` in C++ or a temporary variable in C.

Here's the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, temp;
  scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
  while (b != 0) {
    temp = a % b;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
  }
  printf("%d\n", a);
}
```

The optimized code has the same functionality as the original one but it's slightly simpler and more efficient. We've removed the redundant variable `c` and simplified the loop condition. The time complexity of both programs is the same (O(log(min(a, b)))), but the optimized program uses less memory.
