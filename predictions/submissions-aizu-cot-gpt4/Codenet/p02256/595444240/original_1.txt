The given program uses a loop to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. It seems optimized already, but there are still some improvements that we can make to the given code. 

1. The first optimization is avoiding the initialization of 'c' to '1' and then reassigning it later. Instead, we can move it inside the loop. This will save the unnecessary assignment operation at the beginning.

2. The second optimization is about the 'while' loop. The current condition will always execute once, regardless of the input, because 'c' is initialized to a non-zero value. This can result in unnecessary computations if 'b' is already zero. We can change the loop to a 'do-while' loop, so that the condition is checked at the end of each iteration, after the modulus operation. 

3. The third optimization is related to the 'scanf' and 'printf' functions. We can use 'puts' instead of 'printf' for single integer printing, as 'printf' is heavier and slower due to more functionality. We can't replace 'scanf' with a lighter function, but we can reduce the number of function calls by reading both numbers in a single 'scanf' call.

Here's the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b, c, i;
  scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
  do {
    c = a % b;
    a = b;
    b = c;
  } while (c > 0);
  printf("%d\n", a);
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations may not significantly improve the performance due to the already efficient nature of the provided code. The actual gain can vary depending on the compiler and the runtime environment.
