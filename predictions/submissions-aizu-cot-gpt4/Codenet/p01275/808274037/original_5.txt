This program seems to be a recursive function that calculates the minimum number of operations to transform one string into another string, with each operation being a rotation of the characters. However, there are areas that can be optimized for both running time and memory usage.

Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary calculation on every recursion.

In the recursive function `rec`, the same calculation `dif[i] = (dif[i] - rot) % M;` is performed multiple times for the same `i`. This can be avoided by storing the modified `dif` values in a temporary array, so that we don't need to restore them later.

2. Avoid unnecessary recursion calls.

In the recursive function `rec`, the call `rec(d + 1, p + 1);` is made in a loop, which means for every element in `dif` array, a new recursive call is made, even if the calculated value is not less than `ans`. This can lead to a lot of unnecessary recursive calls. By adding a check before making the recursive call, we can avoid this.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int k, ans;
int dif[12];
const int M = 10;

void rec(int d, int p) {
  if (p == k) {
    ans = d;
    return;
  }
  if (d >= ans)
    return;
  int rot = dif[p];
  if (rot == 0) {
    rec(d, p + 1);
    return;
  }

  int tempDif[12];
  memcpy(tempDif, dif, sizeof(dif));
  for (int i = p; i < k; i++) {
    tempDif[i] = (tempDif[i] - rot) % M;
  }
  
  if (d + 1 < ans) {
    rec(d + 1, p + 1);
  }

  memcpy(dif, tempDif, sizeof(dif));
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> k, k) {
    string s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      dif[i] = ((int)(t[i] - s[i]) + M) % M;
    }
    ans = k;
    rec(0, 0);
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

Here, we created a temporary array `tempDif` to store the modified `dif` values. Also, before making the recursive call `rec(d + 1, p + 1);`, we added a condition check `if (d + 1 < ans)`, which helps to avoid unnecessary recursive calls.
