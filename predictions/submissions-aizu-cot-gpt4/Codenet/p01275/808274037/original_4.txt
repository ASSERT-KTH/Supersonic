This program is already quite optimized, but there are still a few more possible optimizations:

1. Avoid unnecessary modular operations: In the function `rec()`, there are two loops that calculate `dif[i] - rot` and `dif[i] + rot` respectively. In previous calculations, `dif[i]` is already computed as `((int)(t[i] - s[i]) + M) % M`, which ensures `dif[i]` is within the range [0, M). So, we can safely remove the `% M` from `(dif[i] - rot) % M` and `(dif[i] + rot + M) % M`.

2. Avoid unnecessary recursion: The function `rec()` is called recursively twice within the second loop. However, the second recursive call `rec(d + 1, p + 1)` doesn't change the state of `dif[i]` compared to the first call because it is immediately followed by `dif[i] = (dif[i] + rot + M) % M`, which undoes the previous operation on `dif[i]`. So, the second recursive call can be removed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int k, ans;
int dif[12];
const int M = 10;
void rec(int d, int p) {
  if (p == k) {
    ans = d;
    return;
  }
  if (d >= ans)
    return;
  int rot = dif[p];
  if (rot == 0) {
    rec(d, p + 1);
    return;
  }
  rec(d + 1, p + 1);
  for (int i = p; i < k; i++) {
    dif[i] = dif[i] - rot;
    rec(d + 1, p + 1);
  }
  for (int i = p; i < k; i++)
    dif[i] = (dif[i] + rot + M);
}
int main() {
  while (cin >> k, k) {
    string s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      dif[i] = ((int)(t[i] - s[i]) + M) % M;
    }
    ans = k;
    rec(0, 0);
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

Please note that these optimizations may not significantly improve the performance of the program as the original implementation is already quite efficient.
