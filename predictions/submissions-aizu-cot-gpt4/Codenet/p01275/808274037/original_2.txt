The provided C++ program is a recursive implementation that does not make use of memoization, leading to lots of repeated calculations. This can be optimized by using dynamic programming to store previously calculated values and prevent redundant recursion. This method is particularly effective when dealing with recursive functions that have overlapping subproblems, as is the case here.

Additionally, the original code reads input from the console, which is slower than reading from memory. We can speed up the input/output operations by using faster alternatives to cin and cout, such as scanf and printf, or by using cin and cout with std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL). 

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
vector<int> dp(12);
int dif[12];
const int M = 10;
int rec(int d, int p) {
  if (p == dp.size())
    return d;
  if (dp[p] != -1)
    return dp[p];
  int res = d;
  int rot = dif[p];
  if (rot != 0) {
    res = min(res, rec(d + 1, p + 1));
    for (int i = p; i < dp.size(); i++) {
      dif[i] = (dif[i] - rot + M) % M;
      res = min(res, rec(d + 1, p + 1));
    }
    for (int i = p; i < dp.size(); i++)
      dif[i] = (dif[i] + rot + M) % M;
  }
  dp[p] = res;
  return dp[p];
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int k;
  while (cin >> k, k) {
    fill(dp.begin(), dp.end(), -1);
    string s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      dif[i] = ((int)(t[i] - s[i]) + M) % M;
    }
    cout << rec(0, 0) << '\n';
  }
}
```

In this optimized code:

1. The answer "ans" is replaced with a dynamic programming (DP) array "dp". This DP array stores the minimum number of operations required to reach position "p". If dp[p] is -1, it means we haven't calculated the minimum number of operations for position "p" yet.

2. The recursive function "rec" is modified to use the DP array. If dp[p] is already calculated (i.e. not -1), it returns the stored value instead of calculating it again. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of operations for position "p" and stores it in dp[p].

3. The main function initializes the DP array with -1 before each test case.

4. The I/O operations are optimized by using "ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);" and "cin.tie(NULL);". This makes cin and cout as fast as scanf and printf. Also, '\n' is used instead of endl for output, because endl flushes the output buffer, which makes it slower.
