Optimization steps:

1. The first optimization step is to reserve the capacity of the vector ahead of time. This is because if the vector needs to grow, it will allocate a new block of memory, copy the existing elements to the new location, and deallocate the old memory block. This is a very expensive operation in terms of time complexity.

2. The second optimization step is to change the while loop that calculates the sum into a for loop. This avoids the need to manually increment the iterator, and it tends to be more readable.

3. The third optimization step is to use the operator [] to access the elements of the vector instead of the at() function. The operator [] is faster than the at() function because it does not check the bounds of the vector.

4. The fourth optimization step is to use the stream manipulator std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false) and std::cin.tie(NULL) to make cin and cout more efficient.

After applying these 4 steps, the optimized code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int num, cap, price;
  while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::vector<int> vegetables;
    vegetables.reserve(num);
    for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      std::cin >> price;
      vegetables.push_back(price);
    }
    sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      if ((i + 1) % cap != 0) {
        sum += vegetables[i];
      }
    }
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  }
}
```
