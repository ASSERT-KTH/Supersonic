Optimization steps:

1. Reserve memory for `vector<int> vegetables` in advance. This avoids dynamic memory reallocation when adding elements using the `push_back` method, which can be time-consuming.

2. Use `operator[]` instead of `at()` to access elements in the vector. The `at()` function includes a range check, which can slow down the program if used in a loop. Since we know that `i` is always within the range of indices for the vector, we can safely use `operator[]`.

3. Avoid some unnecessary computations. In the original code, `(i + 1) % cap != 0` is computed for each `i` in the loop. However, we can observe that every `cap`th number is skipped. So instead of checking this condition for each `i`, we can simply increment `i` by 1 most of the time, and by 2 when we reach a number that should be skipped.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
int main() {
  int num, cap, price, i;
  while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::vector<int> vegetables;
    vegetables.reserve(num);
    for (i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      std::cin >> price;
      vegetables.push_back(price);
    }
    sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());
    int sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < num; i += i % cap == cap - 1 ? 2 : 1) {
      sum += vegetables[i];
    }
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  }
}
```
Note: The code was modified to use the pre-increment operator `++i` instead of the post-increment `i++` inside the loop. This is a common optimization for C++ as pre-increment can be faster in some cases. However, modern compilers often optimize this automatically, so the difference may not be noticeable.
