Step 1: Use reserve function for vector to avoid reallocation of space. This can be done when we know the number of elements that will be stored in the vector. This avoids the overhead of reallocation and copying of elements every time the vector grows.

Step 2: Replace the at() function in vector with operator[] as the at() function does a range check every time it is called, while operator[] doesn't. But be careful, operator[] doesn't check the boundary, so only use it when you are sure the index is within range.

Step 3: Use prefix increment instead of postfix increment. The prefix increment (++i) is faster than the postfix (i++) in C++ because the postfix increment creates a copy of the object, increments the value, and then returns the copy from before the increment. The prefix increment on the other hand, simply increments the value and returns a reference to the object.

Step 4: Use more efficient way for conditional checking in while loop to avoid extra operation of adding 1 to 'i' every time.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
int main() {
  int num, cap, price, i;
  while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::vector<int> vegetables(num);
    for (i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      std::cin >> price;
      vegetables[i] = price;
    }
    sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());
    int sum = 0;
    i = 0;
    while (i < num) {
      if (i % cap != cap - 1) {
        sum += vegetables[i];
      }
      ++i;
    }
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  }
}
```
