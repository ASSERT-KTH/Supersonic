The program can be optimized as follows:

1. Memory optimization: Instead of using a vector and keep pushing back the inputs, we can declare an array of size `num` as we know the number of inputs beforehand.

2. Time optimization: We use `cin` and `cout` which are slower compared to `scanf` and `printf`. We can switch to `scanf` and `printf` for faster input and output.

3. Time optimization: We are using `at()` function to access vector elements which does boundary checking and is slower, we can use `[]` operator which does not do boundary check and is faster.

4. Loop optimization: We are using a while loop to calculate the sum, we can use a for loop to iterate over the array which is more readable.

Note: This will only work if `num` does not exceed the maximum size of an array on your system.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
int main() {
  int num, cap, price;
  while (scanf("%d%d", &num, &cap) != EOF) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }
    int vegetables[num];
    for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      scanf("%d", &price);
      vegetables[i] = price;
    }
    std::sort(vegetables, vegetables+num, std::greater<int>());
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      if ((i + 1) % cap != 0) {
        sum += vegetables[i];
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", sum);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This code has been optimized for memory by using an array instead of a vector and optimized for time by using `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout`, using `[]` operator instead of `at()` function and by using a for loop instead of a while loop.
