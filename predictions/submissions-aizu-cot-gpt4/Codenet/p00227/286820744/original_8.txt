Step 1: Reserve the size of the vector.

In the original program, the `push_back` function is used to add elements to the vector. This function increases the size of the vector by 1 every time it is called. If the size of the vector exceeds its capacity, a new block of memory is allocated, the existing elements are copied to the new block, and the old block is deleted. This process is expensive in terms of time and memory.

Therefore, we can optimize this part by using the `reserve` function to set the capacity of the vector before adding elements to it. This way, the vector's capacity is enough to hold all the elements, so the expensive process of re-allocating memory is avoided.

Step 2: Use the `[]` operator instead of the `at` function.

In the original program, the `at` function is used to access elements in the vector. This function is safe because it checks whether the index is within the range of the vector. However, this safety comes at a cost in terms of performance.

Therefore, we can optimize this part by using the `[]` operator to access elements in the vector. This operator does not check whether the index is within the range of the vector, so it is faster than the `at` function. However, we must ensure that the index is always within the range to avoid undefined behavior.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
int main() {
  int num, cap, price, i;
  while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::vector<int> vegetables;
    vegetables.reserve(num);
    for (i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      std::cin >> price;
      vegetables.push_back(price);
    }
    sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());
    int sum = 0;
    i = 0;
    while (i < num) {
      if ((i + 1) % cap != 0) {
        sum += vegetables[i];
      }
      ++i;
    }
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  }
}
```
