The optimizations for this program are as follows:

1. **Reserve Vector Size:** It's good practice to reserve memory for a vector if you know the number of elements that will be inserted. This can significantly increase the performance as it reduces the number of memory reallocations. In this case, we know that 'num' elements will be inserted into the vector.

2. **Using [] Operator instead of at():** The at() function checks the bounds of the array and throws an out_of_range exception if the checked index is out of bounds. Since we're sure that the index 'i' will not go out of bounds, we can use the [] operator which doesn't do any bounds checking, hence is faster.

3. **Using Prefix Increment:** In C/C++, the prefix version (++i) of increment operator is usually faster than the postfix (i++) version because the postfix version involves a copy of the original value.

The optimized program is:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int num, cap, price;
  while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::vector<int> vegetables;
    vegetables.reserve(num);
    for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      std::cin >> price;
      vegetables.push_back(price);
    }
    sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      if ((i + 1) % cap != 0) {
        sum += vegetables[i];
      }
    }
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  }
}
```
Here, I have also moved the declaration of 'i' inside the loop to limit its scope and prevent it from being accidentally modified elsewhere. This is a good programming practice rather than an optimization.
