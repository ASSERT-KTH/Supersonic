The program provided is already quite optimized, but there are still a few small improvements that can be made. 

Optimization Steps:

1. Minimize function calls: Instead of calling the Max function repeatedly, we can use the built-in max function provided in the standard algorithm library. This may not provide a significant speedup, but every little helps. The cost of function call can be relatively high especially when the function body is small.

2. Loop unrolling: This is a common technique for optimization where the number of iterations in a loop is reduced by increasing the amount of work done in each iteration. This can be done by processing more than one element of the array in each iteration of the loop. However, in this specific code, it doesn't really make sense to do it because the loop body is complex and each iteration is dependent on the previous one.

3. Reuse computed value: The value of "tmp" is computed in each iteration but it is not used if "tmp < value" is true. Instead, it can be calculated inside the else block.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdio.h>

using namespace std;

typedef long long llong;

struct Data {
  llong size;
  llong value;
};

#define N_MAX 500000

Data art[N_MAX];

inline bool cmp(const Data &a, const Data &b) {
  return a.size == b.size ? a.value < b.value : a.size < b.size;
}

int main(void) {
  int N;
  scanf("%d", &N);
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    scanf("%lld %lld", &art[i].size, &art[i].value);
  }
  sort(art, art + N, cmp);
  llong min_size = art[0].size;
  llong sum_value = art[0].value;
  llong ans = art[0].value;
  for (i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
    llong value = art[i].value;
    llong size = art[i].size;
    if (sum_value + value - (size - min_size) < value) {
      ans = max(ans, value);
      sum_value = value;
      min_size = size;
    } else {
      llong tmp = sum_value + value - (size - min_size);
      ans = max(ans, tmp);
      sum_value += value;
    }
  }
  printf("%lld\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that while these changes may improve the speed a bit, they are unlikely to be noticeable unless you're dealing with a very large dataset. Most of the time, the biggest speedup comes from using more efficient algorithms, rather than micro-optimizations like these.
