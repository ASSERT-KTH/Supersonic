The program provided is already quite efficient. However, there are a couple of small optimizations that can be applied.

1. **Use of prefix increment operator:** In C++, the prefix increment operator (++i) can be more efficient than the postfix increment operator (i++) because it does not need to create a temporary variable. This can be applied in the for loop.

2. **Avoiding multiple array indexing:** Every time an array is indexed, the compiler adds code to compute the address of the indexed element. In the for loop, art[i] is indexed multiple times. We can create a reference to the current element to avoid this.

3. **Avoiding redundant computation:** In the for loop, the value of (size - min_size) is computed twice. We can compute it once and store the result in a variable.

4. **Direct use of std::max function:** Instead of defining a new function Max, we can directly use the std::max function provided by the C++ Standard Library.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long llong;
struct Data {
  llong size;
  llong value;
};
#define N_MAX 500000
Data art[N_MAX];
inline bool cmp(const Data &a, const Data &b) {
  return a.size == b.size ? a.value < b.value : a.size < b.size;
}
int main(void) {
  int N;
  scanf("%d", &N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    scanf("%lld %lld", &art[i].size, &art[i].value);
  }
  sort(art, art + N, cmp);
  llong min_size = art[0].size;
  llong sum_value = art[0].value;
  llong ans = sum_value;
  for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
    Data &curr = art[i];
    llong diff = sum_value + curr.value - (curr.size - min_size);
    if (diff < curr.value) {
      ans = max(ans, curr.value);
      sum_value = curr.value;
      min_size = curr.size;
    } else {
      ans = max(ans, diff);
      sum_value += curr.value;
    }
  }
  printf("%lld\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these are micro-optimizations and might not lead to noticeable improvements in the program's performance. The performance of the program will also depend on other factors such as the compiler and the machine on which the program is run.
