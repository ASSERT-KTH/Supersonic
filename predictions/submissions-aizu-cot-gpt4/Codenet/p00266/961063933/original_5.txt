This code is already efficient in terms of time complexity, but there are a few places where we can optimize it.

1. `std::map` has a time complexity of O(logN) for operations like insert, delete, and search. But in this case, we can replace the map with an array because the keys in the map are consecutive numbers, which makes the map behave like an array. This reduces the time complexity to O(1) for all operations. We need to allocate an array of size 100001 to make this change. 

2. The current code is iterating over the map to increment the value of all elements that are greater than the current one. This is not necessary. We can keep a variable to store the total count and subtract the current element's count to get the count of elements greater than the current one.

3. The current code is inserting an element in the map and then finding it again to increment the value. This is not necessary. We can insert the element and increment the value at the same time.

4. The current code is using `std::pair` to insert an element in the map. We can directly use the `[]` operator to insert an element in the map.

Here is the optimized code with the above-mentioned changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
const int divisor = 1000000007;
int main() {
  long long *factmodary = new long long[100001];
  long long fact = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 100000; i++) {
    fact *= i;
    fact %= divisor;
    factmodary[i] = fact;
  }
  int *word = new int[100000]{0};
  int *bubblehist = new int[100001]{0};
  for (;;) {
    int N, R;
    cin >> N;
    if (N == 0)
      break;
    cin >> R;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
      word[i] = i + 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < R; i++) {
      int s, t;
      cin >> s >> t;
      int tmp = word[s - 1];
      word[s - 1] = word[t - 1];
      word[t - 1] = tmp;
    }
    int totalCount = 0;
    long long ans = factmodary[N - 1] * (word[0] - 1);
    bubblehist[word[0]] = 1;
    totalCount++;
    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
      int facttime = word[i] - 1;
      int bubblenum = bubblehist[word[i]];
      bubblehist[word[i]] = ++totalCount;
      facttime -= bubblenum;
      ans += factmodary[N - (i + 1)] * facttime;
      ans %= divisor;
    }
    cout << (int)ans << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
      bubblehist[word[i]] = 0;
  }
  delete[] word;
  delete[] factmodary;
  delete[] bubblehist;
  return 0;
}
```
The major optimization in this code is the replacement of `std::map` with an array. This reduces the time complexity of operations from O(logN) to O(1).
