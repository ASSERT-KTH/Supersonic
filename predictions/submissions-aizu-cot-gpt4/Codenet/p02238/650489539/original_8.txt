The program above is a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for a graph. It seems to be well-implemented without any obvious inefficiencies. However, there are some minor improvements that can be made:

1. In the main function, the initialization of the matrix G could be done using memset function which is faster than the double loop. However, this is not a major performance improvement, but it simplifies the code.

2. The do-while loop in the main function could be changed to a for loop, because the number of iterations (n) is known in advance.

3. The program uses global variables which is not an optimal coding practice. It doesn't affect performance, but affects code readability and maintainability. However, changing this would require a major change in the structure of the code and we are only permitted to make small modifications.

4. The DFS function checks if color[i] == WHITE twice: once before calling search_loop and again inside search_loop. This check is unnecessary in search_loop function. Removing this check will improve performance.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
#define WHITE 0
#define GRAY 1
#define BLACK 2

int G[101][101];
int color[101];
int n;
int d[101], f[101], t;

void search_loop(int i) {
    int next;
    d[i] = ++t;
    color[i] = GRAY;
    for (next = 1; next <= n; next++) { 
        if (G[i][next] > 0 && color[next] == WHITE) {
            search_loop(next); 
        }
    } 
    f[i] = ++t;
    color[i] = BLACK;   
}

void dfs() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (color[i] == WHITE)
            search_loop(i); 
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cout << i << " " << d[i] << " " << f[i] << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> n;
    memset(G, 0, sizeof(G));
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int e;
        cin >> i >> e;
        for (int j = 1; j <= e; j++) {
            int k;
            cin >> k;
            G[i][k] = 1;
        }
    }
    dfs();
    cin >> n;
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should run slightly faster and use the same amount of memory as the original code.
