The given program seems to be checking whether all elements in an array S of size K can be reduced by elements read from input N times without any element in S becoming negative. If any element becomes negative, the program outputs "No", otherwise "Yes".

Here are a few observations for optimization:

1. In the current program, 'a' is set to 1 in each iteration of the outer while loop. This means that the program will output "Yes" even if 'a' was set to 0 in previous iterations, which is probably not desired. This should be fixed by declaring 'a' inside the while loop.

2. Dynamic memory allocation is being used to declare the array S. This can be slow and is not necessary if K is not extremely large. A statically allocated array can be used instead for better performance.

3. The condition 'S[j] < 0 ? a = 0 : 0' is a ternary operation where the 'else' part does nothing. This can be changed to a simple if condition for better readability.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_K = 1e6; // assuming K does not exceed 1 million
int S[MAX_K];

int main() {
    int N, K, B;
    while (cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
        int a = 1;
        for (int i = K; i--;)
            cin >> S[i];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
            for (int j = K; j--;) {
                cin >> B;
                S[j] -= B;
                if (S[j] < 0) a = 0;
            }
        cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    }
}
```

Please note that I am assuming that the maximum value of K is 1 million. If K can be larger than that, you may need to adjust the value of MAX_K, or go back to using a dynamically allocated array if K can be extremely large.
