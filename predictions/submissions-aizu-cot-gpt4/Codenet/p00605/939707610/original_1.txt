The given program contains a few inefficient parts that can be optimized to improve its running time and memory usage.

Optimization Steps:
1. Dynamic memory allocation: Instead of allocating memory dynamically using "new" for every iteration of the while loop, we can declare an array with a maximum size at the beginning of the program. This will save time required for frequent dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. But it must be noted that this optimization only works if we know the maximum possible value of K in advance.

2. Avoid unnecessary memory access: In the nested for loop, the program checks if S[j] is less than 0 after subtracting B from S[j]. It then sets 'a' to 0 if true. We can optimize this by breaking the loop as soon as we find a negative value. This will save unnecessary memory accesses and iterations. 

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define MAX_K 10000 // assuming maximum K value is 10000
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, K, i, j, S[MAX_K], B, a;
  while (cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    for (i = K; i--;)
      cin >> S[i];
    a = 1;
    for (i = 0; i < N && a; ++i)
      for (j = K; j-- && a;) {
        cin >> B;
        S[j] -= B;
        if (S[j] < 0)
          a = 0;
      }
    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program reduces the time complexity by avoiding unnecessary iterations and also optimizes memory usage by avoiding frequent dynamic memory allocations. Please note that the size of the array 'S' is assumed to be a constant (10000 in this case), which should be adjusted according to the maximum possible value of 'K' in your program's context.
