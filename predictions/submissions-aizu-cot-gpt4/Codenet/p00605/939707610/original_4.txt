The given code reads two integers N and K from the input and then reads K integers into an array S. After that, it reads N * K integers and subtracts each of them from the corresponding element in the array S. If any of the subtractions result in a negative number, it sets a flag variable a to 0. Finally, it outputs "Yes" if a is 1 and "No" if a is 0.

The first optimization that we can do is to avoid dynamic memory allocation by using a std::vector instead of a raw pointer. This will automatically manage memory and avoid potential memory leaks.

The second optimization is to break the inner loop as soon as a becomes 0. This is because once a is set to 0, it will remain 0 (since we only set a to 1 at the beginning of each outer loop). This can potentially save a lot of unnecessary iterations.

The third optimization is to use std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false) to disable the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. This can potentially speed up the I/O operations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int N, K, B, a;
  while (a = 1, cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    vector<int> S(K);
    for (int i = K; i--;)
      cin >> S[i];
    for (int i = 0; i < N && a; ++i)
      for (int j = K; j-- && a;)
        cin >> B, S[j] -= B, a = S[j] >= 0 ? 1 : 0;
    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
