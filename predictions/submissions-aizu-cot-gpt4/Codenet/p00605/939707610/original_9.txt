This program takes two inputs: N and K. It then creates an array of size K and fills it with user inputs. After that, it subtracts user inputs from the elements of the array. If any element in the array becomes less than 0, a flag variable 'a' is set to 0. If 'a' remains 1 after all operations, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No". 

The main problem with this program is that it uses dynamic memory allocation for the array, which is slow and can cause memory leaks if not deleted properly. In this case, the program doesn't delete the array, which causes a memory leak. 

To optimize this program, we can take the following steps:

1. Replace dynamic memory allocation with an array on the stack. The maximum limit for stack allocated array depends on your system, but up to few thousands, it should be fine. Here we'll assume K is small enough to use stack allocation.
2. Remove the unnecessary use of the variable 'a' in the while condition. It can be initialized only once at the beginning.
3. Use prefix decrement for the loop counter 'j' in the inner loop. It's slightly faster than postfix decrement because it doesn't need to keep a copy of the previous value.

Now, let's implement these changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int N, K, i, j, S[1000], B, a = 1;
  while (cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    for (i = K; i--;)
      cin >> S[i];
    for (i = 0; i < N; ++i)
      for (j = K; j--;)
        cin >> B, S[j] -= B, S[j] < 0 ? a = 0 : 0;
    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    a = 1; // Reset the flag for next iteration
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program should be faster and use less memory than the original one.
