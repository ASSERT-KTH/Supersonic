The main optimization that can be performed in this code is to use a vector instead of a dynamic array. As it stands, the program uses "new int[K]" to dynamically create an array S, but "delete[]" is never used to free this memory, causing a memory leak. 

If we replace this dynamic array with a vector, the memory management will be handled automatically, eliminating the memory leak. This modification does not change the logic of the program, it only optimizes the memory usage.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N, K, i, j, B, a;
    while (a = 1, cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
        vector<int> S(K);
        for (i = K; i--;)
            cin >> S[i];
        for (i = 0; i < N; ++i)
            for (j = K; j--;)
                cin >> B, S[j] -= B, S[j] < 0 ? a = 0 : 0;
        cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code accomplishes the same functionality as the original but without the memory leak. The dynamic array S was replaced with a vector, which automatically manages the memory. This change will also make the code easier to read and maintain.
