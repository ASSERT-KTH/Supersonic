The existing C++ program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. As the array "S" is dynamically allocated using the "new" keyword, it is not being deallocated after its usage ends. This can lead to memory leakage. We can use the "delete" keyword to deallocate the memory after the usage of the array ends.

2. The initialization of variable 'a' is done inside the while loop which is unnecessary. It can be initialized once outside the loop to avoid unnecessary initializations in each iteration.

3. The ternary operation inside the nested loop can be replaced with an if condition which makes it more readable and also eliminates the unused branch of the ternary operator.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, K, i, j, *S, B;
  bool a = true;
  
  while (cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    S = new int[K];
    for (i = K; i--;)
      cin >> S[i];
    for (i = 0; i < N; ++i)
      for (j = K; j--;)
        cin >> B, S[j] -= B, if(S[j] < 0) a = false;
    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    delete[] S;
  }
}
```

In this optimized code:

1. Initialized 'a' as 'true' once before the while loop.

2. Replaced the ternary operation inside the nested for loop with an if condition.

3. After the array "S" is no longer needed, it is deallocated using the "delete[]" keyword to prevent memory leakage.
