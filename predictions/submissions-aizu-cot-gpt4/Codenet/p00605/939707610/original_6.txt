The provided C++ program can be optimized in several ways:

1. By using `std::vector<int>` instead of the pointer `int *S`. Vectors are dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the container. This will save us memory and handle memory leaks.

2. Instead of using two nested loops to subtract the two arrays, a single loop can be used if we read the second array's elements directly into the subtraction operation. 

3. If `a` becomes 0, i.e., any element in `S` becomes negative, we can break the loop immediately instead of checking the remaining elements. This saves computation time.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N, K, i, j, B;
    bool a;
    while (cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
        vector<int> S(K);
        a = true;
        for (i = K; i--;)
            cin >> S[i];
        for (i = 0; i < N && a; ++i) {
            for (j = K; j--;) {
                cin >> B;
                S[j] -= B;
                if (S[j] < 0) {
                    a = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version, we managed to prevent potential memory leaks by using `std::vector<int>` instead of `int *S`. Moreover, we reduced the number of loops and included a condition to break the loop when it's not needed anymore, improving the running time of our code.
