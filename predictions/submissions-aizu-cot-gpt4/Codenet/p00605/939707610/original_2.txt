Here are the steps to optimize this C++ program:

1. Avoid dynamic memory allocation using the `new` keyword. Instead, use a statically allocated array or an `std::vector`. Dynamic memory allocation can be slow and may cause memory leaks if not managed properly.

2. Reorder the loops to avoid unnecessary operations. If at any point `S[j] < 0`, we can break out of the inner loop early, because `a` will be set to `0` and won't change after that.

3. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to speed up I/O operations. This will disable synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. You can also use `cin.tie(NULL)` to untie `cin` from `cout`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int N, K, B;
    bool a;

    while (cin >> N >> K, N || K) 
    {
        vector<int> S(K);
        for (int i = K; i--;)
            cin >> S[i];

        a = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
        {
            for (int j = K; j--;)
            {
                cin >> B;
                S[j] -= B;
                if (S[j] < 0) 
                {
                    a = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!a)
                break;
        }
        cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Note: This optimized code assumes that the number of elements `K` is not too large. If `K` is very large, you might want to dynamically allocate `S` to avoid stack overflow. However, in such cases, `std::vector` will handle the dynamic memory allocation for you, and it will free the memory when it goes out of scope, avoiding memory leaks.
