The provided program is a C++ program which reads two integers from the standard input. It then reads K integer values into dynamically allocated memory. It then reads N*K more integers from the standard input and subtracts these from the previously read K integers. Finally, it checks if any of these K integers has become negative as a result of this subtraction and outputs "No" if this is the case and "Yes" if it is not. 

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Avoid dynamic memory allocation: Although dynamic memory allocation provides flexibility, it is slower than automatic (stack) or static memory allocation. If the maximum value of K is known, we can declare an array of that size instead of using dynamic memory allocation.
  
2. Minimize the usage of cin and cout: cin and cout are slower compared to scanf and printf. We can use scanf and printf for faster I/O operations.
  
3. Reduce computation in loop: We are performing the check S[j] < 0 inside the N*K loop which is not necessary. We can perform this check once after the loop.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
const int MAX_K = 1000; // Replace 1000 with maximum possible K
int main() {
  int N, K, i, j, S[MAX_K], B, a;
  while (scanf("%d %d", &N, &K), N || K) {
    a = 1;
    for (i = 0; i < K; ++i)
      scanf("%d", &S[i]);
    for (i = 0; i < N; ++i)
      for (j = 0; j < K; ++j) {
        scanf("%d", &B);
        S[j] -= B;
      }
    for (j = 0; j < K; ++j)
      if (S[j] < 0) {
        a = 0;
        break;
      }
    printf("%s\n", (a ? "Yes" : "No"));
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the maximum possible value of K should be known and it should not be very large, otherwise, it might cause a stack overflow.
