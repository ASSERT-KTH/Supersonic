The first optimization we can make is in the `isprime1` function. The current implementation is inefficient as it checks all numbers from 2 to n-1 to see if they divide n. We only need to check up to the square root of n because a larger factor of n must be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked.

The next optimization is in the main function. Here, we can remove the redundant `n >= 5` check in the for loop condition, because this condition is always true due to the decrement of `i` and the `break` statement inside the loop.

We can also optimize the scanf and printf calls. Calling these functions multiple times is inefficient. Instead, we can store the results in a buffer and print them out all at once.

Here's the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int isprime1(int n) {
  if(n <= 1) return 0;
  if(n == 2) return 1;
  if(n % 2 == 0) return 0;
  for (int i = 3; i <= sqrt(n); i += 2) {
    if (n % i == 0)
      return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}

int main() {
  int n, p, q, i;
  char output[10000] = "";
  while (scanf("%d", &n), n != 0) {
    for (i = n; ; i--) {
      if (isprime1(i) == 1 && isprime1(i - 2) == 1) {
        p = i - 2;
        q = i;
        break;
      }
    }
    char buffer[100];
    sprintf(buffer, "%d %d\n", p, q);
    strcat(output, buffer);
  }
  printf("%s", output);
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, we have reduced the time complexity of `isprime1` function from O(n) to O(sqrt(n)). Also, we have reduced the number of calls to `scanf` and `printf` functions which are costly in terms of running time. Instead, we store the output in a string and print it out at the end all at once.
