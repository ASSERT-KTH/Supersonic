The given program checks for prime pairs (p, q) such that p = q - 2 and both p and q are prime numbers. In each iteration, it checks all numbers from n to 5 whether they are prime or not. The function "isprime1" checks whether a given number is prime by checking all numbers from 2 up to n - 1 if they can divide the given number, that's why the program runs slowly.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. In the "isprime1" function, we don't need to check all numbers up to n - 1. We only need to check up to the square root of n. This is because, if n is not a prime number, then it can be factored into two factors a and b. If both a and b were greater than the square root of n, a*b would be greater than n. Similarly, if both a and b were less than the square root of n, a*b would be less than n. So at least one of those factors must be less or equal to the square root of n, and to check if n is prime, we only need to test for factors less than or equal to the square root of n.

2. In the main function, instead of checking all numbers from n to 5, we can start from the smallest even number not less than n and check every even number. This is because the difference between two prime numbers must be even (except for (2, 3)).

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int isprime1(int n) {
  if (n < 2) return 0;
  if (n == 2) return 1;
  if (n % 2 == 0) return 0;
  int upperLimit = sqrt(n);
  for (int i = 3; i <= upperLimit; i += 2) {
    if (n % i == 0)
      return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}

int main() {
  int n, p, q;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  while (1) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    if (n % 2 == 0) n--; // ensure n is odd
    for (int i = n; i >= 5; i -= 2) {
      if (isprime1(i) == 1 && isprime1(i - 2) == 1) {
        p = i - 2;
        q = i;
        break;
      }
    }
    printf("%d %d\n", p, q);
    scanf("%d", &n);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program will run much faster and use less memory than the original version.
