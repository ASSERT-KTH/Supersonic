The provided code checks if a number and the number two less than it are both prime. If they are, it stops and prints these two numbers. The process repeats until the input number is zero.

Here are the steps we can take to optimize the code:

1. The function `isprime1()` can be optimized. There's no need to check divisibility up to `n`. It is enough to check up to the square root of `n`, because a larger factor of `n` must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.

2. The `isprime1()` function checks every integer for divisibility, but it's known that except for 2, all prime numbers are odd. Therefore, we can optimize this by checking 2 separately, and then checking only odd factors.

3. In the `main()` function, if the input number `n` is even, there is no need to check it because it cannot be a prime number. We can subtract 1 to make it odd before the loop starts.

4. Also, there's no need to check even `i` in the loop in `main()` because if `i` is even, `i-2` is also even, and they cannot be primes (except for 2). So we can use `i -= 2` instead of `i--`.

5. We can move the `scanf("%d", &n);` to the top of the loop to make the code structure simpler.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int isprime1(int n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return 0;
  }
  if (n == 2) {
    return 1;
  }
  if (n % 2 == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  for (int i = 3; i <= sqrt(n); i += 2) {
    if (n % i == 0)
      return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}

int main() {
  int n, p, q;
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    if (n % 2 == 0)
      n--;
    for (int i = n; i >= 5; i -= 2) {
      if (isprime1(i) == 1 && isprime1(i - 2) == 1) {
        p = i - 2;
        q = i;
        break;
      }
    }
    printf("%d %d\n", p, q);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version will run much faster because it reduces the number of iterations in `isprime1()` and in the loop in `main()`. It also uses less memory because it removes the variable `i` from `main()`.
