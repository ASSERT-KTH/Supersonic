The given C/C++ program seems to find two prime numbers (p and q) that are two numbers apart (also known as twin primes) for a given value of n. The program repeats this process until the input number is 0. The function `isprime1(int n)` checks whether a number n is prime by checking whether n is divisible by any number from 2 to n-1.

However, the program can be optimized in a few ways:

1. Instead of checking divisibility up to n-1 in the `isprime1(int n)` function, we can check only up to the square root of n. If n is not divisible by any number up to its square root, then n is a prime number. This significantly reduces the number of iterations in the `isprime1` function.

2. Furthermore, we can eliminate the check for even numbers in the `isprime1` function (except for 2) because all even numbers greater than 2 are not prime.

3. In the main function, rather than starting from n and decrementing down, we can start at 5 and increment up, breaking once we've found our twin primes. This could potentially reduce the number of iterations necessary.

4. For the while loop condition, instead of checking `if (n == 0) break;`, we can simply make n != 0 the condition for the while loop.

Here is the optimized code with the above suggestions applied:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int isprime1(int n) {
  if (n <= 1) return 0;
  if (n == 2) return 1;
  if (n % 2 == 0) return 0;

  for (int i = 3; i <= sqrt(n); i += 2) {
    if (n % i == 0)
      return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}

int main() {
  int n, p, q, i;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  while (n != 0) {
    for (i = 5; i <= n; i++) {
      if (isprime1(i) && isprime1(i + 2)) {
        p = i;
        q = i + 2;
        break;
      }
    }
    printf("%d %d\n", p, q);
    scanf("%d", &n);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program should run faster and use less memory than the original version.
