The given program has a few areas that could be optimized:

1. The isprime1 function: It checks all the way up to n to see if any number is a divisor of n. This could be optimized by only checking up to the square root of n. The reason is that a larger factor of n must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.

2. The main function: It checks each number starting from n down to 5 to see if it and its preceding number are prime. This could be optimized by breaking out of the loop as soon as we find a pair of prime numbers.

3. Memory usage: The program does not have any significant memory usage issues. All variables are used locally and there are no large data structures. However, we could avoid re-declaring the variable i in each iteration of the while loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int isprime1(int n) {
  if (n <= 1)
    return 0;
  if (n == 2)
    return 1;
  if (n % 2 == 0)
    return 0;
  for (int i = 3; i <= sqrt(n); i += 2) {
    if (n % i == 0)
      return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}

int main() {
  int n, p, q, i;
  while (scanf("%d", &n) != EOF && n != 0) {
    for (i = n; i >= 5; --i) {
      if (isprime1(i) && isprime1(i - 2)) {
        p = i - 2;
        q = i;
        break;
      }
    }
    printf("%d %d\n", p, q);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version will run faster because it significantly reduces the number of iterations in the isprime1 function. Also, in the main function, it stops checking as soon as it finds a pair of primes, which could potentially save a lot of iterations. The memory usage is also slightly optimized by reusing the variable i.
