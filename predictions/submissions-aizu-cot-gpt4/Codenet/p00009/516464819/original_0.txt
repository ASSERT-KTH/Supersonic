The given code is a basic implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers up to a given limit and then count the number of prime numbers less than or equal to each input number.

Optimization Steps:

1. Instead of using the `list<int> primes` to store the primes, we can directly use the `vector<bool> v`. This eliminates the need to populate the list with primes, which saves memory and runtime.

2. In the main function, we are finding the maximum element in the inputs vector to get the upper limit for the sieve function. We can do this while reading the inputs itself which can save some time.

3. The way we are counting the prime numbers for each input is inefficient. We are traversing the primes list for each input. Instead, we can use prefix sum array for vector v. This way, we can get the count of primes less than or equal to each input in constant time.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
void sieve(int n, vector<int> &prefix) {
  vector<bool> v(n + 1, true);
  v[0] = v[1] = false;
  for (int i = 3, end = sqrt(n); i <= end; i += 2) {
    if (!v[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i * i, skip = i * 2; j <= n; j += skip)
      v[j] = false;
  }
  prefix[2] = 1;
  for (int i = 3; i <= n; i += 2)
    prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + v[i], prefix[i+1] = prefix[i];
}
int main() {
  vector<int> inputs;
  int mx = 0;
  for (int x; cin >> x;)
    inputs.push_back(x), mx = max(mx, x);
  vector<int> prefix(mx + 1, 0);
  sieve(mx, prefix);
  for (auto x : inputs)
    cout << prefix[x] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the optimized program assumes that the input numbers are positive. If the input can be negative, we need to handle that separately.
