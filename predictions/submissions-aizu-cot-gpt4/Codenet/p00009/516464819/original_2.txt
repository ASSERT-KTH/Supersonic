The given program is a prime number finder and counter. It's a good implementation, but there are several small optimizations we can do to enhance its performance:

1. In the `sieve` function, we are using `list<int> &primes`. `std::list` is not cache-friendly as it uses a doubly-linked list structure. Instead, we can use `std::vector` which is cache-friendly due to its contiguous memory allocation.

2. In the `main` function, we are checking if every prime number is equal to or less than every input number. This operation is costly. Instead, we can store the results of the `sieve` function in a `std::vector<bool> isPrime` variable. Then, we can check if the number is prime or not in constant time.

3. We don't need to store all the inputs and calculate the maximum at the end. We can calculate the maximum while taking the inputs and then use the maximum to run the `sieve` function.

4. `sqrt(n)` in the loop condition of `sieve` function is calculated at each step, which is not necessary. We can calculate it once and use it in the loop.

Here is the optimized version:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void sieve(int n, vector<int> &primes, vector<bool> &isPrime) {
  vector<bool> v(n + 1, true);
  v[0] = v[1] = false;

  for (int i = 2; i*i <= n; i++) {
    if (v[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i)
        v[j] = false;
    }
  }

  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    if (v[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
  }

  isPrime = v;
}

int main() {
  vector<int> primes;
  vector<bool> isPrime;
  int maxInput = 0;
  vector<int> inputs;

  for (int x; cin >> x;) {
    inputs.push_back(x);
    maxInput = max(maxInput, x);
  }

  sieve(maxInput, primes, isPrime);
  
  for (auto x : inputs) {
    cout << (isPrime[x] ? primes[x] : 0) << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
