The given program is a C++ program that uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers up to a certain limit. It then counts the number of prime numbers less than or equal to each input number and prints the count.

Here are some potential optimizations:

1. Use `std::vector` instead of `std::list` for the `primes` container. `std::vector` provides better cache locality and hence faster access time than `std::list`.

2. The program currently reads all input numbers before generating primes. However, it can start generating primes as soon as the first number is read.

3. The `max_element` function is used to find the maximum input number. However, this can be done while reading the inputs, eliminating the need for an additional pass over the input numbers.

4. Finally, the program currently counts primes by manually iterating over the `primes` vector for each input number. This is unnecessary as the prime count for a number `n` is just the index of the first prime greater than `n` in the `primes` vector. We can use the `std::upper_bound` function to find this index quickly.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void sieve(int n, vector<int> &primes) {
  vector<bool> v(n + 1, true);
  primes.push_back(2);
  for (int i = 3, end = sqrt(n); i <= end; i += 2) {
    if (!v[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i * i, skip = i * 2; j <= n; j += skip)
      v[j] = false;
  }
  for (int i = 3; i <= n; i += 2)
    if (v[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
}

int main() {
  vector<int> primes, inputs;
  int max_input = 0;
  for (int x; cin >> x;) {
    inputs.push_back(x);
    max_input = max(max_input, x);
  }
  sieve(max_input, primes);
  for (auto x : inputs) {
    int count = upper_bound(primes.begin(), primes.end(), x) - primes.begin();
    cout << count << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program should run faster and use less memory than the original program.
