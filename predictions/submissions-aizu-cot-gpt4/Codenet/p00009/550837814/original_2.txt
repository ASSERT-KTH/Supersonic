This is a program that calculates the number of prime numbers less than or equal to n using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

Here are the optimizations:

1. Instead of `sqrt(1000000)`, calculate the square root once and store it in a variable.
2. The size of the array `num[]` is very large. Use dynamic memory allocation to avoid wasting memory when the program doesn't need all the space. 
3. The `scanf` and `printf` functions are slow. To speed up the program, we can use `getchar_unlocked` and `putchar_unlocked` for input and output operations. However, these functions are not portable and should be used with caution.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int i, j, n;
    int upBound = 1000000;
    int sqrtBound = (int)sqrt(upBound);

    int* num = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * upBound);
    if (num == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
        return -1;
    }

    for (i = 0; i < upBound; i++) {
        num[i] = 1;
    }
    num[0] = num[1] = 0;

    for (i = 2; i <= sqrtBound; i++) {
        if (num[i] == 1) {
            for (j = i * i; j < upBound; j += i)
                num[j] = 0;
        }
    }

    for (i = 1; i < upBound - 1; i++) {
        num[i + 1] += num[i];
    }

    while (scanf("%d", &n) != EOF) {
        printf("%d\n", num[n]);
    }

    free(num);
    return 0;
}
```
Please note that, if the program is running on a system with limited memory, it would be better to reduce the upper bound (1000000 in the current case).
