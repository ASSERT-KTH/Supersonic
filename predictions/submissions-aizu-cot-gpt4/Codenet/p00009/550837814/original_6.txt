The given C/C++ program is used to identify the number of prime numbers less than or equal to a given number. The program uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers less than 1,000,000.

Optimization Steps:

1. Reduce the number of iterations in the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The inner loop can start from i^2 and can increment by 2*i instead of i. This is because all the numbers less than i^2 would have already been marked in the previous iterations, and incrementing by 2*i ensures that only odd multiples are marked, as even multiples would have already been marked in the previous iterations.

2. Instead of sqrt(1000000), use an integer variable to store the square root value and use it in the loop condition. By doing this, the program doesn't need to calculate the square root for each iteration.

3. Use the 'bool' data type for the 'num' array, as it only stores 0 or 1. This would reduce the memory usage.

4. Use 'fast IO' methods for input and output to reduce the time taken for IO operations. This can be done by using getchar_unlocked() for input and putchar_unlocked() for output, instead of scanf() and printf().

Optimized Program:

```
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

inline int read_int() {
  int num = 0;
  char c = getchar_unlocked();
  while(c<'0' || c>'9') c = getchar_unlocked();
  while(c>='0' && c<='9') {
    num = (num<<1) + (num<<3) + c - '0';
    c = getchar_unlocked();
  }
  return num;
}

int main() {
  int i, j;
  int sqrtVal = sqrt(1000000);
  bool num[1000000];
  for (i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
    num[i] = 1;
  }
  num[0] = num[1] = 0;
  for (i = 2; i <= sqrtVal; i++) {
    if (num[i] == 1) {
      for (j = i * i; j < 1000000; j += i*2)
        num[j] = 0;
    }
  }
  for (i = 1; i < 1000000 - 1; i++) {
    num[i + 1] += num[i];
  }
  while(true) {
    int n = read_int();
    if(n == EOF) break;
    putchar_unlocked(num[n] + '0');
    putchar_unlocked('\n');
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the getchar_unlocked() and putchar_unlocked() functions are not standard C/C++ functions and may not be available on all platforms. They are used here for illustration purposes to show how IO operations can be optimized in C/C++ programs.
