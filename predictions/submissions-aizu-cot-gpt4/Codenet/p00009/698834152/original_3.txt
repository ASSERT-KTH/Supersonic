The existing code is finding the prime numbers up to a given number N using the Sieve of Eratosthenes method. Here are some optimization steps we can follow:

1. We can use the fact that all primes are of the form 6k Â± 1, with the exception of 2 and 3, to reduce the number of iterations. This will reduce the running time.

2. We can start the inner loop from i*i instead of 2*i because a smaller number will always be marked by a smaller prime number before. This will also reduce the running time.

3. We can use static array instead of dynamic allocation which can save memory and time.

Here is the optimized program:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#define MAX 999999
using namespace std;

int num_prime[MAX + 1];
bool not_prime_flag[MAX + 1];

int main() {
  int n;
  not_prime_flag[0] = not_prime_flag[1] = true;
  for (int i = 4; i <= MAX; i += 2) {
      not_prime_flag[i] = true;
  }
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= MAX; i += 2) {
    if (!not_prime_flag[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= MAX; j += i) {
        not_prime_flag[j] = true;
      }
    }
  }
  num_prime[0] = num_prime[1] = 0;
  num_prime[2] = 1;
  for (int i = 3; i <= MAX; ++i) {
    num_prime[i] = num_prime[i - 1] + !not_prime_flag[i];
  }
  while (cin >> n) {
    cout << num_prime[n] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces the number of unnecessary iterations and hence reduces the running time. Also, using static array saves memory.
