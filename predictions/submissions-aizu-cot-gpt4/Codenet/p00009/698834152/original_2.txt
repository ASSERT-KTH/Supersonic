This program aims to find the number of prime numbers less than or equal to n. This is done by creating a boolean array `not_prime_flag` where each index represents a number and the value at that index represents whether the number is not a prime. The array `num_prime` stores the cumulative count of primes up to the corresponding index. 

To optimize this program, we can apply the following steps:
1. Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate the prime numbers. This algorithm is more efficient as it avoids marking multiples of numbers that have already been iterated over.
2. We can reduce the memory usage by half by only considering odd numbers, since apart from 2, all other prime numbers are odd. However, this would require a mapping from the number to the index and could complicate the code a bit.
3. Instead of precomputing the primes up to MAX, compute primes up to sqrt(MAX) as any number `n` has at least one factor less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`. Then use the precomputed primes to check if each number is prime.
4. We can use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` to make I/O operations faster.

Here is the optimized program:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#define MAX 999999
using namespace std;
int num_prime[MAX + 1];
bool not_prime_flag[MAX + 1];
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n;
  int limit = sqrt(MAX + 1);
  for (int i = 2; i <= limit; ++i) {
    if (!not_prime_flag[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j < MAX + 1; j += i) {
        not_prime_flag[j] = true;
      }
    }
  }
  num_prime[2] = 1;
  for (int i = 3; i < MAX + 1; ++i) {
    num_prime[i] = num_prime[i - 1] + !not_prime_flag[i];
  }
  while (cin >> n) {
    cout << num_prime[n] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this code, the inner loop of the Sieve starts at `i*i` because all smaller multiples of `i` would have already been marked by previous primes. The increment is changed to `j += i` to avoid unnecessary iterations. Also, the calculation of `num_prime` starts from 3 and goes up to MAX, as 2 is the only even prime number. Please note that the memory usage is not reduced in this version to keep the code simple.
