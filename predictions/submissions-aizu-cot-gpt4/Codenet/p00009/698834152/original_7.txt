This C++ program is finding the number of prime numbers below a certain number. The current program uses a Sieve of Eratosthenes-like algorithm to mark non-prime numbers and count the prime numbers for every number from 2 to MAX. The inner loop can be optimized by starting from `i*i` instead of `2*i`. This is because all numbers `n * k` for `n < i` and `k <= i` would already have been marked in previous steps.

Here is how we can optimize the given program:

1. The first optimization is in the inner loop of the sieve algorithm. Instead of starting from `2*i`, we can start from `i*i`. This is because, for all `k < i`, the multiple `k*i` would already have been marked in previous steps.

2. Remove the global `num_prime[]` array. Instead of storing the count of prime numbers up to each number, we can compute the count dynamically when the number is input.

3. As a minor optimization, we can also use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to speed up I/O operations by unsynchronizing C++'s I/O streams with C's.

4. The `cin.eof()` function is more efficient for checking the end of file condition. It does not need to read input into a buffer as `cin >> n` does.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define MAX 999999
using namespace std;
bool not_prime_flag[MAX + 1];

int count_primes(int n) {
  int count = 0;
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
    count += !not_prime_flag[i];
  }
  return count;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= MAX; ++i) {
    if (!not_prime_flag[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= MAX; j += i) {
        not_prime_flag[j] = true;
      }
    }
  }
  int n;
  while (cin >> n) {
    cout << count_primes(n) << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
