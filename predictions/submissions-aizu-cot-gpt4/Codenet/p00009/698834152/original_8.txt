This program finds the number of prime numbers less than or equal to a given number `n`. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit.

The program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. **Use less memory**: Instead of using two arrays of size MAX + 1, you can combine them into a single array. This will reduce the memory usage by half.

2. **Optimize inner loop**: In the inner loop, you can start `j` from `i` instead of 2 because any number less than `i` would already have been marked by previous iterations.

3. **Optimize the loop**: The outer loop runs up to MAX + 1, but you can stop it as soon as `i * i > MAX + 1`. This is because any composite number `n` has at least one factor less than or equal to the square root of `n`.

4. **Pre-calculate prime counts**: As the program seems to ask for prime counts multiple times, we can pre-calculate the prime counts and store them, so that we can access the counts in constant time.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define MAX 999999
using namespace std;

int prime_counts[MAX + 1];

void calculate_prime_counts() {
  bool not_prime_flag;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= MAX; ++i) {
    if (prime_counts[i] == i) { // i is prime
      for (int j = i; i * j <= MAX; ++j) {
        if (prime_counts[i * j] == i * j) { // if this number hasn't been marked yet
          prime_counts[i * j] = i;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  for (int i = 3; i <= MAX; ++i) {
    prime_counts[i] = prime_counts[i - 1] + (prime_counts[i] == i);
  }
}

int main() {
  calculate_prime_counts();
  int n;
  while (cin >> n) {
    cout << prime_counts[n] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, `prime_counts[i]` stores the smallest prime that divides `i`. If `i` is a prime number, then `prime_counts[i]` is `i` itself. We use this property to mark the non-prime numbers and count the prime numbers.
