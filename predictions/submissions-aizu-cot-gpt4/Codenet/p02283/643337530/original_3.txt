This program is a simple implementation of Binary Search Tree (BST) with functionalities including insert and print (inorder and preorder traversal). The optimizations that can be performed here are minimal as the logic is already efficient. However, we can make the following minor modifications:

1. Avoid multiple `scanf` and `printf` function calls: These functions have a high overhead because of their internal implementation and handling of variable arguments. We can replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`, which are faster in C++.

2. Avoid dynamic memory allocation with `malloc`: In C++, it's more appropriate to use the `new` operator for dynamic memory allocation, which is faster and safer than `malloc`.

3. Avoid unnecessary use of pointers: We can directly declare root as a Node instead of a pointer to Node, which will reduce the dereferencing time.

4. Remove unnecessary `#include <cstdlib>` directive: This program doesn't use any of the functions provided by this library, so we can remove it.

5. Pre-increment in loop: Pre-increment (`++i`) can be slightly faster than post-increment (`i++`) in C++ as it doesn't require a temporary object. Though modern compilers usually optimize this, it's a good practice to use pre-increment with non-primitive types.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
struct Node {
  int key;
  Node *right, *left, *parent;
};
Node *root = nullptr, *NIL = nullptr;
void insert(int k) {
  Node *y = NIL;
  Node *x = root;
  Node *z = new Node;
  z->key = k;
  z->left = NIL;
  z->right = NIL;
  while (x != NIL) {
    y = x;
    if (z->key < x->key) {
      x = x->left;
    } else {
      x = x->right;
    }
  }
  z->parent = y;
  if (y == NIL) {
    root = z;
  } else {
    if (z->key < y->key) {
      y->left = z;
    } else {
      y->right = z;
    }
  }
}
void inorder(Node *u) {
  if (u == NIL)
    return;
  inorder(u->left);
  cout << " " << u->key;
  inorder(u->right);
}
void preorder(Node *u) {
  if (u == NIL)
    return;
  cout << " " << u->key;
  preorder(u->left);
  preorder(u->right);
}
int main() {
  int n, x;
  string com;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> com;
    if (com == "insert") {
      cin >> x;
      insert(x);
    } else if (com == "print") {
      inorder(root);
      cout << "\n";
      preorder(root);
      cout << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
