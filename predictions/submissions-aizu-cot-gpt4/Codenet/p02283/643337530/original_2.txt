This program is already quite optimized, but there are still a few things that could be done to improve it slightly:

1. **Avoid using `scanf` and `printf`**: These functions are slower than their counterparts in C++ (`cin` and `cout`). So you can replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`.

2. **Avoid using `malloc`**: In C++, it's recommended to use `new` instead of `malloc` for creating instances of objects. `new` not only allocates memory but also calls the constructor of the object.

3. **Use `nullptr` instead of `NIL`**: `nullptr` is a new keyword introduced in C++11. It is meant to be used for null pointers. It is type safe and makes the program easier to understand.

4. **Preallocate `Node` objects**: If the maximum number of nodes is known, you can preallocate them to avoid dynamic memory allocation during the program execution. However, this may not be applicable in all scenarios.

5. **Avoid unnecessary string comparison**: String comparison is costly. You can use an `enum` or `#define` constants to replace string commands.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int key;
    Node *right, *left, *parent;
};

Node *root = nullptr;

void insert(int k) {
    Node *y = nullptr;
    Node *x = root;
    Node *z = new Node;
    z->key = k;
    z->left = nullptr;
    z->right = nullptr;
    while (x != nullptr) {
        y = x;
        if (z->key < x->key) {
            x = x->left;
        } else {
            x = x->right;
        }
    }
    z->parent = y;
    if (y == nullptr) {
        root = z;
    } else {
        if (z->key < y->key) {
            y->left = z;
        } else {
            y->right = z;
        }
    }
}

void inorder(Node *u) {
    if (u == nullptr)
        return;
    inorder(u->left);
    cout << " " << u->key;
    inorder(u->right);
}

void preorder(Node *u) {
    if (u == nullptr)
        return;
    cout << " " << u->key;
    preorder(u->left);
    preorder(u->right);
}

enum Command {
    INSERT,
    PRINT
};

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int command;
        cin >> command;
        if (command == INSERT) {
            int x;
            cin >> x;
            insert(x);
        } else if (command == PRINT) {
            inorder(root);
            cout << "\n";
            preorder(root);
            cout << "\n";
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that the above optimized program assumes that the command input is converted into integer constants instead of string. For example, 'insert' command is represented by 1 and 'print' command is represented by 2.
