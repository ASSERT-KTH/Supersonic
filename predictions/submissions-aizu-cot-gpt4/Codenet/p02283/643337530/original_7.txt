This program seems to be a binary tree with insertion and print (pre-order and in-order traversal) operations. However, there are a few ways we can optimize the code for better performance:

1. **Memory Allocation**: Use `new` instead of `malloc` as `malloc` requires type-casting for C++, but `new` does not. Also, `new` calls constructors, and `delete` calls destructors.
2. **Using `endl` vs `"\n"`**: In terms of speed, `"\n"` is faster than `endl` because `endl` causes a flush operation, which can be a costly operation in terms of time. So, we can replace `endl` with `"\n"`.
3. **Struct Initialization**: We can initialize the Node struct when we create a new node, which will make the code cleaner.
4. **Unnecessary Global Variables**: The `NIL` variable is not being properly used and it seems unnecessary. We can use `nullptr` instead of `NIL`. This will reduce memory usage.
5. **Using `std::cin` and `std::scanf` together**: It's not a good practice to use `std::cin` and `std::scanf` together because they can cause synchronization issues. In this case, it's better to stick with `std::cin`.
   
Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
  int key;
  Node *right = nullptr, *left = nullptr, *parent = nullptr;
};

Node *root = nullptr;

void insert(int k) {
  Node *y = nullptr;
  Node *x = root;
  Node *z = new Node;
  z->key = k;
  
  while (x != nullptr) {
    y = x;
    if (z->key < x->key) {
      x = x->left;
    } else {
      x = x->right;
    }
  }
  z->parent = y;
  
  if (y == nullptr) {
    root = z;
  } else {
    if (z->key < y->key) {
      y->left = z;
    } else {
      y->right = z;
    }
  }
}

void inorder(Node *u) {
  if (u == nullptr)
    return;
  inorder(u->left);
  cout << " " << u->key;
  inorder(u->right);
}

void preorder(Node *u) {
  if (u == nullptr)
    return;
  cout << " " << u->key;
  preorder(u->left);
  preorder(u->right);
}

int main() {
  int n, i, x;
  string com;
  cin >> n;
  
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> com;
    if (com == "insert") {
      cin >> x;
      insert(x);
    } else if (com == "print") {
      inorder(root);
      cout << "\n";
      preorder(root);
      cout << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: Always remember to deallocate dynamically allocated memory in real-world applications to prevent memory leak. This was not done in the original code and not included in the optimized code to keep the changes minimal.
