The given program is a basic implementation of Binary Search Tree (BST) insertion and traversal. The program uses a combination of C and C++ standard libraries and constructs, which can be optimized with respect to memory management and the usage of modern C++ features. Here are the steps for optimization:

1. Memory Management: `malloc` is used to allocate memory for new nodes in the BST. This is a C-style memory allocation which doesn't call the constructor. In C++, `new` is preferred over `malloc` as it calls the constructor and is type safe.

2. I/O Operations: The program uses a combination of `scanf`, `printf` and `cin`, `cout` for I/O operations. This can be optimized by choosing only one method. Since this is a C++ code, using `cin` and `cout` is more appropriate. Also, using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` can speed up I/O operations.

3. Unnecessary Variables: Variable `i` is used for loop indexing, which can be declared within the loop itself.

4. Use of `std::string`: The `com` variable is of type `std::string`, which is more expensive in terms of memory than C style strings. But since it provides more safety and functionality, we will keep it.

The optimized program is presented below:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
  int key;
  Node *right, *left, *parent;
};

Node *root, *NIL;

void insert(int k) {
  Node *y = NIL;
  Node *x = root;
  Node *z = new Node;
  z->key = k;
  z->left = NIL;
  z->right = NIL;
  while (x != NIL) {
    y = x;
    if (z->key < x->key) {
      x = x->left;
    } else {
      x = x->right;
    }
  }
  z->parent = y;
  if (y == NIL) {
    root = z;
  } else {
    if (z->key < y->key) {
      y->left = z;
    } else {
      y->right = z;
    }
  }
}

void inorder(Node *u) {
  if (u == NIL)
    return;
  inorder(u->left);
  cout << " " << u->key;
  inorder(u->right);
}

void preorder(Node *u) {
  if (u == NIL)
    return;
  cout << " " << u->key;
  preorder(u->left);
  preorder(u->right);
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n, x;
  string com;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> com;
    if (com == "insert") {
      cin >> x;
      insert(x);
    } else if (com == "print") {
      inorder(root);
      cout << "\n";
      preorder(root);
      cout << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code uses modern C++ features and practices, making it more efficient and readable.
