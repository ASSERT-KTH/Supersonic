The given C++ program seems to simulate a kind of game or puzzle, where it calculates the maximum area of a certain color. 

There are few areas where we can optimize this code for run-time and memory usage:

1. Avoid unnecessary copies of the matrix `N` in the recursive function `on`. In the current program, `N` is passed by value, meaning that a new copy of `N` is created every time `on` is called. This can be both time- and memory-consuming, especially when the matrix is large. We can pass `N` by reference to avoid these unnecessary copies.

2. Avoid unnecessary use of the `queue` data structure in the function `on`. The queue is used to do a breadth-first search (BFS) of the matrix. However, this is not necessary because we can achieve the same result with a simple recursive function, which will be faster and consume less memory.

3. Avoid unnecessary use of the `vector` data structure in the function `solve`. The vector `V` is used to read and store the input matrix. However, this is not necessary because we can read the input directly into the matrix `N`, which will be faster and consume less memory.

4. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to increase the speed of `cin` and `cout`.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string.h>
using namespace std;
int w, h, Col;
typedef pair<int, int> C;
typedef vector<vector<int>> P;
int dx[4] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int dy[4] = {1, 0, -1, 0};
int res;
P N;
int tres = 0;
void calc(int y, int x) {
  if (y < 0 || x < 0 || x >= w || y >= h)
    return;
  if (N[y][x] == Col) {
    tres++;
    N[y][x] = 0;
    for (int r = 0; r < 4; r++)
      calc(y + dy[r], x + dx[r]);
  }
}
void on(int count, int c) {
  if (count == 5) {
    tres = 0;
    calc(0, 0);
    res = max(res, tres);
    return;
  }
  int nc = N[0][0];
  N[0][0] = c;
  for (int r = 0; r < 4; r++) {
    int ny = dy[r], nx = dx[r];
    if (ny < 0 || nx < 0 || ny >= h || nx >= w)
      continue;
    if (N[ny][nx] == nc)
      on(count + 1, c);
  }
  if (count != 4)
    for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++)
      on(count + 1, i);
  else
    on(count + 1, Col);
}
void solve() {
  res = 0;
  N.clear();
  N.resize(h);
  for (int y = 0; y < h; y++)
    for (int x = 0; x < w; x++) {
      cin >> N[y][x];
    }
  for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
    if (N[0][0] != i)
      on(0, i);
  }
  cout << res << endl;
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  while (cin >> h >> w >> Col) {
    if (w == 0)
      break;
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
