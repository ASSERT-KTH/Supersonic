The given program seems to perform operations related to graph theory, possibly finding the shortest distance between vertices, and then performing some calculations based on these distances.

Here are the main points of optimization:

1. The given program uses `std::vector` extensively. Vectors are dynamically sized arrays and are not the most efficient data structure for situations where we know the maximum size upfront. In such cases, arrays are faster.

2. There is a usage of `std::queue` in the program. If the number of elements pushed to the queue is significantly less than the maximum possible size of the queue, it would be more memory efficient to use a `std::deque`. A deque (double-ended queue) allows insertion and removal of elements from both ends with little cost. It is implemented as a dynamic array that can grow in both directions.

3. The program uses `std::pair` to store related data. This is fine, but the use of structured bindings can make the code more readable and potentially more efficient.

4. The program uses `std::fill` to initialize the `dist` array. This function has a time complexity of O(n). If we can initialize this array at the time of declaration, it would be more efficient.

5. The program uses extensive branching (if statements), some of which can be simplified or removed to improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <deque>
#include <array>

const int MAX = 210000;
int n, m, q, a[MAX], b[MAX], c, dist[MAX], T[MAX], cnt, U[MAX];
std::array<std::deque<std::pair<int, int>>, MAX> x, y;
bool used[MAX];

int main() {
  scanf("%d%d%d", &n, &m, &q);
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    scanf("%d%d", &a[i], &b[i]);
    x[a[i]].push_back({b[i], i});
    x[b[i]].push_back({a[i], i});
  }
  std::fill(dist, dist + n + 1, 999999);
  dist[1] = 0;
  std::deque<int> Q;
  Q.push_back(1);
  while (!Q.empty()) {
    int a1 = Q.front();
    Q.pop_front();
    for (auto [first, _] : x[a1]) {
      if (dist[first] > dist[a1] + 1) {
        dist[first] = dist[a1] + 1;
        Q.push_back(first);
      }
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (auto j : x[i]) {
      if (dist[i] < dist[j.first]) {
        y[i].push_back(j);
        T[j.first]++;
      }
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &c);
    c--;
    std::deque<std::pair<int, int>> Q1;
    int ss = dist[a[c]] > dist[b[c]] ? a[c] : b[c];
    if (ss >= 1 && U[ss] == 0 && used[c] == false) {
      Q1.push_back({ss, c});
      while (!Q1.empty()) {
        auto [a1, a2] = Q1.front();
        Q1.pop_front();
        if (U[a1] == 1 || used[a2] == true)
          continue;
        T[a1]--;
        used[a2] = true;
        if (T[a1] != 0)
          continue;
        cnt++;
        U[a1] = 1;
        for (auto j : y[a1]) {
          if (U[j.first] == 0)
            Q1.push_back(j);
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", cnt);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these changes may not significantly improve the program's performance, as the main performance bottleneck seems to be the graph traversal algorithm, which already is quite efficient. The given improvements mostly aim to increase the code's readability and clean up some unnecessary overhead.
