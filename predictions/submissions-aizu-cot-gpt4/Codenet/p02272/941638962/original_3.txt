This program uses a merge sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. This algorithm has good time complexity, but there are some small optimizations we can make to the program:

1. Reduce the scope of variables: The variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `n1`, `n2` are defined globally but they are only used in the `merge` function. We can define these variables locally in the `merge` function to reduce memory usage and avoid any potential side effects from other parts of the program.

2. Reduce unnecessary operations: In the `main` function, there is an `if` condition inside the loop to check whether a space should be printed. We can modify this loop to print the space before the element, and then we would not need to check the condition on each iteration.

3. Use `const` for variables that won't be changed: The `left`, `mid`, and `right` parameters in the `merge` function are never changed, so we can declare them as `const` to help the compiler optimize the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX 1000000001
void mergesort(int *, int, int);
void merge(int *, const int, const int, const int);
int count = 0, n;
int main(void) {
  int S[500000];
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  mergesort(S, 0, n);
  printf("%d", S[0]);
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    printf(" %d", S[i]);
  }
  printf("\n%d\n", count);
  return 0;
}
void mergesort(int *S, int left, int right) {
  int mid;
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergesort(S, left, mid);
    mergesort(S, mid, right);
    merge(S, left, mid, right);
  }
}
void merge(int *S, const int left, const int mid, const int right) {
  int n1 = mid - left;
  int n2 = right - mid;
  int Left[n1+1], Right[n2+1];
  for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++)
    Left[i] = S[left + i];
  for (int i = 0; i < n2; i++)
    Right[i] = S[mid + i];
  Left[n1] = MAX;
  Right[n2] = MAX;
  int i = 0;
  int j = 0;
  int k = left;
  while (k < right) {
    if (Left[j] > Right[i])
      S[k++] = Right[i++];
    else
      S[k++] = Left[j++];
  }
  count += right - left;
}
```

This program will have the same output as the original one, but it's a bit more efficient in terms of memory usage and running time.
