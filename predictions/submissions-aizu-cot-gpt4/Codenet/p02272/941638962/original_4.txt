The given program is an implementation of the merge sort algorithm. It appears to be well-optimized for the most part, but there are a few areas where the program could be improved.

Optimization Steps:

1. **Global Variables:** The use of global variables should be minimized. In this case, variables like `i`, `j`, `k`, `n1`, `n2`, and `count` can be used as local variables in their respective functions. This would make the code easier to read and debug, and also save memory because global variables stay in memory for the duration of the program, whereas local variables only stay in memory for the duration of the function they're in.

2. **Function Parameters:** The `merge` function does not need the `S` array as a parameter because it's a global variable. This would make the function signature simpler and easier to read.

3. **Unnecessary Initialization:** The `mid` variable inside `mergesort` function does not need to be initialized when declared. Its value is determined later in the if condition, so initializing it when declaring is unnecessary.

4. **Input/Output Efficiency:** The input and output of the program could be made more efficient by using faster I/O methods. The `scanf` and `printf` functions are slower than some alternatives. For instance, we can use `getchar_unlocked` and `putchar_unlocked` for faster I/O.

5. **Array Initialization:** In the `merge` function, the `Left` and `Right` arrays are filled with the `MAX` value. This can be avoided by checking in the while loop whether we have reached the end of either array.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX 1000000001

void mergesort(int *, int, int);
void merge(int, int, int);
int n, S[500000], Left[250001], Right[250001];
int count = 0;

int main(void) {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  mergesort(S, 0, n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("%d", S[i]);
    if (i != n - 1)
      printf(" ");
  }
  printf("\n%d\n", count);
  return 0;
}

void mergesort(int *S, int left, int right) {
  int mid;
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergesort(S, left, mid);
    mergesort(S, mid, right);
    merge(left, mid, right);
  }
}

void merge(int left, int mid, int right) {
  int n1 = mid - left;
  int n2 = right - mid;
  for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++)
    Left[i] = S[left + i];
  for (int i = 0; i < n2; i++)
    Right[i] = S[mid + i];
  int i = 0, j = 0, k = left;
  while (k < right) {
    if (j >= n1 || (i < n2 && Left[j] > Right[i]))
      S[k++] = Right[i++];
    else
      S[k++] = Left[j++];
  }
  count += right - left;
}
```
