Step 1:
The first optimization that we can perform is to remove the `printf` function from the standard library and replace it with `cout` from the iostream library. The standard IO libraries (like `printf`, `scanf`, etc.) in C are slower than the ones in C++ (like `cin`, `cout`, etc.).

Step 2:
The next optimization is to reduce the number of iterations in the merge function. Instead of iterating over the entire array, we can iterate only until `n1` or `n2`.

Step 3:
Instead of creating two separate arrays `L` and `R` for storing the left and right halves of the array `A`, we can directly use the array `A`. This will save memory.

Step 4:
In the merge function, we are setting the last element of `L` and `R` to `INF`. Instead of doing this, we can check the index `i` and `j` in the condition of the `if` statement. If `i` or `j` is equal to `n1` or `n2`, then we can take the element from the other array. This will save one operation for each element in the array.

Step 5:
We can reduce the number of arguments in the merge function by removing the `right` argument. The value of `right` can be calculated in the function using `left` and `mid`.

Step 6:
The main function can be simplified by removing the separate loop for outputting the array. We can output the array elements in the same loop in which we are reading the inputs.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
const int MAX = 500000;
int cnt;
int A[MAX] = {0};
void merge(int left, int mid) {
  int i = left, j = mid, k = 0;
  int temp[MAX];
  while (i < mid && j < 2 * mid - left) {
    if (A[i] <= A[j]) {
      temp[k] = A[i];
      i++;
    } else {
      temp[k] = A[j];
      j++;
    }
    k++;
    cnt++;
  }
  while (i < mid) {
    temp[k] = A[i];
    i++;
    k++;
    cnt++;
  }
  while (j < 2 * mid - left) {
    temp[k] = A[j];
    j++;
    k++;
    cnt++;
  }
  for (i = left; i < 2 * mid - left; i++) {
    A[i] = temp[i - left];
  }
}
void mergesort(int left, int right) {
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergesort(left, mid);
    mergesort(mid, right);
    merge(left, mid);
  }
}
int main() {
  int N;
  cnt = 0;
  cin >> N;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
    if (i > 0) {
      cout << " ";
    }
    cout << A[i];
  }
  cout << endl;
  mergesort(0, N);
  cout << cnt << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This code is more efficient in terms of both running time and memory usage compared to the original code.
