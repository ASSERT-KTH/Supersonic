This program is a merge sort implementation. There are a few things that can be improved:

1. Redundant variables: The program declares `int n, i, j;` but `n` is never used and `i, j` are redeclared in the scope of the for loops. We can remove these redundant variables.
2. Redundant copies: The program copies the left and right halves of the array to be sorted into temporary arrays `L` and `R`. This is not necessary and can be avoided by directly accessing the elements in the original array. This will reduce the memory usage significantly.
3. I/O operations: `cin` and `cout` are notoriously slow. We can speed up the I/O operations by using `scanf` and `printf` instead. Additionally, we can avoid flushing the output buffer unnecessarily by not using `endl`.
4. Unnecessary comparison: In the print loop, the program checks if it's about to print the last element to decide whether to print a space or a newline character. We can avoid this comparison by always printing a space after the elements and then printing a newline character after the loop.

Here is the optimized version of the program according to these points:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 1000000001;
const int MAX = 500000;
int cnt;
int S[MAX] = {0};
void merge(int *A, int left, int mid, int right) {
  int n1 = mid - left;
  int n2 = right - mid;
  int i = 0, j = 0;
  for (int k = left; k < right; k++) {
    if ((i < n1 && A[left + i] <= A[mid + j]) || j >= n2) {
      A[k] = A[left + i++];
    } else {
      A[k] = A[mid + j++];
    }
    cnt++;
  }
}
void mergesort(int *A, int left, int right) {
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergesort(A, left, mid);
    mergesort(A, mid, right);
    merge(A, left, mid, right);
  }
}
int main() {
  int N;
  cnt = 0;
  scanf("%d", &N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  }
  mergesort(S, 0, N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    printf("%d ", S[i]);
  }
  printf("\n%d\n", cnt);
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this optimized version of the program does not exactly replicate the behavior of the original program: It always prints a space after the last sorted integer. The original program does not print a space after the last sorted integer. If this is an issue, the unnecessary comparison in the print loop can be reintroduced.
