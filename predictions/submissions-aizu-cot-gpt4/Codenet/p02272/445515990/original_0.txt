This program is implementing merge sort, a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It's reasonably efficient, but there are a few areas where we could tweak things for performance:

1. Pass by reference: Currently the arrays are being passed by value which results in unnecessary copying of arrays which can be expensive in terms of time and space. So, instead, we should pass the array by reference.

2. Reduce the scope of variables: Variables like 'i', 'j', 'n1', 'n2', 'n' are declared at the beginning of the merge function but they are only used in specific parts of the function. Reducing the scope of these variables might improve readability and reduce memory usage slightly.

3. Unnecessary array initializations: The arrays L and R are initialized with a size of MAX/2 + 1 but only the first n1 and n2 elements are used. We could avoid this unnecessary memory allocation by initializing them with the required size inside the merge function.

4. Use of the INF constant: The program uses a constant INF as a sentinel value to indicate the end of the L and R arrays. This is not really necessary and we can avoid this by simply checking if we have reached the end of either array during the merge process.

5. Use of 'cnt' variable: The program uses a global variable 'cnt' to keep track of the number of times the elements are compared. Instead of incrementing this in the merge function, we could increment it in the main function which could reduce the overhead of accessing a global variable.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void merge(vector<int>& A, int left, int mid, int right, int& cnt) {
  int n1 = mid - left;
  int n2 = right - mid;
  vector<int> L(A.begin() + left, A.begin() + mid);
  vector<int> R(A.begin() + mid, A.begin() + right);
  int i = 0, j = 0;
  for (int k = left; k < right; k++) {
    if (j >= n2 || (i < n1 && L[i] <= R[j])) {
      A[k] = L[i++];
    } else {
      A[k] = R[j++];
    }
    cnt++;
  }
}

void mergesort(vector<int>& A, int left, int right, int& cnt) {
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergesort(A, left, mid, cnt);
    mergesort(A, mid, right, cnt);
    merge(A, left, mid, right, cnt);
  }
}

int main() {
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  vector<int> S(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> S[i];
  }
  int cnt = 0;
  mergesort(S, 0, N, cnt);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (i > 0) {
      cout << " ";
    }
    cout << S[i];
  }
  cout << "\n" << cnt << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
