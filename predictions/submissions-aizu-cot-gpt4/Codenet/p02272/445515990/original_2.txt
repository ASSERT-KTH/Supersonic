Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid using `std::endl`. `std::endl` flushes the output buffer which is a costly operation in terms of time. Instead, use "\n" for line breaks.
2. Avoid using `cin` and `cout` for heavy input/output. `scanf` and `printf` are faster than `cin` and `cout`.
3. Use prefix increment instead of postfix. Prefix increment is faster than postfix increment as it doesn't need to create a temporary object.
4. Keep variables local to the block they are used in. This makes the program easier to understand and reduces the chances of inadvertently modifying a variable.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 1000000001;
const int MAX = 500000;
int S[MAX] = {0}, L[1 + MAX / 2] = {0}, R[1 + MAX / 2] = {0};
void merge(int *A, int left, int mid, int right, int &cnt) {
  int n1 = mid - left, n2 = right - mid;
  int i, j;
  for (i = 0; i < n1; i++) {
    L[i] = A[left + i];
  }
  for (i = 0; i < n2; i++) {
    R[i] = A[mid + i];
  }
  L[n1] = INF;
  R[n2] = INF;
  i = 0;
  j = 0;
  for (int k = 0; k < right - left; k++) {
    if (L[i] <= R[j]) {
      A[left + k] = L[i];
      ++i;
    } else {
      A[left + k] = R[j];
      ++j;
    }
    ++cnt;
  }
}
void mergesort(int *A, int left, int right, int &cnt) {
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergesort(A, left, mid, cnt);
    mergesort(A, mid, right, cnt);
    merge(A, left, mid, right, cnt);
  }
}
int main() {
  int N, cnt = 0;
  scanf("%d", &N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  }
  mergesort(S, 0, N, cnt);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    printf("%d", S[i]);
    if (i == N - 1)
      printf("\n");
    else
      printf(" ");
  }
  printf("%d\n", cnt);
  return 0;
}
```

Justification:

1. Removing `std::endl` and replacing it with "\n" speeds up the program as it avoids buffer flushing.
2. Replacing `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` significantly speeds up I/O operations, which often can be a bottleneck in competitive programming problems.
3. Using prefix increment instead of postfix increment can lead to slightly faster code due to the absence of a temporary object.
4. By keeping `cnt` variable local and passing it as a reference to the functions that are modifying it, we avoid unnecessary global scope.
