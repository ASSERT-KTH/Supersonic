The code is a merge sort implementation. The main opportunities for optimization are in the `merge` and `mergesort` functions.

1. In the `merge` function, there's no need to duplicate the array elements into the `L` and `R` arrays. This consumes extra memory and involves unnecessary copy operations. Instead, we can use pointers to track the progress through the two halves of the array being merged.

2. The number of comparisons `cnt` is calculated in each merge operation. This operation can be moved outside the merge operation and calculated just once in the `mergesort` function.

3. In the `main` function, you can use `'\n'` instead of `endl` to avoid unnecessary buffer flushes which can slow down the program.

4. You can also use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams.

Here's the optimized version:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 1000000001;
const int MAX = 500000;
int cnt;
int S[MAX] = {0};
void merge(int *A, int left, int mid, int right) {
  int i = left, j = mid;
  int k = 0;
  while (i < mid && j < right) {
    if (A[i] <= A[j]) {
      S[k] = A[i];
      i++;
    } else {
      S[k] = A[j];
      j++;
    }
    k++;
  }
  while (i < mid) {
    S[k] = A[i];
    i++;
    k++;
  }
  while (j < right) {
    S[k] = A[j];
    j++;
    k++;
  }
  for (i = left; i < right; i++) {
    A[i] = S[i - left];
  }
}
void mergesort(int *A, int left, int right) {
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergesort(A, left, mid);
    mergesort(A, mid, right);
    merge(A, left, mid, right);
    cnt += right - left - 1;
  }
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int N;
  cnt = 0;
  cin >> N;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> S[i];
  }
  mergesort(S, 0, N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (i == N - 1) {
      cout << S[i] << '\n';
    } else {
      cout << S[i] << " ";
    }
  }
  cout << cnt << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

These changes should result in a faster and more memory efficient implementation of merge sort.
