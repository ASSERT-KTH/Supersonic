This program is a merge sort implementation. In the merge phase, it creates two temporary arrays L and R and assigns INF at the end of these arrays. This INF is used to indicate the end of the arrays L and R. In the merge phase, the program is comparing the elements of L and R and assigning the smaller element to the original array. If one array finishes before the other one, the remaining elements of the other array are copied to the original array using the INF as an indicator of the end of the array.

The main optimization we can make here is to avoid copying data into temporary arrays L and R. Instead, we can merge the data directly in the original array. This will save us the time we spend on copying the data and will also save us memory because we won't have to create the temporary arrays. However, this will require us to use additional indices to keep track of the current position in the two subarrays we are merging.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
const int MAX = 500000;
int cnt;
int S[MAX] = {0};

void merge(int *A, int left, int mid, int right) {
  int i = left, j = mid, k = 0;
  int temp[right-left+1];

  while(i < mid && j < right) {
    if(A[i] <= A[j]) {
      temp[k++] = A[i++];
    } else {
      temp[k++] = A[j++];
    }
    cnt++;
  }
  while(i < mid) {
    temp[k++] = A[i++];
    cnt++;
  }
  while(j < right) {
    temp[k++] = A[j++];
    cnt++;
  }
  for(i = left, k = 0; i < right;) {
    A[i++] = temp[k++];
  }
}

void mergesort(int *A, int left, int right) {
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergesort(A, left, mid);
    mergesort(A, mid, right);
    merge(A, left, mid, right);
  }
}

int main() {
  int N;
  cnt = 0;
  cin >> N;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> S[i];
  }
  mergesort(S, 0, N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (i == N - 1) {
      cout << S[i] << endl;
    } else {
      cout << S[i] << " ";
    }
  }
  cout << cnt << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, we create a temporary array of the size of the range we are currently sorting. We use this array to store the merged elements. After we have merged the elements, we copy them back to the original array. This way we avoid the need for the arrays L and R and the use of the constant INF. We also avoid the need to copy the elements to L and R and then back to the original array. 

Please note that this optimization may not be beneficial if the size of the range we are sorting is very large because the size of the temporary array is proportional to this size. However, in the context of the provided code, where the size of the original array is fixed and relatively small (500000), this optimization should be beneficial.
