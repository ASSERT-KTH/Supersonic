This program is using Merge Sort to sort a given array. Here are some steps we can take to optimize it:

1. Inline functions: The functions `inputArray` and `printArray` are already marked as `static`, which suggests that they're only being used in this file. However, these functions can be inlined for performance improvements as they are small functions and called multiple times. The `inline` keyword suggests to the compiler that it should attempt to embed the function's code in place of where the function is being called.

2. Avoiding unnecessary memory allocation: The vectors `L` and `R` are being resized each time the `merge` function is called, which involves memory allocation and deallocation. This can be avoided by allocating memory only once at the start of the merge sort operation, and then simply copying the necessary elements into `L` and `R` in each `merge` operation.

3. Local variable usage: The `compared` variable is global, which can lead to slower access times compared to local variables. We should make the `compared` variable local to the `main` function and pass it by reference to the `merge` and `mergeSort` functions.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

inline void inputArray(uint32_t A[], int num) {
  for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
}

inline void printArray(uint32_t A[], int num) {
  for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    cout << (i != 0 ? " " : "") << A[i];
  }
  cout << endl;
}

vector<uint32_t> L(250000);
vector<uint32_t> R(250000);

inline void merge(uint32_t A[], uint32_t left, uint32_t mid,
                  uint32_t right, int& compared) {
  uint32_t n1 = mid - left;
  uint32_t n2 = right - mid;
  for (uint32_t i = 0; i < n1; i++) L[i] = A[left + i];
  for (uint32_t i = 0; i < n2; i++) R[i] = A[mid + i];
  L[n1] = R[n2] = UINT32_MAX;
  for (uint32_t i = 0, j = 0, k = left; k < right; k++) {
    compared++;
    if (L[i] <= R[j]) {
      A[k] = L[i];
      i++;
    } else {
      A[k] = R[j];
      j++;
    }
  }
}

inline void mergeSort(uint32_t A[], uint32_t left, uint32_t right, int& compared) {
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    uint32_t mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergeSort(A, left, mid, compared);
    mergeSort(A, mid, right, compared);
    merge(A, left, mid, right, compared);
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<uint32_t> A(n);
  inputArray(&A[0], n);
  int compared = 0;
  mergeSort(&A[0], 0, n, compared);
  printArray(&A[0], n);
  cout << compared << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the maximum possible size of `L` and `R` has been hardcoded as `250000`. If you know that the input size `n` will not exceed this, then it's fine. If not, you should dynamically resize `L` and `R` to be of size `n/2 + 1` after reading `n`.
