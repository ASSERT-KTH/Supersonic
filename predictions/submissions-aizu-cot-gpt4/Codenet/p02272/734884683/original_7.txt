The given C++ program performs a merge sort operation on an array of unsigned 32-bit integers. It uses two vectors L and R as helper storage during the merge operation. The program also counts the number of comparisons made.

Optimization steps:

1. The vectors `L` and `R` are defined as global variables and are always of size 250000. This could lead to memory wastage if the size of the array being sorted is significantly smaller. Instead, we can declare `L` and `R` inside the merge function and make their size dependent on `n1` and `n2`.

2. We can also avoid assigning `UINT32_MAX` to `L[n1]` and `R[n2]` by modifying the merge loop condition to stop when either `i` reaches `n1` or `j` reaches `n2`.

3. The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output, which are slower compared to `scanf` and `printf`. For large inputs/outputs, this could result in considerable time difference.

4. Instead of using a pointer to the first element of the vector in functions `inputArray`, `printArray` and `mergeSort`, we can pass the vector by reference to improve readability of the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

static void inputArray(vector<uint32_t>& A, int num) {
  for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    scanf("%u", &A[i]);
  }
}

static void printArray(const vector<uint32_t>& A, int num) {
  for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    printf((i != 0 ? " %u" : "%u"), A[i]);
  }
  printf("\n");
}

static int compared = 0;

static inline void merge(vector<uint32_t>& A, uint32_t left, uint32_t mid, uint32_t right) {
  uint32_t n1 = mid - left;
  uint32_t n2 = right - mid;
  vector<uint32_t> L(A.begin() + left, A.begin() + mid);
  vector<uint32_t> R(A.begin() + mid, A.begin() + right);
  uint32_t i = 0, j = 0, k = left;
  while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
    compared++;
    if (L[i] <= R[j]) {
      A[k++] = L[i++];
    } else {
      A[k++] = R[j++];
    }
  }
  while (i < n1) {
    A[k++] = L[i++];
  }
  while (j < n2) {
    A[k++] = R[j++];
  }
}

static inline void mergeSort(vector<uint32_t>& A, uint32_t left, uint32_t right) {
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    uint32_t mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergeSort(A, left, mid);
    mergeSort(A, mid, right);
    merge(A, left, mid, right);
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  vector<uint32_t> A(n);
  inputArray(A, n);
  mergeSort(A, 0, n);
  printArray(A, n);
  printf("%d\n", compared);
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimization of changing `cin/cout` to `scanf/printf` might not have a significant impact on modern compilers.
