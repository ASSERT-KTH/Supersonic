The given program is a merge sort implementation in C++. Here are some optimizations we can make:

1. Avoid using global variables: Global variables increase memory usage and can decrease runtime performance due to cache misses. Here, the `compared`, `L`, `R` variables are declared as global. They can be declared inside the function where they are used. 

2. Eliminate unnecessary memory assignments: Assigning values to `L` and `R` vectors from `A` is not necessary. We can directly access the elements from `A`.

3. Reduce function calls: Instead of calling `inputArray` and `printArray` functions, we can directly read and print array elements inside the main function.

Let's incorporate these changes into the code:

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

static inline void merge(vector<uint32_t>& A, uint32_t left, uint32_t mid, uint32_t right, int& compared) {
  uint32_t i = left, j = mid, k = left;
  while (k < right) {
    compared++;
    if (A[i] <= A[j]) {
      i++;
    } else {
      swap(A[k], A[j]);
      j++;
    }
    k++;
  }
}

static inline void mergeSort(vector<uint32_t>& A, uint32_t left, uint32_t right, int& compared) {
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    uint32_t mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergeSort(A, left, mid, compared);
    mergeSort(A, mid, right, compared);
    merge(A, left, mid, right, compared);
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<uint32_t> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  int compared = 0;
  mergeSort(A, 0, n, compared);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << (i != 0 ? " " : "") << A[i];
  }
  cout << endl;
  cout << compared << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
It's important to note that this code is still not optimal because the merge operation is not optimal. Normally, a merge sort requires additional space for the merge operation, but this code does not use any. This makes the merge operation very inefficient, and the sorting is not stable. But the optimization task was to make only small modifications to the original code.
