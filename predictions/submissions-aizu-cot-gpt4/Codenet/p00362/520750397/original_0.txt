The provided code is quite cryptic, making it difficult to understand and thus optimize. However, we can still perform some generic optimizations which should improve the code's performance marginally. 

Here's the step by step explanation of the optimizations:

1. Instead of using map for `T`, use `unordered_map`. An unordered_map in C++ is implemented using a Hash Table and searching in a Hash Table is O(1) on average as compared to map in C++ which is implemented using a self-balancing Binary Search Tree and takes O(Log N) time for searching. This will improve the time complexity.

2. The `S` function is called with the same arguments multiple times in a loop. We can store the results of the function calls in a `memo` table to avoid redundant computations. This technique is known as memoization. 

3. We can replace the post-increment operations with pre-increment. Post-increment creates a copy and then increments, while pre-increment simply increments. This can save a bit of time.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define U [7 << 15] = {}
#define G )+((c=A[a]+A[P[a]]+C[a])%k?c:0)-M(
typedef long long L;
using namespace std;
unordered_map<L, L> T U;
L P U, E U, Z U, H U, C U, A U, O U, X U, B U, k, n, a, b, c;
char s U;
L M(L f) { return f ? B[f] + M(f ^ f & -f) : 0; }
unordered_map<L, unordered_map<L, L>> memo;
L S(L a, L i) {
  if (memo[a].find(i) != memo[a].end()) return memo[a][i];
  for (a = M(++i G i); i < 2e5; i += i & -i)
    B[i] += a;
  return memo[a][i] = a;
}
L D(L f) {
  L d;
  Z[f] = 1;
  for (auto I = T[f].begin(); I != T[f].end(); I++)
    d = I->first, !Z[d] ? P[d] = f, E[d] = E[f] + 1, C[d] = I->second, D(d),
    Z[f] += Z[d], !H[f] | Z[H[f]] < Z[d] ? H[f] = d : 0 : 0;
}
L K(L f) {
  a = X[f];
  n = X[b];
  return a - n ? M(O[E[a] < E[n] ? a = n, n = b, b = f, n : f] G O[a]) + K(P[a])
               : abs(M(O[f]) - M(O[b]));
}
main() {
  for (cin >> n >> k; --n; T[a][b] = T[b][a] = c)
    cin >> a >> b >> c;
  for (D(a = b = 0); n < *Z; a = H[P[++n]] - n ? n : 0)
    for (; !b | a; S(a = H[a], ++O[a]))
      X[a] = n;
  for (cin >> a; cin >> s >> a >> b; ++S(H[a], O[a]), S(a, ++O[a] - 1))
    *s & 2 ? cout << K(a) << endl, 0 : A[a] += b;
}
```
It's worth noting that these optimizations will only provide marginal improvements. The overall complexity is determined by the structure of the code, which seems to be obfuscated and hard to understand in this case.
