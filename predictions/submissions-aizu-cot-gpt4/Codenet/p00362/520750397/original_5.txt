This code seems to be written in obfuscated manner to make it hard to understand. It's not a good practice to write a code in such a way, because it makes it hard to maintain and debug. However, let's try to optimize the code where possible.

First, let's explain the parts of the code that we can understand.

1. `#define U [7 << 15] = {}` and `#define G )+((c=A[a]+A[P[a]]+C[a])%k?c:0)-M(`: These are macro definitions, they replace `U` and `G` in code with `[7 << 15] = {}` and `)+((c=A[a]+A[P[a]]+C[a])%k?c:0)-M(` respectively.

2. `typedef long long L;` : This is a typedef, which is used to give a new name to an existing type.

3. `map<L, L> T U;` : This is a map where both key and value are long long integers.

4. `main() { ... }` : This is the main function where the program starts.

In terms of optimization, there are a few things we can do:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because this header file includes quite literally everything and can slow down compile times significantly. Instead, we should include only the necessary libraries.

2. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up cin and cout operations.

3. Use `"\n"` instead of `std::endl` because `endl` causes unnecessary flushing of the buffer which can slow down output.

4. Use array instead of map where possible because map operations are slower than array operations.

5. Use pre-increment (++i) instead of post-increment (i++) where possible because pre-increment is faster.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#define U [7 << 15] = {}
#define G )+((c=A[a]+A[P[a]]+C[a])%k?c:0)-M(
typedef long long L;
using namespace std;
map<L, L> T U;
L P U, E U, Z U, H U, C U, A U, O U, X U, B U, k, n, a, b, c;
char s U;
L M(L f) { return f ? B[f] + M(f ^ f & -f) : 0; }
L S(L a, L i) {
  for (a = M(++i G i); i < 2e5; i += i & -i)
    B[i] += a;
}
L D(L f) {
  L d;
  Z[f] = 1;
  for (map<L, L>::iterator I = T[f].begin(); I != T[f].end(); ++I)
    d = I->first, !Z[d] ? P[d] = f, E[d] = E[f] + 1, C[d] = I->second, D(d),
    Z[f] += Z[d], !H[f] | Z[H[f]] < Z[d] ? H[f] = d : 0 : 0;
}
L K(L f) {
  a = X[f];
  n = X[b];
  return a - n ? M(O[E[a] < E[n] ? a = n, n = b, b = f, n : f] G O[a]) + K(P[a])
               : abs(M(O[f]) - M(O[b]));
}
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cin >> n >> k;
  while(--n) 
    cin >> a >> b >> c, T[a][b] = T[b][a] = c;
  for (D(a = b = 0); n < *Z; a = H[P[++n]] - n ? n : 0)
    for (; !b || a; S(a = H[a], O[a] = ++b))
      X[a] = n;
  cin >> a;
  while (cin >> s >> a >> b) {
    S(H[a], O[a]);
    S(a, O[a] - 1);
    if (*s & 2) 
      cout << K(a) << "\n";
    else 
      A[a] += b;
  }
  return 0;
}
