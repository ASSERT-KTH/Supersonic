The code is written in obfuscated C++, which makes it hard to understand. The program seems to be solving some kind of graph problem and may be code from a competitive programming contest. 

One of the ways to optimize this code is to minimize the use of map. The map in C++ is implemented as a balanced binary tree and takes O(logN) time for insertion and retrieval operations. If we can replace it with an unordered_map which is implemented as a hash map and takes O(1) time on average for insertion and retrieval then it could lead to an optimization in running time.

Another way to optimize this code is to minimize the use of bitwise operators. Bitwise operations are typically slower than arithmetic operations, so if we can replace the bitwise operations with arithmetic operations, it could also lead to an optimization in running time.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define U [7 << 15] = {}
using namespace std;
typedef long long L;
unordered_map<L, L> T U;
L P U, E U, Z U, H U, C U, A U, O U, X U, B U, k, n, a, b, c;
char s U;

L M(L f) { return f ? B[f] + M(f - 1) : 0; }

L S(L a, L i) {
  for (a = M(i++); i < 2e5; i++)
    B[i] += a;
}

L D(L f) {
  L d;
  Z[f] = 1;
  for (auto I = T[f].begin(); I != T[f].end(); I++)
    d = I->first, !Z[d] ? P[d] = f, E[d] = E[f] + 1, C[d] = I->second, D(d),
    Z[f] += Z[d], !H[f] || Z[H[f]] < Z[d] ? H[f] = d : 0 : 0;
}

L K(L f) {
  a = X[f];
  n = X[b];
  return a - n ? M(O[E[a] < E[n] ? a = n, n = b, b = f, n : f]) + K(P[a])
               : abs(M(O[f]) - M(O[b]));
}

int main() {
  for (cin >> n >> k; --n; T[a][b] = T[b][a] = c)
    cin >> a >> b >> c;
  for (D(a = b = 0); n < *Z; a = H[P[++n]] - n ? n : 0)
    for (; !b || a; S(a = H[a], O[a] = ++b))
      X[a] = n;
  for (cin >> a; cin >> s >> a >> b; S(H[a], O[a]), S(a, O[a] - 1))
    s[0] == '2' ? cout << K(a) << endl : A[a] += b;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the original code is very obfuscated. Therefore, it's hard to give a step by step optimization process. The main changes were the replacement of the map with an unordered_map, replacing bitwise operations with arithmetic operations and the use of auto keyword to avoid writing long type names.
