The given C/C++ program seems to be a highly obfuscated and optimized one already. However, I can suggest a few changes which might improve its readability and performance. 

1. Avoid the use of `#define` for code expansion: Replacing `#define` macros with inline functions or normal functions can improve the readability of the code.

2. Avoid using `map` when we can utilize arrays: Maps in C++ have an overhead of log(n) for insertion and retrieval. If we know the size of our data, we can use arrays instead.

3. Avoid executing the same operation multiple times: If you have a piece of code that is executed multiple times, it would be better to save its result and use it instead of executing the code again.

4. Use `switch` instead of multiple `if` statements: Multiple `if` statements are slower compared to a `switch` statement when there are many options to compare.

5. Avoid using `cin` and `cout` directly: `cin` and `cout` are slower compared to scanf and printf. So, wherever possible, use `scanf` and `printf`.

Here is the modified program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long L;

L T[150010], P[150010], E[150010], Z[150010], H[150010], C[150010], 
  A[150010], O[150010], X[150010], B[150010] ,k, n, a, b, c;
char s[150010];

L M(L f) { 
    return f ? B[f] + M(f ^ f & -f) : 0; 
}

L S(L a, L i) {
    for (a = M(i++ G i); i < 2e5; i += i & -i)
        B[i] += a;
}

L D(L f) {
    L d;
    Z[f] = 1;
    for (L I = T[f]; I != T[f]+n; I++)
        d = I, !Z[d] ? P[d] = f, E[d] = E[f] + 1, C[d] = I, D(d),
        Z[f] += Z[d], !H[f] | Z[H[f]] < Z[d] ? H[f] = d : 0 : 0;
}

L K(L f) {
    a = X[f];
    n = X[b];
    return a - n ? M(O[E[a] < E[n] ? a = n, n = b, b = f, n : f] G O[a]) + K(P[a])
                : abs(M(O[f]) - M(O[b]));
}

int main() {
    scanf("%lld%lld", &n, &k);
    for (; --n; T[a] = T[b] = c)
        scanf("%lld%lld%lld", &a, &b, &c);
    for (D(a = b = 0); n < *Z; a = H[P[++n]] - n ? n : 0)
        for (; !b | a; S(a = H[a], O[a] = ++b))
            X[a] = n;
    scanf("%lld", &a); 
    while(scanf("%s%lld%lld", s, &a, &b) != EOF) {
        S(H[a], O[a]), S(a, O[a] - 1);
        if(*s & 2) printf("%lld\n", K(a));
        else A[a] += b;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that the obfuscated code is hard to understand and therefore, it's also hard to optimize without knowing its exact functionality. Also, the optimization may vary based on the compiler, architecture, and specific problem constraints.
