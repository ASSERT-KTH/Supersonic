The provided code is a bit convoluted and quite challenging to understand. But, after a thorough analysis, I have identified a few potential optimization techniques that can be applied.

1. Use of a bitset instead of a map: The map data structure in the program, T, is used to store boolean values. This is a wasteful use of memory as each entry in a map includes extra overhead for handling the key-value pair. By replacing the map with a bitset, we can significantly reduce the memory usage.

2. Avoiding unnecessary operations: The function K seems to be performing unnecessary operations that could be optimized. The function is recursively calculating values that could be stored and reused, reducing the time complexity.

3. Proper use of macros: The code uses macros U, G, and M in a way that makes the code harder to read and understand. These macros can be replaced with inline functions, which would make the code cleaner and easier to debug.

4. Use of cin and cout: cin and cout are slower compared to scanf and printf. Therefore, replacing cin and cout with scanf and printf would speed up the I/O operations.

5. Use of global variables: The code uses a large number of global variables making it harder to understand and debug. Although this doesn't directly affect performance, it's a good practice to limit the use of global variables as much as possible.

Here is the modified version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define MAX_N 200000

typedef long long ll;

using namespace std;

bitset<MAX_N> Z;
ll P[MAX_N], E[MAX_N], H[MAX_N], C[MAX_N], A[MAX_N], O[MAX_N], X[MAX_N], B[MAX_N], k, n, a, b, c;
vector<pair<ll,ll>> T[MAX_N];
char s[MAX_N];

inline ll M(ll f) { return f ? B[f] + M(f ^ f & -f) : 0; }

void S(ll a, ll i) {
  for (a = M(i++); i < MAX_N; i += i & -i)
    B[i] += a;
}

void D(ll f) {
  ll d;
  Z[f] = 1;
  for (auto I = T[f].begin(); I != T[f].end(); I++)
    if (d = I->first, !Z[d])
      P[d] = f, E[d] = E[f] + 1, C[d] = I->second, D(d),
      Z[f] += Z[d], !H[f] | Z[H[f]] < Z[d] ? H[f] = d : 0;
}

ll K(ll f) {
  a = X[f];
  n = X[b];
  return a - n ? M(O[E[a] < E[n] ? a = n, n = b, b = f, n : f]) + K(P[a])
               : abs(M(O[f]) - M(O[b]));
}

int main() {
  scanf("%lld %lld", &n, &k);
  while (--n) {
    scanf("%lld %lld %lld", &a, &b, &c);
    T[a].push_back({b,c});
    T[b].push_back({a,c});
  }
  for (D(a = b = 0); n < Z.count(); a = H[P[++n]] - n ? n : 0)
    for (; !b | a; S(a = H[a], O[a] = ++b))
      X[a] = n;
  scanf("%lld", &a);
  while (scanf("%s %lld %lld", s, &a, &b) != EOF) {
    S(H[a], O[a]), S(a, O[a] - 1);
    if(*s & 2)
      printf("%lld\n", K(a));
    else
      A[a] += b;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that this code is quite complex and these optimizations are based on an interpretation of the code's functionality. If the code has some other hidden functionality, these optimizations may not be beneficial.
