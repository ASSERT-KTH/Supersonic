The provided C/C++ program seems to implement the partition operation of the quicksort algorithm. The partition operation places an element (called a pivot) in its correct position in a sorted array, and places all smaller (smaller than pivot) to left of the pivot and all greater elements to the right of the pivot.

Looking at the code, below are the potential optimizations:

1. The function "print_partition_ints" uses a conditional check inside a loop to determine the format string. We can avoid this by breaking the loop into two parts, one for elements before the pivot and one for elements after the pivot. This will reduce the number of conditional checks.

2. In the main function, the size of the array 'as' is determined at runtime. In C++, dynamic-sized arrays are not part of the C++ standard. Instead, use a vector for dynamic-sized arrays. 

3. The 'scanf' and 'printf' functions are slower than 'cin' and 'cout' because they have to parse the format string. However, 'cin' and 'cout' are slower than 'scanf' and 'printf' by default because they are synchronized with the C standard streams. You can make 'cin' and 'cout' faster by adding 'ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)' at the beginning of the main function.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

void print_partition_ints(const vector<int>& as, const int q, const int n) {
  for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    cout << as[i] << " ";
  }
  cout << "[" << as[q] << "] ";
  for (int i = q + 1; i < n; ++i) {
    cout << as[i] << " ";
  }
  cout << "\n";
}

int partition(vector<int>& as, const int first, const int last) {
  int less = first;
  for (int i = first; i < last; ++i) {
    if (as[i] <= as[last]) {
      swap(as[less], as[i]);
      ++less;
    }
  }
  swap(as[less], as[last]);
  return less;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> as(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> as[i];
  }
  int q = partition(as, 0, n - 1);
  print_partition_ints(as, q, n);
}
```

Now, the code is more efficient and also complies with the C++ standard.
