This program follows the quicksort algorithm to sort an array. The main function reads an integer N and then N elements of the array. It calls a function "partition" which rearranges the array such that all elements less than or equal to the last element are on the left and all elements greater are on the right. The function returns the position of the pivot element (last element). Then it calls a function to print the array.

Optimization steps:

1. Use std::vector instead of dynamic array: Dynamic arrays in C++ are not recommended because they could lead to issues such as memory leaks and buffer overflow. Use std::vector instead which automatically manages memory.

2. Use std::cin and std::cout instead of scanf and printf: C++ streams are more type-safe and flexible than C-style I/O functions.

3. Use std::endl instead of "\n": std::endl flushes the output buffer each time it's called, which can make your program run faster in some cases.

4. Remove unnecessary "uint" type alias: This doesn't improve performance, but it makes the code cleaner and easier to read.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void print_partition_ints(const std::vector<int>& as, const unsigned int q) {
  std::string out_sep = "";
  for (unsigned int i = 0; i < as.size(); ++i) {
    auto format = (i != q ? "%s%d" : "%s[%d]");
    std::cout << out_sep << (i != q ? as[i] : "[" + std::to_string(as[i]) + "]");
    out_sep = " ";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;
}

unsigned int partition(std::vector<int>& as, const unsigned int first, const unsigned int last) {
  auto less = first;
  for (auto i = first; i < last; ++i) {
    if (as[i] <= as[last]) {
      std::swap(as[less], as[i]);
      ++less;
    }
  }
  std::swap(as[less], as[last]);
  return less;
}

int main() {
  unsigned int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> as(n);
  for (unsigned int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> as[i];
  }
  auto q = partition(as, 0, n - 1);
  print_partition_ints(as, q);
}
```
Note: Please note that the performance improvement from these changes is negligible for small inputs. For large inputs, the use of std::vector can lead to faster execution time compared to dynamic arrays because it manages memory more efficiently. The other changes are mainly for code cleanliness and consistency with C++ conventions.
