The given program performs a partition operation on an array, which is a fundamental operation of the quicksort algorithm. The partition function rearranges the elements of the array so that all elements less than or equal to the pivot are on the left side and all elements greater than the pivot are on the right side.

The performance of the original program can be improved by using a few optimization techniques:

1. Use of dynamic memory allocation: Instead of declaring an array `as[n]` in the stack, we can allocate it in the heap using dynamic memory allocation. This will reduce the risk of stack overflow for large `n` and will also allow to free up memory when it's no longer needed, reducing memory usage.

2. Avoiding unnecessary string comparison: The `print_partition_ints` function performs a string comparison in every loop iteration to decide whether to include brackets around the current number. This can be avoided by splitting the loop into two, one for the numbers before `q` and one for the numbers after `q`.

Below is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
using uint = unsigned int;
static void print_partition_ints(const int as[], const uint q, const uint n) {
  for (uint i = 0; i < q; ++i)
    std::printf("%d ", as[i]);

  std::printf("[%d] ", as[q]);

  for (uint i = q+1; i < n; ++i)
    std::printf("%d ", as[i]);

  std::printf("\n");
}
static uint partition(int as[], const uint first, const uint last) {
  auto less = first;
  for (auto i = first; i < last; ++i) {
    if (as[i] <= as[last]) {
      std::swap(as[less], as[i]);
      ++less;
    }
  }
  std::swap(as[less], as[last]);
  return less;
}
int main() {
  uint n;
  std::scanf("%u", &n);
  int* as = new int[n];
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    std::scanf("%d", &as[i]);
  }
  auto q = partition(as, 0, n - 1);
  print_partition_ints(as, q, n);
  delete[] as;
}
```

The optimized program now uses dynamic memory allocation for array `as` and has improved the efficiency of the `print_partition_ints` function by avoiding unnecessary string comparisons.
