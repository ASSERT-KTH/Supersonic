The given program is a simple loop, where it calculates the multiplication table for numbers from 1 to 9. In this case, there are not many optimizations that can be done since the algorithm is straightforward and does not have any complex operations or unnecessary memory usage.

However, one possible optimization is to use pre-increment (++i / ++j) instead of post-increment (i++ / j++). Pre-incrementing is a tiny bit faster than post-incrementing in C/C++ because post-incrementing involves a copy operation. It's worth noting that this kind of micro-optimization will not make a significant difference in the program performance, but it's a good practice in performance-critical codes.

Another possible optimization is to write constants for loop bounds instead of variables, which allows the compiler to optimize the code better.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 10; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j < 10; ++j) {
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Again, it's important to note that these optimizations are micro-optimizations and would not significantly improve the performance of the given program. The original code is already quite efficient.
