The given C program is already quite optimized in terms of memory usage. However, one small optimization for running time can be done. 

The multiplication operation inside the printf statement can be moved to a separate line to avoid repeated calculations inside printf. This will reduce the number of multiplications performed.

Optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      int result = i*j;
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, result);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimization might not have a noticeable effect in this particular program due to the small numbers involved. However, in a more complex program with larger numbers and more complex calculations, such an optimization can save significant amount of computation time.
