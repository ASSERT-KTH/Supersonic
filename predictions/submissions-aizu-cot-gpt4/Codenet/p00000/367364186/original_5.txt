This program is a simple multiplication table generator. It uses two nested for-loops to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 9 and print the product of each pair. 

There isn't much scope for optimization in terms of run-time performance in this simple program, as the complexity is already O(n^2), which is the best we can achieve given that we have to process every pair of numbers. 

However, there's a small optimization that we can make in terms of memory usage. In the current program, we are multiplying `i` and `j` in each iteration of the inner loop and then passing the product to the `printf` function. Instead, we could calculate the product once, store it in a variable, and then pass that variable to `printf`. This would save us a multiplication operation in each iteration of the inner loop.

This may not result in a significant improvement in this particular case as the range of numbers is very small. However, it's a good practice to follow in general, as it can lead to noticeable improvements in larger programs.

Here's the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      int product = i * j;
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, product);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Let me know if you have any questions or other code that needs optimization.
