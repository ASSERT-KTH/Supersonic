The given C/C++ program already has good performance because it only contains two nested loops with 10 iterations each, making it a linear time complexity O(n) algorithm. The memory usage is also minimal because it only stores two integer variables and a string format for the printf() function.

However, there are a few minor optimizations that we can do to make the program a little bit faster.

1. Use putchar() instead of printf() when possible. The printf() function has a larger overhead because it needs to parse the format string. In this case, we can use putchar() to print the newline character instead of using "\n" in printf().

2. Precompute i*j. Instead of calculating i*j twice, we can calculate it once and store it in a variable.

Here is the optimized code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      int product = i * j;
      printf("%dx%d=", i, j);
      printf("%d", product);
      putchar('\n');
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Remember, these optimizations are very minor and might not make a noticeable difference in a simple program like this. The performance gain might be more noticeable in a larger program or in a program that is called frequently.
