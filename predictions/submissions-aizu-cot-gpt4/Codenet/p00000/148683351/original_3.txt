This program is quite efficient already but there are a few small optimizations that can be applied:

1. Output: The output to the console (standard output) is a relatively slow operation. We can reduce the number of output operations by merging the separate output statements into a single one, using string concatenation. This will slightly increase the speed of the program.

2. Constants: `1` and `9` are constants in the loop. If these values need to be changed often, it would be better to define them as constants at the beginning of the program. This will make the code cleaner and more maintainable.

3. We can use `'\n'` instead of `endl` for line breaks. `endl` causes the output buffer to be flushed, which can slow down the program if used repeatedly. `'\n'` doesn't flush the buffer, making it faster.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int START = 1;
const int END = 9;

int main() {
  for (int i = START; i <= END; i++) {
    for (int j = START; j <= END; j++) {
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program does the same thing as the original, but it is slightly more efficient and more maintainable.
