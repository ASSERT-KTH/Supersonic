Optimization Tips:
1. We can use `'\n'` instead of `endl` to print a new line. `endl` not only inserts a new line, but it also flushes the stream, which can cause unnecessary overhead especially inside loops. So, using `'\n'` can improve the speed of output in this case.
2. We can reduce the number of times `cout` is used in the loop. Each `cout` is a system call and it takes time. We can concatenate strings and make a single call to `cout` in each iteration of the inner loop.

After applying these optimizations, the code becomes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This code will run faster due to fewer `cout` calls and using `'\n'` instead of `endl` for new lines. However, the memory usage of these two programs will be the same. The original program already has an efficient memory usage because it doesn't use any extra space that grows with the input size. The variables used (i and j) are only single integers, which take constant space.
