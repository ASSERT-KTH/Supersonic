The optimization in this program can be done in two ways:

1. **Optimizing the running time**: The running time can be optimized by reducing the number of times the output stream (`cout`) is called. Each call to `cout` can be relatively slow, so minimizing the number of calls can improve performance.

2. **Optimizing the memory usage**: Memory usage can be optimized by limiting the scope of the variables. In this case, the variables `i` and `j` are only used within the for loops, so they can be declared in the for loop itself, which will free up memory once the loop is done.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; ++j) {
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of optimization:**

1. The `endl` manipulator in `cout` is replaced with '\n'. This is because `endl` not only adds a newline character but also flushes the output stream buffer which is not necessary every time and can slow the program. Using '\n' only adds a newline character, which is faster.

2. The '++i' and '++j' are used instead of 'i++' and 'j++'. This is a minor optimization. The '++i' (pre-increment) is generally more efficient than 'i++' (post-increment), because post-increment needs to make a copy of 'i' before it increments, while pre-increment doesn't need to make a copy.
   
3. Variables `i` and `j` are declared within the for loop, limiting their scope to the loop only. Once the loop is done, the memory for these variables is freed up. This can be a minor optimization in terms of memory usage, but it's a good practice to restrict the scope of variables to where they are needed.
