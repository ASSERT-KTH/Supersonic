The given code generates the multiplication table from 1 to 9. It's a simple and efficient code. However, there are few things that we can optimize:

1. Avoid using 'endl': 'endl' not only adds a newline character, but it also flushes the output buffer every time it is called which is not necessary in this case.

2. Use '\n' instead of 'endl': '\n' only adds a newline character without flushing the output buffer, hence it is generally faster than 'endl'.

3. Use faster I/O methods: The standard C++ cin and cout are slower compared to the printf and scanf in C. In this case, we can use printf instead of cout for faster I/O.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      printf("%d x %d = %d\n", i, j, i*j);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
However, keep in mind that the speedup from these optimizations may not be noticeable for such a small program. These optimizations become significant in larger programs where I/O operations are performed many times.
