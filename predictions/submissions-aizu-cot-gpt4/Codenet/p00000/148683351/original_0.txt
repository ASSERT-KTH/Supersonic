This program is essentially generating a multiplication table for the numbers 1 to 9. The program is straightforward and already quite optimized for its task. But there are a few small improvements that can be made:

1. `std::endl` not only inserts a new line, but also flushes the output buffer. This can slow down the console output. You can replace `std::endl` with '\n' to improve the performance. 
2. Use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl` to avoid unnecessary flush of the output buffer. It will make the program faster if the output is large.
3. Pre-calculate `i*j` in a variable to avoid calculating it twice. This will improve performance if the calculation is complex or time-consuming (in this case it's not, but it's a good practice in general).

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      int product = i * j;
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << product << '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
