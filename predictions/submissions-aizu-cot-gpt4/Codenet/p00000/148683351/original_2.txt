The given program is a C++ program that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. The program is pretty optimized already, but we can still make a few minor adjustments to further optimize it.

Changes that can be performed:

1. I/O operations in C++ are usually slow, especially when done inside nested loops like in this program. To decrease the running time, the output can be buffered in a string and then printed at once, instead of printing inside the loop.

2. The multiplication operation can be replaced with addition operation for speed improvement. The multiplication operation cost is relatively higher than addition. So, instead of multiplying i and j each time, we can add i to a sum variable that starts from 0 for each round of inner loop.

After applying these changes, the optimized program would look like this:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string> //include the string library to use string datatype
using namespace std;
int main() {
  string output = ""; //initialize an empty string to buffer the output
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    int sum = 0; //initialize sum at the start of each round of the outer loop
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      sum += i; //replace multiplication with addition
      output += to_string(i) + "x" + to_string(j) + "=" + to_string(sum) + "\n"; //buffer the output in the string
    }
  }
  cout << output; //print the output at once
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program should run a bit faster and use a bit less memory than the original one.
