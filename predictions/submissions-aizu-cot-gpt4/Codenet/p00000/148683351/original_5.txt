The given C++ program is a simple one: It prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. There's not much scope for optimization in terms of algorithmic complexity since it's a simple nested loop with constant bounds. However, there is an opportunity to improve the I/O performance by reducing the number of calls to `cout`. For a console application, I/O is often a significant bottleneck.

Here are the optimization steps:
1. Instead of making three calls to `cout` in each iteration of the inner loop, we can concatenate the string and make a single call in each iteration. This reduces the number of I/O operations, hence potentially speeding up the program.
2. We can use `'\n'` character for new line, instead of `endl`. `endl` actually flushes the output buffer every time it's used, which can lead to slower execution. Using `'\n'` gives a new line without flushing the buffer.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program should run slightly faster, especially on systems with slow I/O. However, since the given program is already very simple, the performance improvement might not be noticeable.
