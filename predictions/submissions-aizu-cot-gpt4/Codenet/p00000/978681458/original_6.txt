The given C program is printing the multiplication table for numbers between 1 and 9. It's pretty efficient as it is, but there are small tweaks that can be applied to slightly improve its performance:

1. Use "puts" instead of "printf": The printf function is slower because it has to parse the format string. If we create the string before and use puts, it may provide a slight performance increase. However, this will consume a bit more memory as we need to store the string.

2. Remove redundant brackets in return statement: This is a very minor thing, but it's not necessary to have brackets around 0 in the return statement. Removing them won't have any effect on performance, but it makes the code a bit cleaner.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
  int i, j;
  char str[30];
  for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      sprintf(str, "%dx%d=%d", i, j, i * j);
      puts(str);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note, the optimization in this case is very minor and only for educational purposes. The original code is already efficient for such a simple task. For larger and more complex tasks, other optimization strategies might be more beneficial.
