This simple program core functionality cannot be optimized much because it is already quite straightforward. It loops through and prints the multiplication table for numbers 1 through 9.

However, there are few things we can do to improve the code style and potentially make small performance improvements:

1. Avoid repeatedly calling printf inside the loop. Instead, prepare the string to be printed in the loop, and print it once after the loop. This could potentially reduce the overhead of calling printf function multiple times, especially when the loop is large.

2. Declare variables in the smallest possible scope. This can potentially save some stack memory, especially in larger applications with deep call stacks.

Here is an optimized version of your code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  char output[361] = ""; // 361 is the total number of characters in the final output string
  for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      char temp[10];  // Temporary string to hold the result of one multiplication
      sprintf(temp, "%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
      strcat(output, temp);  // Append the result to the output string
    }
  }
  printf("%s", output);  // Print the output string once
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations are relatively minor and unlikely to have a noticeable impact on this particular program's performance. They are more applicable to larger programs where many function calls and variable declarations are being made.
