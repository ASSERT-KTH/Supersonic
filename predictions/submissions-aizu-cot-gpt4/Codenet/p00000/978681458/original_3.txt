This is a simple C program that prints out a multiplication table from 1 to 9. It's already quite optimized, but if we really want to push it, we can make a few small changes.

1. Reducing function call overhead: The printf function is called in each iteration of the inner loop. This is a costly operation because printf is a function in the C library, and calling it involves a function call overhead. We can reduce the number of printf calls by concatenating multiple multiplication results into a single string, and then output it once for each line.

2. Improve cache usage: The order of the multiplication does not affect the result (i.e., i*j == j*i). We can leverage this property to reduce the number of unique multiplications. By ensuring that i is always less than or equal to j, we can reuse the results from previous calculations, which may still be in the CPU's cache. This is a micro-optimization that may or may not result in noticeable performance improvements, depending on the specific CPU architecture.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int i, j;
  char line[50];
  for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    int pos = 0;
    for (j = i; j < 10; j++) {
      pos += sprintf(line + pos, "%dx%d=%d, ", i, j, i * j);
    }
    line[pos - 2] = '\n';  // replace the last comma with a newline
    printf("%s", line);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations are quite minor and will not result in significant performance improvements for this specific program. They are more useful as general techniques that can be applied in more complex programs.
