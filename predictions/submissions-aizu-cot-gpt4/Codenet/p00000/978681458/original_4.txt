This program is a simple multiplication table generator and does not contain much room for optimization as it operates in linear time complexity (O(n)) and constant space complexity (O(1)). However, there are a few minor changes we could make:

1. Use `puts()` instead of `printf()`: `puts()` function is faster than `printf()` for just printing a string. However, in this case, we need to format the output, so we will stick to `printf()`.

2. Use register storage class for loop variables: `register` storage class in C/C++ is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that a variable can be stored in a register for faster access than if it was stored in memory.

3. Reduce the scope of the variables `i` and `j` to inside the `for` loops: This is a good practice but will not have a significant impact on performance for this particular program.

The optimized program would look like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  for (register int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (register int j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
  }
  return (0);
}
```

Keep in mind that modern compilers are smart enough to automatically apply these optimizations where applicable. It's always a good idea to profile your program first and identify bottlenecks before beginning the optimization process.
