The given program prints the multiplication table for numbers from 1 to 9. The program is already quite simple and efficient, but there are still a few potential optimizations that can be made:

1. **Minimize calculations within the printf statement**: Right now, the multiplication `i*j` is being calculated inside the printf statement. We can calculate it beforehand and store it in a variable to avoid doing arithmetic within the printf statement.

2. **Use putchar instead of printf for fixed characters**: The 'x', '=' and '\n' characters are being printed using printf, which is an expensive operation. We can replace these with putchar, which is faster.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int i, j, product;
  for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      product = i * j;
      printf("%d", i);
      putchar('x');
      printf("%d", j);
      putchar('=');
      printf("%d", product);
      putchar('\n');
    }
  }
  return (0);
}
```

Note: The actual performance improvement from these optimizations may not be significant because the original program is already quite efficient. The optimizations are more about good programming practices than about noticeable performance improvements.
