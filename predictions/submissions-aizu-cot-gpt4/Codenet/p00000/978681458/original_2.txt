The given C program is already efficient in terms of its logic, as it's a simple nested loop for printing multiplication tables. However, there are a few minor optimizations we can apply to improve it further.

1. Declare the variables `i` and `j` inside the `for` loop. This makes the variables scope limited to the loop only and is considered a good practice.

2. Instead of calling the multiplication operation inside the `printf` statement, we can calculate the multiplication result beforehand and store it in a variable. This way, we reduce the number of operations inside `printf`, which might slightly enhance the performance.

3. As the upper limit of each loop is constant (10), we can declare them as `constexpr`. It would allow the compiler to understand that these values are constant throughout the program, which may lead to better optimization at compile time.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  constexpr int limit = 10;
  for (int i = 1; i < limit; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j < limit; j++) {
      int multiplication = i * j;
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, multiplication);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Remember that the optimization here is minimal and won't significantly impact the performance of the program due to the simple logic of the initial code.
