This is a simple multiplication table generation program. It is difficult to optimize it because it is already quite simple and efficient. However, there is one small change we could make to slightly reduce the number of multiplications.

Currently, the program calculates the product of `i` and `j` directly in the `printf` function. We can store the result in a variable before printing it out. This way, if the compiler isn't optimizing this calculation already, we can ensure that the multiplication is only performed once.

Optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int i, j, product;
  for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      product = i * j;
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, product);
    }
  }
  return (0);
}
```

This change might not make a noticeable difference in this case, but it's a good practice for more complex calculations.
