First, let's explain the current code. This code reads a list of strings, and calculates a result based on operators '+' and '*'. The operator is determined by the first character of a string, and the rest of the string contains the operands, which are processed recursively. The '+' operator sums up all operands, while the '*' operator multiplies them. 

Optimizations:

1. Removal of #include <bits/stdc++.h>: This is not a standard header file and it includes a lot of unnecessary files which increases compilation time. We will include only the necessary header files.

2. Avoid using namespace std: It's generally good practice to avoid "using namespace std". This can lead to name clashes in larger programs.

3. Avoid using macros: Macros should be avoided when it's possible to use a function instead. They can lead to harder to debug code.

4. Reduce the use of vector: Since we only need to store the results temporarily, we don't need to use a vector to store them. We can calculate the result directly in the while loop.

5. Avoid unnecessary checks: Checking (int)s[y].size() > x in the while loop is not needed, as the function "solve" will return when it has processed the whole string.

6. Use cin.tie(0) and ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0): This will stop C++ from syncing with the C standard streams and give a performance boost.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <functional>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;
using std::string;
using std::accumulate;
using std::multiplies;

int solve(vector<string> &s, int n, int &y, int x) {
  if (std::isdigit(s[y][x]))
    return s[y++][x] - '0';
  char op = s[y][x];
  ++y, ++x;
  int result = (op == '+') ? 0 : 1;
  while (y < n) {
    int term = solve(s, n, y, x);
    if (op == '+')
      result += term;
    else
      result *= term;
  }
  return result;
}

int main(void) {
  cin.tie(0);
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    vector<string> s(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      cin >> s[i];
    int y = 0;
    cout << solve(s, n, y, 0) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
