The given code is already quite efficient, but there are some places where we can make slight modifications to optimize it. 

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which increase the compilation time. We can replace it with the specific headers we need.

2. The `all(a)` macro is used only twice. Instead of defining it as a macro, we can directly use the function calls. This will make the code more readable.

3. In the `solve` function, the `term` vector is used to temporarily store results and then sum or multiply them together. We can directly accumulate the results, which can save memory.

4. The use of `isdigit()` function is a bit costly in terms of time. We can replace it with a direct comparison since we know ASCII values of digits.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int solve(vector<string> &s, int n, int &y, int x) {
  if (s[y][x] >= '0' && s[y][x] <= '9')
    return s[y++][x] - '0';
  char op = s[y][x];
  ++y, ++x;
  int sum = 0, product = 1;
  while (y < n && (int)s[y].size() > x) {
    int temp = solve(s, n, y, x);
    sum += temp;
    product *= temp;
  }
  if (op == '+')
    return sum;
  else
    return product;
}

int main(void) {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    vector<string> s(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) cin >> s[i];
    int y = 0;
    cout << solve(s, n, y, 0) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, we have eliminated the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, replaced the `all(a)` macro with direct function calls, and replaced the `term` vector with direct accumulation of the results. We also replaced `isdigit()` function with a direct comparison. The code should now run faster and use less memory.
