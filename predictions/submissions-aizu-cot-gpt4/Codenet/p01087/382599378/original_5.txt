Optimization Steps:

1. The first optimization we can do is to replace the vector of integers `term` with two integers: `sum` and `prod`. Instead of storing each term in the vector, we can directly add to `sum` if the operation is addition '+' and multiply with `prod` if the operation is multiplication '*'. This will reduce the space complexity from O(n) to O(1).

2. The second optimization is to avoid the usage of `std::multiplies<int>()` as a custom binary operation for `std::accumulate`. Instead, we can directly multiply the result with `prod` in the multiplication '*' case.

3. Instead of using `all(a)`, which expands to `a.begin(), a.end()`, we can directly use `sum` and `prod` for their respective cases. This reduces a function call overhead and improves the readability of the code.

4. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl` to prevent unnecessary flushing of the output buffer.

5. Avoid the usage of `#define` preprocessor directive for rep(i, n). Instead, use the standard for loop.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int solve(vector<string> &s, int n, int &y, int x) {
  if (isdigit(s[y][x]))
    return s[y++][x] - '0';
  char op = s[y][x];
  ++y, ++x;
  int sum = 0, prod = 1;
  while (y < n && (int)s[y].size() > x) {
    int result = solve(s, n, y, x);
    if (op == '+')
        sum += result;
    else
        prod *= result;
  }
  return op == '+' ? sum : prod;
}

int main(void) {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    vector<string> s(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) cin >> s[i];
    int y = 0;
    cout << solve(s, n, y, 0) << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code should have lower memory usage due to not using a vector to store terms, and should also have faster running time due to direct operations on sum and prod instead of using the accumulate function.
