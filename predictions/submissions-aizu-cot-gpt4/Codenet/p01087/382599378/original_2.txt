This C++ program executes a recursive operation on a vector of strings. It seems there are no glaring optimization issues, but there are some small adjustments you can make to potentially improve the program.

1. Remove the `#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < int(n); ++i)` macro. This macro is used just once in the whole program and it's not making the code more readable or performant. It's better to directly write the for loop in the `main` function.

2. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file is quite large and includes much more than you actually need, which can slow down the compile time. It's better to include only the specific libraries you need.

3. The `all(a)` macro is used to get the range of the vector `term`. This macro can be replaced by directly using `term.begin(), term.end()` in the `accumulate` function.

4. The program uses `vector<int> term` to collect results of the recursive `solve` function. Instead of using a vector to store the results and then using `std::accumulate` to compute the sum or product of the elements, you can directly accumulate the results to a single integer in the loop.

5. The `solve` function takes `s` and `n` as parameters. But since `s` is not modified inside the function and `n` is the size of `s`, they can be replaced by a const reference to `s`.

Here is the optimized code after applying these modifications:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <functional>
#include <cctype>

using namespace std;

int solve(const vector<string> &s, int &y, int x) {
  if (isdigit(s[y][x]))
    return s[y++][x] - '0';
  char op = s[y][x];
  ++y, ++x;
  int result = (op == '+') ? 0 : 1;
  while (y < s.size() && (int)s[y].size() > x) {
    int val = solve(s, y, x);
    if(op == '+')
        result += val;
    else
        result *= val;
  }
  return result;
}

int main(void) {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    vector<string> s(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) cin >> s[i];
    int y = 0;
    cout << solve(s, y, 0) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note that despite these optimizations, the efficiency of the program heavily relies on the design of the algorithm and the `solve` function, which are unchanged. The recursive nature of the `solve` function and the use of string manipulation could potentially be a source of inefficiency. If the program is still not fast enough or uses too much memory, it may be necessary to rethink the algorithm.
