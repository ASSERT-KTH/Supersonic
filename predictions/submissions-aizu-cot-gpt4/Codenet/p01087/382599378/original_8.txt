Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which can increase compile time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std`: This can lead to naming conflicts as it includes all the names from the std namespace. Use the std:: prefix before each standard library object.

3. Avoid using macros for simple loops: It might make the code shorter, but it also makes it less readable and harder to debug. It's better to write the loop explicitly.

4. Avoid using vectors when a simple sum or product is required: In the function `solve()`, instead of pushing elements into the vector `term` and then applying `std::accumulate()`, we can keep a running sum or product.

5. Avoid unnecessary typecasting: In the while loop in `solve()`, there is no need to typecast `s[y].size()` to `int`, as `size()` returns `size_t` which can be compared with an integer.

6. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(NULL)`: These two lines turn off some of the C++ stdio synchronizations, which can speed up the cin and cout operations.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <functional>

int solve(std::vector<std::string> &s, int n, int &y, int x) {
    if (isdigit(s[y][x]))
        return s[y++][x] - '0';
    
    char op = s[y][x];
    ++y, ++x;
    int result = (op == '+') ? 0 : 1;
    
    while (y < n && s[y].size() > x) {
        int term = solve(s, n, y, x);
        if (op == '+')
            result += term;
        else
            result *= term;
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main(void) {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);
    
    int n;
    while (std::cin >> n, n) {
        std::vector<std::string> s(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            std::cin >> s[i];
        int y = 0;
        std::cout << solve(s, n, y, 0) << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
