This program is already quite optimized, but there are a few potential improvements that could be made:

1. Preallocate memory for the `term` vector. This can help with performance if the number of terms is large, as it avoids multiple reallocations as the vector grows. A reasonable initial size could be the length of the string, assuming that the expression is not too deeply nested.

2. Use `reserve` function to allocate memory in advance for vector `term`. This will reduce the time of memory allocation in the vector.

3. Avoid using `std::accumulate` with `std::multiplies`. Instead, write a for-loop which multiplies the elements of `term` together. `std::accumulate` with `std::multiplies` is a bit slower because it requires a function call for each element in the vector, whereas a simple for-loop can be optimized more effectively by the compiler.

4. Instead of using `std::isdigit`, which is locale-dependent and can potentially have performance overhead, we can directly compare the character with '0' and '9'. This is safe because the input only contains ASCII characters.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < int(n); ++i)
#define all(a) a.begin(), a.end()
int solve(vector<string> &s, int n, int &y, int x) {
  if (s[y][x] >= '0' && s[y][x] <= '9')
    return s[y++][x] - '0';
  char op = s[y][x];
  ++y, ++x;
  vector<int> term;
  term.reserve(s[y].size());
  while (y < n && (int)s[y].size() > x) {
    term.push_back(solve(s, n, y, x));
  }
  if (op == '+')
    return accumulate(all(term), 0);
  else {
    int product = 1;
    for (int num : term)
      product *= num;
    return product;
  }
}
int main(void) {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    vector<string> s(n);
    rep(i, n) cin >> s[i];
    int y = 0;
    cout << solve(s, n, y, 0) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized program is expected to run faster due to the reduction of vector reallocations and function calls inside the `std::accumulate` function. Also, it will use less memory because we only allocate as much memory as needed for the `term` vector. The direct comparison with '0' and '9' can also be faster than `std::isdigit`.
