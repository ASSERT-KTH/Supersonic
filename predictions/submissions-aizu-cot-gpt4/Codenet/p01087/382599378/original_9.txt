The program provided is an interpreter for a simple domain-specific language, which is represented in the string vector `s`. The language consists of digits and operators '+', '*'. The parsing of the language and execution is done in the `solve` function. 

The main optimization opportunities in this program are:

1. Avoiding unnecessary heap allocations: Here, the `vector<int> term` is created inside the `solve` function which is recursively called. Each call to `solve` hence creates a new vector, which involves heap allocation and deallocation. This can be expensive in terms of time and space. As an optimization, we can change this to a static array with a large enough size.

2. Avoiding unnecessary function calls: The `accumulate` function is called twice, once for each operator. Instead of calling `accumulate` function twice, we can calculate the result in the same loop where the vector is filled. This will save unnecessary function calls.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < int(n); ++i)

int solve(const string* s, int n, int &y, int x) {
  if (isdigit(s[y][x]))
    return s[y++][x] - '0';
  char op = s[y][x];
  ++y, ++x;
  int result = (op == '+') ? 0 : 1;
  while (y < n && (int)s[y].size() > x) {
    int val = solve(s, n, y, x);
    if (op == '+')
        result += val;
    else
        result *= val;
  }
  return result;
}

int main(void) {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    string s[n];
    rep(i, n) cin >> s[i];
    int y = 0;
    cout << solve(s, n, y, 0) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that using Variable Length Array (array `s` with length `n` in the `main` function) is a feature of GNU C++ and not part of the C++ standard, so it might not be portable across different compilers. You can replace it with `std::vector<std::string> s(n);` for broader compiler support.
