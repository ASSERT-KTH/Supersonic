The given C++ program is quite optimized already. However, there are a few minor changes that could potentially improve the performance, including:

1. The use of `memset` function. This function is used to fill a block of memory with a particular value, but it's not type-safe. It treats the block of memory as an array of bytes and sets each byte to a given value, which can cause problems with non-byte types (like `long long`). In this case, it's used to initialize an array of `long long` with value `-1`. If `long long` is not a single byte on the system where the code is run, this could lead to incorrect results. It's better to use a loop for initialization.

2. The use of `std::vector::size` function in a loop condition. This function is called at each iteration of the loop, which can be inefficient. It's better to call this function once, store the result in a variable and use this variable in the loop condition.

3. The use of `std::vector::push_back` function. This function can cause reallocation and copying of the vector's elements, which can be inefficient. If the maximum size of the vector is known in advance, it's better to reserve that amount of space with `std::vector::reserve` function before adding elements to the vector.

Here is the improved version of the code:

#define foreach(it, X) for (auto it = (X).begin(); it != (X).end(); it++)
#define ite iterator
#define mp make_pair
#define mt make_tuple
#define rep(i, n) rep2(i, 0, n)
#define rep2(i, m, n) for (int i = m; i < (n); i++)
#define pb push_back
#define sec second
#define sz(x) ((int)(x).size())
