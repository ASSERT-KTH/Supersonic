This program is difficult to optimize because it is already quite optimized. However, there are a few small changes that could potentially improve its performance:

1. Input optimization: The std::cin is usually slower than scanf. To improve the speed of the program, we could use scanf instead of std::cin.

2. Avoiding the division operation: Division operation is slower than multiplication and subtraction. We can use bitwise shift operators to perform division by 2.

3. Avoiding the modulus operation: Modulus operation can be optimized by using bitwise AND operator.

4. Repeated calculation: In the loop, the program calculates dp[i][j] % 2 twice which can be optimized by calculating it once and storing the result in a variable.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
int mp[1001][1001], dp[1001][1001];
int h, w, n;
void saiki(int x, int y) {
  int dx[] = {0, 1}, dy[] = {1, 0};
  if (y == h || x == w)
    printf("%d %d\n", y + 1, x + 1);
  else
    saiki(x + dx[mp[y][x]], y + dy[mp[y][x]]);
}
int main() {
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %d %d", &h, &w, &n);
    if (!h && !w && !n)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++)
        scanf("%d", &mp[i][j]);
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    dp[0][0] = n - 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        int dp_mod_2 = dp[i][j] & 1;
        dp[i][j + 1] += (dp[i][j] >> 1) + mp[i][j] * dp_mod_2;
        dp[i + 1][j] += (dp[i][j] >> 1) + !mp[i][j] * dp_mod_2;
        if (dp_mod_2)
          mp[i][j] = !mp[i][j];
      }
    saiki(0, 0);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note, these optimizations may not make a noticeable difference in the running time of the program because the original program is already quite optimized. However, these are general optimization techniques that can be applied to C/C++ programs.
