The given code is a C++ program that uses dynamic programming and recursion to solve a problem. As an experienced C/C++ developer, I can suggest a few ways to optimize this code for running time and memory usage:

1. **Avoid using `<bits/stdc++.h>`**: Although it's very convenient, `<bits/stdc++.h>` is actually not a standard header file and it includes a lot of unnecessary things which increase the compile time of the program. We can replace it with the specific header files we need.

2. **Avoid using `using namespace std;`**: It's a bad practice because it can lead to name collisions. It's better to use `std::` before every standard library object.

3. **Avoid using `memset` for non-byte values**: The `memset` function is used to fill a block of memory with a particular value. It works fine for arrays of `char` and `unsigned char`, but it can cause problems for other types of arrays, like `int`. Instead, we can initialize `dp` array with loop in the code.

4. **Avoid using global variables**: Global variables can make the code harder to understand and debug, and they can also lead to unexpected side effects. We can replace the global variables `mp`, `dp`, `h`, `w`, `n` with local ones.

5. **Avoid using recursive function calls when it's not necessary**: Recursive function calls can cause a significant overhead, especially when the recursion depth is large. We can replace the recursive function `saiki` with a while loop.

Here is the optimized version of the program that implements these suggestions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    while (1) {
        int h, w, n;
        std::cin >> h >> w >> n;
        if (!h && !w && !n)
            break;
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> mp(h, std::vector<int>(w));
        for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < w; j++)
                std::cin >> mp[i][j];
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(h, std::vector<int>(w, 0));
        dp[0][0] = n - 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
                dp[i][j + 1] += dp[i][j] / 2 + mp[i][j] * dp[i][j] % 2;
                dp[i + 1][j] += dp[i][j] / 2 + !mp[i][j] * dp[i][j] % 2;
                if (dp[i][j] % 2)
                    mp[i][j] = !mp[i][j];
            }
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        while(y != h && x != w) {
            int dx[] = {0, 1}, dy[] = {1, 0};
            x += dx[mp[y][x]];
            y += dy[mp[y][x]];
        }
        std::cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimization is contextual which means it depends on the specific context and constraints of the problem. The above optimizations are general ones that are applicable for most of the cases.
