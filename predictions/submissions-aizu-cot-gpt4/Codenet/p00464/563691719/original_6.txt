This program can be optimized by reducing the amount of recursion and avoiding unnecessary computation.

1. In the `saiki` function, the program is recursively calling `saiki` without any condition to stop the recursion, which can lead to stack overflow if `x` and `y` do not meet the condition `y == h || x == w`. We can replace the recursion with a while loop to avoid stack overflow.

2. The `memset` function is used to set the `dp` array to 0, which is not necessary if we initialize the array with 0 while declaring it.

3. The statement `mp[i][j] = !mp[i][j];` is flipping the value of `mp[i][j]` which is not necessary as it is only used in the `saiki` function. We can directly use `!mp[y][x]` in the recursive function instead of changing the value in the array.

Here is the optimized program,

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int mp[1001][1001], dp[1001][1001] = {0};
int h, w, n;

void saiki(int x, int y) {
  int dx[] = {0, 1}, dy[] = {1, 0};
  while (x < w && y < h) {
    int dir = mp[y][x];
    x += dx[dir];
    y += dy[dir];
  }
  cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << endl;
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    cin >> h >> w >> n;
    if (!h && !w && !n)
      break;

    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++)
        cin >> mp[i][j];

    dp[0][0] = n - 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        dp[i][j + 1] += dp[i][j] / 2 + mp[i][j] * dp[i][j] % 2;
        dp[i + 1][j] += dp[i][j] / 2 + !mp[i][j] * dp[i][j] % 2;
      }
    saiki(0, 0);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
