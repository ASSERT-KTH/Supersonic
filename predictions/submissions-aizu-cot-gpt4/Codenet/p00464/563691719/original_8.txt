The given program seems to be a solution to some kind of game or puzzle problem. The first step to optimize such a program is to identify the parts of the code that are either redundant or inefficient in terms of time and space complexity.

Here are some points for optimization:
1. The "saiki" function uses recursion to trace some path on the "mp" matrix. This could be replaced by a loop to avoid the overhead of recursive function calls. 

2. The "saiki" function also prints the coordinates (x, y) as soon as it reaches the boundary. This could be optimized by storing the boundary coordinates in variables and printing them only once, after the loop ends. 

3. The "memset" function is used to initialize the "dp" matrix with zeros. This is unnecessary because the "dp" matrix is filled with actual values later in the code. So, this line could be removed.

4. The assignments of "dp[i][j + 1]" and "dp[i + 1][j]" inside the nested loop could be optimized. The modulo operation "%" is expensive in terms of time complexity, so it's better to calculate "dp[i][j] / 2" and "dp[i][j] % 2" only once and store the results in temporary variables.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int mp[1001][1001], dp[1001][1001];
int h, w, n;

void saiki(int x, int y) {
  int dx[] = {0, 1}, dy[] = {1, 0};
  while (x != w && y != h) {
    int direction = mp[y][x];
    x += dx[direction];
    y += dy[direction];
  }
  cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << endl;
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    cin >> h >> w >> n;
    if (!h && !w && !n)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++)
        cin >> mp[i][j];
    dp[0][0] = n - 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        int half = dp[i][j] / 2;
        int remainder = dp[i][j] % 2;
        dp[i][j + 1] += half + mp[i][j] * remainder;
        dp[i + 1][j] += half + !mp[i][j] * remainder;
        if (remainder)
          mp[i][j] = !mp[i][j];
      }
    }
    saiki(0, 0);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program should perform better in terms of running time and memory usage. It avoids unnecessary function calls and computations, and it also removes a redundant operation.
