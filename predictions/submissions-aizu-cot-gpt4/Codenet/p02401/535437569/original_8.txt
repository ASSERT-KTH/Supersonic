The given program is a basic calculator that reads two integers and an operator from the standard input and writes the result to the standard output. If the operator is '?', it exits the program.

Here are the optimizations proposed:

1. We can replace the series of if-else statements with a switch-case construct. Switch-case is generally faster than if-else in C/C++ because it uses a jump table or a hash list. This results in faster execution as it simply looks up the address of the code to be executed.

2. The program includes the cstdio library, but it doesn't use any of its functionality, so we can remove it to save memory.

3. It's more efficient to use std::cin and std::cout for input and output operations than scanf() and printf() in C++. So, we can replace scanf() and printf() with std::cin and std::cout respectively. 

4. As we are dividing two integers, we need to make sure that we are not dividing by zero, which is undefined in mathematics. So, we need to include a check to avoid dividing by zero.

5. We are using an infinite loop, which is not a good practice. It would be better to use a loop whose termination condition is when the operator is '?'.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x, y;
    char z;

    while (std::cin >> x >> z >> y && z != '?') {
        switch(z) {
            case '+':
                std::cout << (x + y) << "\n";
                break;
            case '-':
                std::cout << (x - y) << "\n";
                break;
            case '/':
                if(y != 0) {
                    std::cout << (x / y) << "\n";
                }
                break;
            case '*':
                std::cout << (x * y) << "\n";
                break;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Remember, C++ does not protect you from division by zero, it is your responsibility to prevent this from happening.
