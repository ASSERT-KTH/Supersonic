Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid multiple printf calls: In the current implementation, there's a printf statement inside every if-else condition. We can reduce this to a single printf statement by calculating the result within the conditions and then printing it once after the conditions.

2. Use switch-case instead of if-else: switch-case statements are generally faster than if-else statements when dealing with multiple conditions based on a single variable. We can replace the multiple if-else conditions with a switch-case on the 'z' variable.

3. Avoid division by zero: The program currently does not handle the case where 'y' is zero and 'z' is '/'. This will cause a runtime error. We should add a condition to check for this.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int x, y, result;
  char z;
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %c %d", &x, &z, &y);
    if (z == '?') {
      return 0;
    }
    switch (z) {
      case '+':
        result = x + y;
        break;
      case '-':
        result = x - y;
        break;
      case '/':
        if (y != 0) {
          result = x / y;
        } else {
          printf("Error: Division by zero\n");
          continue;
        }
        break;
      case '*':
        result = x * y;
        break;
    }
    printf("%d\n", result);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The "using namespace std;" line isn't necessary in this program, as we aren't using anything from the std namespace. I've left it in to stick to the rule of making only small modifications to the original program.
