The given C++ program appears to be a competitive programming problem where for each test case, it's trying to find the maximum product that can be created by splitting a number `N` into two parts (not necessarily equal) and repeating the process until it's no longer possible. If the process enters a loop, it prints `-1`.

Steps to optimize the code:

1. We don't need to initialize the boolean table for each test case. We can do it once outside the test cases loop. This will reduce the time complexity from O(Q*1e6) to O(1e6), where Q is the number of test cases.

2. We can avoid using dynamic memory allocation for the boolean table. Instead, we can declare it as a static array. This will prevent unnecessary allocation and deallocation in heap memory and it also reduces the chance of memory leakage and segmentation fault.

3. We can eliminate the use of the variable 'FLG'. Instead, we can use a `break` statement to exit the loop when a repeating number is found.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int Q, N, count, tmp, max, S;
    scanf("%d", &Q);
    
    bool table[1000001] = {false};
    for (int loop = 0; loop < Q; loop++) {
        count = 0;
        scanf("%d", &N);
        table[N] = true;
        while (N / 10 != 0) {
            max = 0;
            for (S = 10; N / S != 0; S *= 10) {
                tmp = (N / S) * (N % S);
                max = (max >= tmp) ? max : tmp;
            }
            N = max;
            if (table[N] == true) {
                printf("-1\n");
                break;
            } else {
                table[N] = true;
                count++;
            }
        }
        if (N / 10 == 0) {
            printf("%d\n", count);
        }
        // reset the used elements in table to false for next test case
        for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
            if (table[i]) {
                table[i] = false;
            }
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
