Before optimizing, let's understand what the code does:

1. It reads a number Q from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it initializes an array of boolean values `table` to `false`.
3. It reads a number `N` from the input and marks its corresponding `table` index value to `true`.
4. It then enters a loop where it calculates a new `N` value as the maximum product of two numbers obtained by splitting `N` at any digit.
5. This process continues until `N` becomes a single digit number or `N` has already been encountered before (a cycle is detected).
6. If a cycle is detected, the program prints `-1`, else it prints the count of the number of operations performed.

Here are few optimization steps:

1. The array `table` is initialized to `false` in every test case. This is not required. We only need to reset the values corresponding to the numbers we have encountered in the current test case. So, instead of setting the entire array to `false`, we can keep track of the numbers we have encountered in a separate vector and only reset those values.
2. The calculation of `max` can be optimized. We do not need to calculate the product for every split of `N`. We can start from the middle and move towards the ends. This will give us the maximum product earlier, reducing the number of iterations.
3. We do not need to use `scanf` and `printf`. We can use `cin` and `cout` which are faster.

Now let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int Q, N, count, tmp, max, S;
  bool FLG;
  cin >> Q;
  bool *table = new bool[1000001];
  vector<int> encountered;
  for (int loop = 0; loop < Q; loop++) {
    encountered.clear();
    count = 0;
    cin >> N;
    table[N] = true;
    encountered.push_back(N);
    FLG = false;
    while (N / 10 != 0) {
      max = 0;
      S = pow(10, to_string(N).size() / 2);
      while (S != 0) {
        tmp = (N / S) * (N % S);
        max = max >= tmp ? max : tmp;
        S /= 10;
      }
      N = max;
      if (table[N] == true) {
        FLG = true;
        break;
      } else {
        table[N] = true;
        encountered.push_back(N);
        count++;
      }
    }
    if (FLG) {
      cout << "-1\n";
    } else {
      cout << count << "\n";
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < encountered.size(); i++)
      table[encountered[i]] = false;
  }
  delete[] table;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version should run faster and use less memory than the original version.
