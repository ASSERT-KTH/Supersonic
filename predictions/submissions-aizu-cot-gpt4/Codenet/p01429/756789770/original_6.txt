Here are some optimizations that can be applied to the provided code:

1. Remove unused includes: The program includes many libraries that are not being used. For example, deque, list, map, queue, set, sstream, stack, string, bitset, and cctype are not used in the program. Removing these includes will reduce the compilation time.

2. Reduce number of operations inside loops: The code computes `next = i + 1` inside the loop where `i` is the loop variable. This operation can be done outside of the loop to reduce the number of operations inside the loop.

3. Use prefix increment/decrement operators when the result is not used: In C++, prefix increment/decrement operators (++i/--i) are more efficient than postfix (i++/i--) when the result is not used, because the postfix operators need to make a copy of the original value.

4. Use references or pointers when passing large objects to functions: The function compute takes two integers by value. If these integers are large objects, it would be more efficient to pass them by reference or by pointer.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: In the function compute, the rhs value is calculated even if it is not needed when `notes[j] - 1 < 0`. We can avoid this by using a ternary operator.

Now let's apply these optimizations:

  return (lhs - rhs) / force_of_repulsion;
}
int main() {

      scanf("%d", &notes[note_idx]);
      --notes[note_idx];
    }
    memset(sum, 0, sizeof(sum));
    for (int beauty_idx = 0; beauty_idx < num_of_beauty; ++beauty_idx) {
      scanf("%d", &beauty[beauty_idx]);
      sum[beauty_idx] = (beauty_idx - 1 >= 0 ? sum[beauty_idx - 1] : 0) + beauty[beauty_idx];
    }
    sort(notes, notes + num_of_notes);
    reverse(notes, notes + num_of_notes);
    memset(dp, 0x3f, sizeof(dp));
    dp[0][0] = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_of_notes; ++i) {
      int next = i + 1;
      for (int j = 0; j <= i; ++j) {
        dp[next][j] = min(dp[next][j], dp[i][j] + compute(i, next));
        dp[next][i] = min(dp[next][i], dp[i][j] + compute(j, next));
      }
    }
    ll res = 0x3f3f3f3f3f3f3f3f;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_of_notes; ++i) {
      res = min(dp[num_of_notes - 1][i] + compute(i, num_of_notes - 1), res);
    }
    printf("%lld\n", res);
  }
}
```
