The given program is a complex one and it is already quite optimized. The optimizations that could be performed on this program would not drastically improve the performance but rather make the code more maintainable and cleaner.

Here are the steps we can take:

1. Eliminate the unnecessary include statements. If a header is not directly used in the source file, there is no need to include it. This may slightly decrease the compile time.

2. The usage of `#define` for constants could be replaced with `const` or `constexpr` variables. This is not an optimization in terms of execution speed, but it is better for type safety and debugging.

3. In the compute function, the division operation is costlier than other arithmetic operations. Since the `force_of_repulsion` is a constant during the execution of the program, if it always divides the lhs - rhs, we can instead multiply by the reciprocal of `force_of_repulsion`, which can be pre-calculated. This can slightly improve the performance.

4. Place the most probable condition first in min() function to avoid unnecessary function call.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
typedef pair<int, P> PP;
const static int tx[] = {0, 1, 1, 1, 0, -1, -1, -1};
const static int ty[] = {-1, -1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, -1};
static const double EPS = 1e-8;
const ll INF = 0x3f3f3f3f3f3f3f3f;
int num_of_notes;
int num_of_beauty;
ll force_of_repulsion;
ll sum[200001];
ll dp[2001][2001];
int notes[2001];
ll beauty[100001];
double force_of_repulsion_reciprocal;

ll compute(int i, int j) {
  ll lhs = sum[notes[i]];
  ll rhs = (notes[j] - 1 < 0 ? 0 : sum[notes[j] - 1]);
  return (lhs - rhs) * force_of_repulsion_reciprocal;
}

int main() {
  while (~scanf("%d %d %lld", &num_of_notes, &num_of_beauty, &force_of_repulsion)) {
    force_of_repulsion_reciprocal = 1.0 / force_of_repulsion;
    for (int note_idx = 0; note_idx < num_of_notes; note_idx++) {
      scanf("%d", notes + note_idx);
      notes[note_idx]--;
    }
    memset(sum, 0, sizeof(sum));
    for (int beauty_idx = 0; beauty_idx < num_of_beauty; beauty_idx++) {
      scanf("%d", beauty + beauty_idx);
      sum[beauty_idx] = (beauty_idx - 1 >= 0 ? sum[beauty_idx - 1] : 0) + beauty[beauty_idx];
    }
    sort(notes, notes + num_of_notes);
    reverse(notes, notes + num_of_notes);
    memset(dp, 0x3f, sizeof(dp));
    dp[0][0] = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_of_notes; i++) {
      int next = i + 1;
      for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
        dp[next][j] = min(dp[next][j], dp[i][j] + compute(i, next));
        dp[next][i] = min(dp[next][i], dp[i][j] + compute(j, next));
      }
    }
    ll res = INF;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_of_notes; i++) {
      res = min(res, dp[num_of_notes - 1][i] + compute(i, num_of_notes - 1));
    }
    printf("%lld\n", res);
  }
}
```
