This C/C++ program can be optimized in several ways:

1. **Avoiding unnecessary includes**: The program includes several libraries that it doesn't use. Removing these will reduce the compiled program's size and make it slightly faster to compile.

2. **Minimizing the use of global variables**: The program uses several global variables, which can cause memory waste and potential bugs if not handled properly. We can move the declaration of some variables inside the main function to make them local variables.

3. **Avoiding unnecessary computations**: Two calls to the compute function are identical in the nested for loop within the main function. We can store the result of the first call and reuse it in the second call.

4. **Using std::min instead of ternary operator**: Instead of using the ternary operator for the minimum operation, we can use std::min for better readability.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
static const ll INF = 0x3f3f3f3f3f3f3f3f;
static const double EPS = 1e-8;

ll compute(int i, int j, ll force_of_repulsion, ll* sum, int* notes) {
  ll lhs = sum[notes[i]];
  ll rhs = (notes[j] - 1 < 0 ? 0 : sum[notes[j] - 1]);
  return (lhs - rhs) / force_of_repulsion;
}

int main() {
  int num_of_notes;
  int num_of_beauty;
  ll force_of_repulsion;
  ll sum[200001];
  ll dp[2001][2001];
  int notes[2001];
  ll beauty[100001];
  while (~scanf("%d %d %lld", &num_of_notes, &num_of_beauty,
                &force_of_repulsion)) {
    for (int note_idx = 0; note_idx < num_of_notes; note_idx++) {
      scanf("%d", notes + note_idx);
      notes[note_idx]--;
    }
    memset(sum, 0, sizeof(sum));
    for (int beauty_idx = 0; beauty_idx < num_of_beauty; beauty_idx++) {
      scanf("%d", beauty + beauty_idx);
      sum[beauty_idx] =
          (beauty_idx - 1 >= 0 ? sum[beauty_idx - 1] : 0) + beauty[beauty_idx];
    }
    sort(notes, notes + num_of_notes);
    reverse(notes, notes + num_of_notes);
    memset(dp, 0x3f, sizeof(dp));
    dp[0][0] = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_of_notes; i++) {
      int next = i + 1;
      for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
        ll comp = compute(i, next, force_of_repulsion, sum, notes);
        dp[next][j] = min(dp[next][j], dp[i][j] + comp);
        dp[next][i] = min(dp[next][i], dp[i][j] + comp);
      }
    }
    ll res = INF;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_of_notes; i++) {
      res = min(dp[num_of_notes - 1][i] + compute(i, num_of_notes - 1, force_of_repulsion, sum, notes), res);
    }
    printf("%lld\n", res);
  }
}
```
Please note that the optimizations suggested here are mainly focused on code readability, compile-time efficiency, and memory usage. The runtime could be improved by using more advanced algorithms or data structures, but that would require a more significant modification of the code.
