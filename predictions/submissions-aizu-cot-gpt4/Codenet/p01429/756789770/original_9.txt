The given C/C++ program can be optimized for running time and memory usage with the following steps:

1. Remove unused includes: The program includes a lot of libraries, but only few of them are actually being used. This unnecessarily increases the compilation time of the program. It's advised to only include necessary libraries.

2. Use vector instead of array: Using vector instead of built-in C-style arrays is beneficial in terms of safety and ease of use. Vectors can grow and shrink dynamically, they provide efficient insertions and deletions at the end and they automatically manage memory.

3. Avoid using global variables: Global variables should be avoided as they can lead to unexpected results due to variable shadowing and other issues.

4. Use function parameters instead of global variables: This makes the code clearer and easier to understand.

5. Use std::min instead of ternary operator: The ternary operator can be replaced with the std::min function to make the code more readable.

6. Avoid using memset with non-zero values: The behavior of memset is defined only for values that can be represented as unsigned char. Using it with non-zero values (like 0x3f) is not recommended.

7. Use early return in compute function: This can make the code clearer and potentially faster.

8. Use prefix increment (++i) instead of postfix (i++): This can be faster in some cases, especially when dealing with objects that overload the increment operator.

9. Avoid using magic numbers: Instead of using magic numbers (like 0x3f3f3f3f3f3f3f3f), it's better to use named constants.

10. Use const references for complex objects: This can avoid unnecessary copying of objects.

Here is the optimized version of the given C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef vector<int> VI;
const static ll LINF = 0x3f3f3f3f3f3f3f3f;
ll compute(const VI& notes, const VI& sum, ll force_of_repulsion, int i, int j) {
  ll lhs = sum[notes[i]];
  ll rhs = (notes[j] - 1 < 0 ? 0 : sum[notes[j] - 1]);
  return (lhs - rhs) / force_of_repulsion;
}
int main() {
  int num_of_notes, num_of_beauty;
  ll force_of_repulsion;
  while (~scanf("%d %d %lld", &num_of_notes, &num_of_beauty, &force_of_repulsion)) {
    VI notes(num_of_notes), sum(num_of_beauty), dp(num_of_notes);
    for (int i = 0; i < num_of_notes; ++i) {
      scanf("%d", &notes[i]);
      --notes[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < num_of_beauty; ++i) {
      scanf("%d", &sum[i]);
      sum[i] += (i - 1 >= 0 ? sum[i - 1] : 0);
    }
    sort(notes.begin(), notes.end(), greater<int>());
    fill(dp.begin(), dp.end(), LINF);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_of_notes; ++i) {
      for (int j = 0; j <= i; ++j) {
        dp[i + 1] = min({dp[i + 1], dp[i] + compute(notes, sum, force_of_repulsion, i, i + 1), dp[i] + compute(notes, sum, force_of_repulsion, j, i + 1)});
      }
    }
    ll res = LINF;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_of_notes; ++i) {
      res = min(res, dp[num_of_notes - 1] + compute(notes, sum, force_of_repulsion, i, num_of_notes - 1));
    }
    printf("%lld\n", res);
  }
}
