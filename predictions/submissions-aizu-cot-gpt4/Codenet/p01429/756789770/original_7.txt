Here are some steps to optimize this code:

1. Reduce the number of includes: You are including a lot of libraries, some of them are unnecessary. For example, you included both `cstdio` and `iostream` which are used for input/output operations. You can stick to one of them. 

2. Use vectors instead of arrays: In C++, vector is a dynamic array that automatically handles its size. It can be more memory efficient if the size of the array is not fixed.

3. Use fast I/O operations: `scanf` and `printf` are faster than `cin` and `cout` but they can be made even faster by using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` at the start of the main function.

4. Avoid unnecessary computations in loops: You are calling `compute(i, next)` twice in the loop. This is not necessary, you can call it once, store it in a variable and use this variable.

5. Avoid use of `memset`: `memset` is used to set the block of memory with the specified value. But it is not always safe to use and its misuse can lead to problems. In C++, you can initialize the array at the time of declaration.

Here is your optimized code:
