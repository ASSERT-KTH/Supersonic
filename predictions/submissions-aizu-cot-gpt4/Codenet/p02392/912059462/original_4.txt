This program is quite optimized in terms of running time and memory usage. However, there are small modifications we can do to make it slightly better.

1. Combining the print statement: Instead of having two separate print statements, we can combine them into one. This will reduce the number of system calls made by the program, which in turn improves the running time of the program.

2. Use return instead of exit(0): The purpose of both return 0 and exit(0) in main() function is to exit the program. But, the difference is that return 0 will immediately terminate the program and also return the control to the operating system where as exit(0) will terminate the program but it will not return the control to the operating system instead it will check for some other conditions to be executed and then it will return the control to operating system. So, using return 0 is slightly better in terms of memory usage and execution time.

Here is the optimized code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);
  if (a < b && b < c) {
    printf("Yes\n");
  } else {
    printf("No\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
