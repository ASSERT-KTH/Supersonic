The given C program is already quite optimized. But there are few very minor optimizations that can be done. 

1. The `printf("\n")` can be merged with the previous `printf` statements, this can reduce the number of function calls which can give a bit of performance improvement especially when the function is called too many times. But in this case, this will not give a noticeable improvement as it's only called once.

2. If you are using C++, it's better to use `iostream` instead of `stdio.h` for better type safety and extensibility.

Let's apply these optimizations to the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  if (a < b && b < c) {
    cout << "Yes\n";
  } else {
    cout << "No\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

If you still want to stick with C, the optimized program will look like:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);
  if (a < b && b < c) {
    printf("Yes\n");
  } else {
    printf("No\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Remember that the given optimization will not make a significant difference in this case as the program is already quite small and efficient.
