The given C/C++ program is already quite optimized in terms of running time and memory usage, as it only involves reading integers from the standard input, comparing them, and printing a result.

However, a small optimization could be to remove the separate `printf("\n");` statement and add the newline character to the previous `printf` statements. This reduces the number of function calls from 3 to 2, which could potentially speed up the program, even if just slightly.

Optimized Program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);
  if (a < b && b < c) {
    printf("Yes\n");
  } else {
    printf("No\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the improvements made here are minimal because the original code was already quite efficient.
