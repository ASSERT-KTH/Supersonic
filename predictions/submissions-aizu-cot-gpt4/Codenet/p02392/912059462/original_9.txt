This program is quite simple and efficient. However, to optimize it further, we can make these changes:

1. We can combine the two `printf` statements into one to decrease the number of function calls.
2. We can return directly from the `printf` statements to remove the need for the `return 0;` statement.
3. Instead of using `scanf` which is slower due to its error checking and conversion capabilities, we can use `fscanf` which is faster as it directly reads from the `stdin`.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  fscanf(stdin, "%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);
  if (a < b && b < c) {
    return printf("Yes\n"), 0;
  } else {
    return printf("No\n"), 0;
  }
}
```

This optimized version reduces the number of function calls and uses a faster input reading function. It also removes the need for an extra return statement. The comma operator is used to return 0 after printing the result. The left operand of the comma operator is evaluated for its side effects and its result is discarded, which makes it a useful construct in cases like this where we want to perform two actions in one statement.
