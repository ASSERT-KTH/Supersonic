The given program is quite simple and efficient already, but there are a few minor optimizations that can still be done.

Optimization Steps:

1. Instead of two separate calls to printf(), combine them into one. This reduces the number of function calls, thereby slightly reducing the running time of the program.

2. Combine the declaration and initialization of the integer variables. This is a good programming practice, but doesn't actually optimize the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0;

    scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);

    if (a < b && b < c) {
        printf("Yes\n");
    } else {
        printf("No\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
Please note that the optimizations made here are very minor, and it's unlikely you'll see any noticeable improvements in execution time or memory usage for a program as simple as this. However, it's good to get into the habit of writing efficient code, as this will make a big difference in larger and more complex programs.
