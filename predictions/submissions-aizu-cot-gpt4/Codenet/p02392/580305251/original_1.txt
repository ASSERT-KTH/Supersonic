There are several issues with your code:

1. You're trying to check if `a`, `b`, and `c` are in range 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 100, but it doesn't do anything in C/C++. It's just a no-op.

2. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are used without being initialized. They could contain any value before `scanf` is called.

3. The code is not very efficient because it uses `printf` and `scanf`, which have high overhead.

Here are the modifications I would suggest:

1. Initialize `a`, `b`, and `c` to some default value. This will ensure they don't contain garbage values before `scanf` is called.

2. Use `puts` instead of `printf` for printing the string. `puts` is faster than `printf` because it doesn't need to parse the format string.

3. Remove the line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` as it doesn't do anything.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int a=0, b=0, c=0;
  scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
  if (a < b && b < c) {
    puts("Yes");
  } else {
    puts("No");
  }
  return (0);
}
```

However, this is a minor optimization. The runtime of this program is mostly determined by how fast the user can input the numbers. The optimization here won't make the program noticeably faster. But it's still good practice to initialize variables and use efficient functions.
