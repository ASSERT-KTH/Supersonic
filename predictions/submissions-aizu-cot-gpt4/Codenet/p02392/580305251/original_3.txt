The given C/C++ program takes three integers as inputs and checks if they are in ascending order. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

From the optimization perspective, there are a few things we can improve:

1. The line "0 <= a, b, c <= 100;" is not performing any action. The values of a, b, and c have not been initialized and this line is not constraining their values in any way. This line can be removed to clean up the code, as itâ€™s not contributing to the functionality of the program.

2. The program uses two printf statements to display "Yes" and "No". We can instead use a ternary operator within a single printf statement to decide what to print. This will reduce the number of lines in our code and make it easier to read and maintain.

3. The return statement at the end of main() is not necessary in C/C++. The C/C++ standards state that if control reaches the end of main without encountering a return statement, the effect is the same as executing return 0; Hence, we can remove this line.

Here's the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
  printf((a < b && b < c) ? "Yes\n" : "No\n");
}
```
This version of the program does exactly the same as the original, but with fewer lines of code. It's cleaner and easier to understand.
