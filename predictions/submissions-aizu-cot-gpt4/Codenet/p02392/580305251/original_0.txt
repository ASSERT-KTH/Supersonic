The given C/C++ program reads three integers as input and checks if they are in ascending order. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

The program itself is quite efficient, but there are a few small improvements that can be made:

1. The line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` doesn't do anything meaningful in C/C++. It seems like it's supposed to constrain the values of a, b, and c to the range [0, 100], but C/C++ doesn't support that kind of syntax. It needs to be removed.
2. The variables a, b, and c are declared at the beginning of the main function, but they aren't used until later. In C/C++, it's often better to declare variables as late as possible to reduce their scope and improve readability.

Let's make these changes:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  // Remove the meaningless line
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
  if (a < b && b < c) {
    printf("Yes\n");
  } else {
    printf("No\n");
  }
  return 0; // Return statement doesn't need parentheses in C/C++
}
```

This optimized program behaves exactly the same as the original but is slightly cleaner and easier to read.
