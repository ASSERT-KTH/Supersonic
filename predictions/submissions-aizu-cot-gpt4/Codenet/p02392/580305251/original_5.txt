The given C program reads three integers from the user and checks if they are in increasing order. If they are, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No". However, the line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` does nothing and can be removed.

Also, the program doesn't initialize the variables a, b, and c. This is not a problem here because the variables are assigned values from the user input before they are used. However, it's generally a good practice to initialize variables when they are declared to avoid potential issues. This is especially important in larger programs where the flow of control might be more complicated.

Another potential optimization is to replace the standard `printf` function with `puts` function when printing a constant string. `puts` function is generally faster than `printf` because it doesn't need to parse the format string.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0;
  scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
  if (a < b && b < c) {
    puts("Yes");
  } else {
    puts("No");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note, the optimized program still makes the assumption that the user will provide valid integer input. If there's a chance that the user might not provide valid input, you should add error checking code after the `scanf` function call.
