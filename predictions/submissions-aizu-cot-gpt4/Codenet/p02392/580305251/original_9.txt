This program takes three integers as input and checks if they are in increasing order. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". The line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` is not doing anything in this code - it doesn't limit the input values to this range, so we can remove it to reduce redundancy. 

Also, the `return(0);` at the end of the `main()` function is not necessary in modern C/C++ standards, because it is automatically assumed if not specified.

Here is the optimized code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
  
  if (a < b && b < c)
    printf("Yes\n");
  else
    printf("No\n");
}
```

This optimized program will have the same behavior as the original program but is more efficient due to the removal of unnecessary lines of code.
