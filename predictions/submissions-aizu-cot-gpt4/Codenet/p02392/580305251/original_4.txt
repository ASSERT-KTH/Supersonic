The given code is very simple and there is very little room for optimization. However, there are some minor changes that can be made to improve the cleanliness and efficiency of the code:

1. Remove Unused Expression: The expression `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` has no effect on the program. It is not a valid way to set limits on the variables a, b and c in C/C++. It should be removed.

2. Combine printf Statements: The `printf` statements can be combined into one. This reduces the number of function calls which can slightly improve the performance of the program.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);

  printf((a < b && b < c) ? "Yes\n" : "No\n");

  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code performs the same as the original, but it is cleaner and slightly more efficient. 

Note: If you wanted to enforce the condition `0 <= a, b, c <= 100`, you would need to implement it as a check after the `scanf` statement. For example, you could add `if (a < 0 || a > 100 || b < 0 || b > 100 || c < 0 || c > 100) return 1;` This would end the program with an error code if the input values are out of the desired range. However, this was not included in the optimized code because it was not in the original code.
