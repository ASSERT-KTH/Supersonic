The program you provided is a 3D geometry representation and operations simulator. It is well-structured and has been divided into classes and functions that each handle a specific task. However, there are a few areas that could be optimized for better performance and memory usage.

Optimization Steps:

1. Include Necessary Headers: Instead of using `#include<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a lot of unnecessary headers, you may include only the headers that are needed for the program. This could speed up the compilation time, reduce memory usage, and make the code more portable.

2. Inline Functions: Inline functions can speed up the execution time by reducing the overhead of function calls. However, almost all of your functions are already inline.

3. Pass Complex Objects by Reference: When passing complex objects like Point3d and Segment3d as function arguments, it's more efficient to pass by reference rather than by value. This avoids unnecessary object copying, reduces memory usage, and can improve performance.

4. Use `const` Reference: When an object is passed by reference and not modified by the function, it is more efficient to declare it as a `const` reference. This can avoid accidental modification of the object and potentially improve performance.

5. Avoid Unnecessary Copy: In function `crosspointTS`, you are copying the `Vector3d` object `normal_vector` to normalize it. This can be avoided by normalizing the object directly.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

#define REP(i, s, n) for (int i = s; i < n; i++)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define IINF (INT_MAX)
#define EPS (1e-7)
#define equals(a, b) (fabs((a) - (b)) < EPS)

using namespace std;

// Classes and functions remain the same, just showing the changes.

double dot(const Point3d &a, const Point3d &b) {
  return a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y + a.z * b.z;
}

Vector3d cross(const Point3d &a, const Point3d &b) {
  return Vector3d(a.y * b.z - a.z * b.y, a.z * b.x - a.x * b.z,
                  a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x);
}

// ... Other functions ...

bool point_on_the_triangle3d(const Point3d& tri1, const Point3d& tri2, const Point3d& tri3,
                             const Point3d& p) {
  // ... Same code ...
}

Point3d crosspointTS(const Point3d& tri1, const Point3d& tri2, const Point3d& tri3, const Segment3d& seg) {
  Vector3d normal_vector = cross(tri2 - tri1, tri3 - tri1);
  normal_vector = normal_vector / abs(normal_vector);
  double dist1 = dot(seg.p[1] - seg.p[0], normal_vector);
  double dist2 = dot(tri1 - seg.p[0], normal_vector);
  double t = dist2 / dist1;
  Point3d e = (seg.p[1] - seg.p[0]) / abs(seg.p[1] - seg.p[0]);
  return seg.p[0] + e * t;
}

// ... Main function ...
```

Remember, these optimizations are minor and may not significantly impact the performance and memory usage for smaller inputs. However, they could potentially provide noticeable improvements for larger inputs.
