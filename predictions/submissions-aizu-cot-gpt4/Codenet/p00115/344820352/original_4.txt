This program is already quite optimized, but there are still a few minor improvements that can be made.

1. Remove unused macro definitions: The definitions for REP, IINF, and EPS are not used in the code. Removing them would not affect the program's functionality and would slightly reduce memory usage.

2. Avoid creating unnecessary temporary objects: The operator overloads in the Point3d class create and return temporary objects when performing arithmetic operations. This increases memory usage and can slow down the program when dealing with large data. We can modify these overloads to modify and return the original object instead. However, we need to be aware that this will change the behavior of the program, so it should only be done if we are certain that the original object does not need to be preserved.

3. Avoid unnecessary checks: In the function point_on_the_triangle3d, the condition on_line3d(seg, p) is checked twice. We can store the result of this check in a variable and use it in both places, avoiding the need to perform the check twice.

4. Avoid creating unnecessary variables: In the function crosspointTS, the variable e is created and used only once. We can avoid creating this variable and instead use its value directly where it is needed.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
using namespace std;

class Point3d {
public:
  double x, y, z;
  Point3d(double x = 0, double y = 0, double z = 0) : x(x), y(y), z(z) {}
  Point3d& operator+=(const Point3d &a) {
    x += a.x; y += a.y; z += a.z;
    return *this;
  }
  Point3d& operator-=(const Point3d &a) {
    x -= a.x; y -= a.y; z -= a.z;
    return *this;
  }
  Point3d& operator*=(const double &d) {
    x *= d; y *= d; z *= d;
    return *this;
  }
  Point3d& operator/=(const double &d) {
    x /= d; y /= d; z /= d;
    return *this;
  }
  // ... rest of the class definition remains unchanged ...
};

bool on_segment3d(Segment3d seg, Point3d p) {
  bool onLine = on_line3d(seg, p);
  if (!onLine) return false;
  double dist[3] = {abs(seg.p[1] - seg.p[0]), abs(p - seg.p[0]),
                    abs(p - seg.p[1])};
  return onLine && equals(dist[0], dist[1] + dist[2]);
}

Point3d crosspointTS(Point3d tri1, Point3d tri2, Point3d tri3, Segment3d seg) {
  Vector3d normal_vector = cross(tri2 - tri1, tri3 - tri1);
  normal_vector /= abs(normal_vector);
  double dist1 = dot(seg.p[1] - seg.p[0], normal_vector);
  double dist2 = dot(tri1 - seg.p[0], normal_vector);
  double t = dist2 / dist1;
  return seg.p[0] + ((seg.p[1] - seg.p[0]) / abs(seg.p[1] - seg.p[0])) * t;
}

// ... rest of the program remains unchanged ...
