This program is quite well optimized. However, there are still a few improvements we can make:

1. Avoid using `std::endl`. It flushes the buffer every time it's used, which can slow down output operations. Use "\n" instead.
2. Avoid unnecessary calculations. For example, in the `dot` and `cross` functions, you perform multiplication twice. Instead, you can store the results in a variable and use it again.
3. Inline functions: Inline functions are a nice way to ask the compiler to insert the code of a function directly into the code of its callers. It is used to reduce the function call overhead. Inline is only a request to the compiler, it's up to the compiler to insert the code of the function into its callers or not. But be careful, inlining a very big function can increase the binary size significantly.
4. Use `const` references to avoid copying of objects. For example, in the `dot`, `cross`, `norm`, `abs` and `on_line3d` functions, pass the Point3d objects by const reference instead of by value.
5. Reserve memory for vectors if the size is known beforehand. This minimizes reallocations and copying.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define REP(i, s, n) for (int i = s; i < n; i++)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define IINF (INT_MAX)
#define EPS (1e-7)
#define equals(a, b) (fabs((a) - (b)) < EPS)

using namespace std;

class Point3d {
public:
  double x, y, z;
  Point3d(double x = 0, double y = 0, double z = 0) : x(x), y(y), z(z) {}
  Point3d operator+(const Point3d &a) const {
    return Point3d(x + a.x, y + a.y, z + a.z);
  }
  Point3d operator-(const Point3d &a) const {
    return Point3d(x - a.x, y - a.y, z - a.z);
  }
  Point3d operator*(const double &d) const { return Point3d(x * d, y * d, z * d); }
  Point3d operator/(const double &d) const { return Point3d(x / d, y / d, z / d); }
  bool operator<(const Point3d &p) const {
    return !equals(x, p.x) ? x < p.x : ((!equals(y, p.y)) ? y < p.y : z < p.z);
  }
  bool operator==(const Point3d &p) const {
    return equals(x, p.x) && equals(y, p.y) && equals(z, p.z);
  }
};

// More code here...

double dot(const Point3d &a, const Point3d &b) {
  return a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y + a.z * b.z;
}

// More code here...

bool on_line3d(const Line3d &line, const Point3d &p) {
  return equals(abs(cross(p - line.p[0], line.p[1] - line.p[0])), 0);
}

// More code here...

int main() {
  Point3d tri[3], S, G;
  cin >> S.x >> S.y >> S.z;
  cin >> G.x >> G.y >> G.z;
  rep(i, 3) cin >> tri[i].x >> tri[i].y >> tri[i].z;
  Plane3d plane(tri[0], tri[1], tri[2]);
  Segment3d seg(S, G);
  if (!plane.intersectS(seg)) {
    cout << Y << "\n";
    return 0;
  }
  Point3d cp = plane.crosspointS(seg);
  cout << (point_on_the_triangle3d(tri[0], tri[1], tri[2], cp) ? N : Y) << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimizations given here are quite generic. The actual impact on performance may vary depending on the specific context and use case. It's always a good practice to measure and profile your code to find out where the bottlenecks are.
