This program seems to be a dynamic programming problem. The optimization can be made in terms of the way we are using the 3-dimensional DP array which is using a lot of memory. Here, the 3rd dimension of the DP array is only using two slots (0 and 1), which indicates that it is taking advantage of only two states of the current index (even or odd). 

Instead of using a 3-dimensional DP array, we can use two 2-dimensional DP arrays. This way, we will have two DP arrays corresponding to the two states of the current index (even or odd). 

We will also move the process of resetting the DP array to the end of the loop where it is used which is a common practice to avoid unnecessary operations.

Also, it seems like the "algorithm" and "cmath" libraries are not being used in the code so we can remove those.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define REP(i, s, n) for (int i = s; i < n; i++)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define MAX 150
using namespace std;
bool dp1[MAX][MAX];
bool dp2[MAX][MAX];
int main() {
  int T;
  while (cin >> T) {
    while (T--) {
      rep(i, MAX) rep(j, MAX) {
        dp1[i][j] = false;
        dp2[i][j] = false;
      }
      int N;
      cin >> N;
      int input[N];
      rep(i, N) cin >> input[i];
      if (N <= 2) {
        cout << input[N - 1] << endl;
        continue;
      }
      int ans = input[N - 1];
      REP(cur, 1, N - 1) {
        bool (*dp_curr)[MAX], (*dp_next)[MAX];
        if (cur & 1) {
          dp_curr = dp1;
          dp_next = dp2;
        } else {
          dp_curr = dp2;
          dp_next = dp1;
        }
        dp_curr[input[cur - 1]][input[cur]] = true;
        int R = input[cur + 1];
        rep(L, MAX) {
          rep(M, MAX) {
            if (!dp_curr[L][M])
              continue;
            if (M == 0) {
              if (cur + 2 < N) {
                dp_next[M][R] = true;
              } else
                ans = max(ans, R);
            } else {
              if (cur + 2 < N) {
                dp_next[M][R] = true;
                dp_next[M - 1][R + L] = true;
              } else {
                ans = max(ans, R + L);
              }
            }
          }
        }
        rep(i, MAX) rep(j, MAX) dp_curr[i][j] = false;
      }
      cout << ans << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The main optimization here is to reduce the space complexity from O(N^3) to O(N^2) by using two 2-dimensional arrays instead of one 3-dimensional array. The reduction in memory usage can significantly impact the performance of the program and reduce its running time. This is because fewer memory allocations and deallocations are needed, which are expensive operations. Also, less memory usage can lead to better cache utilization, which can further improve the overall execution time.
