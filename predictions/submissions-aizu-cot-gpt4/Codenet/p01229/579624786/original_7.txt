This program is a bit complex, but I can see a few areas for optimization:

1. Memory Optimization: The "dp" array is consistently being reset to "false". Instead of resetting the array as part of the loop, we could initialize it once and then only change the values that need to be changed. This would save memory and also reduce the time complexity.

2. Input Optimization: The program is reading input values one by one. We can use std::vector with std::istream_iterator for faster input.

3. Loop Optimization: There are several nested loops that are iterating up to MAX. If we can find a way to reduce the range of these loops, we can significantly improve the time complexity.

4. Avoiding unnecessary computation: We see 'cur & 1' is computed multiple times. We can store it in a variable and reuse it, to avoid re-computation.

5. Use of pre-increment instead of post-increment: Pre-increment is generally faster than post-increment in C++ as post-increment involves keeping a copy of the previous value that's not needed in this context.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <iterator>
#define REP(i, s, n) for (int i = s; i < n; ++i)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define inf (1 << 29)
#define MAX 150
using namespace std;
bool dp[MAX][MAX][2];
int main() {
  int T;
  while (cin >> T) {
    while (T--) {
      int N;
      cin >> N;
      vector<int> input(N);
      copy(istream_iterator<int>(cin), istream_iterator<int>(), back_inserter(input));
      if (N <= 2) {
        cout << input[N - 1] << endl;
        continue;
      }
      int ans = input[N - 1];
      REP(cur, 1, N - 1) {
        int curMod = cur & 1;
        dp[input[cur - 1]][input[cur]][curMod] = true;
        int R = input[cur + 1];
        rep(L, MAX) {
          rep(M, MAX) {
            if (!dp[L][M][curMod])
              continue;
            if (M == 0) {
              if (cur + 2 < N) {
                dp[M][R][!curMod] = true;
              } else
                ans = max(ans, R);
            } else {
              if (cur + 2 < N) {
                dp[M][R][!curMod] = true;
                dp[M - 1][R + L][!curMod] = true;
              } else {
                ans = max(ans, R + L);
              }
            }
          }
        }
        rep(i, MAX) rep(j, MAX) dp[i][j][curMod] = false;
      }
      cout << ans << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
