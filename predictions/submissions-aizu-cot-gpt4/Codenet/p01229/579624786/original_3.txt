The given C++ program can be optimized in several ways for both memory and runtime performance:

1. Memory Optimization:

   a) "input" array is declared with size "N" inside the while loop. This dynamic allocation can be avoided by declaring it with the maximum possible size, MAX.

   b) "dp" is a 3D boolean array with a size of MAX*MAX*2. The last dimension is actually toggling between 0 and 1. So, it can be reduced to 2D array with size of MAX*MAX by using the modulo operation on the current index.

2. Run-time Optimizations:

   a) The code is clearing the 3D array "dp" twice in each iteration of "T". This operation can be done only once at the end of the iteration.

   b) "R" is calculated inside the loop that iterates over "L" and "M". This calculation is not dependent on "L" or "M" and hence can be moved outside these loops to save computation time.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#define REP(i, s, n) for (int i = s; i < n; i++)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define MAX 150
using namespace std;

bool dp[MAX][MAX];
int input[MAX];

int main() {
  int T;
  while (cin >> T) {
    while (T--) {
      rep(i, MAX) rep(j, MAX) dp[i][j] = false;
      int N;
      cin >> N;
      rep(i, N) cin >> input[i];
      if (N <= 2) {
        cout << input[N - 1] << endl;
        continue;
      }
      int ans = input[N - 1];
      REP(cur, 1, N - 1) {
        dp[input[cur - 1]][input[cur]] = true;
        int R = input[cur + 1];
        rep(L, MAX) {
          rep(M, MAX) {
            if (!dp[L][M])
              continue;
            if (M == 0) {
              if (cur + 2 < N) {
                dp[M][R] = true;
              } else
                ans = max(ans, R);
            } else {
              if (cur + 2 < N) {
                dp[M][R] = true;
                dp[M - 1][R + L] = true;
              } else {
                ans = max(ans, R + L);
              }
            }
            dp[L][M] = false;
          }
        }
      }
      cout << ans << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
One thing to note is that the optimization steps can change the behavior of the program if the original implementation has any dependency on the updated parts of the program.
