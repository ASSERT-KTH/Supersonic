The given C/C++ program is already quite optimized. However, a small improvement can be made in the matrix multiplication function, `mul()`. 

Currently, the function iterates over all entries in the result matrix `C` and for each entry it iterates over the entire row and column from the input matrices `A` and `B` to compute the dot product. This results in a cubic time complexity. However, the computation could be sped up by skipping over entries in `A` or `B` that are zero.

The `mul()` function can be optimized by adding a condition to check whether the multiplier is zero before performing multiplication and addition. This will reduce unnecessary multiplication and addition operations, and thus, can potentially improve the program's performance.

Here is the optimized code snippet:

```cpp
mat mul(const mat &A, const mat &B) {
  int n = A.size();
  mat C(n, vl(n));
  rep(i, n) rep(j, n) {
    if (A[i][j] != 0) {
      rep(k, n) {
        if (B[j][k] != 0) {
          C[i][k] += A[i][j] * B[j][k];
          C[i][k] %= mod;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return C;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations will only have a noticeable effect if your matrices are sparse (i.e., have many zeros). If your matrices are dense (i.e., most of the elements are non-zero), then this optimization might not have a substantial effect and could potentially slow down your code due to the extra conditional checks.
