Step 1: 
We have a 2D array "dp" with size 5002 * 2 which is being reset in each iteration of the outermost loop in the solve() function. Since resetting an array is an expensive operation, we can optimize it by only resetting the elements which are actually being used. We only use "j" elements in each iteration, so we only need to reset the first "j" elements.

Step 2: 
The for loop that is currently copying dp into tmp can be optimized by using std::copy from the algorithm library. It is generally faster than manual copying in a loop.

Step 3: 
We can avoid calling minCost function multiple times by storing its result in a variable and reusing that. This will prevent the overhead of function call multiple times.

Step 4: 
We can replace printf and scanf with cout and cin for better performance. 

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int n;
int t[10002];
int dp[5002][2], tmp[5002][2];
int minCost(const int &a, const int &b) {
  if (a == -1)
    return b;
  if (b == -1)
    return a;
  return a > b ? b : a;
}
int solve() {
  memset(tmp, -1, sizeof(tmp[0][0]) * ((n / 2) + 1) * 2);
  tmp[1][0] = tmp[0][1] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp[0][0]) * ((n / 2) + 1) * 2);
    for (int j = 0; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      for (int pre = 0; pre < 2; pre++) {
        if (tmp[j][pre] == -1)
          continue;
        for (int next = 0; next < 2; next++) {
          int cost = minCost(dp[j + (next == 0 ? 1 : 0)][next], tmp[j][pre] + (pre != next ? t[i - 1] : 0));
          dp[j + (next == 0 ? 1 : 0)][next] = cost;
        }
      }
    }
    std::copy(&dp[0][0], &dp[0][0] + (n / 2 + 1) * 2, &tmp[0][0]);
  }
  return minCost(dp[n / 2][0], dp[n / 2][1]);
}
int main() {
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    cin >> t[i];
  }
  cout << solve() << '\n';
}
```

This optimized program should run faster and use less memory than the original one.
