The given C/C++ program calculates the minimum cost using dynamic programming. Here are a few steps we can take to optimize it:

1. Avoid copying the entire `dp` array to `tmp` in every iteration. Instead, use a flag to switch between the `dp` and `tmp` arrays.
2. Remove the repetitive `minCost` function calls and directly use the `min` function provided by the C++ STL.
3. Remove `memset` to initialize `dp` array. Instead, initialize the values to -1 only when needed.
4. Avoid unnecessary division operation inside the for loop by pre-calculating `n/2`.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int n;
int t[10002];
int dp[2][5002][2];
int solve() {
  int halfN = n / 2;
  dp[0][1][0] = dp[0][0][1] = 0;
  dp[0][0][0] = dp[0][1][1] = -1;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    int cur = i % 2;
    int pre = (i - 1) % 2;
    for (int j = 0; j <= halfN; j++) {
      dp[cur][j][0] = dp[cur][j][1] = -1;
      for (int preStatus = 0; preStatus < 2; preStatus++) {
        if (dp[pre][j][preStatus] == -1)
          continue;
        if (dp[cur][j + 1][0] == -1 || dp[cur][j + 1][0] > dp[pre][j][preStatus])
          dp[cur][j + 1][0] = dp[pre][j][preStatus];
        if (j > 0 && (dp[cur][j][1] == -1 || dp[cur][j][1] > dp[pre][j - 1][0] + t[i - 1]))
          dp[cur][j][1] = dp[pre][j - 1][0] + t[i - 1];
      }
    }
  }
  return min(dp[(n - 1) % 2][halfN][0], dp[(n - 1) % 2][halfN][1]);
}
int main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &t[i]);
  }
  printf("%d\n", solve());
}
```

In the optimized version, the `dp` array is now a 3D array. The first dimension represents the current and previous states, with `i%2` used as the index, switching between 0 and 1. This way reduces the copying operation from `dp` to `tmp`. The `minCost` function has been replaced with the built-in `min` function for brevity and efficiency. The initialization of `dp` is now done only when needed, saving time and memory. Also, the value `n/2` has been pre-calculated so that the division operation is not done in every iteration of the loop.
