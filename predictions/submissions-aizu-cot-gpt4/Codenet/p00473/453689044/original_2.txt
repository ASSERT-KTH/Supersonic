The given C/C++ program has the following possible optimizations:

1. Use `std::min` instead of `minCost` function: The `minCost` function is essentially trying to get the minimum value between two integers. Instead of using this custom function, we can use the `std::min` provided by the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++. This function is optimized and tuned for performance.

2. Avoid unnecessary copying of arrays: The code currently copies the entire `dp` array to `tmp` in every iteration of the outer loop in the `solve` function. We can avoid this by using a single array and updating it in-place.

3. Use `std::vector` instead of static arrays: Static arrays in C++ have a fixed size which is determined at compile time. If your program needs a dynamic array whose size can change at runtime, you should use `std::vector`. Vectors are a part of the C++ STL and can provide significant speed improvements over static arrays. In this case, `dp` and `tmp` arrays can be replaced with vectors.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int n;
int t[10002];
vector<vector<int>> dp(5002, vector<int>(2, -1));

int solve() {
  dp[1][0] = dp[0][1] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      for (int pre = 0; pre < 2; pre++) {
        if (dp[j][pre] == -1)
          continue;
        for (int next = 0; next < 2; next++) {
          if (pre == next) {
            if (next == 0)
              dp[j + 1][next] = min(dp[j + 1][next], dp[j][pre]);
            else
              dp[j][next] = min(dp[j][next], dp[j][pre]);
          } else {
            if (next == 0)
              dp[j + 1][next] = min(dp[j + 1][next], dp[j][pre] + t[i - 1]);
            else
              dp[j][next] = min(dp[j][next], dp[j][pre] + t[i - 1]);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return min(dp[n / 2][0], dp[n / 2][1]);
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &t[i]);
  }
  printf("%d\n", solve());
}
```

This optimized version of the program reduces the memory usage by removing the unnecessary copying of arrays and could potentially run faster due to the use of `std::min` and `std::vector`.
