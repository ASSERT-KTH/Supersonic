The original program's performance can be improved by reducing the amount of computation and memory allocation. Here are the steps to optimize:

1. **Minimizing repeated calculations**: The statement `int s = i % 2, t = 1 - s;` is calculating the same values repeatedly. Instead, we can use a boolean flip variable to flip between 0 and 1.

2. **Removing redundant initializations**: The `dp` array is initialized twice with the same value `INF`. The second initialization of `dp[1][1][0]` and `dp[1][0][1]` to 0 is unnecessary because the following loop will update these values.

3. **Using faster I/O methods**: `scanf` and `printf` are faster than `cin` and `cout`, so we will use them instead.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int INF = 1000000000;
static int dp[2][5002][2];
int n, c;

int main() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j <= 5000; j++)
      dp[i][j][0] = dp[i][j][1] = INF;

  scanf("%d", &n);
  dp[1][0][0] = dp[1][0][1] = 0;
  bool flip = true;
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    flip = !flip;
    scanf("%d", &c);
    for (int j = 0; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      if (j == 0)
        dp[flip][j][0] = INF;
      else
        dp[flip][j][0] = min(dp[!flip][j - 1][0], dp[!flip][j - 1][1] + c);
      dp[flip][j][1] = min(dp[!flip][j][0] + c, dp[!flip][j][1]);
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", min(dp[flip][n / 2][0], dp[flip][n / 2][1]));
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program has the same functionality as the original, but it has fewer redundant calculations and memory assignments, which leads to increased performance.
