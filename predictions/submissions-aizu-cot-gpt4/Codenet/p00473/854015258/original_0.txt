Optimization Steps:

1. Initialization of dp array: Instead of using two nested loops to initialize the dp array, we can use memset to initialize all elements in dp array to INF. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(1).

2. Computation of dp array: Instead of using the modulo operation to get s and t, we can use bitwise AND operation. This operation is faster than modulo operation.

3. Removal of unnecessary condition in the computation of dp array: In the computation part, there is an unnecessary condition where j == 0. We can simplify this condition by separating the loop where j == 0 and j > 0.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 1000000000;
const int maxn = 5000 + 2;
int dp[2][maxn][2];

int main() {
  memset(dp, INF, sizeof(dp)); // Initialize all elements in dp to INF

  dp[1][1][0] = 0;
  dp[1][0][1] = 0;

  int n, c;
  scanf("%d", &n);

  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    int s = i & 1, t = s ^ 1; // Use bitwise AND and XOR operation instead of modulo operation
    scanf("%d", &c);

    // Separate the loop where j == 0 and j > 0
    dp[s][0][0] = INF;
    for (int j = 1; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      dp[s][j][0] = min(dp[t][j - 1][0], dp[t][j - 1][1] + c);
      dp[s][j][1] = min(dp[t][j][0] + c, dp[t][j][1]);
    }
  }

  printf("%d\n", min(dp[0][n / 2][0], dp[0][n / 2][1]));
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the optimized program still has the same logic as the original one. It just optimizes the initialization of the dp array and the computation of the dp array.
