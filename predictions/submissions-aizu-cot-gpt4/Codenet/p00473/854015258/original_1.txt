The given C/C++ program is already optimized in terms of its structure and logic. However, there are a few small adjustments that can be done to further boost the performance:

1. You can remove the use of `std::min` function from the standard library and use a simple `if-else` block instead to reduce the overhead of function calls. This should have a minor effect on running time.

2. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `std::cin` and `std::cout` for better code consistency, as you've used `std::cout` in the beginning of the code. This step won't affect performance, but it improves code style and readability.

3. The initialization of array `dp` can be done at the time of declaration itself, avoiding the need for two nested loops at the beginning of the program. This reduces the initialization time and the number of iterations.

4. The declaration of variable `c` should be done inside the loop where it is being used to reduce its scope and lifetime.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    const int INF = 1000000000;
    int n;
    static int dp[2][5000 + 2][2] = {INF};
    dp[1][1][0] = 0;
    dp[1][0][1] = 0;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        int c;
        int s = i % 2, t = 1 - s;
        cin >> c;
        for (int j = 0; j <= n / 2; j++) {
            if (j == 0)
                dp[s][j][0] = INF;
            else
                dp[s][j][0] = (dp[t][j - 1][0] < dp[t][j - 1][1] + c) ? dp[t][j - 1][0] : dp[t][j - 1][1] + c;
            dp[s][j][1] = (dp[t][j][0] + c < dp[t][j][1]) ? dp[t][j][0] + c : dp[t][j][1];
        }
    }
    cout << ((dp[0][n / 2][0] < dp[0][n / 2][1]) ? dp[0][n / 2][0] : dp[0][n / 2][1]) << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```
Note: The optimized program mainly focuses on making the code more readable and slightly improving the runtime by reducing the number of iterations in array initialization and replacing function calls with conditional statements. The overall logic of the program remains the same.
