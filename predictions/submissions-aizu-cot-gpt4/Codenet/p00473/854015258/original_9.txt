Optimization Steps:

1. The 3D array dp[2][5000 + 2][2] is taking up a large amount of memory. Since we only ever use 2 layers of this 3D array at any given time (current and previous), we can reduce it to a 2D array dp[5000 + 2][2]. This will greatly reduce the memory usage.

2. The loop that initializes the dp array can be parallelized to speed up the program. This is accomplished using OpenMP, a parallel programming library for C/C++. However, if the overhead of creating threads is more than the time saved by parallelization (which may be the case for small arrays), then parallelization may not be beneficial.

3. The use of scanf and printf for input and output is already optimized for speed. They are generally faster than cin and cout in C++.

4. It is better to calculate n/2 once and store the result in a variable instead of calculating it multiple times.

5. The use of min function can be optimized by calculating it once and storing the result in a variable instead of calling it twice.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <omp.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const int INF = 1000000000;
  int n, c;

  static int dp[5000 + 2][2];
  #pragma omp parallel for
  for (int j = 0; j < 5002; j++) {
    dp[j][0] = INF;
    dp[j][1] = INF;
  }
  dp[1][0] = 0;
  dp[0][1] = 0;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int half_n = n / 2;
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    int s = i % 2, t = 1 - s;
    scanf("%d", &c);
    for (int j = 0; j <= half_n; j++) {
      if (j == 0)
        dp[j][0] = INF;
      else
        dp[j][0] = min(dp[j - 1][t], dp[j - 1][1] + c);
      int min_val = min(dp[j][t] + c, dp[j][1]);
      dp[j][1] = min_val;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", min(dp[half_n][0], dp[half_n][1]));
}
```
Note: Please ensure that OpenMP is setup correctly in your development environment before running the optimized code. Also, you need to consider the overhead of creating threads which might not be efficient for small arrays. It's better to test the parallelized version against the serial version to see if it's beneficial in your specific case.
