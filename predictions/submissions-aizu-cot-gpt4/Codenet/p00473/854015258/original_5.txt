The given C++ program seems to be a dynamic programming solution to a problem. Here's how we can optimize the program:

1. Reducing the number of array accesses: The number of array accesses can significantly impact performance, especially in nested loops. In this code, dp[s][j][0] and dp[s][j][1] are accessed multiple times inside the inner loop. We can store these in temporary variables and use them instead.

2. Reducing the number of computations: The expressions dp[t][j - 1][0], dp[t][j - 1][1] + c, dp[t][j][0] + c, and dp[t][j][1] are computed more than once. We can compute these expressions once, store them in temporary variables, and use these variables instead.

3. Use std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false): This can provide significant speedup in some cases as it turns off synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams.

4. Use std::cin and std::cout instead of scanf and printf: They are faster when used with std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false).

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  const int INF = 1000000000;
  int n, c;
  static int dp[2][5002][2];
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 5002; j++) {
      dp[i][j][0] = INF;
      dp[i][j][1] = INF;
    }
  dp[1][1][0] = 0;
  dp[1][0][1] = 0;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    int s = i % 2, t = 1 - s;
    cin >> c;
    for (int j = 0; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      int t_j_0 = dp[t][j][0], t_j_1 = dp[t][j][1], t_jm1_0 = dp[t][j - 1][0], t_jm1_1 = dp[t][j - 1][1];
      if (j == 0)
        dp[s][j][0] = INF;
      else
        dp[s][j][0] = min(t_jm1_0, t_jm1_1 + c);
      int t_j_0_c = t_j_0 + c;
      dp[s][j][1] = min(t_j_0_c, t_j_1);
    }
  }
  cout << min(dp[0][n / 2][0], dp[0][n / 2][1]) << "\n";
}
```
Please note that although using cin and cout with std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false) can potentially speed up I/O in some cases, it might not be compatible with C-style I/O (scanf, printf, gets, puts, etc.) and mixing them can cause issues. In this code, we have replaced all C-style I/O with C++ style I/O to avoid such issues.
