The given C++ program is a dynamic programming problem. It is already optimized in terms of algorithmic complexity, but we can make a few adjustments to make it a bit more efficient.

1. Since we only use the last two layers of dp[i][j][k], we can reduce its dimension from 3 to 2. This can help decrease the memory usage.

2. Remove the unnecessary initialization of the dp array, since we only need to initialize dp[1][1][0] and dp[1][0][1].

3. For reading and writing integer values, we can use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf` for consistency.

4. Lastly for the loop that iterates through `j`, we can start from `1` instead of `0` since we are already initializing `dp[s][j][0]` to `INF` when `j` equals `0`.

Here is the optimized C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const int INF = 1000000000;
  int n, c;
  static int dp[5000 + 2][2];
  dp[1][0] = 0;
  dp[0][1] = 0;

  cin >> n;

  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    int s = i % 2, t = 1 - s;
    cin >> c;
    dp[0][0] = INF;
    for (int j = 1; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      dp[j][0] = min(dp[j - 1][0], dp[j - 1][1] + c);
      dp[j][1] = min(dp[j][0] + c, dp[j][1]);
    }
  }

  cout << min(dp[n / 2][0], dp[n / 2][1]) << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```
Note that in this optimized version, `dp[j][0]` is equivalent to `dp[s][j][0]` in the original version, and `dp[j][1]` is equivalent to `dp[s][j][1]` in the original version.
