The main optimization that can be made to this code is the elimination of redundant operations and reducing the size of the dp array.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. The dp array is initialized with the value of INF. However, we only need to initialize the dp[1][j][0] and dp[1][j][1] for j in the range [0, n/2], because only these positions are used in the code. So, we can reduce the initialization part to a single loop.

2. In the main loop, we calculate the same value twice for dp[s][j][0] when j == 0 and j != 0. We can calculate it once outside of the loop and then only calculate it for j != 0 inside the loop.

3. The size of the dp array can be reduced from 5000 + 2 to n / 2 + 1, as it is the maximum index that is accessed in the code.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  const int INF = 1000000000;
  int n, c;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  static int dp[2][n / 2 + 1][2];
  for (int j = 0; j <= n / 2; j++) {
    dp[1][j][0] = INF;
    dp[1][j][1] = INF;
  }
  dp[1][1][0] = 0;
  dp[1][0][1] = 0;
  
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    int s = i % 2, t = 1 - s;
    scanf("%d", &c);
    dp[s][0][0] = INF;
    for (int j = 1; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      dp[s][j][0] = min(dp[t][j - 1][0], dp[t][j - 1][1] + c);
      dp[s][j][1] = min(dp[t][j][0] + c, dp[t][j][1]);
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", min(dp[0][n / 2][0], dp[0][n / 2][1]));
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that scanf and printf are used instead of cin and cout for faster IO, which can significantly improve the runtime for large inputs.
