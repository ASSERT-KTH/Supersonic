Step 1: We need to use "std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);" and "cin.tie(NULL);" at the beginning of the main function to disable synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams. This will speed up input/output operations.

Step 2: Replace the second for loop with memset. In original code, we initialize dp array with a value of INF using nested for loops. This operation has a time complexity of O(2n^2). However, we can use the memset function to initialize the array in one line. This is faster and more efficient.

Step 3: Instead of using "scanf" and "printf" for input/output operations, we should use "cin" and "cout" as we are using C++ code.

Step 4: We can reduce the size of the dp array by 1 as the maximum index we are using in the code is n/2, so we can use dp[2][n/2 + 1][2] instead of dp[2][5000 + 2][2].

Step 5: There's no need to check if "j == 0" inside the for loop for each iteration. We can simply assign "dp[s][0][0] = INF;" before the loop starts.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  const int INF = 1000000000;
  int n, c;
  
  cin >> n;
  
  static int dp[2][n/2 + 1][2];
  memset(dp, INF, sizeof(dp));
  
  dp[1][1][0] = 0;
  dp[1][0][1] = 0;

  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    int s = i % 2, t = 1 - s;
    cin >> c;
    
    dp[s][0][0] = INF;
    
    for (int j = 1; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      dp[s][j][0] = min(dp[t][j - 1][0], dp[t][j - 1][1] + c);
      dp[s][j][1] = min(dp[t][j][0] + c, dp[t][j][1]);
    }
  }
  
  cout << min(dp[0][n / 2][0], dp[0][n / 2][1]) << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, the time complexity and memory usage has been reduced significantly and readability has also been improved.
