The given program seems to be complex due to its variable names and structure. The program performs string manipulations and calculations in different functions and in the main function as well. Here are some optimization steps you can apply:

1. Avoiding Global Variables: Global variables make the program hard to understand. You can replace them with local variables or pass them as function parameters.
2. Simplifying Functions: Functions like hyouka, hin, hout, init, getlr, gets, match are a bit complex. Try to simplify them or divide them into smaller functions if possible. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Using Descriptive Variable Names: Variables like a, b, i, j, l, r, m, n, s, q are not descriptive. You can use names which represent the purpose of the variables.
4. Reducing Nested Loops: The function init and gets have nested loops. You can try to reduce them if possible.
5. Avoiding Redundant Calculations: In the main function, getlr is called twice with the same parameters. You can call it once and store the result in a variable.

Please note that the given program is already quite optimized in terms of running time and memory usage. However, it is quite hard to understand due to its complexity. The aforementioned steps will make the program more readable and maintainable rather than optimizing its performance.

Let's apply these steps to the code:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
long long calculate_mod(char *str, long long a, long long M, long long* d, long long* k) {
  long long result = 0;
  k[0] = 1;
  for (int j = d[0] = 0; str[j]; j++) {
    d[j + 1] = (d[j] * a + (str[j] - 'a' + 1)) % M;
    k[j + 1] = (k[j] * a) % M;
    result = (result * a + (str[j] - 'a' + 1)) % M;
  }
  return result;
}
int main() {
  int distinct_strings = 0, m, l = 0, r = 1;
  char s[300010], q[5];
  long long a[2] = {101, 103};
  long long M[2] = {1e9 + 7, 1e9 + 9};
  long long d[2][300010], k[2][300010];
  scanf("%*d %d %s", &m, s);
  long long h[2] = {calculate_mod(s, a[0], M[0], d[0], k[0]), calculate_mod(s, a[1], M[1], d[1], k[1])};
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    scanf("%s", q);
    if (q[0] == 'L')
      l += q[1] - '-' ? 1 : -1;
    else
      r += q[1] - '-' ? 1 : -1;
    long long h1 = (M[0] * M[0] + d[0][r] - d[0][l] * k[0][r - l]) % M[0];
    long long h2 = (M[1] * M[1] + d[1][r] - d[1][l] * k[1][r - l]) % M[1];
    distinct_strings += (h1 != h[0] || h2 != h[1]);
  }
  printf("%d\n", distinct_strings);
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program is more readable and maintainable. It avoids global variables, uses clear variable names, and reduces redundant calculations. However, as mentioned, the optimization is more about code quality than performance.
