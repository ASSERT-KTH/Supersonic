The provided code is a hexagonal grid-based search algorithm. The code's performance can be improved by minimizing the number of computations inside the while loop, which is the most computation-intensive part of the code. We can accomplish this by precomputing the "ny" values and storing them in an array, thus avoiding the need to calculate them repeatedly.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Pre-compute the "ny" values for all possible "cy" and "dy[i]" and store them in a 2D array. This will make the lookup of "ny" a constant-time operation, which will significantly speed up the program if "m_t" is large.
2. Also, instead of using a pair of pairs in the queue, we can use a struct, which will improve the code's readability and potentially its performance.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, b) for (int i = 0; i < b; i++)
#define m_t 60
#define max (3 * m_t * (m_t + 1) + 1)
#define zero (max / 2)
#define mp make_pair
int dx[6] = {0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 0};
int dy[6] = {1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1};
vector<int> field(max);
int precompute[m_t*2 + 1][6]; //Precompute array
int t, n;
int cnt;

//Define a struct for queue
struct node {
    int x, y;
    int t;
};

int main() {
  //Precompute the ny values
  for (int i = 0; i < m_t*2 + 1; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 6; j++) {
      precompute[i][j] = (i + dy[j]) * (m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(i + dy[j])) / 2;
    }
  }

  while (cin >> t >> n, t) {
    fill(field.begin(), field.end(), 1);
    int x, y;
    rep(i, n) {
      cin >> x >> y;
      y = precompute[y][0]; //Use precomputed value
      field[zero + x + y] = 0;
    }
    int sx, sy;
    cin >> sx >> sy;
    x = sx;
    y = precompute[sy][0]; //Use precomputed value
    field[zero + x + y] = 0;
    int ans = 0;
    queue<node> rt;
    rt.push({sx, sy, 0});
    while (!rt.empty()) {
      ans++;
      node curr = rt.front();
      rt.pop();
      if (curr.t < t) {
        rep(i, 6) {
          int nx = curr.x + dx[i];
          int ny = precompute[curr.y][i]; //Use precomputed value
          if (field[zero + nx + ny]) {
            field[zero + nx + ny] = 0;
            rt.push({nx, curr.y + dy[i], curr.t + 1});
          }
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}

```
By doing this, the algorithm's efficiency is improved because it avoids calculating the same values over and over again.
