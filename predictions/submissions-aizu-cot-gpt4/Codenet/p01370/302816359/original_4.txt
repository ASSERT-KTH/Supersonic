The provided code is a C++ program that appears to perform a breadth-first search on a hexagonal grid. It reads inputs denoting obstacles and performs the search to find a path to a destination. The optimization of this code can be focused on improving how the code handles memory and attempts to reduce unnecessary computations.

Step 1: Reduce unnecessary vector initialization.
In this case, the field vector is being filled with ones every time the while loop runs. This is an unnecessary operation if the vector is reset appropriately after each loop.

Step 2: Remove redundant calculations.
There are several instances where the same calculation is performed multiple times. For example, calculating the y coordinate is done in the same way at multiple places. This can be moved to a function to avoid duplicating the calculation.

Step 3: Reduce size of queue elements.
Instead of storing pairs of pairs in the queue, we can store the computed index and the time directly in the queue. This reduces memory usage and simplifies the code.

The optimized code after applying the above steps is as follows:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, b) for (int i = 0; i < b; i++)
#define m_t 60
#define max (3 * m_t * (m_t + 1) + 1)
#define zero (max / 2)
int dx[6] = {0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 0};
int dy[6] = {1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1};
vector<int> field(max);
int t, n;

int calculateY(int y) {
    return y * (m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(y)) / 2;
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> t >> n, t) {
    fill(field.begin(), field.end(), 1);
    int x, y;
    rep(i, n) {
      cin >> x >> y;
      y = calculateY(y);
      field[zero + x + y] = 0;
    }
    int sx, sy;
    cin >> sx >> sy;
    x = sx;
    y = calculateY(sy);
    field[zero + x + y] = 0;
    int ans = 0;
    queue<pair<int, int>> rt;
    rt.push({zero + x + y, 0});
    while (!rt.empty()) {
      ans++;
      int c = rt.front().first;
      int ct = rt.front().second;
      rt.pop();
      if (ct < t) {
        rep(i, 6) {
          int nx = c + dx[i];
          int ny = calculateY(c + dy[i]);
          if (field[zero + nx + ny]) {
            field[zero + nx + ny] = 0;
            rt.push({zero + nx + ny, ct + 1});
          }
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

Please, note that if your inputs and outputs are large, you might want to use faster I/O methods (like scanf/printf instead of cin/cout) for better performance.
