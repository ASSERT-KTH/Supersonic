Looking at your code, there are a few things we can optimize.

1. Repeated Calculations: The expression `(m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(cy + dy[i])) / 2` is calculated twice in the main loop. We can calculate it once and store the result in a variable to avoid redundant calculations, thereby improving the runtime.

2. Excessive Memory Usage: The `field` vector is declared with a maximum size of `max`. However, it should be noted that the actual size used during the program execution can be much smaller. A better approach would be to use a `std::unordered_map`, which only uses memory for elements that are actually inserted.

3. Optimizing I/O operations: The I/O operations `cin` and `cout` are slower than `scanf` and `printf`. Therefore, we can replace them with `scanf` and `printf`.

Here's the optimized version of your code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, b) for (int i = 0; i < b; i++)
#define m_t 60
#define max (3 * m_t * (m_t + 1) + 1)
#define zero (max / 2)
#define mp make_pair
int dx[6] = {0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 0};
int dy[6] = {1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1};
unordered_map<int, int> field;
int t, n;
int cnt;
int main() {
  while (scanf("%d %d", &t, &n), t) {
    field.clear();
    int x, y;
    rep(i, n) {
      scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
      y = y * (m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(y)) / 2;
      field[zero + x + y] = 0;
    }
    int sx, sy;
    scanf("%d %d", &sx, &sy);
    x = sx;
    y = sy * (m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(sy)) / 2;
    field[zero + x + y] = 0;
    int ans = 0;
    queue<pair<pair<int, int>, int>> rt;
    rt.push(mp(mp(sx, sy), 0));
    while (!rt.empty()) {
      ans++;
      int cx = rt.front().first.first;
      int cy = rt.front().first.second;
      int ct = rt.front().second;
      rt.pop();
      if (ct < t) {
        rep(i, 6) {
          int nx = cx + dx[i];
          int ny = (cy + dy[i]) * (m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(cy + dy[i])) / 2;
          if (field[zero + nx + ny]) {
            field[zero + nx + ny] = 0;
            rt.push(mp(mp(nx, cy + dy[i]), ct + 1));
          }
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
  }
}
```

In this optimized code, we have avoided repeated calculations and reduced memory usage by using `unordered_map` instead of `vector`. We have also replaced `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for faster I/O operations.
