This program seems to perform some sort of breadth-first search (BFS) on a grid. The optimization can be done in a few steps:

1. **Avoiding repeated computations**: The program repeatedly calculates `ny` within the BFS loop. The value of `ny` depends only on `cy` and `dy[i]`, so it's only necessary to compute it once for each `i`. This can be done by moving the computation outside the inner loop.

2. **Reducing function calls**: The program uses the `push` and `pop` functions of `queue` in every iteration of the BFS loop. Instead of calling `push` and `pop` separately, we can use `emplace` which constructs and inserts an element in one call. This can slightly improve performance.

3. **Avoiding unnecessary operations**: The `fill` function is used to initialize the `field` vector before the BFS. However, the program also manually sets certain elements of `field` to 0 before the BFS. This can be optimized by initializing the `field` vector with zeros instead of ones, and then setting only the necessary elements to 1. This avoids the need to use `fill`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, b) for (int i = 0; i < b; i++)
#define m_t 60
#define max (3 * m_t * (m_t + 1) + 1)
#define zero (max / 2)
#define mp make_pair
int dx[6] = {0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 0};
int dy[6] = {1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1};
vector<int> field(max, 0); // Initialize with zeros
int t, n;
int main() {
  while (cin >> t >> n, t) {
    int x, y;
    rep(i, n) {
      cin >> x >> y;
      y = y * (m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(y)) / 2;
      field[zero + x + y] = 1; // Set necessary elements to 1
    }
    int sx, sy;
    cin >> sx >> sy;
    x = sx;
    y = sy * (m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(sy)) / 2;
    field[zero + x + y] = 1;
    int ans = 0;
    queue<pair<pair<int, int>, int>> rt;
    rt.emplace(mp(sx, sy), 0);
    while (!rt.empty()) {
      ans++;
      int cx = rt.front().first.first;
      int cy = rt.front().first.second;
      int ct = rt.front().second;
      rt.pop();
      if (ct < t) {
        rep(i, 6) {
          int nx = cx + dx[i];
          int ny = (cy + dy[i]) * (m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(cy + dy[i])) / 2;
          if (field[zero + nx + ny]) {
            field[zero + nx + ny] = 1;
            rt.emplace(mp(nx, cy + dy[i]), ct + 1);
          }
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
    field.assign(max, 0); // Reset the field for the next test case
  }
}
```
These optimizations should make the program run slightly faster and use less memory. However, the overall complexity of the program remains the same.
