There are a few optimizations that can be done on this program. Here they are explained step by step:

1. Remove the usage of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file includes almost all the standard libraries which can slow down the compile time. Instead, include only the libraries that are being used in the program.

2. The usage of `rep(i, n)` macro can be replaced with the simple for loop `for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)` as the macro increases the complexity and isn't necessary here.

3. The usage of `set<int> height[V]` can be replaced with `vector<set<int>> height(V)` to avoid allocating memory for maximum size initially. This will save memory.

4. `priority_queue<pi> que` can be replaced with `priority_queue<pi, vector<pi>, greater<pi>> que` to avoid sorting in descending order and then popping the top element which is an expensive operation.

5. Instead of using `map<pi, int> v2id`, we can use `unordered_map<pi, int, pair_hash> v2id`, where `pair_hash` is a custom hash function for pair. This is because unordered_map has a better average case time complexity compared to map.

6. `ll ans = d[goal]` can be moved inside the if condition since it is only used there. This will avoid unnecessary assignment.

Here is the optimized version of the program reflecting these modifications:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <set>
#include <utility>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
using pi = pair<int, int>;
using P = pair<ll, int>;

struct edge {
  int to;
  ll cost;
};

struct pair_hash {
    template <class T1, class T2>
    std::size_t operator () (const std::pair<T1, T2> &p) const {
        auto h1 = std::hash<T1>{}(p.first);
        auto h2 = std::hash<T2>{}(p.second);
        return h1 ^ h2;  
    }
};

const int V = 100000;
const int VV = 1000000;
const ll INF = LLONG_MAX / 3;
vector<edge> G[V], gg[VV];
vector<set<int>> height(V);
int n, m;
ll X;
int H[V];
unordered_map<pi, int, pair_hash> v2id;
int max_h[V] = {};
ll d[VV];

int main() {
  // ...
  priority_queue<pi, vector<pi>, greater<pi>> que;
  // ...
  unordered_map<pi, int, pair_hash> v2id;
  // ...
  for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
  if (ans != INF)
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The `// ...` comments are placeholders for the rest of the code which remains unchanged.
