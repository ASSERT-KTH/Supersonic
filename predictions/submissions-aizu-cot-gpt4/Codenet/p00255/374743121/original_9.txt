The given C/C++ program has a few areas where it can be optimized:

1. The program is using a dynamically allocated array `j` of size 99999 which is not a good practice if we don't know the maximum size we will need in advance. Instead of this, we can use a vector which will dynamically grow and shrink based on the number of elements.

2. The sort function is being called in each outer loop iteration, which is unnecessary as the array is not being modified in the loop. We can sort the vector only once after taking all the inputs.

3. The variable `s` is being updated in each iteration, but it's not being used anywhere until the last loop. Therefore, we can move its computation to the last loop where it's actually being used.

4. The variable `a` is not initialized. We should initialize `a` to a value that cannot be a maximum (ex: negative infinity).

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    long long n;
    while (true) {
        cin >> n;
        if (n == 0)
            break;

        vector<long long> j(n);
        long long s = 0, a = -1e18, t;
        for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> t;
            s += t;
            j[i] = t;
        }
        sort(j.begin(), j.end());

        for (long long i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            a = max(a, (i + 1) * s);
            s -= j[i];
        }
        cout << a << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, I have also added `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` at the start of the main function. These lines make the input/output operations faster, which can be beneficial when dealing with large amounts of data. Please note that these lines should only be used when cin/cout and scanf/printf need not be used together.

Also, `int main()` is used instead of `main()`. This is a more standard way to define the main function, and it returns 0 to indicate that the program has ended successfully.
