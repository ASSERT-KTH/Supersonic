Optimization Steps:

1. Using the STL `std::vector` instead of C arrays: The size of this program's arrays is defined at compile time, which may lead to unnecessary memory usage if `n` is significantly smaller than the size of the arrays. By using `std::vector`, we can dynamically allocate memory according to the user's input `n`, which can save memory. This change doesn't affect the time complexity of the program.

2. Removing redundant variables: The variable `use` is unnecessary because it is used to check if an element is used or not. This can be achieved by comparing `p[id].fs` with `b[i].fs` directly. This would save space, as we don't need an extra boolean array.

3. Avoiding the use of `std::make_pair`: Instead of using `std::make_pair` to create pairs, we can directly assign values to the pair. This doesn't affect the time complexity, but makes the code cleaner.

4. Using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This can speed up I/O operations, which can be useful when dealing with large inputs.

5. Removing macros: Macros like `fs` and `sc` may make the code harder to read and understand. It's better to use `.first` and `.second` directly.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<pair<ll, int>> p(n), b(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> p[i].first >> b[i].first;
    p[i].second = i;
    b[i].second = i;
  }
  sort(p.begin(), p.end());
  sort(b.begin(), b.end());
  int ans = 0;
  ll sum = 0;
  int id = 0, num = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (p[b[i].second].first == b[i].first) {
      sum += p[b[i].second].first;
      num++;
    }
    while (id < n && p[id].first <= b[i].first) {
      sum += p[id].first;
      num++;
      id++;
    }
    while (id < n && sum + p[id].first <= (num + 1) * b[i].first) {
      sum += p[id].first;
      num++;
      id++;
    }
    if (sum <= num * b[i].first)
      ans = max(ans, num);
    sum -= p[b[i].second].first;
    num--;
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}
```
Notice: The original program may have a logical bug, as it checks `use[b[i].sc]` but never sets `use[b[i].sc]` to true. This bug is not addressed in the optimized code, as the request was to optimize the code without rewriting it completely.
