The given C/C++ program is a numerical optimization problem to find the minimum gap in a given range from 0 to d inclusive. The time-consuming part of this program is the nested loop, which has a time complexity of O(n^2). This can be reduced to O(n) by eliminating the inner loop.

The inner loop is iterating from `i` to `d` to find `j` such that `i+j == d`. This computation can be simplified to `j = d - i`, so we don't need to iterate over j.

We performed the following optimizations:

1. Eliminate the nested loop by calculating j as `d - i`.
2. Remove the `if (i + j == d)` condition because it will always be true due to the nature of j's calculation.
3. The `min` variable is renamed to `min_gap` to avoid confusion with the `min` function.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int d, e;
  while (1) {
    cin >> d >> e;
    if (d == 0 && e == 0)
      break;
      
    double min_gap = 100000.0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= d; i++) {
      int j = d - i;
      double cost = sqrt(i * i + j * j);
      double gap = sqrt((cost - e) * (cost - e));
      if (gap < min_gap) {
        min_gap = gap;
      }
    }
    cout << min_gap << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: 

This optimization doesn't take into account the mathematical nuances of the problem, it's purely from a coding point of view. Depending on the intended mathematical behavior of the program, further optimizations might be possible.
