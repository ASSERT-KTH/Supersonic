The given program is inefficient because there is a nested loop that performs redundant computations. The inner loop starts from `i` and checks if `i+j` is equal to `d`. However, since the outer loop already goes from 0 to `d`, we can eliminate the inner loop and directly calculate `j` from `d` and `i`.

Optimization step by step:

1. Eliminate the inner loop and calculate `j` from `d` and `i`.
2. Since we are always comparing the gap with `min` for less than operation, there is no need to calculate the square root of the gap. Instead we could just compare the square of gap with the square of `min`. This will save time as square root operation is costly.
3. Remove the unnecessary `map`, `string`, and `vector` includes as they are not being used in the code.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int d, e;
  while (1) {
    cin >> d >> e;
    double min = 100000 * 100000; // min is now the square of minimum gap
    if (d == 0 && e == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i <= d; i++) {
      int j = d - i;
      double costSquare = i * i + j * j;
      double gapSquare = (costSquare - e * e) * (costSquare - e * e);
      if (gapSquare < min) {
        min = gapSquare;
      }
    }
    cout << sqrt(min) << endl; // Take square root here when printing
  }
  return 0;
}
```
