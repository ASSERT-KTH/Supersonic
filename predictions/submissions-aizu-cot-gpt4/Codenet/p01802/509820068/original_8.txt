The given program can be optimized in the following ways:
1. The inner loop in the program is redundant and can be removed. The condition `i + j == d` is always true when `j = d - i`, so we don't need an extra loop to iterate over `j`. This reduces the time complexity of the program from O(n^2) to O(n).

2. The `min` variable is reset to a large value at the start of each iteration of the outer loop. It would be more efficient to reset it just before the inner loop begins.

3. Instead of recalculating `cost - e` twice, we can store the result in a variable and use it in the next line. This will save computation time.

4. We can avoid the use of `sqrt` function two times which is computationally expensive by comparing the squares directly.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int d, e;
  while (1) {
    cin >> d >> e;
    if (d == 0 && e == 0)
      break;
      
    double min = 1e9;
    for (int i = 0; i <= d; i++) {
      int j = d - i;
      double cost_squared = i * i + j * j;
      double gap_squared = cost_squared - e * e;
      if (gap_squared < min) {
          min = gap_squared;
      }
    }
    cout << sqrt(min) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program significantly reduces the time and computation complexity of the original program.
