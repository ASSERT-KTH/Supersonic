This program aims to minimize the gap between a desired cost (`e`) and a calculated cost based on the sum of two factors (`i` and `j`) that equals a given distance (`d`). 

To optimize this program, we can consider the following steps:

1. The inner loop `for (int j = i; j <= d; j++)` can start from `d - i` because `i + j` must be equal to `d`. This way, we avoid unnecessary iterations starting from `i`. 

2. The `if (i + j == d)` condition inside the inner loop is always true due to the optimized loop. So, we can remove this condition.

3. Instead of using `sqrt((cost - e) * (cost - e))` to calculate the gap, we can use `fabs(cost - e)`. `fabs` computes the absolute value of a floating-point number, which saves us from performing an unnecessary multiplication and square root operation.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <limits>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int d, e;
  while (1) {
    cin >> d >> e;
    double min = numeric_limits<double>::max();
    if (d == 0 && e == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i <= d; i++) {
      int j = d - i;
      double cost = sqrt(i * i + j * j);
      double gap = fabs(cost - e);
      if (gap < min) {
        min = gap;
      }
    }
    cout << min << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized version of this program should run faster and consume less memory than the original version, while still producing the same output.
