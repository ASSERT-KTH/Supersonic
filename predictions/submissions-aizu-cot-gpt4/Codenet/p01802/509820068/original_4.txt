Optimization Steps:

1. Instead of scanning all the pairs of i and j (i.e., O(n^2)), we can use the fact that `i + j == d`. Hence, for a given `i`, `j` can be directly computed as `d - i`. This reduces the loop from O(n^2) to O(n).
2. The conditional check `if (i + j == d)` is unnecessary since `j` is computed based on `d` and `i`.
3. Calculation `sqrt(i * i + j * j)` is done twice. We can calculate it once and use it in both places.
4. We can switch from `std::endl` to `'\n'`. `std::endl` causes a flush of the output buffer, which can be expensive. If we want to print a newline, we can just use `'\n'` which doesn't flush the buffer.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int d, e;
  while (1) {
    cin >> d >> e;
    if (d == 0 && e == 0)
      break;

    double min = 100000;
    for (int i = 0; i <= d; i++) {
      int j = d - i;
      double cost = sqrt(i * i + j * j);
      double gap = sqrt((cost - e) * (cost - e));
      if (gap < min) {
        min = gap;
      }
    }
    cout << min << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
