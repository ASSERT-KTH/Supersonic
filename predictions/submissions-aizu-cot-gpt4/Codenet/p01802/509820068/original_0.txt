Step 1: Remove the second loop
The second loop is redundant. The condition `if (i + j == d)` inside the second loop can be replaced by calculating `j` directly as `d - i`. 

Step 2: Change the min calculation process
Instead of calculating the `cost` and `gap` every time, we can first calculate the `cost` and then update the `min` only if the `cost` is less than `min`.

Step 3: Use `std::min` function
We can use the `std::min` function provided by the C++ standard library for the calculation of minimum. It is generally more optimized and cleaner.

Step 4: Use `std::abs` instead of `sqrt`
The `gap` calculation is actually finding the absolute value of `cost - e`. We can use `std::abs` function instead of `sqrt` to reduce the computation time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int d, e;
  while (1) {
    cin >> d >> e;
    if (d == 0 && e == 0) break;

    double min = 1e6;
    for (int i = 0; i <= d; i++) {
      int j = d - i;
      double cost = sqrt(i * i + j * j);
      min = std::min(min, std::abs(cost - e));
    }
    cout << min << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this optimization is based on the assumption that the values of `d` and `e` are not extremely large. If `d` is very large, the loop could still take a long time. In this case, you might need to find a mathematical solution or a different algorithm to solve the problem.
