The original program is trying to find the minimum gap between the number 'e' and the sum of squares of two numbers 'i' and 'j', whose sum is 'd'. To optimize this program we can take the following steps:

1. We don't need to use map, string, and vector headers. They are not used in this program.
2. We can reduce the inner loop by half. Since 'i' and 'j' are both non-negative integers and their sum is 'd', we don't need to check for 'j' from 'i' to 'd'. We can start 'j' from 'd' minus 'i'.
3. We don't need to check 'i + j == d', because 'j' is already calculated as 'd - i'.
4. We can calculate 'cost' and 'gap' outside the if statement, it will not affect the result but will reduce the number of calculations.
5. We can remove the sqrt function in the gap calculation. We actually want to minimize the square of the gap. Removing the sqrt function will not change the relative order of the gaps and can reduce computation.

Here is the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int d, e;
  while (1) {
    cin >> d >> e;
    double min = 1e12;
    if (d == 0 && e == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i <= d; i++) {
      int j = d - i;
      double cost = i * i + j * j;
      double gap = (cost - e * e);
      if (gap < min) {
        min = gap;
      }
    }
    cout << sqrt(min) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
