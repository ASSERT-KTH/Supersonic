The above C/C++ program is already quite optimized in terms of memory and running time. It only uses 6 integer variables and calculates the result in a single line. This calculation includes basic arithmetic operations and finding the minimum and maximum values, which are all done in constant time. The running time of this program is O(1), which is the best time complexity possible, and the memory usage is also minimal.

However, there is a small optimization that can be done. We can avoid using the "bits/stdc++.h" header file, which includes a lot of functionality not needed in this program. This will reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

Instead, we can include only the necessary header files: iostream (which allows us to use cin and cout) and algorithm (which provides the min and max functions).

The optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b, c, d, e, f;
  cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e >> f;
  int ans = a + b + c + d - min(min(a, b), min(c, d)) + max(e, f);
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This is a small optimization but nevertheless, it helps to reduce unnecessary overhead.
