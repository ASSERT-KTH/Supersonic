The given C/C++ code is quite optimized already. It reads six integers from the input, computes the sum of the first four integers minus the minimum of them, adds the maximum of the last two integers, and prints the result.

However, there are a few minor points that could be optimized:

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a header file used in GCC, which includes practically every standard library. This can slow down the compilation time, so it's better to include only the header files that are needed.

2. The variables `a, b, c, d, e, f` are all declared at the beginning of `main()`. They could be declared when they are first used to possibly save some memory.

3. The `min` and `max` functions each take two arguments. The `min` function is called twice and then the results are compared again with `min`. This can be optimized by using a single call to `min` and `max` with an initializer list in C++.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b, c, d;
  cin >> a >> b >> c >> d;
  int e, f;
  cin >> e >> f;
  int ans = a + b + c + d - min({a, b, c, d}) + max(e, f);
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, only the necessary header files are included. The variables are declared when they are first used. The `min` function is called once with an initializer list to find the minimum of `a, b, c, d`. This reduces the number of function calls and may improve the running time.
