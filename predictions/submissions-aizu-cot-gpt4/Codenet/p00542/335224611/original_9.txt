The given C/C++ program is fairly optimal. However, there are some minor changes that can be applied to slightly optimize the program.

1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is quite heavy as it includes a lot of unnecessary header files, which can increase the compilation time. So, it's better to include only those header files which are being used in the program. 

2. Use `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`: These two lines can optimize the input/output operations in C++. `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` unties C++ and C streams. `cin.tie(NULL)` unties `cin` and `cout`. By default, every `cout` operation is followed by a `cin` operation to ensure a correct order of input and output. If you are sure that every output operation is followed by an input operation, you can use these two lines to optimize input/output operations. 

3. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio` and `std::cin.tie` instead of `using namespace std`: Avoiding `using namespace std` can prevent naming conflicts.

4. There is no need to separately calculate the maximum and minimum. You can simply calculate the sum of all numbers and subtract the minimum and add the maximum. This way you do not need to call the min function twice.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  int a, b, c, d, e, f;
  std::cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e >> f;
  int minimum = std::min(std::min(a, b), std::min(c, d));
  int maximum = std::max(e, f);
  int ans = a + b + c + d + e + f - minimum + maximum;
  std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This program should have slightly faster input/output operations and compile faster due to the removal of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. The logic of the program remains the same and there should be no noticeable difference in the runtime of the program.
