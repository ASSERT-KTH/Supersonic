Your code is quite efficient in terms of time complexity. It runs in O(1), constant time. But here are some minor optimizations:

Step 1: Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because it includes a lot of unnecessary headers which increases compilation time. Instead, include only those headers which are required. In your case, we need `iostream` and `algorithm`.

Step 2: Instead of using `std::min` two times, you can use `std::min({a, b, c, d})` to get the minimum value from a, b, c, and d in one go. This makes your code more concise and doesn't affect the performance.

Step 3: Avoid using `std::endl` because it does a flush operation which is slower. You can use "\n" instead.

Step 4: `using namespace std;` is generally considered bad practice. It's better to use the `std::` prefix before the standard library functions.

Here is the optimized code incorporating those changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int a, b, c, d, e, f;
  std::cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e >> f;
  int ans = a + b + c + d - std::min({a, b, c, d}) + std::max(e, f);
  std::cout << ans << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
