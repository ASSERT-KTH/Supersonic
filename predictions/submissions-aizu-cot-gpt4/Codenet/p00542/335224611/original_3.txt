Step 1: Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes too many unnecessary headers, which increases the compilation time. Instead, include only necessary headers: `#include <iostream>` for cin, cout and `#include <algorithm>` for min() and max() functions.

Step 2: Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to make the input and output more efficient. This will decouple C++ standard streams from their C counterparts, and potentially improve I/O efficiency.

Step 3: Instead of calculating the minimum and maximum values twice, store them in variables and use those variables. This will save some CPU cycles because the minimum and maximum calculations are only done once.

Step 4: Declare variables `a, b, c, d, e, f` at the time of their first use to save memory.

The optimized program will look like:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int a, b, c, d, e, f;
  std::cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e >> f;
  
  int min_val = std::min(std::min(a, b), std::min(c, d));
  int max_val = std::max(e, f);
  
  int ans = a + b + c + d - min_val + max_val;
  
  std::cout << ans << '\n';
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program will have less compilation time, more efficient I/O, and will save some CPU cycles.
