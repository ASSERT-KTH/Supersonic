This program does a simple calculation: it adds four integers, subtracts the smallest of them and then adds the maximum between two other integers. Here are the few steps I took to optimize it:

1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of other header files and increases the compilation time. We are only using a few functionalities here, so it is best to include only those header files that we need.

2. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(NULL);`: These two lines improve the I/O performance.

3. Minimize the number of times `min` and `max` functions are called: We are calling `min` function twice and `max` function once. We can reduce this by storing the results in variables.

4. Remove unnecessary variables: The variable `ans` is not needed and we can directly output the result.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(NULL);
  int a, b, c, d, e, f;
  cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e >> f;
  int min_abcd = min(min(a, b), min(c, d));
  int max_ef = max(e, f);
  cout << a + b + c + d - min_abcd + max_ef << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

This code does the same job as the original one but is optimized for better performance.
