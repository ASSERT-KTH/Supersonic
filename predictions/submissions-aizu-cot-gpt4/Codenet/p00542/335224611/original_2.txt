The given C++ program is quite efficient, but here are some minor optimizations that can be done:

1. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: This header file includes lots of unnecessary stuff which increases the compilation time. Instead, just include the necessary headers. In this case, we only need `iostream` and `algorithm`.

2. `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This line allows you to speed up the input/output operations by decoupling C and C++ standard streams. But if you use it, don't mix C-stdio with C++-iostream.

3. `cin.tie(NULL)`: This line unties cin from cout, meaning that cout does not flush every time we input something with cin, which can speed up input/output operations.

4. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`: `endl` causes a flush operation, which can be time-consuming. The `'\n'` character does not cause a flush operation.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int a, b, c, d, e, f;
  cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e >> f;
  
  int ans = a + b + c + d - min(min(a, b), min(c, d)) + max(e, f);
  
  cout << ans << '\n';
  
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations may not lead to a noticeable runtime difference for this specific program, but they are good practices for larger programs with more complex operations and larger inputs.
