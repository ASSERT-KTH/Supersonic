This C++ program is fairly optimal as it is. There is little room for optimizing the running time or memory usage significantly. However, there are a few minor improvements that can be made:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: Although this header file includes most of the standard library headers in C++, it is not a standard header and it slows down the compilation time. Instead, you should include only the headers that are used in your code.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std`: This line can potentially cause name clashes if your program grows bigger. It's better to use `std::` prefix where necessary.

3. Variables declaration and initialization: You can declare and initialize the int variables a, b, c, d, e, f at the same time.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int a, b, c, d, e, f;
  std::cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e >> f;
  int ans = a + b + c + d - std::min(std::min(a, b), std::min(c, d)) + std::max(e, f);
  std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations are quite minimal and won't have a significant impact on the performance of your program, but they will make your code cleaner and easier to maintain.
