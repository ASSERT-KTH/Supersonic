The provided C++ program is already quite optimized, but there are some minor adjustments we can make.

1. Rather than using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, we can include only the necessary headers. This is because `bits/stdc++.h` includes a very large number of headers, which increases the compilation time. In this case, we only need `iostream` and `algorithm`.

2. The `std::min` and `std::max` functions are called twice, which is unnecessary. We can instead store the results in variables for reuse.

3. The `std::endl` not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output buffer. If you don't need to flush the buffer and just want to add a newline, you can use `'\n'` instead. This can make a difference in programs with a lot of output.

Here is the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int a, b, c, d, e, f;
  std::cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e >> f;

  int smallest_ab = std::min(a, b);
  int smallest_cd = std::min(c, d);
  int largest_ef = std::max(e, f);

  int ans = a + b + c + d - std::min(smallest_ab, smallest_cd) + largest_ef;

  std::cout << ans << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

Remember that while these optimizations can decrease the time your program takes to compile and run, in this particular case, the effect will be extremely small and likely unnoticeable.
