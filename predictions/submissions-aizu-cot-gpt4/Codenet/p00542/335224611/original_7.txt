Step 1: We do not need to include "bits/stdc++.h". This header file includes quite a large number of standard C++ libraries. While this makes it convenient as you do not need to remember all the individual standard libraries, it increases your compilation time and memory usage. Replace it with the specific libraries you need, which in this case are <iostream> to handle input and output, and <algorithm> to use std::min and std::max functions.

Step 2: Using namespace std is also not a good practice, because it can lead to conflicts if your program has its own functions or variables that have the same names as standard library functions or variables. It's better to specify the namespace for each standard library function.

Step 3: Instead of calculating the minimum of a, b, c, and d in a nested way, we can do it in a single call to min by using an initializer list.

Step 4: Similarly for max, we can use an initializer list.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int a, b, c, d, e, f;
  std::cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e >> f;
  int ans = a + b + c + d - std::min({a, b, c, d}) + std::max({e, f});
  std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The use of initializer lists with std::min and std::max is only available from C++11 onwards. If you are using an older version of C++, you may need to use a different approach.
