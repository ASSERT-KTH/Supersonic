The given program is a custom implementation of the quicksort algorithm. Here are the steps I would take to optimize this code:

1. Remove unused libraries: The given code includes several libraries that aren't actually used. For example, `<cassert>`, `<ctime>`, and `<vector>`. Removing these will not affect the program's functionality, but it will improve the program's compilation speed.

2. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This line of code disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. By default, all standard streams are synchronized, which means we can freely mix C and C++ style I/O operations. However, it also makes C++ I/O operations significantly slower. 

3. Use `cin.tie(NULL)`: This unties `cin` from `cout`, meaning `cout` will not be flushed before each I/O operation via `cin`. This can result in a speedup.

4. Use `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout` for I/O operations: The `scanf` and `printf` functions are faster than their C++ counterparts `cin` and `cout`.

Now, let's implement these changes in the code:

```c++
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int a[1000010];
template <typename T> void quicksort(T *l, T *r) {
  T *begin = l;
  struct range {
    T *l, *r;
  };
  static range s[300];
  auto partition = [&](T *l, T *r) {
    if (r - l < 2)
      return (T *)nullptr;
    T *piv = l + rand() % (r - l);
    if (*piv == *max_element(l, r)) {
      swap(*piv, *(r - 1));
      return r - 1;
    }
    swap(*l, *piv);
    piv = l;
    r--;
    while (l < r) {
      while (l < r && *l <= *piv)
        l++;
      while (l<r && * r> * piv)
        r--;
      swap(*l, *r);
    }
    T *p = l - 1;
    swap(*p, *piv);
    return p;
  };
  int sz = 0;
  s[sz++] = {l, r};
  while (sz) {
    T *l = s[--sz].l;
    T *r = s[sz].r;
    T *p = partition(l, r);
    if (p != nullptr) {
      if (p + 1 < r)
        s[sz++] = {p + 1, r};
      if (l < p)
        s[sz++] = {l, p};
    }
  }
}
int main() {
  srand(time(0));
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", a + i);
  quicksort(a, a + n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    printf("%d%c", a[i], i == n - 1 ? '\n' : ' ');
}
```
Please note that the actual runtime and memory usage of a program can depend on a variety of factors, including the specific computer and operating system it's running on, and the specific inputs it's given. So, while these changes should generally improve the program's performance, they won't necessarily make it faster or use less memory in every single case.
