This program appears to be an implementation of the quicksort sorting algorithm for an array of integers. There are a few potential optimizations that can be made to this program:

1. Remove unused headers: `cassert` and `cstdlib` are included but not used.
2. Use of `std::vector` instead of C-style array: C-style arrays like `int a[1000010]` can be inefficient and unsafe to use. Using a `std::vector` could help with memory efficiency and safety.
3. Use of `std::cin` and `std::cout` for I/O: The use of `scanf` and `printf` for input and output can be replaced with `std::cin` and `std::cout` for better type safety and consistency with the rest of the code.
4. Use of `std::swap` instead of `swap`: Although `using namespace std;` is declared, it's better to use `std::swap` to avoid potential naming conflicts.
5. Using `std::sort` instead of custom quicksort: The C++ Standard Library provides a sort function that is typically implemented as an efficient quicksort or introsort. This could potentially speed up the program and make it more readable.

Let's optimize the code based on these points:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(time(0)));
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> a[i];
    
    sort(a.begin(), a.end());
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cout << a[i] << (i == n - 1 ? '\n' : ' ');
}
```
In this optimized version, we use `std::vector<int> a(n);` to create a vector of size `n` and `cin >> a[i];` to input the elements. Then, we use `std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());` to sort the vector. Finally, we use `cout << a[i] << (i == n - 1 ? '\n' : ' ');` to output the sorted array.
