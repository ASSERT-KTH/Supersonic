The original code is a prime number generator and a Goldbach's Conjecture solver. To optimize this, we could do the following:

1. As we already have the upper limit for the prime number generator, we can pre-allocate the size of the prime number vector. This reduces the number of allocations and deallocations, and therefore the time taken by them.
2. The `std::vector::at` function is safe but slower because it checks whether the index is within the bounds of the vector or not. As we are sure that the index will always be within the bounds, we can use the `operator[]` instead.
3. We can also optimize the loop where we are checking for prime numbers. We don't need to check for multiples of a number if we have already established that the number is not prime. So, we can add a condition to check only if the number is prime. This reduces the number of iterations and thus the time complexity.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
    const int maxNum = 51000;
    vector<bool> isPrime(maxNum + 1, false);
    isPrime[2] = true;
    for (int i = 3; i <= maxNum; i += 2) {
        isPrime[i] = true;
    }
    for (int i = 3; i <= maxNum; i += 2) {
        if (isPrime[i]) {  // Only check for prime numbers
            for (int j = i + i; j <= maxNum; j += i) {
                isPrime[j] = false;
            }
        }
    }
    vector<int> primes;
    primes.reserve(maxNum/2);  // Preallocate memory
    primes.push_back(2);
    for (int i = 3; i <= maxNum; i += 2) {
        if (isPrime[i]) {
            primes.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    int n;
    while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
        int kotae = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < primes.size() && primes[i] <= n / 2; i++) {
            if (isPrime[n - primes[i]]) {
                kotae++;
            }
        }
        cout << kotae << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
