Optimization Steps:

1. In the current implementation, the vector<bool> isPrime is initialized to false and then set to true in a separate loop. This operation can be optimized by initializing the vector<bool> isPrime directly to true and then setting the required indices to false.

2. The vector<int> primes is used to store the prime numbers. This can be optimized by using an iterator to iterate through the isPrime vector and directly using the index where isPrime is true.

3. The inner loop in the third loop structure is checking if isPrime.at(n - primes[i]) is true. This check can be optimized by using direct array access instead of the at() function. This is because the at() function performs range checking and throws an exception if the index is out of range. On the other hand, direct array access does not perform range checking and is therefore faster.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  vector<bool> isPrime(51000 + 1, true);
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= 51000; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= 51000; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n / 2; i++) {
      if (isPrime[i] && isPrime[n - i])
        kotae++;
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized program, the number of loops is reduced and the vector<int> primes is removed completely, which saves memory. The usage of the at() function is replaced with direct array access, which saves runtime.
