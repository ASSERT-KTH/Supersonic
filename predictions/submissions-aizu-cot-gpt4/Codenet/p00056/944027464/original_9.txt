The original program is a prime number generator and then tries to find out how many prime pairs can add up to a given number. Here is how we can optimize this program:

1. Instead of using `vector<bool>`, we can use `vector<char>` because the memory usage of `vector<bool>` is not efficient in some C++ implementations.

2. We can combine two for-loops that iterate from 3 to 51000 into one for-loop to reduce redundant operations.

3. In the nested loop, we can start from `i*i` instead of `i + i` because the multiples of numbers less than `i` have already been marked as non-prime.

4. The loop that populates the `primes` vector can be integrated into the prime generation loop for efficiency.

5. We can replace `primes.size()` with a variable to avoid calling the size function in every iteration.

6. We can use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` to speed up cin and cout.

7. In the `while` loop, we can break the loop when `primes[i]` is greater than `n / 2` to reduce unnecessary operations.

The optimized code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  vector<char> isPrime(51000 + 1, false);
  isPrime[2] = true;
  vector<int> primes;
  primes.push_back(2);
  for (int i = 3; i < 51000; i += 2) {
    if (!isPrime[i]) {
      primes.push_back(i);
      for (int j = i * i; j < 51000; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = true;
      }
    }
  }
  int n, size = primes.size();
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      if (primes[i] > n / 2)
        break;
      if (!isPrime[n - primes[i]])
        kotae++;
    }
    cout << kotae << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
