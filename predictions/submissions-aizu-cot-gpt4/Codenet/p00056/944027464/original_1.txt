The given code is an implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given limit (51000 in this case). The prime number list is then used to find the number of pairs of prime numbers that sum up to a given number. 

Here are some ways we can optimize the program:

1. Use a bitset instead of vector<bool>. A bitset uses 1 bit per boolean value, while the vector<bool> uses at least 1 byte per boolean. This can significantly reduce the memory usage for large sets of booleans.

2. Use std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false). This can potentially speed up I/O operations.

3. Instead of storing all prime numbers in a separate vector, we can use the isPrime bitset directly.

4. In the nested loop for marking non-prime numbers, we don't need to start from i + i. Instead, we can start from i * i because all smaller multiples of i would have already been marked by previous prime numbers.

5. In the loop for counting pairs of prime numbers that sum up to a given number, we don't need to check every prime number. We can stop when we reach a prime number greater than n / 2.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  bitset<51001> isPrime;
  isPrime.set();
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = 0;
  for (int i = 4; i <= 51000; i += 2) {
    isPrime[i] = 0;
  }
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= 51000; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= 51000; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = 0;
      }
    }
  }
  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n / 2; ++i) {
      if (isPrime[i] && isPrime[n - i])
        kotae++;
    }
    cout << kotae << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, we directly use the bitset isPrime to check if a number is prime. We also optimize the sieve algorithm by starting from i * i and we optimize the counting loop by stopping at n / 2.
