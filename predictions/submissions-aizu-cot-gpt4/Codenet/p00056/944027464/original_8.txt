The given program finds all the prime numbers up to 51000 and then, for each input number, it counts the number of ways the number can be expressed as a sum of two primes.

Here are some optimizations we can make:

1. In the inner loop of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, we can start from `i*i` instead of `i + i`. Because all the smaller multiples of `i` would have already been marked.

2. We can also optimize the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm by looping `j` up to the square root of 51000. This is because a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been processed.

3. Instead of storing the primes in a separate vector and then iterating over it, we can use the isPrime vector itself to check if a number is prime or not. This saves memory as we don't have to store the primes separately.

4. The condition `if (primes[i] <= n / 2)` can be removed. This is because we are already breaking the loop when `primes[i] > n / 2`.

5. We can use `isPrime[n - primes[i]]` instead of `isPrime.at(n - primes[i])` for better performance. `at()` function checks for out of range errors while `[]` operator does not. Since we are sure `n - primes[i]` will not be out of range, we can use `[]` operator.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  vector<bool> isPrime(51000 + 1, false);
  isPrime[2] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i < 51000; i += 2) {
    isPrime[i] = true;
  }

  int limit = sqrt(51000);
  for (int i = 3; i <= limit; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i*i; j < 51000; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }

  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n / 2; ++i) {
      if (isPrime[i] && isPrime[n - i]) {
        count++;
      }
    }
    cout << count << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: This program assumes that the input is always valid (a positive integer).
