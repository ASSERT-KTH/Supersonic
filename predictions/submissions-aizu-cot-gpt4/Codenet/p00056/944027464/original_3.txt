Step 1: Instead of making all numbers prime initially and then unmarking the non-prime numbers, we can do the opposite, i.e., mark only the prime numbers and keep others as non-prime initially. This will save some computation time.

Step 2: In the nested loop where we are setting multiples of prime numbers as non-prime, we can start from i * i since all numbers less than that would have already been covered by smaller primes. This will further reduce computation.

Step 3: We don't need to store all the primes in a separate vector. We can directly use the isPrime vector to check for primes, reducing the memory usage.

Step 4: In the last loop where we are counting the pairs of prime numbers, we can break the loop once we reach a prime number greater than n / 2. This will save computation time in case of large inputs.

With these optimizations, the optimized program will look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int SIZE = 51000;
    vector<bool> isPrime(SIZE, false);
    isPrime[2] = true;
    for (int i = 3; i * i < SIZE; i += 2) {
        if (!isPrime[i]) {
            for (int j = i * i; j < SIZE; j += i) {
                isPrime[j] = true;
            }
        }
    }

    int n;
    while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
        int kotae = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n / 2; ++i) {
            if (isPrime[i] && isPrime[n - i]) {
                kotae++;
            }
        }
        cout << kotae << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program will run faster and with less memory usage than the original program.
