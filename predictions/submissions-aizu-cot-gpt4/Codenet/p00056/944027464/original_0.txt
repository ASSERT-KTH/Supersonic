This program is running an algorithm to find all prime numbers up to 51000, store them in a vector, and then for each input number, it counts how many pairs of prime numbers can sum to that number.

The main part we can optimize here is the prime number generation.

1. In the second loop, we're looping through every odd number again which is unnecessary. We can start from the square of the number as any smaller multiples would have already been marked by previous iterations. Also, we can increment `j` by `2*i` instead of `i` because we are sure that even numbers aren't prime.
2. We can reduce the number of iterations in the second loop by stopping when `i * i` exceeds `51000`.
3. Also, we can reduce the size of `isPrime` vector by half as we are only interested in odd numbers excluding 2.
4. We don't need the `primes` vector. We can directly count the pairs in the `isPrime` vector itself.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n = 51000;
  vector<bool> isPrime(n/2, true);
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= n; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i/2]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += 2*i) {
        isPrime[j/2] = false;
      }
    }
  }

  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n / 2; i += 2) {
      if(isPrime[i/2] && isPrime[(n - i)/2]) {
        count++;
      }
    }
    cout << count << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
This program is more efficient in time and memory usage than the original one. It saves memory by halving the size of the `isPrime` vector and also saves time by reducing the number of iterations in the prime number generation part.
