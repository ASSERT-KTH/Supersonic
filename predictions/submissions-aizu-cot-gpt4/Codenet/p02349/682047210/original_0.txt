This program is already quite well optimized. It uses a lazy propagation segment tree, which is an efficient data structure for operations on ranges of elements. However, there are a few small things that can be done to further optimize this program.

Optimization Steps:
1. The use of "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" is not recommended because it includes all standard library headers which increases compilation time. Instead, only include necessary headers.
2. Use "ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);" to optimize I/O operations.
3. Remove the function "init". Instead, directly initialize the vectors in the constructor. This will reduce the number of function calls.
4. Use the "emplace_back" function instead of "push_back" when adding elements to a vector. This avoids the extra copy and can be faster.
5. Use prefix increment (++i) instead of postfix (i++) in loops. Although compilers usually optimize this, it is a good practice to use prefix increment when the result of the increment operation is not used.
6. The "typedef" keyword is old-style C++. Use "using" instead for type alias.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

template <typename Monoid>
struct LazySegmentTree {
    int N;
    vector<Monoid> node, lazy;

    LazySegmentTree(int sz = 0) {
        N = 1;
        while (N < sz) N <<= 1;
        node.assign(2 * N - 1, 0);
        lazy.assign(2 * N - 1, 0);
    }

    // ... rest of the code remains the same ...
};

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;
    LazySegmentTree<ll> seg(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
        int c;
        cin >> c;
        if (c == 0) {
            ll s, t, x;
            cin >> s >> t >> x;
            seg.add(s - 1, t, x);
        } else {
            int s;
            cin >> s;
            cout << seg.getSum(s - 1, s) << endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Note that the optimization strategies used here may not always lead to noticeable improvements, depending on the compiler and the specific scenario. Always test your code to verify that the optimizations are effective.
