The C/C++ program you provided seems to be implementing a Fenwick tree (also known as Binary Indexed Tree) for range updates and point queries. 

Here are the optimizations we can do:

1. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up the cin and cout operations.
2. Since the array S is globally declared, it's automatically initialized with 0, so there is no need to explicitly initialize it.
3. Instead of adding `-x` to `S[i]`, we can subtract `x` directly. This would avoid the unnecessary operation of negation.
4. The `op` variable can be declared inside the loop since it is not required outside the loop.
5. We can replace `ll` with `int64_t` to ensure that it will always hold a 64-bit integer, irrespective of the platform. `ll` (long long) might have different sizes on different platforms.

Let's apply these optimizations to the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef int64_t ll;
const int maxn = 100005;
ll S[maxn];
int n, q;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cin >> n >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    bool op;
    cin >> op;
    if (op) {
      int k;
      cin >> k;
      ll ans = 0;
      for (int i = k; i > 0; i -= i & -i)
        ans += S[i];
      cout << ans << '\n';
    } else {
      int s, t, x;
      cin >> s >> t >> x;
      for (int i = s; i <= n; i += i & -i)
        S[i] += x;
      for (int i = t + 1; i <= n; i += i & -i)
        S[i] -= x;
    }
  }
}
```

Please note that these optimizations will provide marginal improvements. The majority of the running time is dictated by the algorithmic complexity, which in this case is O(q log n) due to the Fenwick tree operations. The memory usage is also optimal at O(n) due to the single array used.
