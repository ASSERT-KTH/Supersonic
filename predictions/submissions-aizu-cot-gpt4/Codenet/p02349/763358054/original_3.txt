The provided C/C++ program generates a range sum with a binary indexed tree. The optimizations that can be made are:

1. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`: These two lines turn off some features of the C++ standard streams which make them slow. 

2. Avoid using `endl` and use `'\n'` instead: The `endl` command flushes the stream which can be a time-consuming operation. 

3. Use `printf` and `scanf` instead of `cin` and `cout`: The `cin` and `cout` operations are slower than `printf` and `scanf`. 

4. Use a more specific include instead of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is not a standard library and it includes nearly all C++ libraries, which increases the compilation time. 

Here is the optimized version of the provided C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int maxn = 100005;
ll S[maxn];
int n, q;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &q);
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    bool op;
    scanf("%d", &op);
    if (op) {
      int k;
      scanf("%d", &k);
      int ans = 0;
      for (int i = k; i > 0; i -= i & -i)
        ans += S[i];
      printf("%d\n", ans);
    } else {
      int s, t, x;
      scanf("%d %d %d", &s, &t, &x);
      for (int i = s; i <= n; i += i & -i)
        S[i] += x;
      for (int i = t + 1; i <= n; i += i & -i)
        S[i] += -x;
    }
  }
}
```

Please note that although the `printf` and `scanf` functions are faster than `cin` and `cout`, they are also less type safe. If performance is not a high priority or if you are working with user-input data, it may be safer to stick with `cin` and `cout`.

Also, if the `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` lines are used in a program, you should only use the `cin/cout` or `scanf/printf` group in the entire program, and not mix the two, because it can lead to unpredictable results.
