The given program is a C++ implementation of a Fenwick tree (also known as a Binary Indexed Tree). The Fenwick tree is a data structure providing efficient methods for calculation and manipulation of the prefix sums of a table of values.

The program is already quite optimized, but there are a few small changes that could potentially improve it:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file is quite large and including it can slow down the compilation process. Instead, include only those libraries that are actually used in the program (`iostream` in this case).

2. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` right after the main function to speed up the I/O operations.

3. `S[maxn]` array is not initialized. This could result in undefined behavior if the array is read before it is written to. Initialize it to zero.

4. Use `std::endl` instead of `'\n'` for a newline. `std::endl` also flushes the output buffer, which can be useful in some situations.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int maxn = 100005;
ll S[maxn] = {0};
int n, q;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cin >> n >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    bool op;
    cin >> op;
    if (op) {
      int k;
      cin >> k;
      ll ans = 0;
      for (int i = k; i > 0; i -= i & -i)
        ans += S[i];
      cout << ans << endl;
    } else {
      int s, t, x;
      cin >> s >> t >> x;
      for (int i = s; i <= n; i += i & -i)
        S[i] += x;
      for (int i = t + 1; i <= n; i += i & -i)
        S[i] += -x;
    }
  }
}
```

Remember that these optimizations may not make a noticeable difference in the runtime or memory usage of this specific program. In a larger program or in a program that is run many times, however, these optimizations could potentially save a significant amount of time and resources.
