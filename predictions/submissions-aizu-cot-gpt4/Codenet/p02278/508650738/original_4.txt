The given C/C++ program is a bit complex but it seems to be well written. However, there are several places where we can optimize it for running time and memory usage.

1. **Use of unordered_map instead of map**: The std::map in C++ STL is a balanced binary tree based container which provides ordered map. If we do not require ordered map, we can use std::unordered_map which is a hash based container and provides faster access on average.

2. **Avoiding unnecessary vector resizing**: In the QuickFind struct, for each index, we are initially reserving space for one integer in the vector `v`. Later, during the `unite` operation, we are pushing more elements into these vectors. This leads to unnecessary resizing of the vectors which is an expensive operation.

3. **Avoiding unnecessary swapping**: In the `unite` function, we are swapping `x` and `y` based on the values of `r[x]` and `r[y]`. However, the subsequent code does not depend on `x` being larger or smaller than `y`. We can avoid this swap operation.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
struct QuickFind {
  vector<int> r, p;
  vector<vector<int>> v;
  QuickFind() {}
  QuickFind(int size) { init(size); }
  void init(int size) {
    r.resize(size, 0);
    p.resize(size, 0);
    v.resize(size);
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      r[i] = 1, p[i] = i;
    }
  }
  bool same(int x, int y) { return p[x] == p[y]; }
  void unite(int x, int y) {
    x = p[x];
    y = p[y];
    if (x == y)
      return;
    r[x] += r[y];
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)v[y].size(); i++) {
      p[v[y][i]] = x;
      v[x].push_back(v[y][i]);
    }
    v[y].clear();
  }
};
signed main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  vector<int> b(a);
  sort(b.begin(), b.end());
  unordered_map<int, int> p, q;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    p[a[i]] = i;
    q[b[i]] = i;
  }
  QuickFind qf(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    qf.unite(i, p[b[i]]);
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int k = qf.v[i].size();
    if (qf.p[i] != i || k == 1)
      continue;
    int m = a[qf.v[i][0]];
    int tmp = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      tmp += a[qf.v[i][j]];
      m = min(m, a[qf.v[i][j]]);
    }
    ans += min(tmp + m * (k - 2), tmp + m + b[0] * (k + 1));
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
