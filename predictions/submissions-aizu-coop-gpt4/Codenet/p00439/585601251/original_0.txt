The given program is a C++ program used to calculate the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k` from an array of size `n`. Let's analyze the code first.

1. Code Analysis: 

The code is quite straightforward and does not appear to be inefficient at a first glance. It calculates the prefix sum array and then finds the maximum sum of subarrays of size `k`. However, there's a scope of optimization in the main computation part where it finds the maximum sum of the subarray. 

2. Optimization Strategy: 

The main optimization strategy would be to decrease the number of calculations the program makes when computing the maximum sum of the subarray.

Instead of subtracting `ac[i - k]` from `ac[i]` for every `i`, we can keep track of the minimum prefix sum up to `i - k` and subtract this from `ac[i]` to get the maximum sum for the current subarray. This way, we only make a single calculation for each `i`.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation: 

The current code calculates the maximum sum of the subarray of size `k` by iterating from `k` to `n`, and for each `i`, it subtracts the prefix sum up to `i - k` from the prefix sum up to `i`. This results in `n - k + 1` subtraction operations.

By keeping track of the minimum prefix sum up to `i - k`, we can calculate the maximum sum for the current subarray by subtracting this minimum from the prefix sum up to `i`. This way, we only make a single subtraction operation for each `i`, resulting in `n` subtraction operations, which is less than `n - k + 1` for `k > 1`.

This optimization reduces the number of subtraction operations, and since subtraction is a relatively expensive operation, this will result in a significant performance gain.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, k;
  while (cin >> n >> k, n) {
    vector<long long> ac(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      cin >> ac[i];
      ac[i] += ac[i - 1];
    }
    long long res = -LLONG_MAX;
    long long min_ac = 0;  // Initialize minimum prefix sum
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      if (i > k) {
        min_ac = min(min_ac, ac[i - k - 1]);  // Update minimum prefix sum
      }
      res = max(res, ac[i] - min_ac);  // Subtract minimum prefix sum from current prefix sum
    }
    cout << res << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the code still calculates the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k` from an array of size `n`, but it does so more efficiently by reducing the number of subtraction operations. 

It's important to note that this optimization doesn't change the O(n) time complexity of the program. However, it does reduce the constant factor, which can result in significant performance gains for large inputs.
