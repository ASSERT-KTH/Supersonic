**Code Analysis:**

The above program is a fairly simple one that reads in a series of numbers and calculates the maximum sum of a sub-array of length `k`. The program uses a prefix sum approach to calculate the maximum sum, which is quite efficient. 

However, there are a few areas where the code can still be optimized:

1. The program is reading input from standard input and writing output to standard output. These operations can be slow and can be sped up with some optimization.

2. The program is using a `vector<long long>` to store the prefix sums. This is not a problem in itself, but the size of the vector is initialized to `n+1`, which means that an extra space is being allocated that is not used. 

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. We can use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` to speed up cin and cout operations.

2. We can reduce the size of the vector to `n` instead of `n+1`.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` unties cin from cout, allowing input and output operations to be more independent and potentially faster. 

2. `cin.tie(NULL)` is another optimization that can be made for input/output operations. By default, cin and cout are tied together, meaning that any input operation (cin) will cause the output buffer (cout) to be flushed first. This is not necessary in this program, so we can untie them.

3. We can initialize the vector `ac` with size `n` instead of `n+1`, and adjust the indexing in the rest of the program accordingly. This will save a small amount of memory.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  // Optimizing input/output operations
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, k;
  while (cin >> n >> k, n) {
    // Reducing the size of the vector to save memory
    vector<long long> ac(n, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> ac[i];
      if(i > 0) {
        ac[i] += ac[i - 1];
      }
    }
    
    long long res = -LLONG_MAX;
    for (int i = k - 1; i < n; ++i) {
      long long temp = ac[i];
      // Adjusting the index in the subtraction operation
      if(i >= k) {
        temp -= ac[i - k];
      }
      res = max(res, temp);
    }
    cout << res << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: These optimizations should speed up the program and reduce memory usage a bit. However, the overall time complexity of the program is still O(n), which is already quite efficient for this type of problem. The main benefit of these optimizations is to make the program run faster in practice, especially with large inputs.
