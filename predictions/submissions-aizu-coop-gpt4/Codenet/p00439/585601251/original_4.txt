The given C++ program calculates the maximum sum of `k` consecutive elements in a sequence of `n` numbers. The input sequence is given from the standard input. The program uses a prefix sum array to calculate the sum of `k` consecutive elements efficiently.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

### 1. Code Analysis

The original code has O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity. It uses a vector to store the prefix sum array, and it recalculates the maximum sum for every `k` consecutive numbers in the sequence. The space complexity arises from the prefix sum array.

### 2. Optimization Strategy

While the original code is efficient, there are a few potential optimizations:

1. Use an array instead of a vector to store the prefix sum array. An array is more cache-friendly than a vector and may result in better performance.
2. Perform the calculation of the maximum sum during the input reading phase, eliminating the need for a second pass over the data.
3. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` at the beginning of the main function to speed up I/O operations.

### 3. Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Replace the `vector<long long> ac(n + 1, 0);` with `long long ac[n+1]; ac[0]=0;`. An array has a lower overhead than a vector and can be faster due to better cache locality.
2. Calculate the maximum sum during input reading. After reading each input, calculate the maximum sum of `k` consecutive numbers if we have read at least `k` numbers. This change allows us to eliminate the separate loop for calculating the maximum sum.
3. Add `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` at the beginning of the main function to speed up I/O operations.

### 4. Optimized Code Block

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n, k;
  while (cin >> n >> k, n) {
    long long ac[n + 1];
    ac[0] = 0;
    long long res = -LLONG_MAX;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      cin >> ac[i];
      ac[i] += ac[i - 1];
      if (i >= k) {
        res = max(res, ac[i] - ac[i - k]);
      }
    }
    cout << res << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program has the same time complexity as the original (O(n)), but it may be faster in practice due to the optimizations. It also has the same space complexity (O(n)) but uses less memory due to the use of an array instead of a vector.
