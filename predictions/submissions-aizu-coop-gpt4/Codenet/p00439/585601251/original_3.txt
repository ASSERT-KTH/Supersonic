The provided C++ code reads two integers n and k from the standard input. It then reads n more integers and stores their cumulative sums in an array. The code then calculates the maximum sum of any k consecutive integers in the array and prints the maximum sum.

Here are the steps required to optimize this code:

1. Code Analysis: 
   - The vector `ac` stores the cumulative sum of the array. It is of size `n + 1`, which is larger than necessary.
   - The loop at the end of the program calculates the maximum sum of any `k` consecutive integers. This loop iterates `n - k + 1` times.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Use an array instead of a vector. An array is faster than a vector because it doesn't have to deal with dynamic size changes.
   - Decrease the number of iterations in the final loop. After the first `k` sums are calculated, each subsequent sum can be calculated by subtracting the first number of the previous k numbers and adding the new number.
   
3. Step-by-step Explanation:
   - Replace the vector with an array. Arrays are faster because they don't need to manage dynamic size changes.
   - Instead of calculating the sum of every `k` consecutive numbers, calculate the first sum, then for each subsequent sum, subtract the first number of the previous `k` numbers and add the new number. This reduces the number of operations from `k` to `2` for each iteration after the first one.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, k;
  while (cin >> n >> k, n) {
    long long ac[n + 1] = {0};
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      cin >> ac[i];
      ac[i] += ac[i - 1];
    }
    long long res = -LLONG_MAX;
    for (int i = 1; i < k; ++i) {
      res = max(res, ac[i]);
    }
    for (int i = k; i <= n; ++i) {
      long long temp = ac[i] - ac[i - k];
      res = max(res, temp);
    }
    cout << res << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we used an array instead of a vector, which is faster due to its static nature. We also reduced the number of operations in the final loop, which reduces the overall time complexity.
