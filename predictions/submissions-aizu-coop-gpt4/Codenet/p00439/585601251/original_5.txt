**Code Analysis**

The provided code reads a sequence of integers from the standard input and calculates the maximum sum of a subsequence of length `k`. 

It starts by reading two integers, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the length of the sequence and `k` is the length of the subsequence to consider. If `n` is not zero, the program proceeds to read `n` integers and stores their cumulative sum in the array `ac`.

The program then iterates over the array `ac` from index `k` to `n`. For each index `i`, it calculates the sum of the subsequence ending at index `i` by subtracting the cumulative sum at index `i - k` from the cumulative sum at index `i`. The maximum sum found so far is stored in the variable `res`.

Finally, the program outputs the maximum sum and repeats the whole process until `n` is zero.

**Optimization Strategy**

1. **Data Structures:** The code uses a vector to store the cumulative sums. This is a good choice because vectors in C++ are implemented as dynamic arrays, which provide fast access to elements. However, we need to ensure that the vector's capacity is reserved in advance to avoid potential reallocations during the input reading phase.

2. **Redundant Computations:** The current code doesn't have any redundant computations. Each operation is necessary to calculate the maximum sum of a subsequence.

3. **Loops:** The loop that calculates the maximum sum can be optimized using a sliding window approach. Instead of recalculating the sum for each subsequence, we can calculate the sum for the first subsequence and then adjust this sum for each subsequent subsequence by subtracting the first element of the previous subsequence and adding the last element of the current subsequence.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** The code doesn't have any complex computations or parallelizable sections, so there's not much room for compiler-specific optimizations.

**Optimized Code Block**

Here's the optimized code that implements the sliding window approach:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, k;
  while (cin >> n >> k, n) {
    vector<long long> ac(n + 1, 0);
    ac.reserve(n + 1);  // reserve memory in advance

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      cin >> ac[i];
      ac[i] += ac[i - 1];
    }

    // Initialize the maximum sum with the sum of the first subsequence
    long long res = ac[k];

    // Use a sliding window to calculate the maximum sum
    for (int i = k + 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      long long sum = ac[i] - ac[i - k];
      res = max(res, sum);
    }

    cout << res << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code works in the same way as the original code, but it calculates the maximum sum more efficiently by using a sliding window approach. It also reserves memory for the vector in advance to avoid potential reallocations during the input reading phase. 

The trade-off is a slight increase in code complexity due to the sliding window approach. However, this is justifiable by the potential performance gain, especially for large input sequences.
