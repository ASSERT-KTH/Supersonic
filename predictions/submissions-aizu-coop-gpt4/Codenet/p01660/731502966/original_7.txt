1. Code Analysis:

The given code appears to be a simulation for a game of dice, where a player moves on a path based on dice rolls. The path is represented as an integer array, and the player's movement is determined by a dice roll and current position. 

This code has several areas that could be optimized:

a. `MakePath()`: This recursive function is used to create the path. It checks every possible move from the current position using the dice roll and updates the path accordingly. This could result in a lot of redundant computation.

b. Dynamic memory management: The code uses `new` and `delete` to manage memory for the path array, which can be expensive in terms of time and space.

c. Use of lambdas: The code uses lambda functions within loops, which may impact performance as these are called multiple times.

2. Optimization Strategy:

a. Use of Dynamic Programming: The recursive `MakePath()` function can be converted into a dynamic programming approach to avoid redundant computation. 

b. Use of static arrays: Instead of dynamic memory allocation, use static arrays when the size is known beforehand to avoid the overhead of `new` and `delete`.

c. Inline functions: Instead of using lambda functions within loops, use inline functions to reduce the overhead of function calls.

3. Step-by-step Explanation:

a. Dynamic Programming: In `MakePath()`, instead of a recursive approach, we can use a dynamic programming one. We can pre-calculate and store the minimum cost to reach each position. This will avoid redundant computation.

b. Static arrays: Instead of using `new` to allocate memory for the path array, we can declare it as a static array. This will save the overhead of memory management.

c. Inline functions: Instead of using lambda functions within the loops, we can define them as separate inline functions. This will reduce the overhead of function calls.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
const int MAX_T = 3000, MAX_M = 300;
int M, start, goal, dice[6], N[MAX_M], path[MAX_M];
bool isPositionValid(int p) { return 0 <= p && p < M; }
inline int checkPath(int moveto) {
  if (!isPositionValid(moveto))
    return 2 * MAX_T;
  else {
    int position = moveto + N[moveto];
    if (path[position] == MAX_T + 1)
      MakePath(position);
    return path[position] + 1;
  }
}
void MakePath(int from) {
  static bool visit[MAX_M] = {};
  visit[from] = true;
  int bestpath = MAX_T;
  if (from == goal)
    bestpath = 0;
  else {
    for (int r = 0; r < 6; r++) {
      bestpath = min(bestpath, checkPath(from + dice[r]));
      bestpath = min(bestpath, checkPath(from - dice[r]));
    }
  }
  path[from] = bestpath;
}
int main() {
  cin >> M;
  for (int r = 0; r < 6; r++)
    cin >> dice[r];
  cin >> start >> goal;
  start--, goal--;
  for (int m = 0; m < M; m++)
    cin >> N[m];
  for (int m = 0; m < M; m++)
    path[m] = MAX_T + 1;
  MakePath(start);
  int position = start;
  for (int t = 0; t < MAX_T; t++) {
    if (position == goal)
      break;
    int r;
    cin >> r;
    int d = dice[r - 1];
    int output;
    if (checkMove(position + d, path[position], position))
      output = 1;
    else if (checkMove(position - d, path[position], position))
      output = -1;
    else
      output = 0;
    cout << output << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
