1. Code Analysis:
The given C++ code appears to simulate a game in which a player moves on a board of size M using a dice. The player's starting position and goal are given and the player can move forward and backward based on the roll of the dice. The player's movement is also affected by an array N, which seems to indicate possible additional movements from each position. The code calculates the shortest path to the goal from the start position using a recursive function `MakePath()`, then simulates the game's movements based on the dice rolls.

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:

- The recursive function `MakePath()` is called for each possible movement from the current position. This can lead to repeated calculations for the same positions, which is inefficient and can become a bottleneck especially for large values of M.
- The `path` array is dynamically allocated and passed around by pointer, which can lead to unnecessary overhead and potential memory leaks.
- The `tryMove` lambda function is declared inside the main loop, which can potentially slow the program down.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Replace the recursion in `MakePath()` with an iterative approach using a queue or stack to avoid repeated calculations.
    2. Replace dynamic allocation of `path` array with a static array.
    3. Move the declaration of `tryMove` lambda function outside of the main loop.
    4. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up the input/output operations.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    1. Replace Recursion with Iteration: The `MakePath()` function currently uses recursion to calculate the shortest path to the goal. This can lead to repeated calculations for the same positions, which is inefficient. We can replace this with an iterative approach using a queue or stack to avoid these repeated calculations. This will speed up the program by avoiding unnecessary work.
    
    2. Replace Dynamic Allocation with Static Array: The `path` array is currently dynamically allocated and passed around by pointer. This can lead to unnecessary overhead and potential memory leaks. Instead, we can allocate the `path` array statically in the main function and pass it by reference to `MakePath()`. This avoids the overhead of dynamic allocation and potential memory leaks.
    
    3. Move Lambda Function Declaration: The `tryMove` lambda function is currently declared inside the main loop. This means that the function is re-declared on each iteration of the loop, which can potentially slow the program down. We can move the declaration of this function outside of the main loop to avoid this overhead.
    
    4. Speed Up I/O Operations: We can use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` at the beginning of the main function to speed up the input/output operations. This can significantly improve the performance of the program when the number of I/O operations is large.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;
const int MAX_T = 3000, MAX_M = 300;
int M, start, goal, dice[6], *N;

void MakePath(int *path, int from) {
  static bool visit[MAX_M] = {};
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(from);
  visit[from] = true;
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int cur = q.front();
    q.pop();
    int bestpath = cur == goal ? 0 : MAX_T;
    for (int r = 0; r < 6; r++) {
      int moveto = cur + dice[r];
      if (isPositionValid(moveto)) {
        int position = moveto + N[moveto];
        if (!visit[position]) {
          visit[position] = true;
          q.push(position);
        }
        bestpath = min(bestpath, path[position] + 1);
      }
      moveto = cur - dice[r];
      if (isPositionValid(moveto)) {
        int position = moveto + N[moveto];
        if (!visit[position]) {
          visit[position] = true;
          q.push(position);
        }
        bestpath = min(bestpath, path[position] + 1);
      }
    }
    path[cur] = bestpath;
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);
  cin >> M;

    cin >> dice[r];
  cin >> start >> goal;
  start--, goal--;
  N = new int[M];
  for (int m = 0; m < M; m++)
    cin >> N[m];
  int path[MAX_M];
  for (int m = 0; m < M; m++)
    path[m] = MAX_T + 1;
  MakePath(path, start);
  int position = start;
  auto tryMove = [&path](int moveto, int path_before,
                         int &position) -> bool {
    if (isPositionValid(moveto)) {
      if (path_before > path[moveto + N[moveto]]) {
        position = moveto + N[moveto];
        return true;
      }
    }
    return false;
  };
  for (int t = 0; t < MAX_T; t++) {
    if (position == goal)
      break;
    int r;
    cin >> r;
    int d = dice[r - 1];
    int output;
    if (tryMove(position + d, path[position], position))
      output = 1;
    else if (tryMove(position - d, path[position], position))
      output = -1;
    else
      output = 0;
    cout << output << endl;
  }
  delete[] N;
  return 0;
}
