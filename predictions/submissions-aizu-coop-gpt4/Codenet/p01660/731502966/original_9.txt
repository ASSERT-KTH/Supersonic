The program seems to involve moving along a path based on dice rolls. Each position on the path has a specific number associated with it, which determines the next position. However, the implementation is sub-optimal and can be improved in several ways.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Avoid Recursion**: The `MakePath` function is using recursion to create a path. This can be optimized by using an iterative approach instead to avoid the overhead of recursive function calls. 

2. **Redundant Computations**: The `checkPath` function is called twice for each dice roll in both directions, which is unnecessary. The result of each call can be stored and used instead of computing it again.

3. **Inefficient Data Structures**: The `path` and `N` arrays are dynamically allocated using `new`. Changing these to statically allocated arrays can improve memory management.

4. **Compiler Optimization**: Use compiler optimization flags to instruct the compiler to optimize the code for speed or size when compiling the program.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Avoid Recursion**: Recursion incurs overhead due to function calls and can lead to stack overflow for large inputs. The `MakePath` function can be rewritten using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. BFS is optimal for this problem because it ensures that the shortest path is found first.

2. **Redundant Computations**: The current implementation calls `checkPath` twice for each dice roll. We can optimize it by storing the results of `checkPath` in an array and using the stored results instead of computing them again.

3. **Inefficient Data Structures**: Dynamically allocated arrays require manual memory management and can cause memory leaks if not properly handled. By changing `path` and `N` arrays to static arrays, we can improve performance and make the code simpler.

4. **Compiler Optimization**: When compiling the program, use the `-O2` or `-O3` flags to enable optimization. The `-O2` flag instructs the compiler to optimize for speed while `-O3` goes a step further by also enabling inline functions.

**Trade-offs**: The main trade-off with these optimizations is increased code complexity. The BFS approach is more complex than simple recursion, and storing results of `checkPath` requires additional space. However, these trade-offs are justified as they lead to significant performance improvements.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_T = 3000, MAX_M = 300;
int M, start, goal, dice[6], N[MAX_M], path[MAX_M];

bool isPositionValid(int p) { return 0 <= p && p < M; }

void MakePath() {
    queue<int> q;
    fill(path, path + M, MAX_T + 1);
    path[start] = 0;
    q.push(start);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int from = q.front();
        q.pop();

        for (int r = 0; r < 6; r++) {
            int move_to[2] = {from + dice[r], from - dice[r]};
            for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
                int position = move_to[i] + N[move_to[i]];
                if (isPositionValid(position) && path[position] > path[from] + 1) {
                    path[position] = path[from] + 1;
                    q.push(position);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> M;
    for (int r = 0; r < 6; r++)
        cin >> dice[r];
    cin >> start >> goal;
    start--, goal--;
    for (int m = 0; m < M; m++)
        cin >> N[m];

    MakePath();

    int position = start;
    for (int t = 0; t < MAX_T; t++) {
        if (position == goal)
            break;
        int r;
        cin >> r;
        int d = dice[r - 1];
        int output;
        if (path[position + d] < path[position]) {
            position += d;
            output = 1;
        }
        else if (path[position - d] < path[position]) {
            position -= d;
            output = -1;
        }
        else
            output = 0;

        cout << output << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This optimized code incorporates all the strategies mentioned above. The code is now more efficient and avoids unnecessary computations, leading to improved performance.
