Code Analysis:
The code represents a dice game where one starts from a given position and tries to reach a goal position by rolling a dice. The dice's possible moves are pre-defined and stored in the dice array. The tiles on the path can either push the player forward or backward by some steps. The objective is to reach the goal in the minimum number of dice rolls. 

The code uses recursion to calculate the minimum number of steps required to reach each tile starting from the 'start' position. The recursive function `MakePath()` is called for each possible move (forward and backward) from each tile, and it calculates the minimum path length to the goal from that tile. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses arrays for storing the dice moves and path length. Arrays are efficient in terms of memory and access time, so there is no need to change them.

2. Redundant Computations: The code is doing redundant computations in the recursive function `MakePath()`. For each tile, the function is called twice for each dice move (forward and backward), which can be avoided.

3. Loops and Recursive Calls: The recursion in `MakePath()` can be converted to dynamic programming to avoid redundant recursive calls.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations like `-O3` can make the code run faster by performing several optimization techniques.

Optimization Steps:

1. Avoiding Redundant Computations: The function `MakePath()` is called twice for each dice move from each tile. Instead of calling the function twice, we can store the result of the first call in a variable and use it in the second comparison. This will reduce the number of function calls by half.

2. Converting Recursion to Dynamic Programming: The recursive function `MakePath()` is calculating the minimum path length from each tile to the goal. This can be calculated iteratively using dynamic programming. We can start from the goal position and calculate the minimum path length to each tile in reverse order. This will avoid redundant recursive calls.

3. Compiler Optimizations: We can compile the code with `-O3` option which will optimize the code for speed.

Trade-offs:
1. Increased Code Complexity: The dynamic programming solution will increase the complexity of the code, but it will make the code run faster.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
const int MAX_T = 3000, MAX_M = 300;
int M, start, goal, dice[6], *N;
bool isPositionValid(int p) { return 0 <= p && p < M; }

int *MakePath() {
  int *path = new int[M];
  for (int m = 0; m < M; m++)
    path[m] = MAX_T + 1;
  path[goal] = 0;
  for (int m = goal - 1; m >= 0; m--) {
    for (int r = 0; r < 6; r++) {
      int moveto = min(max(m + dice[r], 0), M - 1);
      path[m] = min(path[m], path[moveto + N[moveto]] + 1);
      moveto = max(min(m - dice[r], M - 1), 0);
      path[m] = min(path[m], path[moveto + N[moveto]] + 1);
    }
  }
  return path;
}

int main() {
  cin >> M;
  for (int r = 0; r < 6; r++)
    cin >> dice[r];
  cin >> start >> goal;
  start--, goal--;
  N = new int[M];
  for (int m = 0; m < M; m++)
    cin >> N[m];
  int *path = MakePath();
  int position = start;
  for (int t = 0; t < MAX_T; t++) {
    if (position == goal)
      break;
    int r;
    cin >> r;
    int d = dice[r - 1];
    int moveto = min(max(position + d, 0), M - 1);
    int output;
    if (path[position] > path[moveto + N[moveto]]) {
      position = moveto + N[moveto];
      output = 1;
    } else {
      moveto = max(min(position - d, M - 1), 0);
      if (path[position] > path[moveto + N[moveto]]) {
        position = moveto + N[moveto];
        output = -1;
      } else
        output = 0;
    }
    cout << output << endl;
  }
  delete[] N;
  delete[] path;
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, `MakePath()` function is converted to dynamic programming, and redundant function calls are avoided in the main function. The code is compiled with `-O3` option for better speed.
