The given C++ code reads an integer `n` from the input, then reads `n` numbers, and finally prints out these numbers in ascending order. The numbers can be in the range from 0 to 10000 (inclusive). The code uses a variation of the counting sort algorithm, which is quite efficient for sorting integers in a known range. However, there are some performance issues in this code that can be improved.

1. Code Analysis:

   1.1 The code uses `scanf` for input and `cout` for output. Mixing both can cause unnecessary overhead due to internal synchronization.

   2.2 The code uses `#define` to define two macros. This can make the code harder to read and debug. It can also lead to unexpected side effects.

   2.3 The `min` variable is updated in each iteration, even if the new number is not less than the current minimum.

2. Optimization Strategy:

   2.1 Use `cin` and `cout` for both input and output.

   2.2 Replace macros with actual code or const variables.

   2.3 Only update `min` when a new number is less than the current minimum.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   3.1 Replace `scanf` with `cin`: `scanf` and `cout` are synchronized, meaning that before `cout` is executed, all buffers used by `scanf` are flushed. This can cause unnecessary overhead. Using `cin` and `cout` together will avoid this overhead.

   3.2 Replace macros with actual code or const variables: Macros are not type-checked and can lead to unexpected side effects. Replacing them with actual code or const variables will make the code easier to read and debug.

   3.3 Only update `min` when a new number is less than the current minimum: Currently, the `min` variable is updated in each iteration, even if the new number is not less than the current minimum. To avoid this unnecessary computation, we can add an `if` statement to only update `min` when a new number is less than the current minimum.

4. Optimized Code Block:

   Here is the optimized version of the code that incorporates the above-mentioned optimizations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false); // to speed up cin and cout
  cin.tie(nullptr); // untie cin and cout, to speed up input and output

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  const int MAX_NUM = 10001;
  int min = MAX_NUM, t, A[MAX_NUM]{};
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> t;
    if (t < min)
      min = t;
    A[t]++;
  }
  A[min]--;
  
  cout << min;
  
  for (int i = min; i < MAX_NUM; i++) {
    for(int j = 0; j < A[i]; j++) {
      cout << ' ' << i;
    }
  }
  cout << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized version, we have eliminated the use of macros, unnecessary computation and mixed use of `scanf` and `cout`. We have also added `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(nullptr)` to speed up `cin` and `cout`.
