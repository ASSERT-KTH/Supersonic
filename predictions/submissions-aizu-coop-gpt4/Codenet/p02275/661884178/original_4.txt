Code Analysis:
The given C++ code reads an integer 'n' from the input, then reads 'n' more integers, counts the occurrences of each integer, and keeps track of the minimum integer. It then prints the numbers in ascending order, placing the smallest number at the beginning. 

The code uses an array A[10001] to store the occurrences of the numbers. The range of numbers that can be stored is limited from 0 to 10000, inclusive. The time complexity is linear, and the space complexity is also linear with respect to the maximum number that can be stored.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Data Structures: The array is a good choice for this task as it provides constant-time access to elements. No changes are needed here.

2. Redundant Computations: The code seems free of redundant computations.

3. Loop Optimization: The loops are already efficient as they run in linear time. No changes are needed here.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The use of scanf instead of cin provides better input performance. The use of static_cast<int> in the macro definition is unnecessary and can be removed. The #define directives can be replaced with inline functions for type safety and readability.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the unnecessary static_cast<int> from the macro definition. This does not add any value and increases complexity.
2. Replace #define directives with inline functions. Inline functions are safer and more flexible than macros as they are evaluated by the compiler at the call site, enabling proper type checking and scope resolution.

Trade-offs:
The optimization changes proposed here are minimal and do not add any significant complexity to the code. They mainly improve code readability and maintainability.

Optimized Code Block:
Below is the optimized code.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

inline void repeat(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {}
}

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int min = 2000000, t, A[10001]{};
  repeat(n) {
    scanf("%d", &t);
    if (t < min)
      min = t;
    A[t]++;
  }
  A[min]--;
  cout << min;
  for (int i = min; i < 10001; i++) {
    repeat(A[i]) { cout << ' ' << i; }
  }
  cout << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
