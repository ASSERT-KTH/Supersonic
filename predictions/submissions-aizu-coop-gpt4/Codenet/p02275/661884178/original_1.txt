Code Analysis:
This program appears to be a simple frequency counter that scans a list of integers, counts the frequency of each number, and then prints the smallest number followed by the remaining numbers in non-decreasing order. The program uses an array to store the frequency of numbers, which is a common approach to count the occurrence of elements in a range. 

Potential bottlenecks for optimization include:

1. Utilizing the bits/stdc++.h header: This header includes a large number of standard C++ libraries, which can increase compilation time significantly. It is better to include only the libraries that the program actually uses.

2. Use of macro for loops: This may make the code less readable and harder to debug.

3. Use of scanf and cout for input and output: Mixing C-style (scanf) and C++-style (cout) IO operations can create unnecessary overhead and slow down the program.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace bits/stdc++.h with only the necessary libraries, i.e., iostream.
2. Replace the scanf function with cin for consistency.
3. Replace the macro for loop with a standard for loop for better readability and easier debugging.
4. Use "\n" instead of endl to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output buffer.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replacing bits/stdc++.h: Including a large number of libraries unnecessarily increases compilation time. By replacing this with only the necessary ones (iostream in this case), the compilation time can be significantly reduced.

2. Replacing scanf with cin: Mixing C-style and C++-style I/O operations can create unnecessary overhead and slow down the program. By using only C++-style I/O operations, we can avoid this potential slowdown.

3. Replacing the macro loop with a standard for loop: While macro loops may save some typing, they can make the code harder to read and debug. By using a standard for loop, we can improve code readability and maintainability.

4. Using "\n" instead of endl: The endl manipulator not only inserts a new line, but also flushes the output buffer, which can lead to unnecessary overhead when printing many numbers. By using "\n" instead, we can avoid this potential performance issue.

Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int min = 2000000, t, A[10001] = {};
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> t;
    if (t < min)
      min = t;
    A[t]++;
  }
  A[min]--;
  cout << min;
  for (int i = min; i < 10001; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < A[i]; j++) {
      cout << ' ' << i;
    }
  }
  cout << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
