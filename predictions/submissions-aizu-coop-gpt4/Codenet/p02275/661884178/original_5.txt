Let's break down the code and understand what it does:

1. It reads in a number `n` from the standard input.
2. It reads in `n` integers, stores the count of each integer in an array `A`, and keeps track of the smallest integer `min`.
3. It then prints out the smallest integer and the remaining integers in non-decreasing order.

The code is simple and clean, but there are still several areas we can optimize:

1. **Use of `<bits/stdc++.h>` Header File**: This header file is quite large and includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which increases compilation time. We should only include the necessary headers.

2. **Use of `#define r(i, n) for (auto i = 0; i < n; i++)` Macro**: This macro is used to simplify the `for` loop, but it can make the code harder to read and understand. It is better to write out the `for` loop explicitly.

3. **Use of `#define s(c) static_cast<int>((c).size())` Macro**: This macro is not used in the code, so it should be removed.

4. **Use of `scanf` and `cout`**: Mixing C and C++ style I/O can lead to inefficiency due to synchronization. It's better to stick to one - preferably C++ style.

5. **Use of Array `A`**: The array `A` is of size `10001`, which is not necessary if the input numbers are much smaller. We can use `std::map` or `std::unordered_map` to store the counts, which can reduce memory usage.

6. **Use of 'min' as a variable name**: 'min' is a function in the standard library. It would be better to choose another name to avoid confusion.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    map<int, int> count;
    int min_value = 2000000, t;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> t;
        if (t < min_value)
            min_value = t;
        count[t]++;
    }
    count[min_value]--;

    cout << min_value;
    for (const auto& pair : count) {
        for (int i = 0; i < pair.second; i++) {
            cout << ' ' << pair.first;
        }
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces memory usage by using a map instead of an array. It also uses C++ style I/O for consistency and efficiency and removes unnecessary macros and header files.
