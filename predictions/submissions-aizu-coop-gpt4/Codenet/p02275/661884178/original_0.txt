Code Analysis:
This code reads an integer n from the input and then reads n more integers. It finds the smallest integer and counts the occurrences of each integer. Finally, it prints the smallest integer once and the rest of the integers in ascending order according to their occurrences.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient data structures: The array A[10001]{} is used as a hash table for counting the occurrences of the integers. This is a good choice for this task.

2. Redundant or unnecessary computations: The code seems efficient in this regard. There are no apparent redundant computations.

3. Loops or recursive calls: The loops are necessary for the task. However, the output loop could be optimized by starting from min+1 instead of min because we have already printed the min value once.

4. Compiler optimizations or pragma directives: The current code does not need specific compiler optimizations or pragma directives. The important thing is to compile with the -O2 or -O3 optimization level.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Change the output loop to start from min+1. This avoids checking the minimum value again in the output loop. The rationale is that we have already taken care of the minimum value before the loop, so there is no need to do it again inside the loop.

2. Tradeoff: There is no significant tradeoff in this optimization. The code complexity remains similar and there is a slight improvement in performance.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define r(i, n) for (auto i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define s(c) static_cast<int>((c).size())
int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int min = 2000000, t, A[10001]{};
  r(i, n) {
    scanf("%d", &t);
    if (t < min)
      min = t;
    A[t]++;
  }
  A[min]--;
  cout << min;
  // Start the loop from min+1 because we have already printed the min value
  for (int i = min+1; i < 10001; i++) {
    r(j, A[i]) { cout << ' ' << i; }
  }
  cout << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
