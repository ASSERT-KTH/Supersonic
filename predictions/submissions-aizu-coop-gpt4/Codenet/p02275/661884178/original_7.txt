Code Analysis:
This program reads an integer 'n' and then 'n' numbers from the input. It finds the minimum number among them and prints it first. The rest of the numbers are printed in ascending order. The code is written in a way that it only works for positive integers and numbers up to 10000.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structure: An array A[10001] is used to store the frequency of each number. This could be inefficient if 'n' is small and the numbers are large. We can use a map instead. Maps in C++ are implemented as balanced binary search trees and have logarithmic complexity for insert and find operations.

2. Redundant Computations: In the code, the minimum number is computed separately. This can be optimized by using the property of a map that it stores the keys in the sorted order. So, the first element of the map will always be the minimum.

3. Loop Optimization: There's no need for a nested loop to print the elements. We can use a single loop to iterate over the map.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use the fast I/O methods for reading and writing the data which can significantly speed up the code.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  map<int, int> freq;
  int t;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> t;
    freq[t]++;
  }

  for (auto &p: freq) {
    for (int i = 0; i < p.second; i++) {
      cout << p.first << ' ';
    }
  }
  
  cout << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. I replaced scanf and printf with cin and cout for readability. To speed up the cin and cout, I added two lines at the start of the main function. This will make the I/O operations almost as fast as scanf and printf.

2. I replaced the array with a map to store the frequency of each number. The map will automatically sort the numbers.

3. I consolidated the two loops into one. The first loop reads the numbers and stores the frequency in the map. The second loop iterates over the map and prints each number according to its frequency.

4. I removed the calculation and tracking of the minimum number as it's not needed anymore. The first element of the map will always be the minimum.

Trade-Offs:
The map uses more memory than the array, and its operations are slower (logarithmic time complexity) compared to the array (constant time complexity). However, it provides automatic sorting which simplifies the code and makes it more efficient for larger ranges of numbers. In a real-world scenario, the choice between map and array would depend on the range and distribution of the input numbers.
