Code Analysis:
The provided code reads an integer 'n' from the user and then reads 'n' integers. The code then prints the integers in ascending order. 

The code uses an array 'A' as a frequency counter for the numbers input by the user. The minimum number input by the user is stored in 'min'. The code then prints out the numbers in ascending order according to their frequency.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies:
1. Using '#include <bits/stdc++.h>': This header file includes a lot of unnecessary files, which can increase compilation time.
2. The code uses 'scanf' and 'cout' together. 'scanf' is faster than 'cin', and 'cout' is slower than 'printf'. It's better to stick with one set for consistency and speed.
3. The size of array 'A' is constant and unnecessarily large, which can waste memory.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Instead of '#include <bits/stdc++.h>', include only the necessary header files.
2. Use either 'cin' and 'cout' or 'scanf' and 'printf' consistently.
3. Use a data structure like a map or unordered_map instead of an array to store the frequencies, which can help to save memory.

Optimized Code:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int min = 2000000, t;
    unordered_map<int, int> A; // Use map to save memory
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> t;
        if (t < min)
            min = t;
        A[t]++;
    }
    A[min]--;
    cout << min;
    for (int i = min; i < 10001; i++) {
        for(int j = 0; j < A[i]; j++) {
            cout << ' ' << i;
        }
    }
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replaced '#include <bits/stdc++.h>' with '#include <iostream>' and '#include <unordered_map>' to reduce compilation time.
2. Replaced 'scanf' with 'cin' for consistency and to improve readability.
3. Replaced array 'A' with an unordered_map. This saves memory as it only allocates space for the numbers that are input by the user, not for every number up to 10001.
4. The rest of the code remains the same as the original. The optimizations should not affect the output. 

Trade-offs: 
Using an unordered_map instead of an array increases the complexity of the code slightly. However, the benefits of memory efficiency outweigh this increase in complexity.
