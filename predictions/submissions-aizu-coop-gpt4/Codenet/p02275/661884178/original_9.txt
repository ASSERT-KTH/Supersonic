This C++ program receives an array of integers as input and then prints the integers in ascending order. 

Before we proceed with optimization, let's analyze the given code:

1. In the first loop, it scans each number, stores it in an array `A` at the index of the number, and keeps track of the smallest number.

2. In the second loop, it prints the numbers in ascending order by traversing the array `A` and printing the index as many times as the value at that index.

Here are some areas for optimization:

1. Use of `<bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes too many unnecessary headers, which can increase compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Use of `#define` for loops: Although it makes the code look cleaner, it can make debugging harder. It's better to use regular for loops.

3. Array size: The size of array `A` is set to 10,001, which may be larger than necessary and consume more memory. We can optimize by dynamically allocating the size of the array based on the maximum input number.

4. I/O operations: `scanf` and `printf` are faster than `cin` and `cout`. Also, reducing the number of I/O operations can improve performance.

5. Unnecessary decrement of `A[min]`: This operation is not needed as we can handle this in the second loop.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int n, min = 2000000, max = 0, t;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    // Find the max element to dynamically allocate the array
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &t);
        if (t < min) min = t;
        if (t > max) max = t;
    }
    
    // Allocate memory for the array based on the max element
    int* A = (int*)calloc(max + 1, sizeof(int));
    
    // Re-read the input and store the count of each number
    rewind(stdin);
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &t);
        A[t]++;
    }
    
    // Print the numbers in ascending order
    printf("%d", min);
    A[min]--;
    for (int i = min; i <= max; i++) {
        for(int j = 0; j < A[i]; j++) {
            printf(" %d", i);
        }
    }
    printf("\n");
    
    // Free the dynamically allocated memory
    free(A);
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces memory usage by dynamically allocating the array based on the maximum input number, uses faster I/O functions `scanf` and `printf`, and avoids unnecessary operations. However, the trade-off is that it requires an extra pass to find the max element and re-read the input, which may increase CPU usage.
