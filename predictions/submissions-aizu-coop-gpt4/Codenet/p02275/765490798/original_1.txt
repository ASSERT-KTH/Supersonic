The provided code is a simple program that reads a sequence of integers from the input, sorts them using counting sort, and then prints them out in ascending order. Below are the optimization steps that can be done:

1. **Avoid Using Bits/StdC++.h**: The first line of the code `#include "bits/stdc++.h"` is not recommended. This header file includes too many unnecessary header files, which will increase the compilation time. Instead, only include the necessary header files.

2. **Remove Unused Macros and Functions**: The code contains unused macros (like `_DEBUG`, `dump`, `rrep`, `chmax`, etc.), and functions (`chmax`, `chmin`), which are unnecessary and can be removed.

3. **Avoid Using `std::endl`**: The use of `std::endl` not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output buffer, which can be a costly operation. Use `'\n'` instead.

4. **Use Reserve for Vector**: To avoid reallocations, it is a good idea to use `reserve` function to reserve space for your vector if you know the size in advance.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

void counting_sort(std::vector<int>& v) {
  int n = v.size();
  int k = *std::max_element(v.begin(), v.end());
  std::vector<int> cnt(k + 1), tmp(v);

  for (int x : v)
    cnt[x]++;

  for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
    cnt[i + 1] += cnt[i];

  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    v[cnt[tmp[i]] - 1] = tmp[i];  // arrays are zero-indexed
    cnt[tmp[i]]--;
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::vector<int> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> A[i];
  }

  counting_sort(A);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cout << A[i];
    if (i != n - 1)
      std::cout << ' ';
  }
  std::cout << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

This code is cleaner and much easier to read. It is also more efficient because it includes only the necessary header files, avoids flushing the output buffer unnecessarily, and reduces memory reallocations for the vector.
