Step 1: Code Analysis

The provided C/C++ program is implementing the Counting Sort algorithm, an efficient sorting algorithm for integers. The program reads integers from the input, sorts them using Counting Sort, and outputs the sorted sequence.

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies:
1. The counting_sort function uses an extra vector, "tmp", which is a copy of the input vector "v". This not only doubles the memory usage but also adds an overhead of copying the entire array.
2. The use of the bits/stdc++.h header. This includes a large number of standard C++ libraries, which can slow down the compilation process.

Step 2: Optimization Strategy

1. Minimize Memory Usage: We can avoid creating the copy of the array "v", thus reducing memory usage. We can directly manipulate the array "v". 
2. Efficient Headers: Instead of bits/stdc++.h, include only the necessary headers.
3. Compiler Optimizations: Use compiler optimizations like -O2 or -O3. These flags tell the compiler to focus on code optimization during the compilation process.

Step 3: Step-by-Step Explanation

1. The "tmp" array is not needed. We can directly manipulate the array "v". This not only reduces memory usage but also avoids the overhead of copying the array.
2. Instead of the bits/stdc++.h header, which includes almost all C++ headers, and slows down the compilation process, we include only the necessary headers: iostream, vector, and algorithm.
3. When compiling the program, use the -O2 or -O3 flags to enable compiler optimizations. This can result in faster code.

Step 4: Optimized Code Block

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int INF = sizeof(int) == sizeof(long long) ? 0x3f3f3f3f3f3f3f3fLL : 0x3f3f3f3f;
const int MOD = (int)(1e9 + 7);

void counting_sort(vector<int> &v) {
  int n = v.size(), k = *max_element(v.begin(), v.end());
  vector<int> cnt(k + 1);
  cnt[0]--;
  for (int x : v)
    cnt[x]++;
  for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
    cnt[i + 1] += cnt[i];
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    cnt[v[i]]--;
    v[cnt[v[i]]] = v[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n);
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  counting_sort(A);
  cout << A[0];
  for(int i = 1; i < A.size(); i++) {
    cout << " " << A[i];
  }
  cout << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Here, we've removed the "tmp" vector, directly manipulating the original "v" array in the counting_sort function. We've also replaced the bits/stdc++.h header with the specific headers that are actually needed for this program.
