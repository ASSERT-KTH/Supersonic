This is a C++ program that reads a series of integers from standard input, sorts them using counting sort, and prints the sorted sequence to standard output. Here are some steps we can take to optimize this code:

1. **Code Analysis**

The given C++ program is generally well-optimized. However, the counting sort function can be optimized further. The current implementation of the counting sort algorithm uses two vectors: `cnt` and `tmp`. The `tmp` vector is a copy of the input vector `v`. This is not necessary and consumes extra memory.

2. **Optimization Strategy**

    1. We will remove the `tmp` vector from the counting sort function. Instead of using `tmp` to store the original values of `v`, we can modify the loop that populates `v` with the sorted values to iterate over the `cnt` vector itself. This way, we get rid of the extra vector and make the function more memory-efficient.

    2. We will replace the usage of `std::cin` and `std::cout` with faster I/O methods, as these are often bottlenecks in C++ programs. We can use `scanf` and `printf` instead.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**

    1. In the counting sort function, we remove the `tmp` vector. This is done to save memory. Instead of iterating over `tmp` when populating `v` with the sorted values, we iterate over `cnt`. For each index `i` in `cnt`, we repeat the value `i` `cnt[i]` times, in increasing order. This gives us the sorted sequence.

    2. We replace `std::cin` and `std::cout` with `scanf` and `printf` respectively. This is because `std::cin` and `std::cout` are slower compared to `scanf` and `printf`.

4. **Optimized Code Block**

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

#define rep(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)

void counting_sort(std::vector<int> &v) {
  int n = v.size(), k = *std::max_element(v.begin(), v.end());
  std::vector<int> cnt(k + 1);
  for (int x : v)
    cnt[x]++;
  int index = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < cnt[i]; j++)
      v[index++] = i;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  std::vector<int> A(n);
  rep(i, 0, n) { scanf("%d", &A[i]); }
  counting_sort(A);
  printf("%d", A[0]);
  rep(i, 1, A.size()) { printf(" %d", A[i]); }
  printf("\n");
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program does the same thing as the original, but consumes less memory and has faster I/O.
