Code Analysis:
The provided code is a C program that performs Gaussian elimination on a 2x3 matrix (a system of two linear equations with two variables). The main performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies in this code are as follows:

1. The matrix() function is performing redundant computations. The value of "su1 = x[k][k]" and "su2 = x[j][k]" is recomputed in each iteration of the inner-most loop, even though these values do not change throughout the iterations for a given k and j.

2. The matrix function performs two similar loops consecutively. This is unnecessary and leads to code duplication, which increases complexity and can introduce errors.

3. The matrix function performs division inside a loop. Division is a computationally expensive operation and should be avoided inside loops whenever possible.

4. The use of **x is not necessary, it can be replaced with a simpler data structure.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The redundant computations can be eliminated by moving "su1 = x[k][k]" and "su2 = x[j][k]" outside the inner-most loop.

2. The two similar loops can be merged into a single loop by introducing a condition within the loop to decide which formula to use.

3. The division can be moved outside the loop by using multiplication with the reciprocal instead. 

4. The use of **x can be replaced by a simple 2D array.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Move "su1 = x[k][k]" and "su2 = x[j][k]" outside the inner-most loop: This will reduce the number of computations per iteration and improve performance.

2. Merge the two similar loops: This will reduce code duplication and improve readability and maintainability.

3. Use multiplication with the reciprocal instead of division: This will reduce the computational complexity and improve performance.

4. Replace **x with a 2D array: This will simplify the code and may improve performance.

Trade-offs: The optimized code will be more complex due to the introduction of a conditional within the loop. However, this increase in complexity is justified by the performance gain.

Optimized Code Block:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define N 2
int matrix(double x[N][N + 1]);
int main(void) {
  double x[N][N + 1];
  int i;
  char str[100];

    sscanf(str, "%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &x[0][0], &x[0][1], &x[0][2],
           &x[1][0], &x[1][1], &x[1][2]);
    matrix(x);
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      if (i)
        printf(" ");
      printf("%3.3f", x[i][N]);
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
int matrix(double x[N][N + 1]) {
  int i, j, k;
  double su1, su2, su1_reciprocal;
  for (k = 0; k <= N - 2; k++) {
    for (j = k + 1; j <= N - 1; j++) {
      su1 = x[k][k];
      su2 = x[j][k];
      su1_reciprocal = 1.0 / su1;
      for (i = 0; i <= 2; i++) {
        if (k == 0) {
          x[j][i] -= x[k][i] * su2 * su1_reciprocal;
        } else {
          x[1 - j][i] -= x[1 - k][i] * (x[1 - j][1 - k] / x[1 - k][1 - k]);
        }
      }
    }
  }
  for (j = 0; j <= N - 1; j++) {
    su1 = x[j][j];
    su1_reciprocal = 1.0 / su1;
    for (i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
      x[j][i] *= su1_reciprocal;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
