1. Code Analysis:

The given code reads a list of matrices (2x3) from the standard input. For each matrix, it performs a certain mathematical operation on each of its elements. After performing the operation, the last column of the matrix is printed. 

The performance of this code can be improved by optimizing the matrix function and by reducing the overhead of reading from the standard input.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Inefficient data structures: The data structure used in this code is a 2-dimensional array, which is appropriate for the task. Therefore, no changes are necessary in this regard.

B. Redundant computations: In the matrix function, there are repeated calculations of x[k][k], x[j][k] and x[1 - k][1 - k], x[1 - j][1 - k]. Storing these values in variables before the loops would eliminate redundant computations.

C. Loop optimization: The matrix function includes loops that iterate over the matrix rows and columns. These loops can be optimized by unrolling them, which will reduce the overhead of loop counter incrementation and end condition checking.

D. Compiler optimizations: The -O3 flag can be used when compiling the code. This flag enables all compiler optimizations, which can significantly improve the execution speed of the program.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. The first step is to analyze the loops in the matrix function. The loops iterate over the elements of the matrix and perform certain operations. These operations involve division and multiplication, which are computationally expensive. The same value is used multiple times within the loop, so it is beneficial to store this value in a variable before the loop. This will reduce the number of operations performed inside the loop, thus improving performance.

B. The next step is to unroll the loops. Loop unrolling involves duplicating the body of the loop a fixed number of times, reducing the overhead of loop counter incrementation and end condition checking. Since the value of N is small (2), we can fully unroll the loops. This will improve performance but will increase the size of the code.

C. The final step is to use the -O3 compiler flag. This flag enables all compiler optimizations, which can significantly improve the execution speed of the program.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define N 2

int matrix(double **x);

int main(void) {
    double x[N][N + 1];
    double *y[N];
    char str[100];

    while(fgets(str, sizeof(str), stdin)) {
        sscanf(str, "%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &x[0][0], &x[0][1], &x[0][2], &x[1][0], &x[1][1], &x[1][2]);

        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
            y[i] = x[i];

        matrix(y);

        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (i)
                printf(" ");
            printf("%3.3f", x[i][N]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

int matrix(double **x) {
    double su1, su2;

    // Fully unrolling the loop
    su1 = x[0][0];
    su2 = x[1][0];
    x[1][0] = x[1][0] - x[0][0] * su2 / su1;
    x[1][1] = x[1][1] - x[0][1] * su2 / su1;
    x[1][2] = x[1][2] - x[0][2] * su2 / su1;

    su1 = x[1][1];
    su2 = x[0][1];
    x[0][0] = x[0][0] - x[1][0] * su2 / su1;
    x[0][1] = x[0][1] - x[1][1] * su2 / su1;
    x[0][2] = x[0][2] - x[1][2] * su2 / su1;

    su1 = x[0][0];
    x[0][0] = x[0][0] / su1;
    x[0][1] = x[0][1] / su1;
    x[0][2] = x[0][2] / su1;

    su1 = x[1][1];
    x[1][0] = x[1][0] / su1;
    x[1][1] = x[1][1] / su1;
    x[1][2] = x[1][2] / su1;

    return 0;
}
```

Remember to use the -O3 flag when compiling this code to enable all compiler optimizations. This flag can significantly improve the execution speed of the program.
