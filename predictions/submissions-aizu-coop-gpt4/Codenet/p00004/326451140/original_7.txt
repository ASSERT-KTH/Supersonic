Code Analysis:

The given C code consists of a main function and a matrix function. The main function reads multiple lines of six floating-point values from standard input. Each line forms a 2x3 matrix, which is then processed through the matrix function.

The matrix function seems to be performing Gaussian elimination, a method for solving linear systems of equations. It is a two-step process: the forward elimination step and the backward substitution step.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Unnecessary Memory Usage: In the main function, the 2D double array 'x' is created, and then pointers to the rows of this array are created in 'y'. This is unnecessary as the array 'x' can be passed directly to the matrix function. This would save memory.

2. Redundant Computations: In the matrix function, there are redundant computations for 'su1' and 'su2'. These computations are performed in the inner loops, even though 'su1' and 'su2' do not change within those loops. These computations should be moved outside the innermost loops to avoid redundant calculations.

3. Loop Unrolling: The loop that performs division in the matrix function could be unrolled for better performance. However, since the value of 'N' is small (2), loop unrolling might not provide significant improvement.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimization flags could be used to further optimize the code. For example, the -O3 flag for gcc tells the compiler to perform high level of optimization.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove the unnecessary 'y' pointer array and pass the 'x' matrix directly to the matrix function. This simplifies the code and reduces memory usage.

2. Move the computations for 'su1' and 'su2' outside the innermost loops in the matrix function. This eliminates redundant computations, improving performance.

Optimized Code Block:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#define N 2
int matrix(double x[N][N + 1]);
int main(void) {
  double x[N][N + 1];
  int i;
  char str[100];
  for (; fgets(str, sizeof(str), stdin) != NULL;) {
    sscanf(str, "%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &x[0][0], &x[0][1], &x[0][2],
           &x[1][0], &x[1][1], &x[1][2]);
    matrix(x);
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      if (i)
        printf(" ");
      printf("%3.3f", x[i][N]);
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
int matrix(double x[N][N + 1]) {
  int i, j, k;
  double su1, su2;
  for (k = 0; k <= N - 2; k++) {
    su1 = x[k][k]; // Moved out of the inner loop
    for (j = k + 1; j <= N - 1; j++) {
      su2 = x[j][k]; // Moved out of the inner loop
      for (i = 0; i <= 2; i++) {
        x[j][i] -= x[k][i] * su2 / su1;
      }
    }
  }
  for (k = 0; k <= N - 2; k++) {
    su1 = x[1 - k][1 - k]; // Moved out of the inner loop
    for (j = k + 1; j <= N - 1; j++) {
      su2 = x[1 - j][1 - k]; // Moved out of the inner loop
      for (i = 0; i <= 2; i++) {
        x[1 - j][i] -= x[1 - k][i] * su2 / su1;
      }
    }
  }
  for (j = 0; j <= N - 1; j++) {
    su1 = x[j][j]; // Moved out of the inner loop
    for (i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
      x[j][i] /= su1;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this optimization doesn't change the complexity of the algorithm. It simply removes redundant operations and unnecessary memory usage. The output of the program remains the same as the original.
