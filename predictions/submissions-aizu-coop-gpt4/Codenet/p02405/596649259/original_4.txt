Code Analysis:

This code takes in two inputs, H and W, and prints a grid of alternating '.#' characters. The size of the grid is determined by the H and W inputs. The outer loop continues until either H or W is zero.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Reducing I/O operations: One major performance bottleneck in this code is the use of I/O operations within nested loops. In this case, the 'cout' operation is being performed within the inner loop. This is a costly operation and slows down the execution.

2. Using string concatenation: Instead of printing a character at a time, we can concatenate the characters into a string and print the string once for each row.

3. Avoiding unnecessary operations: The condition (i + j) % 2 == 0 is computed for every cell in the grid. Since the pattern is repeating, we can avoid this computation by using a pattern string.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. To reduce the I/O operations, we can create a string for each row and then print the string once. This reduces the number of I/O operations from W to 1 for each row.

2. We can use string concatenation to build the string for each row. This allows us to replace the inner loop with a single statement.

3. Instead of computing (i + j) % 2 == 0 for every cell, we can create two pattern strings ".#.#.#.#..." and "#.#.#.#..." and use these strings to create the rows. This avoids the computation and conditional statement in the inner loop.

Trade-offs:

While this optimization significantly reduces the computation and I/O operations, it slightly increases the memory usage because we are storing the pattern strings and the row strings. However, the increase in memory usage is minimal and is a worthwhile trade-off for the performance gain.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int H, W;
  cin >> H >> W;
  // Creating pattern strings
  string pattern1 = ".#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#";
  string pattern2 = "#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.";
  while (H != 0 && W != 0) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= H; i++) {
      // Using pattern strings to create rows
      if (i % 2 == 1) {
        cout << pattern1.substr(0, W) << endl;
      } else {
        cout << pattern2.substr(0, W) << endl;
      }
    }
    cout << endl;
    cin >> H >> W;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
