## Code Analysis

This program prints a checkerboard pattern of '.' and '#' characters. The pattern's height and width are given by the user. The pattern is generated using nested for loops and modulus operation to determine which character to print. The loops run until the user inputs '0' for both height and width.

## Optimization Strategy

The current code is generally efficient, but there are a few areas where we could make some improvements:

1. Unnecessary computations: The expression `".#"[(i + j) % 2 == 0]` is computed for each value of `i` and `j`. This computation can be reduced by pre-calculating the rows and reusing them.

2. Redundant IO operations: The current code makes many calls to `cout` to print each character. This could be optimized by buffering the output and making fewer calls to `cout`.

3. Compiler optimizations: Using compiler optimizations like `-O2` or `-O3` can help the compiler optimize the code further.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Pre-calculate rows: Instead of calculating each cell individually, we can pre-calculate a row with '.' and '#' and another with '#' and '.'. This way, we only need to calculate once and reuse these rows.

2. Buffer output: Instead of printing each character individually, we can append them to a string and then print the entire string at once. This can significantly reduce the overhead of IO operations.

3. Compiler optimizations: Enable compiler optimizations by adding `-O2` or `-O3` flag during compilation.

## Optimized Code

Here is the optimized code implementing the explained optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int H, W;
  while (cin >> H >> W && H != 0 && W != 0) {
    string even_row, odd_row;
    for (int i = 1; i <= W; i++) {
      if (i % 2 == 0) {
        even_row += '#';
        odd_row += '.';
      } else {
        even_row += '.';
        odd_row += '#';
      }
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= H; i++) {
      if (i % 2 == 0) {
        cout << even_row << endl;
      } else {
        cout << odd_row << endl;
      }
    }
    cout << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces the number of calculations and IO operations, which should improve the performance. Furthermore, enabling compiler optimizations can further improve the execution speed.
