Code Analysis:
The program reads two integer inputs (H and W) and then prints a grid of size H x W, where every alternate cell is filled with '.' or '#'. This pattern continues until the user enters 0 for either H or W. 

The computation here is straightforward and doesn't seem to have any major performance bottlenecks. However, the code can be optimized slightly to reduce unnecessary I/O operations which might slow down the execution in the case of large inputs.

1. Optimization Strategy:

    A. Use Fast Input/Output operations: The C++ standard I/O operations (cin and cout) are generally slower than scanf and printf from C language. So, for large inputs, we can use scanf and printf to improve the I/O operation speed. 

    B. Use character arrays to store each row's pattern: The given code prints each cell individually in a row, which can lead to many I/O operations. Instead, we can store each row's pattern in a character array and print it once for each row, reducing the number of I/O operations. 

    C. Use faster modulo operation: For checking whether the sum of the row and column indexes is even or odd, the code uses the modulo operation. We can use bitwise AND operation instead of modulo operation, as bitwise operations are generally faster.

2. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    A. Use Fast Input/Output operations: Replace cin and cout with scanf and printf. This is because C++'s cin and cout operations are slower and can be a bottleneck when dealing with a large amount of data.

    B. Use character arrays to store each row's pattern: Create two character arrays, one for rows where the first cell is '.' and the other where the first cell is '#'. Fill these arrays alternatively based on the row number and print the entire row at once using printf. This reduces the number of I/O operations, leading to faster execution.

    C. Use faster modulo operation: Replace (i + j) % 2 with (i + j) & 1. The bitwise AND operation is faster than the modulo operation. Here, it checks if the least significant bit is 1, which is equivalent to checking if the number is odd.

3. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
  int H, W;
  scanf("%d %d", &H, &W);
  char row1[W+2], row2[W+2];
  for (int i = 1; i <= W; i++) {
    row1[i] = ".#"[(i) & 1];
    row2[i] = ".#"[(i+1) & 1];
  }
  row1[W+1] = row2[W+1] = '\n';
  row1[W+2] = row2[W+2] = '\0';
  while (H != 0 && W != 0) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= H; i++) {
      printf("%s", ((i & 1) ? row1 : row2));
    }
    printf("\n");
    scanf("%d %d", &H, &W);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In the improved code, we are using scanf and printf instead of cin and cout for faster I/O operations. We are also using the bitwise AND operator for faster modulo calculation. Furthermore, we are reducing the number of I/O operations by creating and storing two types of rows in arrays and printing them as whole strings instead of character by character. This optimized code has the same output as the original code but runs faster for large inputs.
