The provided code is a simple C++ program that reads in two integers, H and W, and generates a pattern of "." and "#" characters in a H by W grid. The pattern alternates between "." and "#" characters on every cell, creating a checker pattern. It keeps reading the pair of integers and generating the pattern until (0,0) is received.

Upon analyzing the program, the areas that can be optimized are as follows:

1. Use of cin and cout: The use of cin and cout can be slower because of synchronization with the C standard libraries. We can disable this synchronization to speed up cin and cout operations.

2. Continuous reallocation of memory: In the nested loop structure, the program constructs the string for each line in a character-by-character manner, which can lead to continuous reallocation of memory. This can be optimized by pre-allocating memory for the string.

3. Unnecessary work: Currently, the program is generating the pattern for each pair of inputs from scratch. However, if the pairs are the same or if the new pair has the same or smaller dimensions than the previous one, the program is repeating work it has already done.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Speed up cin and cout operations by disabling synchronization with C standard libraries
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int H, W;
    cin >> H >> W;

    // Pre-allocate a 2D vector to store the generated pattern
    vector<string> pattern(100, string(100, '.'));

    // Generate the pattern for a 100 by 100 grid
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 100; j++) {
            if ((i + j) % 2 == 0) {
                pattern[i][j] = '#';
            }
        }
    }

    while (H != 0 && W != 0) {
        // Print out the pattern for the given dimensions
        for (int i = 0; i < H; i++) {
            cout << pattern[i].substr(0, W) << "\n";
        }
        cout << "\n";
        cin >> H >> W;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In the optimized version of the code, we:

1. Disable synchronization with C standard libraries to speed up cin and cout operations.
2. Pre-allocate a 2D vector to store the pattern for a 100 by 100 grid. This pre-allocation avoids the continuous reallocation of memory. We are assuming that the inputs H and W will not exceed 100, based on the constraints of the problem. If there are no such constraints, we could dynamically resize the vector based on the inputs.
3. Generate the pattern for a 100 by 100 grid once at the start of the program. By doing this upfront, we avoid regenerating the pattern for each pair of inputs.
4. When given a pair of inputs, we simply print out the relevant part of the pattern. This avoids unnecessary work for repeat or smaller pairs of inputs.

The trade-off is that the optimized version uses more memory upfront to store the pattern for a 100 by 100 grid. However, this is a reasonable trade-off for the increased speed, especially for larger inputs.
