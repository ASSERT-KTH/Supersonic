**Code Analysis:**

This program receives pairs of values for height (H) and width (W) from the input until a pair of zeros is given. For each pair, it prints a grid of alternating "." and "#" characters of height H and width W, with each line starting with a "." character.

**Potential Bottlenecks:**

1. The use of `cout << endl` in the inner loop could be a performance bottleneck. The `endl` not only inserts a newline character but also flushes the output buffer each time, which is more time-consuming than simply inserting a newline character.

2. The use of `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations could be slow. These can be made faster by disabling synchronization with the C standard libraries.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. Replace `cout << endl` with `cout << '\n'` to avoid unnecessary buffer flushing.

2. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable synchronization with C standard libraries and speed up input/output operations.

3. Use `cin.tie(NULL)` to untie `cin` from `cout`. By default, `cin` is tied to `cout` to ensure a sensible order of console output and input. But in this case, since we don't need to read after writing or write after reading, we can untie them to possibly improve performance.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Remove `cout << endl` and replace it with `cout << '\n'`. `endl` flushes the buffer each time it is called, which is more time-consuming than simply inserting a newline character.

2. Add `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` at the start of the main function. This disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. By default, all standard streams are automatically synchronized, which ensures a predictable order of output. However, this synchronization causes some overhead, slowing down the input/output operations. Since we don't need to mix C and C++ style I/O in this program, we can safely disable this synchronization.

3. Add `cin.tie(NULL)`. By default, `cin` is tied to `cout` to make sure that the output and input are ordered properly. However, in this program, we don't need to read after writing or write after reading, so we can untie `cin` and `cout` to possibly improve performance.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int H, W;
  cin >> H >> W;
  while (H != 0 && W != 0) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= H; i++) {
      for (int j = 1; j <= W; j++) {
        cout << ".#"[(i + j) % 2 == 0];
      }
      cout << '\n';
    }
    cout << '\n';
    cin >> H >> W;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should run faster than the original code due to the decreased overhead from input/output operations and buffer flushing. The functionality and output remain the same.
