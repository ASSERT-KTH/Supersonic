Code Analysis:
The given code accepts two integers H and W in a loop until both are non-zero. Then, it prints a grid of H rows and W columns where each cell is either filled with '.' or '#', alternating the filling based on whether the sum of the cell's row number and column number is even or odd.

Optimization Strategy:
This code is quite optimized in terms of time complexity, but we can still perform a few changes to improve it further:

1. Use of I/O Operations: The current code uses cin and cout for input and output, which are slower compared to printf and scanf.

2. Optimizing I/O operations: For better performance, we can use Fast I/O methods, which can be achieved by turning off sync with the C standard I/O streams and ignoring any tie to the C and C++ standard streams. 

3. Reducing Unnecessary Operations: In the expression ".#"[(i + j) % 2 == 0], we are performing a modulo operation, which is computationally heavy compared to simple operations like addition or subtraction.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace cin and cout with scanf and printf for faster I/O.

2. Turn off sync with the C standard I/O streams and ignore any tie to the C and C++ standard streams for faster I/O operations.

3. Instead of performing a modulo operation on every iteration, we can just keep track of the current cell's value by toggling it on every iteration. This way, we'll only be performing a simple assignment operation, which is faster than modulo.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int H, W;
  while (scanf("%d %d", &H, &W) && H != 0 && W != 0) {
    char cell = '.';
    for (int i = 1; i <= H; i++) {
      for (int j = 1; j <= W; j++) {
        printf("%c", cell);
        cell = (cell == '.' ? '#' : '.');
      }
      printf("\n");
      if(W % 2 == 0) cell = (cell == '.' ? '#' : '.');
    }
    printf("\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
```
The optimized code has the same functionality as the original code, but with improved performance due to faster I/O operations and the use of less computationally intensive operations. The trade-off here is a slight increase in code complexity due to the additional handling for the alternating cell value.
