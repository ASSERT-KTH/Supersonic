Code Analysis:
1. This program appears to be a solution for some kind of problem involving range maximum queries (RMQ) and segment trees. It uses a segment tree to perform range additions and get maximum values in a range. It also maintains an array of pairs for RMQ.
2. Input is taken from the user for the number of elements (N) and a value H. The program then takes N-1 pairs of values as input and performs a series of operations on these inputs.
3. The solve() function is the heart of the program and where all the computation occurs. It consists of a series of nested loops and recursive calls which are potential sources of inefficiency. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: The program uses arrays to store data, which is efficient. However, we can see that there are some redundant arrays. For example, seg_v and seg_a could be combined into a struct or a pair. This would make it easier to manage the data and could reduce errors.
2. Redundant Computations: There are several repeated calculations, such as seg_getMax(fl, fl + 1) and seg_getMax(idx, fl). These could be stored in variables to avoid repeated computation. 
3. Loop Optimization: The solve() function contains a while(true) loop, which is generally not recommended due to the risk of infinite loops. This loop can be optimized by changing the condition to reflect when it should actually stop.
4. Compiler Optimizations: We could use compiler flags to optimize the program. For example, the -O2 or -O3 flags could be used with gcc to enable various performance optimizations during compilation.

Step by Step Explanation:

1. Combine seg_v and seg_a into a struct or pair to make managing the data easier and potentially reduce errors. 

```cpp
struct segTree {
    int a;
    int v;
};
```

2. Remove redundant computations by storing the results of the functions in variables.

```cpp
int segMaxFL = seg_getMax(fl, fl + 1);
if (segMaxFL > H) {
    seg_add(fl, N, H - segMaxFL);
}
seg_add(fl, N, -d[fl]);
if (segMaxFL > 0)
    continue;
```

3. Change the while(true) loop in the solve() function to a more specific condition. The current condition is when seg_getMax(fl, fl + 1) is not greater than 0.

```cpp
while (seg_getMax(fl, fl + 1) <= 0) {
    // Loop body
}
```

4. Use compiler flags to enable optimization during compilation. This can be done when compiling the program:

```
g++ -O2 -o program program.cpp
```

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 1 << 28;
typedef pair<int, int> Pr;
int N, H;
int d[100000], h[100000];
const int size = 1 << 20;
struct segTree {
    int a;
    int v;
};
segTree seg[size * 2 - 1];
Pr rmq[size * 2 - 1];

// Rest of the code ...

void solve() {
    long long int res = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        rmq_update(i, h[i]);
    }
    seg_add(0, N, H);
    for (int fl = 0; fl < N; fl++) {
        int segMaxFL = seg_getMax(fl, fl + 1);
        if (segMaxFL > H) {
            seg_add(fl, N, H - segMaxFL);
        }
        seg_add(fl, N, -d[fl]);
        if (segMaxFL > 0)
            continue;
        while (seg_getMax(fl, fl + 1) <= 0) {
            int idx = rmq_getMaxIdx(0, fl);
            if (h[idx] > H - seg_getMax(idx, fl)) {
                h[idx] = H - seg_getMax(idx, fl);
                rmq_update(idx, h[idx]);
                continue;
            }
            int s = (H - seg_getMax(idx, fl)) / h[idx];
            int hp = seg_getMax(fl, fl + 1);
            int need = -hp + 1;
            int t = (need / h[idx]) + !!(need % h[idx]);
            int num = min(s, t);
            seg_add(idx, N, h[idx] * num);
            res += num;
        }
    }
    printf("%lld\n", res);
}

// Rest of the code ...
```

In this code, we have combined seg_v and seg_a into a struct, stored the results of repeated function calls in variables to avoid redundant computation, and changed the while(true) loop to have a more specific condition. We also mentioned that the -O2 compiler flag can be used for additional optimization.
