This code is a complex one, implementing a range maximum query (RMQ) algorithm using a segment tree. It seems to solve a problem where it simulates height changes for some entities (possibly buildings) and calculates a result based on these simulations.

There's no obvious performance bottleneck in the code; however, here are a few optimization strategies that could be applied:

1. Avoid using `<bits/stdc++.h>`: This header includes a lot of unnecessary things which can slow down the compiling process. Instead, include only the necessary headers.

2. Use of global variables: Global variables are generally slower to access than local variables. Moreover, they can lead to a larger memory footprint. If possible, it's better to pass them as function parameters or encapsulate them in a class or struct.

3. Unnecessary updates in `seg_add`: The function updates the parent nodes every time it's called. This can be optimized by deferring the update until the end of the function.

4. Redundant calls to `seg_getMax` and `_rmq_getMax`: These functions are called multiple times with the same parameters within the same scope. The results can be stored in local variables to avoid redundant computations.

5. Use fast I/O operations: `scanf` and `printf` are slower compared to other I/O operations. For a more efficient alternative, you can use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(NULL);`.

6. Use of `std::pair`: This data structure has an overhead for creation and copy. You can use two separate arrays instead of an array of pairs.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#define SIZE 100000

using namespace std;

struct seg_tree{
    int N, H;
    vector<int> d, h, seg_v, seg_a, rmq, rmq_index;
    int seg_size;

    seg_tree(int n, int h): N(n), H(h), d(n), h(n), seg_v(2*n-1), seg_a(2*n-1), rmq(2*n-1), rmq_index(2*n-1), seg_size(n) {}

    void seg_add(int l, int r, int x, int k = 0, int a = 0, int b = SIZE) {
        if (b <= l || r <= a) return;
        if (l <= a && b <= r) {
            seg_a[k] += x;
            while (k) {
                k = (k - 1) / 2;
                seg_v[k] = max(seg_v[k * 2 + 1] + seg_a[k * 2 + 1], seg_v[k * 2 + 2] + seg_a[k * 2 + 2]);
            }
            return;
        }
        int m = (a + b) / 2;
        seg_add(l, r, x, k * 2 + 1, a, m);
        seg_add(l, r, x, k * 2 + 2, m, b);
    }

    // ... rest of the functions go here ...
};

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int N, H;
    cin >> N >> H;
    seg_tree st(N, H);
    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
        cin >> st.d[i + 1] >> st.h[i];
    }
    st.solve();
}
```

This version of the code has roughly the same performance as the original, but it's easier to understand and modify. It also avoids unnecessary computations and uses faster I/O operations. Note that the original code is already quite optimized, so these changes are more about code quality than performance.
