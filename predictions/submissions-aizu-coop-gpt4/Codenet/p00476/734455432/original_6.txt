Here are some optimization suggestions:

1. Code Analysis: 
   - The code creates two segment trees, `seg` and `rmq`, which are used for range updates and range maximum queries. It also uses arrays `d` and `h` to store input data.
   - The `solve` function performs the core computation. It first initializes the `rmq` tree, then updates and queries the segment trees in a loop.
   - The code is computation-heavy due to the repeated range updates and queries on the segment trees.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Data Structure Optimization: The data structures used in the current solution are already efficient for the problem at hand. Segment trees are suitable for range update and range query operations.
   - Redundant Computations: Certain calculations, like `seg_getMax(fl, fl + 1)`, are performed multiple times. We can store the result of these computations and reuse them to reduce redundancy.
   - Compiler Optimization: We can use the `-O3` flag during compilation for automatic code optimization.
   - Use of `#pragma` directives: `#pragma` directives can be used for loop unrolling or parallelizing loops if the hardware supports multi-threading.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   - Store result of repeated calls: We can store the result of `seg_getMax(fl, fl + 1)` in a variable and reuse it, which will reduce the number of function calls and thereby increase performance.
   - Compiler optimization: Use `-O3` flag during compilation to enable the compiler to perform automatic code optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, etc. This might increase the binary size but will increase the execution speed.
   - Use of `#pragma` directives: If the hardware supports multi-threading, loops in the `solve` function can be parallelized using OpenMP `#pragma` directives. However, this may lead to increased complexity and potential thread synchronization issues.

4. Optimized Code Block: Here is the optimized code with the above mentioned changes.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 1 << 28;
typedef pair<int, int> Pr;
int N, H;
int d[100000], h[100000];
const int size = 1 << 20;
int seg_v[size * 2 - 1];
int seg_a[size * 2 - 1];
Pr rmq[size * 2 - 1];

// Rest of the code remains the same

void solve() {
  long long int res = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    rmq_update(i, h[i]);
  }
  seg_add(0, N, H);
  for (int fl = 0; fl < N; fl++) {
    int segMax = seg_getMax(fl, fl + 1); // Store result of function call
    if (segMax > H) {
      seg_add(fl, N, H - segMax);
    }
    seg_add(fl, N, -d[fl]);
    segMax = seg_getMax(fl, fl + 1); // Reuse stored result
    if (segMax > 0)
      continue;
    while (true) {
      int idx = rmq_getMaxIdx(0, fl);
      if (h[idx] > H - seg_getMax(idx, fl)) {
        h[idx] = H - seg_getMax(idx, fl);
        rmq_update(idx, h[idx]);
        continue;
      }
      int s = (H - seg_getMax(idx, fl)) / h[idx];
      int hp = segMax; // Reuse stored result
      int need = -hp + 1;
      int t = (need / h[idx]) + !!(need % h[idx]);
      int num = min(s, t);
      seg_add(idx, N, h[idx] * num);
      res += num;
      if (seg_getMax(fl, fl + 1) > 0)
        break;
    }
  }
  printf("%lld\n", res);
}

// Rest of the code remains the same
```
Please note that the effectiveness of compiler optimizations and `#pragma` directives will depend on the specific hardware and compiler. Also, these optimizations may increase code complexity and potential issues like thread synchronization in case of parallelization. Hence, they should be used judiciously and with appropriate testing.
