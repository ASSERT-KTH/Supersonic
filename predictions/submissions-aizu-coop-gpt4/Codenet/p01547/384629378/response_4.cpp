This program seems to perform complex geometric calculations, including finding the convex hull of a set of points, checking if points are within a polygon, and dividing a convex into multiple parts. It also includes a distance matrix calculation for the arrangement of multiple convex objects.

Analyzing the code, there are several areas where optimization can be applied:

1. Code Reusability: There are multiple instances where the same logic is being processed over and over again, such as point-in-polygon checks and intersection checks. This can be optimized by creating reusable functions.

2. Redundant Computations: The code repeatedly calculates certain values inside loops, which can be computed once and stored for future use.

3. Data Structures: Certain data structures like vector of vectors (Vcon & a) are being passed around multiple functions which could be heavy on memory. 

4. Variable Definitions: Defining variables like VP V[n] in the middle of the code can lead to unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation.

5. Computation of Convex Arrangement: The Convex_arrangement function calculates the arrangement of multiple convex objects with a time complexity of O(n^2). This can potentially be optimized.

6. Use of `#define`: The use of `#define` for macros could be replaced with `const` or `inline` functions for type safety and readability.

7. Use of `using namespace std;`: It is generally recommended to avoid this practice to prevent name clashes.

Proposed Optimization Strategy:
1. Extract the repeated logic into separate functions to improve code reusability.
2. Avoid redundant computations inside loops by precomputing and storing results.
3. Use more efficient data structures where possible and avoid passing heavy structures unnecessarily.
4. Move variable definitions to the top of the code block to avoid unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation.
5. Experiment with more efficient algorithms for the calculation of convex arrangement.
6. Replace `#define` with `const` or `inline` functions where possible.
7. Avoid `using namespace std;` and use explicit namespaces instead.
