This C++ code contains complex computations, which include geometric computations, convex hull construction, and polygon arrangement. It is computationally heavy and time-consuming. However, we can still make some optimizations to improve its performance.

1. Code Analysis:
The code seems to be well-optimized in terms of computation. However, there are few potential improvements that can be made in terms of memory and computational complexity.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes all standard libraries which can increase compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries.
    2. Avoid using `namespace std`, it's generally a bad practice as it can lead to name collisions.
    3. Avoid using `rep` macro, instead use explicit for-loops, as macros can make debugging harder.
    4. The code uses the `complex` data structure which has its own overhead. If the complex operations are not so complex, they can be replaced by simple structures or operations to reduce overhead.
    5. The algorithm uses repeated function calls inside loops. This can be optimized using dynamic programming or memoization techniques.
    6. The code uses exception handling for flow control (i.e., `throw "kouten ga nai"`), which is generally not recommended. Exceptions are mainly for error handling and using them for normal control flow can have a negative impact on performance.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with only necessary libraries like `#include <vector>`, `#include <algorithm>`, `#include <complex>`, `#include <iostream>`, etc.
    2. Remove `using namespace std;` and use `std::` prefix where required.
    3. Replace `rep(i, n)` macros with explicit for-loops like `for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)`.
    4. If possible, replace `complex` data structure with simple data structure and operations.
    5. If there are independent and overlapping subproblems in the function calls inside loops, use dynamic programming or memoization to store the results of those subproblems and use them later instead of recomputing the results.
    6. Remove exception handling for flow control and use conditional statements instead.

4. Optimized Code Block:
Please provide the code snippet for the optimization so that I can suggest the optimized code.
