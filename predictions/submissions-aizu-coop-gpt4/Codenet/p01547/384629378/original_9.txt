After analyzing the code, multiple opportunities for optimization can be identified. Here is the proposed optimization strategy:

1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The provided code does not seem to use inefficient data structures. However, the code could benefit from some type aliasing for more readable and maintainable code.

2. **Redundant Computations:** There are various places in the code where computations are repeated. For example, the ccw function is called multiple times in different functions with the same arguments. Such redundant computations can be avoided by storing the result in a variable and reusing it.

3. **Loops or Recursive Calls:** The code contains nested for-loops and functions that are called within loops. These could potentially be optimized by using more efficient algorithms, or by minimizing the number of function calls.

4. **Compiler Optimizations or Pragma Directives:** To optimize the code further, you can use compiler optimizations and pragma directives. However, these should be used with caution as they can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior or make the code less readable.

Below are the detailed explanations for each optimization step:

1. **Use Type Aliasing:** Instead of using complex data types directly in the code, you can use the `typedef` keyword to create an alias for these types. This helps to make the code more readable and maintainable.

2. **Avoid Redundant Computations:** Whenever the same computation is performed multiple times with the same arguments, store the result in a variable and reuse it. This not only reduces the number of computations but also makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.

3. **Optimize Loops and Function Calls:** Try to minimize the number of function calls within loops, especially if the function is computationally expensive. Also, consider using more efficient algorithms where possible.

4. **Use Compiler Optimizations:** Compiler optimizations can help to improve the performance of the code. For example, the `-O3` option for the GCC compiler enables all optimization levels, including loop unrolling and function inlining.

The trade-off for these optimizations is that the code may become less readable or more complex. However, by using good coding practices such as commenting and proper variable naming, this can be mitigated.

Before providing the optimized code, it's important to note that without a detailed understanding of the purpose of the code and how it's used, some optimizations may not be beneficial or could even be harmful. It's always recommended to thoroughly test the optimized code to ensure it's still functioning as expected.
