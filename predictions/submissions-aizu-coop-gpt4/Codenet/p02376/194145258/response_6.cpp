The provided C++ code is implementing a max flow algorithm. This program can be optimized in several ways:

1. Code Analysis:
    1. Excessive use of dynamic memory allocation: The code frequently uses `new` to create nodes. This operation is expensive and can slow down the program.
    2. Non-optimal data structures: The code uses a vector of vectors (`vector<vector<int>>`) for the adjacency list, which can lead to inefficient memory usage.
    3. Redundant computations: The code frequently calls the `expose()` function. Each call performs a full traversal of the splay tree, which can be quite expensive.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Use static memory allocation whenever possible: Instead of creating nodes dynamically, allocate them once and reuse them.
    2. Use more efficient data structures: Use an adjacency list with a more efficient data structure like `std::list` or `std::forward_list`, which have better performance for insertions and deletions.
    3. Reduce redundant computations: Minimize the calls to the `expose()` function. Try to batch multiple operations together to reduce the overall number of function calls.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Static Memory Allocation: Instead of calling `new node_t(i, INF)` every time a node is needed, allocate an array of `node_t` objects once and reuse them. 
    2. Efficient Data Structures: Replace the `vector<vector<int>>` with a more suitable data structure like `std::list` or `std::forward_list`. These data structures provide more efficient insertions and deletions, which can be beneficial for the adjacency list.
    3. Reduce Redundant Computations: Instead of calling `expose()` multiple times in a loop, try to batch these operations together. This will reduce the overhead of calling the function and can improve the program's performance.
