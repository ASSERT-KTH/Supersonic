The provided code is an implementation of the Maximum Flow algorithm. It uses a variation of the Dinitz algorithm with Link-Cut Trees.

Here are some potential areas for optimization:

1. **Avoid the use of #include <bits/stdc++.h>**: Using <bits/stdc++.h> is not good practice as it includes all standard library headers, which can significantly slow down the compilation process. It's better to include only the necessary headers.

2. **Use of 'fill' and 'new' inside the while loop in max_flow function**: The 'fill' function and 'new' operator are being used inside a while loop. Each call to these functions has its own overhead, so it's better to minimize their usage inside loops.

3. **Use an adjacency list to represent the graph**: The current implementation uses an array of vectors to represent the edges of the graph. While this is a common approach, it can be less efficient in terms of memory usage and access times than a proper adjacency list data structure.

4. **Avoid usage of 'inline' keyword**: The 'inline' keyword is used excessively in the code. The 'inline' keyword is a hint to the compiler that it should attempt to insert the complete body of the function in every context where that function is used. In modern compilers, they have their own algorithms to determine what should be inlined, regardless of whether or not the inline keyword is used, so it's often not necessary to use it.

5. **Use of global variables**: The code uses several global variables. It's generally better to avoid global variables when possible, as they can make the code harder to understand and maintain.

6. **Use of pointers**: The code uses raw pointers to manage memory. This can lead to memory leaks if not handled properly. It would be better to use smart pointers that automatically manage memory.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace #include <bits/stdc++.h> with specific headers.
2. Move 'fill' and 'new' outside the while loop in max_flow function, if possible.
3. Replace the array of vectors with an adjacency list data structure.
4. Remove the 'inline' keyword.
5. Avoid using global variables. Instead, pass necessary parameters to functions.
6. Replace raw pointers with smart pointers.
