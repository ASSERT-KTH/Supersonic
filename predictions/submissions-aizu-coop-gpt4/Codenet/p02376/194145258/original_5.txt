This code appears to be an implementation of the maximum flow algorithm, which is used in network flow problems. Here are the steps to optimize this code:

1. **Code Analysis**: The code contains some inefficient and redundant operations. For instance, it repeatedly computes `minId(s)` and `find_root(s)` in a loop, which could be optimized. Also, there might be potential performance improvements possible in the `max_flow` function.

2. **Optimization Strategy**:
    1. **Data Structures**: The data structures seem to be chosen appropriately. However, the use of `vector` for `g` and `lists` could be replaced with other data structures if it enhances performance or memory usage.
    2. **Redundant Computations**: The code could benefit from avoiding redundant computations. For instance, the `minId(s)` and `find_root(s)` calls are computed multiple times with the same argument `s` in a loop. They can be computed once and stored in a variable.
    3. **Loops and Recursive Calls**: The loop in the `max_flow` function could be optimized. Currently, it iterates until `bfs(S, T)` returns false. This can be optimized if we can find a way to break the loop earlier.
    4. **Compiler Optimizations**: Some compiler optimizations such as `-O2` or `-O3` can be used to automatically optimize the code. Also, some pragma directives can be used to hint the compiler about loop unrolling or function inlining.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    1. **Avoiding Redundant Computations**: We will replace multiple calls to `minId(s)` and `find_root(s)` with a single call and store the result in a variable. This will reduce the number of function calls, resulting in a performance improvement.
    2. **Optimizing the Loop**: We will break the loop in `max_flow` function as soon as possible. This will reduce the number of iterations, leading to a performance improvement.
    3. **Compiler Optimizations**: We will add pragma directives to hint the compiler about possible loop unrolling or function inlining. This can improve performance by reducing the overhead of function calls or loop iterations.

4. **Optimized Code Block**: Given the complex nature of the code, I'll need to see the specific data you're dealing with to provide a more targeted optimization solution. However, here's a general approach to some of the changes that can be made:

```c++
// ...

// Replace multiple calls to minId(s) and find_root(s) with a single call and store the result in a variable.
node_t *v;
int minId_s;

// ...
while (true) {
  v = find_root(s);
  if (v == t) {
    minId_s = minId(s);
    expose(v = nodes[minId_s]);
    flow += v->mini;
    add(s, -v->mini);
    while (true) {
      minId_s = minId(s);
      expose(v = nodes[minId_s]);
      if (v->val > 0)
        break;
      g[v->e->to][v->e->rev].cap += v->e->cap;
      v->e->cap = 0;
      cut(v);
    }
    continue;
  }

  // ...

}
// ...
```

Please note that the optimized code may have trade-offs such as increased code complexity and maintenance difficulty. Therefore, it's crucial to consider these trade-offs before implementing the optimizations.
