Firstly, I would like to say that this code is implementing a maximum flow algorithm, more specifically the Dinic's algorithm, using splay trees.

Let's start with the code analysis and optimization strategy:

1. Code Analysis:
    1. The code uses a lot of dynamic memory allocation with `new node_t` in the `max_flow` function. This can be a performance bottleneck as dynamic memory allocation is slow.
    2. The code contains deep nested loops, which can lead to high computational complexity.
    3. The code uses `std::vector` in several places. While `std::vector` is very flexible and easy to use, it might not be the most efficient data structure for this use case.
    4. The use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;` is generally discouraged because it includes a lot of unnecessary code and can lead to name collisions.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Minimize dynamic memory allocation by pre-allocating memory.
    2. Try to simplify or optimize the deep nested loops.
    3. Consider using more efficient data structures instead of `std::vector`.
    4. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;` with only the necessary includes and using declarations.

Now let's go through the optimization steps:

1. Minimize Dynamic Memory Allocation:
    1. We can pre-allocate memory for `node_t` objects by creating an array of `node_t` objects. This array can be reused in each iteration by resetting the necessary fields instead of creating new objects.
    2. Trade-off: The code will become slightly more complex because we have to manually reset the necessary fields in each iteration.

2. Optimize Deep Nested Loops:
    1. It's hard to optimize the deep nested loops without changing the algorithm itself. The main optimization is to reduce unnecessary computations within the loops.
    2. Trade-off: we might lose some readability.

3. Use More Efficient Data Structures:
    1. It's hard to replace `std::vector` with a more efficient data structure because `std::vector` is already very efficient for most use cases. However, we can reserve space for `std::vector` in advance to avoid unnecessary reallocations.
    2. Trade-off: It may use more memory than necessary if we overestimate the size.

4. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;`:
    1. We can replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with only the necessary includes. Also, we can replace `using namespace std;` with only the necessary using declarations.
    2. Trade-off: This will make the code slightly longer, but it will also make the code more portable and less likely to have name collisions.

Let's go to the final optimized code block. But before that, it's important to note that this optimized code is subjective to the system architecture, compiler, and the input data. So it's always important to test the optimized code in the actual environment to ensure the performance improvement.
