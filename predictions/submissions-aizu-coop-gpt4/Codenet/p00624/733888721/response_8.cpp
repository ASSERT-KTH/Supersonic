The code provided is a complex C++ program, which seems to implement a certain type of search algorithm over a grid-like structure. It uses an exhaustive search approach, which might consume extensive processing power and memory, especially for larger inputs. The code includes a large number of repetitive loops and array checks which could be optimized for better performance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use Efficient Data Structures: The current code uses arrays for storing data, which can be inefficient for certain operations. Consider using more efficient data structures where appropriate, such as hash-maps for quick lookup operations.
2. Avoid Redundant Computations: The code performs many computations that could be stored and reused, rather than being recalculated each time. 
3. Optimize Loops and Recursive Calls: The code has several nested loops, which result in a high time complexity. Consider ways to reduce this, such as loop unrolling or reordering.
4. Compiler Optimizations: Take advantage of compiler optimizations, such as -O2 or -O3, to automatically optimize the code at compile time.

Optimization Steps:
1. Replace Arrays with Hash-Maps: In the 'state' struct, replace the arrays 'cx' and 'cy' with hash-maps to improve lookup efficiency.
2. Store Intermediate Results: In the 'BFS' function, the cost of each cell in the grid is calculated each time the function is called. Instead, calculate this once and store it for future use.
3. Unroll Loops: Consider unrolling the loops in the 'input' and 'BFS' functions, which are iterating over the dimensions of the grid.
4. Use Compiler Optimizations: Compile the code with the -O2 or -O3 flags to allow the compiler to automatically optimize the code.

Trade-offs:
1. The use of hash-maps instead of arrays may increase the complexity of the code, but it will improve the time efficiency of lookup operations.
2. Storing intermediate results can increase memory usage, but it will reduce the time taken for computations in the long run.
3. Loop unrolling can make the code longer and harder to read, but it can significantly improve the performance of the code.
4. Compiler optimizations can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, so it's important to thoroughly test the code after applying them.
