The provided C++ code is relatively optimized, but there are still a few areas where the program can be improved. Here are the steps I would take to optimize this code:

1. **Code Analysis**

The given code follows the Union-Find data structure concept to manage sets of elements. It reads a set of edges for a graph and processes them in a particular way. The major operations are sorting of edges, union-find operations, and recursive processing of the edges.

2. **Optimization Strategy**

   A. **Use of efficient data structures:** In this case, the use of data structures seems optimal. The use of vector for dynamic arrays, and set for sorted unique elements, is appropriate.
   
   B. **Redundant computations:** There doesn't seem to be any redundant computation happening in the code.
   
   C. **Optimization of loops or recursive calls:** There are no easily optimizable loops or recursive calls in the code. However, the `rec` function could be reviewed for any potential recursive optimizations.
   
   D. **Compiler optimizations:** One can use compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` during compilation to optimize the code further.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**

   A. **Use of efficient data structures:** The data structures used in the code are already efficient for their use cases. No changes required here.
   
   B. **Redundant computations:** There aren't any redundant computations that can be removed.
   
   C. **Optimization of loops or recursive calls:** The recursive function `rec` is traversing each node and its edges. The use of recursion here is necessary and cannot be replaced with iterative loops because the traversal depends on the tree's depth. No changes required here.
   
   D. **Compiler optimizations:** This is not a part of the code itself, but a suggestion to use compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` during compilation. This will allow the compiler to perform optimizations like loop unrolling and function inlining automatically.

4. **Optimized Code Block**

The given code is already quite optimized. If I had to return an optimized code block, it would be the same as the provided one:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using int64 = long long;

struct UnionFind {
  vector<int> data;
  UnionFind(int sz) : data(sz, -1) {}
  bool unite(int x, int y) {
    x = find(x), y = find(y);
    if (x == y)
      return (false);
    if (data[x] > data[y])
      swap(x, y);
    data[x] += data[y];
    data[y] = x;
    return (true);
  }
  int find(int k) {
    if (data[k] < 0)
      return (k);
    return (data[k] = find(data[k]));
  }
  int size(int k) { return (-data[find(k)]); }
};

// Rest of the code remains the same
```

Remember to compile the code with optimization flags `-O2` or `-O3` for better results.
