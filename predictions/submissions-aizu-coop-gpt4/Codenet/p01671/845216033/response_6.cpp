The given code is a C++ program that uses union-find data structure to solve some graph problem. However, there are multiple ways to optimize this code:

1. Code Analysis:

- The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes all standard library headers. This could slow down the compile-time significantly. Include only the headers which are required by the code.

- A lot of unnecessary copying is done in the loops, which can be avoided by using references or pointers.

- There are multiple variables, like `all` and `ans`, which are defined globally. They can be defined within the function scope where they are used.

- The size of the arrays is fixed and could be dynamically allocated depending on the input size.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Inefficient data structures:

- The `std::vector` is being used as a dynamic array in the code. `std::vector` provides dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted. In this case, the sizes of the vectors are known previously and do not change, so `std::array` would be a more efficient choice.

- The `std::set` is used for storing pairs of integers, with the operations of inserting, erasing and finding elements. A `std::unordered_set` can provide these operations with a better average time complexity.

B. Redundant computations:

- The function `find` in the `UnionFind` structure is not using path compression, which can speed up subsequent `find` operations.

C. Loops and recursive calls:

- In the `rec` function, there is a while-loop erasing elements from one set and inserting them into another. This operation can be optimized by using the `merge` function, which merges two sets in linear time.

D. Compiler optimizations:

- Compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` can be used to enable various optimization features which can speed up the code.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Change `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` to include only necessary headers.
    - This will reduce the compile-time of the code.

B. Use `std::array` instead of `std::vector` where the size is known in advance.
    - This will reduce unnecessary overhead caused by dynamic resizing of `std::vector`.

C. Use `std::unordered_set` instead of `std::set`.
    - This will speed up the operations of insert, erase and search.

D. Use path compression in `UnionFind::find`.
    - This will speed up subsequent `find` operations significantly.

E. Replace the while-loop in the `rec` function with `std::merge`.
    - This will merge two sets in linear time, which is faster than the current implementation.

F. Enable compiler optimization flags.
    - This will make the compiler optimize the code automatically.

G. Move global variables to local scope where they are used.
    - This will make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

H. Avoid unnecessary copying in loops by using references or pointers.
