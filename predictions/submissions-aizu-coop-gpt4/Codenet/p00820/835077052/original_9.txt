1. Code Analysis:

The provided C++ program is a dynamic programming problem, where it calculates the number of ways to represent a number as the sum of four or fewer perfect squares. The program contains a nested loop structure which results in a time complexity of O(n^(3/2)).

2. Optimization Strategy:

   A. Inefficient Data Structures: The current data structure, a 2D array, is appropriate for the task since we need to store the number of ways for various combinations. No change is required.

   B. Redundant Computations: There are no redundant computations as such in this program. All the computations are necessary for the dynamic programming solution.

   C. Loop Optimization: The innermost loop can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary iterations when the value of 'j' is less than 'i*i'.

   D. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler flags like -O2 or -O3 to make the compiler optimize the code further.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   A. Loop Optimization: The innermost loop starts from 'i*i' instead of 0, which means it won't perform unnecessary iterations where 'j' is less than 'i*i'. This saves some computations and hence increases the efficiency of the program.

   B. Compiler Optimizations: Flags like -O2 or -O3 enable the compiler to perform optimizations like loop unrolling, constant propagation, and others, which can further increase the speed of execution.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#define INF 0x3f3f3f3f
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <cctype>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <deque>
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>
#include <list>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <sstream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
typedef pair<int, P> PP;
int tx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int ty[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
static const double EPS = 1e-8;
int dp[1000000][5];
int main() {
  int n;
  while (~scanf("%d", &n)) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
      for (int k = 1; k <= 4; k++) {
        for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j++) {
          dp[j][k] += dp[j - i * i][k - 1];
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", dp[n][4] + dp[n][3] + dp[n][2] + dp[n][1]);
  }
}
```
Please compile this program with -O2 or -O3 flag for further optimizations. Note that the optimized code doesn't lead to any significant trade-offs. It's just as readable and maintainable as the original code, but runs faster due to the loop optimization and compiler optimization flags.
