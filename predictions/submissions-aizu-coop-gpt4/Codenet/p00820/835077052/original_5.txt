**1. Code Analysis:**

This C++ program is calculating the number of ways to represent a number `n` as a sum of at most four square numbers. The program uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to represent each number up to `n` with a certain number of square numbers. 

The potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage in the code are:

- The 2D array `dp` is unnecessarily large. It can be reduced in size as we are only using five columns.
- The `memset` function is called in every loop iteration to initialize the entire `dp` array, even though we are only going to use a portion of it. This is inefficient.
- The triple nested loop is causing the program to run in O(n^2) time complexity, which could be optimized.

**2. Optimization Strategy:**

The following steps will be taken to optimize the code:

A. Reduce the size of the `dp` array: Only five columns are being used in the `dp` array. Hence, the second dimension can be reduced to 5.

B. Optimize the initialization of `dp` array: Instead of initializing the whole `dp` array, we will only initialize the portion we are going to use.

C. Optimize the nested loop: Instead of running the innermost loop for each number from `i*i` to `n`, we can start the loop from `n` and go down to `i*i`. This way, we can avoid unnecessary computations.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

A. Reducing the size of `dp` array: This change reduces the memory usage of the program. The `dp` array is only used to keep track of the number of ways to represent a number with a certain number of square numbers. Hence, we only need five columns in the array.

B. Optimizing the initialization of `dp` array: The `memset` function is used to initialize the `dp` array to zero. However, in the original code, the whole `dp` array is being initialized even though only a portion of it is used. This is inefficient and can be improved by only initializing the portion of the `dp` array that is going to be used.

C. Optimizing the nested loop: In the original code, the innermost loop runs for each number from `i*i` to `n`. This is inefficient as the same computations are repeated for each `i`. By starting the loop from `n` and going down to `i*i`, we can avoid these redundant computations. 

**4. Optimized Code Block:**

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
typedef pair<int, P> PP;
int tx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int ty[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
static const double EPS = 1e-8;
int dp[1000001][5];
int main() {
  int n;
  while (~scanf("%d", &n)) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(int)*(n+1)*5); // Optimized memset
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
      for (int k = 1; k <= 4; k++) {
        for (int j = n; j >= i * i; j--) { // Optimized loop
          dp[j][k] += dp[j - i * i][k - 1];
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", dp[n][4] + dp[n][3] + dp[n][2] + dp[n][1]);
  }
}
```

The functionality and output of the code remain the same as the original, but the running time and memory usage have been optimized. The performance improvement will be more noticeable for larger values of `n`.
