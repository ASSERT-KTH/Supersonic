The given code is trying to find the number of ways a number 'n' can be expressed as the sum of 1 to 4 perfect squares. Here is how we can optimize the code:

1. Code Analysis:
    - The code is using a 2-dimensional array 'dp' of size [1000000][5] which is initialized to 0. 
    - A nested for-loop is used to compute the solutions where for each 'i' from 1 to sqrt(n), it calculates all the possible ways to get to 'n' by using the square of 'i', for 1 to 4 perfect squares.
    - After that, it adds up all the different ways for 1 to 4 perfect squares and prints the result.
    - The main performance bottleneck is the use of a 2D array of large size which may not be entirely necessary. This large size is causing a significant amount of unused memory.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Use more space-efficient data structures: The 2D array 'dp' can be replaced by a 1D array, as we are using only 5 columns and we are not using dp[i][j] where j > 4. By removing the extra dimension of the array, we can save a lot of memory.
    2. Redundant computation: The line "dp[j][k] += dp[j - i * i][k - 1];" has a computation "i * i" inside the loop which is redundant. This can be calculated once per for-loop iteration and stored in a temporary variable.
    3. Compiler optimizations: We can use the -O2 or -O3 optimization level of the compiler which would automatically apply many optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, constant folding, etc.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Replace the 2D array 'dp' with a 1D array 'dp'. This will save a lot of memory as we are using only 5 columns of the original 2D array. This change will also simplify the code as we don't need to handle two indexes.
    2. Calculate "i * i" once per iteration of the 'i' loop and store it in a temporary variable. This will reduce the number of multiplications performed in each iteration of the 'j' loop.
    3. Use the -O2 or -O3 optimization level of the compiler. The compiler can perform many automatic optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, constant folding, etc. which can speed up the execution of the code.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#define INF 0x3f3f3f3f
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <cctype>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <deque>
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>
#include <list>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <sstream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
typedef pair<int, P> PP;
int tx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int ty[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
static const double EPS = 1e-8;
int dp[1000000];
int main() {
  int n;
  while (~scanf("%d", &n)) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    dp[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
      int square = i * i; // calculate square once per iteration
      for (int k = 4; k >= 1; k--) { // reverse order to prevent overwriting
        for (int j = square; j <= n; j++) {
          dp[j] += dp[j - square]; // use 1D array
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", dp[n]);
  }
}
```
In this optimized code, we calculate the square of 'i' once per iteration and store it in the 'square' variable. We also use a 1D 'dp' array to save memory. The order of the 'k' loop is reversed to avoid overwriting the 'dp' array.
