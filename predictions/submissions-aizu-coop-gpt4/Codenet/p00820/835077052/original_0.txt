Upon analyzing the code, it is easy to identify that the main performance bottleneck is the triple nested loop in the `main` function. The outer loop is iterating from `1` to `sqrt(n)`, the middle loop is iterating `4` times, and the inner loop is iterating from `i*i` to `n`. This causes the code execution time to grow rapidly for larger values of `n`.

1. **Code Analysis**
   - Triple nested loop is the main performance bottleneck.
   - We are using a 2-dimensional array `dp` for dynamic programming which uses quite a lot of memory.

2. **Optimization Strategy and Explanation**
    1. **Avoid unnecessary iterations**: The inner loop is iterating from `i*i` to `n`. However, we can start from `n` and go backwards until `i*i`. This reduces the amount of computation needed, as we will only calculate the required values.

    2. **Use a 1-dimensional array for dynamic programming**: We don't need to maintain the state for every `k` in the dynamic programming array. We just need to know the current state. We can use a 1-dimensional array and update it in each iteration of the `k` loop. This will greatly reduce the memory usage.

    3. **Precompute `i*i`**: Instead of calculating `i*i` multiple times in the loop, we can calculate it once and reuse it. This minor optimization can also help improve the performance.

    4. **Use `cin` and `cout` with fast I/O**: `scanf` and `printf` are slower compared to `cin` and `cout` when used with fast I/O. We can replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` and use fast I/O.

    5. **Remove unused variables and `#define` statements**: The code contains several unused variables and `#define` statements. Removing these will make the code cleaner and slightly faster.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int dp[1000005];
int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);
    int n;
    while (cin >> n) {
        if (n == 0)
            break;
        fill(dp, dp + n + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
            int square = i * i;
            for (int k = 4; k >= 1; k--) {
                for (int j = n; j >= square; j--) {
                    dp[j] += dp[j - square];
                }
            }
        }
        cout << dp[n] << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Trade-offs:**
- The code has become less readable due to the removal of some of the `#define` statements and the use of fast I/O.
- The optimization steps are relatively minor and won't make a noticeable difference for very large inputs. The time complexity is still O(n*sqrt(n)), which can be quite slow for large inputs.
