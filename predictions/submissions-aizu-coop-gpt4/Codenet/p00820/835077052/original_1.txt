This C++ program computes the number of ways in which a given number can be represented as a sum of at most four perfect squares. The computation is done using dynamic programming, where dp[i][j] holds the count of ways the number `i` can be represented as a sum of `j` perfect squares. 

1. Code Analysis: 

   The main bottleneck in this code is the nested loops in the main function. The outer loop runs in O(sqrt(n)), the middle loop runs in O(4) = O(1), and the inner loop runs in O(n), making the total time complexity O(n*sqrt(n)). Moreover, the memory complexity is O(n) due to the dynamic programming table `dp`.

2. Optimization Strategy:

   A. Inefficient Data Structures: No inefficient data structures have been used.

   B. Redundant Computations: The line `dp[j][k] += dp[j - i * i][k - 1];` is executed multiple times even when the value `dp[j - i * i][k - 1]` has not changed. This value can be stored in a temporary variable to avoid recomputation. 

   C. Loops or Recursive Calls: In this case, it is hard to optimize the loops further as they encompass the entire range of inputs.

   D. Compiler Optimizations: The use of pragma directives or other compiler optimizations is not applicable in this case.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   A. To avoid redundant computations, we will introduce a temporary variable to store the value `dp[j - i * i][k - 1]`, which is used multiple times within the innermost loop.

   B. The trade-off of this optimization is very minor: while it slightly increases the space complexity due to the added temporary variable, it also considerably reduces the time complexity by avoiding redundant computations.

      break;
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
      for (int k = 1; k <= 4; k++) {
        int temp_value = dp[j - i * i][k - 1]; // Store the value in a temporary variable
        for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j++) {
          dp[j][k] += temp_value; // Use the temporary variable here
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", dp[n][4] + dp[n][3] + dp[n][2] + dp[n][1]);
  }
}
```
However, please note this optimization is small and won't make a substantial impact on program's overall performance. The major time complexity is due to the nature of the problem and algorithm used, which can't be optimized significantly without changing the algorithm.
