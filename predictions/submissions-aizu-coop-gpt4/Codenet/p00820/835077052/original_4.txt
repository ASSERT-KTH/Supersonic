Here are the potential optimization steps:

1. **Code Analysis:** 

    The provided code seems to be a dynamic programming solution to a problem. The main bottleneck in this code can be the triple nested loop which contributes to a time complexity of approximately O(nÂ²). This is where our main focus of optimization will lie.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**

    The first step in the strategy is to tackle the triple nested loop. We will aim to reduce the number of iterations the program has to go through. The next step is to optimize the data structures and memory usage of the program.

    1. **Nested Loops Optimization:** The innermost loop depends on the difference `j - i*i`. Instead of iterating over `j` from `i*i` to `n`, we can iterate over `j` from `0` to `n - i*i`, and then add `i*i` to `j` when we update `dp[j][k]`. This change has the potential to reduce the number of iterations in the loop.

    2. **Memory Optimization:** The 2D array `dp` can be quite large depending on the input and could potentially consume a lot of memory. An optimization would be to use a 1D array instead, and for each iteration, create a new array based on the old one. This would use less memory overall. However, this approach has the disadvantage that it would increase the complexity of the code and could potentially slow down the program if the copying operation is expensive. Therefore, we should be careful when applying this optimization and check whether it actually improves the performance.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

    1. **Nested Loops Optimization:** In this step, we reduce the number of iterations in the innermost loop. This is achieved by changing the loop from iterating over `j` from `i*i` to `n`, to iterating over `j` from `0` to `n - i*i`. When we update `dp[j][k]`, we add `i*i` to `j`. This reduces the number of iterations in the loop, as we only iterate over the elements that we actually need to update.

    2. **Memory Optimization:** In this step, we change the 2D array `dp` to a 1D array. This reduces the amount of memory used by the program. However, this comes at the cost of increased code complexity, as we now need to manage a new array for each iteration. We should carefully consider whether this optimization is worth the increased code complexity and potential performance hit.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

```c++
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#define INF 0x3f3f3f3f
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <cctype>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <deque>
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>
#include <list>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <sstream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
typedef pair<int, P> PP;
int tx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int ty[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
static const double EPS = 1e-8;
int dp[1000000][5];
int main() {
  int n;
  while (~scanf("%d", &n)) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
      for (int k = 1; k <= 4; k++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= n - i * i; j++) { // Optimized loop
          dp[j + i * i][k] += dp[j][k - 1]; // Adjusted the index
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", dp[n][4] + dp[n][3] + dp[n][2] + dp[n][1]);
  }
}
```
The optimized code block still has the 2D array `dp` as changing it to a 1D array might increase the complexity of the code and could potentially slow down the program. However, if memory usage is a concern, the 1D array approach should be considered.
