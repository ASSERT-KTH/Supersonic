This program is a simple C++ program that reads in pairs of characters and their offset values, stores them in an array, and then uses them to convert input characters.

Here's an optimization strategy:

1. Avoid macro usage for std::cin. Although macros can increase code efficiency, they are generally discouraged in modern C++ due to their non-intuitive and error-prone nature.
2. Use std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) to turn off synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. This can provide a significant performance boost.
3. Change the array to a std::unordered_map. The array d is of size 256, which may be unnecessarily large for some inputs. A map would allow us to store only the necessary elements, potentially saving memory.
4. Use cin.get() instead of operator>> for character input. The operator>> skips whitespace characters, which may not be the desired behavior in this case.
5. Use std::cout instead of puts and putchar. The former is more flexible and idiomatic in C++.

Code optimization involves a trade-off between readability and performance. These changes will likely make the code slightly more complex but should also improve its performance and memory usage.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

  int n;
  char a, b;
  while (std::cin >> n && n) {
    std::unordered_map<char, int> d;
    for (; n--; ) {
      std::cin >> a >> b;
      d[a] = b - a;
    }
    std::cin >> n;
    for (; n--; ) {
      a = std::cin.get();
      std::cout << char(a + d[a]);
    }
    std::cout << '\n';
  }
}
```

In this optimized version, the macro z is replaced with std::cin, making the code more readable. The array d is replaced with an unordered_map, which saves memory for small inputs. Also, the sync_with_stdio(false) call turns off synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams, which can provide a significant performance boost.
