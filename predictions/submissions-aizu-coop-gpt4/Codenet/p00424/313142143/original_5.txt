**1. Code Analysis:**

This C++ program reads pairs of characters from the input, calculates the differences between each pair, and then uses that difference to adjust the output of subsequent characters.

It uses an array `d` of size 256 to store the differences between each pair of characters. The array's size is equal to the number of possible ASCII characters, so it can store the difference between any two characters. The array is initialized to zero.

The program has two main loops: the first one reads character pairs and calculates the differences, and the second one reads characters, adjusts them using the calculated differences, and prints them.

**2. Optimization Strategy:**

A1: Avoid using macro for `std::cin >>`. It's a bad practice from the performance and readability point of view. 

A2: Remove redundancy in the `d[a] = b - a` assignment. If the same character `a` appears more than once with different `b` values, the difference will be calculated and stored multiple times. 

A3: The `putchar(a + d[a])` operation could be optimized. It calls `putchar` function for each character, which may result in many system calls if the input is large. 

A4: Compiler optimization flags can be used to improve the performance of the code.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

B1: Replace the macro `#define z std::cin >>` with direct usage of `std::cin >>`. Macros can make the code harder to read and debug. They are replaced by their definitions by the preprocessor before the actual compilation begins, which can lead to unexpected behaviors if not used carefully.

B2: Instead of calculating and storing the difference between `a` and `b` every time in the loop, check if the difference for `a` has already been calculated. If yes, skip the calculation.

B3: Instead of calling `putchar` for each character, use a string to store the adjusted characters and print them all at once. This reduces the number of system calls and hence improves the performance.

B4: Use compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to allow the compiler to perform code optimization. These flags can lead to improvements such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and other optimizations.

**4. Optimized Code Block:**

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  int n;
  for (char a, b; std::cin >> n && n; std::cout << std::endl) {
    int d[256] = {};
    for (; n--; ) {
      std::cin >> a >> b;
      if (d[a] == 0) // only calculate and store the difference if it hasn't been done before
        d[a] = b - a;
    }
    std::cin >> n;
    std::string output;
    for (; n--; ) {
      std::cin >> a;
      output += (a + d[a]); // store the adjusted characters in the string
    }
    std::cout << output; // print all characters at once
  }
}
```
Please note that the `-O2` or `-O3` flags can be used while compiling this program to allow the compiler to perform additional optimizations. For example, `g++ -O2 program.cpp`.
