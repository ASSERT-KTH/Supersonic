The provided program appears to read in two sets of input and perform some computation on them. 

Here's a piece of code that is the equivalent of the given code and easier to understand:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  
  while(std::cin >> n, n) {
    int d[256] = {};
    for (char a, b; n--; d[a] = b - a) {
      std::cin >> a >> b;
    }
    
    std::cin >> n;
    for (char a; n--; std::putchar(a + d[a])) {
      std::cin >> a;
    }
    std::puts("");
  }
}
```

Performance analysis:
1. The program uses an array with 256 elements to store differences between pairs of characters. This seems reasonable, given that the ASCII character set has 256 possible values. This part of the program does not appear to be a performance bottleneck.
2. The program has two loops, both of which iterate 'n' times. The performance of these loops depends on the value of 'n'. If 'n' is large, these loops could be performance bottlenecks.
3. The use of I/O operations within the loops could also be a source of inefficiency. I/O operations are generally slower than CPU and memory operations.

Optimization strategy:
1. Reducing the number of I/O operations: I/O operations are generally slow. We could improve the efficiency of the program by reading the entire input into memory at once, then processing it.
2. Using faster I/O methods: The std::cin and std::cout methods are slower than scanf and printf. We could potentially improve performance by using these faster methods.
3. Using an optimized version of putchar: Using putchar_unlocked instead of putchar can be faster because it does not lock the output stream, but this is not thread-safe.

Here are the specific steps for optimization:

1. Replace the use of std::cin and std::cout with scanf and printf. This could significantly improve I/O performance.
2. Replace putchar with putchar_unlocked to improve performance.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n;
  
  while(scanf("%d", &n), n) {
    int d[256] = {};
    for (char a, b; n--; d[a] = b - a) {
      scanf(" %c %c", &a, &b);
    }
    
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (char a; n--; putchar_unlocked(a + d[a])) {
      scanf(" %c", &a);
    }
    putchar_unlocked('\n');
  }
}
```

Note: The 'putchar_unlocked' function is not thread-safe. If you are writing a multithreaded program, you should use 'putchar' instead. Also, the use of 'putchar_unlocked' might not be portable to all systems.
