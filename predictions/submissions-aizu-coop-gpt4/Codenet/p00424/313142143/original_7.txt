1. Code Analysis: 

This is a C++ program that reads a series of character pairs from the standard input. For each input pair, it saves the difference between the ASCII values of the two characters in an array `d[]` at the index corresponding to the ASCII value of the first character. In the second loop, it reads a series of characters and prints out the character obtained by adding the value from the array `d[]` at the index corresponding to the ASCII value of the read character.

The performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage in this code are:

    - The use of `std::cin >>` and `putchar()` for I/O operations is slow and inefficient.
    - The use of a fixed size array `d[]` of size 256 may use more memory than necessary, considering the actual range of character inputs.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    1. Use faster I/O methods, such as buffered I/O, to improve the speed of input and output operations.
    2. Instead of using a fixed size array, use a `std::unordered_map` to store the character differences. This data structure uses less memory for sparse inputs, and lookups are still very efficient.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    1. Replace `std::cin >>` with `getchar()` and `putchar()` with `putchar_unlocked()`. The `getchar()` function is faster than `std::cin >>` because it does not have to manage C++ streams, which do additional work. Similarly, `putchar_unlocked()` is faster than `putchar()` because it does not have to lock the output stream for each character printed, reducing the overhead of I/O operations. 
    2. Replace the array `d[]` with a `std::unordered_map<char, int>`. This data structure dynamically allocates memory for each entry, which is more efficient when the input characters are sparse. The `std::unordered_map` provides O(1) lookup times on average, which is comparable to the array.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n;
  char a, b;
  while ((n = getchar()) != EOF && n != '\n') {
    n -= '0';
    std::unordered_map<char, int> d;
    for (; n--; ) {
      a = getchar(); getchar(); // skip whitespace
      b = getchar(); getchar(); // skip whitespace
      d[a] = b - a;
    }
    n = getchar() - '0';
    for (; n--; ) {
      a = getchar(); getchar(); // skip whitespace
      putchar_unlocked(a + d[a]);
    }
    putchar_unlocked('\n');
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the above code assumes that the input follows the specified format strictly. In a real-world scenario, input validation and error handling would be necessary to make the code robust.

Also note that replacing `std::cin >>` with `getchar()` and `putchar()` with `putchar_unlocked()` can lead to undefined behavior or crashes if the input does not strictly follow the specified format. However, in competitive programming and similar environments, the benefit of faster I/O usually outweighs this drawback.

The replacement of the array `d[]` with a `std::unordered_map` might lead to slower execution if the input characters are not sparse. However, since the ASCII range is quite large and usually only a small portion of it is used, the memory saving usually outweighs the potential performance penalty.
