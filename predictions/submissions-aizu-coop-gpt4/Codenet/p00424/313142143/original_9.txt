Code Analysis:

This C++ code reads two characters a and b, calculates the difference between their ASCII values, and stores this difference in an array 'd' using 'a' as the index. Then it reads another character 'a' and adds the difference stored in 'd[a]' to 'a' and prints it. The loops run for 'n' times where 'n' is an integer input from the user.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Avoid using macros for common tasks: Macros are not type-checked and can introduce bugs. We can replace the macro 'z' with an actual 'std::cin' command.

2. Use vector instead of array: Vectors are more efficient than arrays in C++ as they can grow dynamically.

3. Minimize I/O operations: I/O operations are usually slower than CPU operations. We can reduce the number of I/O operations by storing the inputs in a container and then processing them.

4. Use '\n' instead of puts(""): It's faster because std::endl actually issues two operations: it outputs a newline, and it flushes the output buffer. The flushing operation can be slow, so avoid it if you can.

Here is the code after applying these strategies:

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  while (std::cin >> n && n != 0) {
    std::vector<int> d(256, 0);
    std::vector<std::pair<char, char>> input(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      std::cin >> input[i].first >> input[i].second;
      d[input[i].first] = input[i].second - input[i].first;
    }
    std::cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      char a;
      std::cin >> a;
      std::cout << static_cast<char>(a + d[a]);
    }
    std::cout << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. Removed the macro 'z' and replaced it with explicit 'std::cin' operations. This makes the code easier to read and debug.

2. Replaced the array 'd' with a vector of the same size. This is more efficient in terms of memory usage and allows for easier code maintenance.

3. Stored the inputs in a vector 'input' and processed them in the same loop. This reduces the number of I/O operations, thereby improving the performance.

4. Replaced 'puts("")' with 'std::cout << '\n'' which is faster because it doesnâ€™t flush the output buffer.

Trade-offs:
1. The optimized code is slightly longer and may be a bit more complex due to the use of vectors and pairs. However, the benefits in terms of performance and code maintainability outweigh this drawback. 

2. Storing the inputs in a vector increases the memory usage temporarily. But this is offset by the reduction in I/O operations, which are usually slower.
