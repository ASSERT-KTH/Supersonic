## Code Analysis

The given code reads from standard input in the following way:

1. It first reads an integer `n` representing the number of key-value (char-int) pairs. The characters are used as lookup keys in a direct-access table `d`, and the differences between the keys and the corresponding values are stored in the table.

2. It then reads another integer `n` representing the number of keys to look up in the table `d`.

The main performance bottlenecks in this program are:

1. The direct-access table `d` that takes up a lot of memory (256 integers) despite the fact that it might not be fully utilized. This can be wasteful if the number of distinct characters is significantly less than 256.

2. The usage of the `std::cin` stream extraction operator (`>>`) in a loop, which can be slow due to its synchronization with the C standard streams and its exception handling overhead.

## Optimization Strategy

1. Replace the direct-access table `d` with a `std::unordered_map`. This data structure is more memory-efficient for sparse key sets, and its lookup time is usually constant.

2. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable the synchronization of `std::cin` with the C standard streams, which can make stream extraction faster.

3. Use `std::cin.tie(NULL)` to untie `std::cin` from `std::cout`. Normally, `std::cout` is flushed before each I/O operation on `std::cin`, but this is unnecessary in this program.

4. Use `std::getchar()` and `std::putchar()` for character I/O instead of the stream extraction and insertion operators, which can be faster.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  while (std::cin >> n && n) {
    std::unordered_map<char, int> d;
    for (char a, b; n--; ) {
      std::cin >> a >> b;
      d[a] = b - a;
    }
    std::cin >> n;
    while (n--) {
      char a = std::getchar();
      std::putchar(a + d[a]);
    }
    std::putchar('\n');
  }
}
```

This version of the program should run faster and use less memory than the original one, while producing the same output.
