The given code seems to be written in an obfuscated manner, which makes it difficult to comprehend and maintain. It reads some values from the standard input, performs some computations, and prints the results to the standard output.

1. Code Analysis:
   - The first loop reads values from the standard input until the end of input or until a zero is read. The values read are stored in the variable `n`.
   - The second loop reads pairs of characters into `i` and `t[0]` respectively, `n` times.
   - The third loop reads a character into `i`, `n` times, and prints either `i` or `t[i]` depending on the value of `t[i]`.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - The use of `scanf()` in the condition part of the first `for` loop is not a good practice. The `scanf()` function should be used in a separate statement before the loop.
   - The `bzero()` function is used to clear the array `t`. This function is non-standard and deprecated. It's better to use `memset()` function instead.
   - The use of `puts("")` to print a newline is unnecessary. It's more efficient to use `putchar('\n')`.
   - The use of `scanf(" %c %c", &i, t)` to read a pair of characters into `i` and `t[0]` is inefficient. It would be better to use the `getchar()` function twice.
   - The use of `scanf(" %c", &i)` to read a character into `i` is inefficient. It would be better to use the `getchar()` function.
   - The computation `!t[i] * i + t[i]` can be optimized by precomputing `t[i]` before the computation.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   - Replace the use of `scanf()` in the condition part of the first `for` loop with a separate statement before the loop. This will improve the readability of the code and make the loop condition more clear.
   - Replace the use of `bzero()` with `memset()`. This will make the code more portable as `memset()` is a standard function.
   - Replace the use of `puts("")` with `putchar('\n')`. This will make the code more efficient as `putchar()` is faster than `puts()`.
   - Replace the use of `scanf(" %c %c", &i, t)` with two `getchar()` calls. This will make the code more efficient as `getchar()` is faster than `scanf()`.
   - Replace the use of `scanf(" %c", &i)` with a `getchar()` call. This will make the code more efficient as `getchar()` is faster than `scanf()`.
   - Precompute `t[i]` before the computation `!t[i] * i + t[i]`. This will make the computation more efficient as it avoids repeated memory accesses.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int n, t[999];

int main() {
  int i;
  while (scanf("%d", &n) == 1 && n != 0) {
    memset(t, 0, sizeof(t));
    while (n--) {
      i = getchar();
      t[0] = getchar();
    }
    scanf("%d", &n);
    while (n--) {
      i = getchar();
      int ti = t[i];
      putchar(!ti * i + ti);
    }
    putchar('\n');
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the provided code and the optimized code have unusual and hard-to-understand behavior due to the obfuscated nature of the original code. The optimized code should behave the same as the original code, but it is clearer and more efficient.
