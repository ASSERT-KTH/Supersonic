1. Code Analysis:
This C code is a program that reads a sequence of characters and their respective values into an array, and then reads another sequence of characters and prints their values. The program uses several loops to read and write data, and it uses the bzero() function to clear the array between iterations.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    A. Inefficient Data Structures:
    The code uses a large integer array to store the character values. The size of the array is 999, which is larger than the number of ASCII characters (128 or 256 depending on the character set), making this an inefficient use of memory.

    B. Redundant Computations:
    The bzero() function is used to clear the array between iterations. This is unnecessary if we ensure that each character value is overwritten during the input sequence. This will reduce the number of function calls and improve performance.

    C. Loops Optimization:
    The main loop condition uses multiplication to check if scanf() returned a value, which is less efficient than simply checking the return value directly. The second loop uses a post-decrement operation on the loop counter, which is slower than pre-decrement.

    D. Compiler Optimizations:
    We can use compiler flags to enable certain optimizations. For example, we can use the -O2 or -O3 optimization level flags when compiling with gcc.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    A. We will replace the large integer array with a smaller one, sized to fit the ASCII character set. This will reduce memory usage.

    B. We will remove the call to bzero() and ensure that each character's value is set during the input sequence. This will reduce the number of function calls.

    C. We will modify the loops to use more efficient conditions and operations. We will check the return value of scanf() directly in the main loop, and use pre-decrement in the second loop.

    D. We will compile the code with an optimization level flag to enable additional compiler optimizations.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int n, t[128]; // Reduced array size to fit ASCII character set

int main() {
  int i;
  while (scanf("%d", &n) == 1) { // Check return value of scanf() directly
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { // Ensure each character's value is set
      scanf(" %c", &t[i]);
      scanf("%d", &t[t[i]]); // Use character as index into array
    }
    if (scanf("%d", &n) == 1) {
      while (--n >= 0) { // Use pre-decrement
        scanf(" %c", &i);
        putchar(i - '0' + t[i]); // Adjust calculation for character as index
      }
    }
    putchar('\n');
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This code should be compiled with an optimization level flag, e.g., `gcc -O2 program.c`. Note that this code assumes that the input characters are in the range '0' to '9'. If the input can include any ASCII characters, adjust the array size and the calculation accordingly.
