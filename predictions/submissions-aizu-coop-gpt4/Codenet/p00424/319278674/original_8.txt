This program reads a series of character pairs from standard input (stdin). It then reads another set of single characters from stdin, and outputs based on the character pairs read earlier. The entire process is repeated as long as the first scanf in the main loop successfully reads an integer. 

There are several potential areas for optimization:

1. Code clarity: The code is difficult to understand, which can lead to inefficiency in maintenance and debugging. Making the variable and function names more descriptive and adding comments can improve code readability. 

2. Input reading: The use of scanf for reading input is typically slower compared to other methods such as getchar. 

3. Initialization: The use of bzero function to initialize the array is not very efficient. It's better to use memset instead.

4. Memory usage: The fixed-size array t[999] can be optimized to dynamically allocate memory based on the input size.

5. Looping: The loops can be optimized for efficiency. For instance, loop unrolling could be considered.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    int num_pairs;
    char* pair_values;

    // Loop until scanf fails to read an integer
    while(scanf("%d", &num_pairs) == 1) {
        pair_values = malloc(num_pairs * sizeof(char));
        memset(pair_values, 0, num_pairs * sizeof(char));

        char pair_first, pair_second;
        for(int i = 0; i < num_pairs; i++) {
            scanf(" %c %c", &pair_first, &pair_second);
            pair_values[pair_first] = pair_second;
        }

        int num_tests;
        scanf("%d", &num_tests);

        char test_char;
        for(int i = 0; i < num_tests; i++) {
            scanf(" %c", &test_char);
            putchar(!pair_values[test_char] * test_char + pair_values[test_char]);
        }

        free(pair_values);
        putchar('\n');
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The variable names are more descriptive, making the code easier to understand. Comments have also been added.

2. The use of getchar is not applicable here as the input includes spaces and newlines that need to be skipped.

3. The bzero function has been replaced with memset, which is typically more efficient and portable.

4. The array t[] has been replaced with a dynamically allocated array that is exactly the size necessary, reducing memory usage.

5. Loop unrolling is not applied here as it may not provide a significant improvement in this case and can make the code more complex. The key aspect here is to ensure that the loops are as efficient as possible which is achieved through avoiding unnecessary computations and using efficient data structures.
