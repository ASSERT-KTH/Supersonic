First, let's decode the given C program. The code reads from standard input a sequence of character mappings and then a sequence of characters to translate, outputting the translated characters. Here is the translation of the code into a more readable form:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <strings.h>

int n, t[999];

int main() {
    char i;
    while ((n = scanf("%d", &n)) != EOF) {
        bzero(t, sizeof(t));
        for (; n > 0; --n) {
            scanf(" %c %c", &i, t + i);
        }
        scanf("%d", &n);
        for (; n > 0; --n) {
            scanf(" %c", &i);
            putchar(t[i] ? t[i] : i);
        }
        putchar('\n');
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Now, we can discuss the optimizations.

1. **Code Analysis**: The code is already quite efficient. It uses an array for direct lookup of character mappings, which is faster than a hash table or binary search tree.

2. **Optimization Strategy**:
    1. The `scanf()` function has overhead. We can reduce the overhead by reading the entire input into a buffer and parsing it manually.
    2. The `putchar()` function also has overhead. We can reduce the overhead by writing the entire output to a buffer and printing it all at once.
    3. The `bzero()` function is being used to clear the entire array `t`. This is not necessary. We can instead clear only the elements of `t` that we have used.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    1. **Buffered Input and Output**: `scanf()` and `putchar()` have overhead because they make system calls, which are expensive. By reading the entire input into a buffer and parsing it manually, we can reduce the number of system calls. Similarly, by writing the entire output to a buffer and printing it all at once, we can also reduce the number of system calls.
    2. **Partial Array Clearing**: Currently, the entire array `t` is being cleared at the beginning of each test case. This is not necessary. We can instead keep track of which elements of `t` we have used, and clear only those elements.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int n, t[1000];
char used[1000];

char input[4000000], output[2000000];
char *p, *q;

int main() {
    p = input;
    q = output;
    fread(input, 1, sizeof(input) - 1, stdin);
    while (*p >= '0') {
        n = 0;
        while (*p >= '0')
            n = 10 * n + *p++ - '0';
        ++p;
        while (n--) {
            t[*p] = p[2];
            used[*p] = 1;
            p += 4;
        }
        n = 0;
        while (*p >= '0')
            n = 10 * n + *p++ - '0';
        ++p;
        while (n--) {
            *q++ = used[*p] ? t[*p] : *p;
            p += 2;
        }
        *q++ = '\n';
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i)
            if (used[i]) {
                t[i] = 0;
                used[i] = 0;
            }
    }
    fwrite(output, 1, q - output, stdout);
    return 0;
}
```

This code is written for Unix-like environments where input and output are buffered by the environment. If you are running this code in a different environment, you may need to add manual buffering.
