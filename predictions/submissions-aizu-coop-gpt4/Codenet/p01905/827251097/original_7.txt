The given code is simple and doesn't contain any obvious performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usage. However, there are some minor changes that can be made to improve readability and coding style, which can indirectly affect the program's performance and maintainability. Below are the suggested optimizations:

1. Use of `<bits/stdc++.h>`: This is a non-standard header file that includes multiple header files, and it's not recommended for production code. It is better to include only the necessary header files. In this case, we only use `printf` and `scanf`, so we can include `<stdio.h>` instead.

2. Use of `scanf` and `printf`: These are C-style I/O operations. If you're coding in C++, it's more idiomatic to use C++ style I/O operations such as `std::cin` and `std::cout`. They're generally safer and more flexible.

3. Error Checking: The program doesn't check if the input is valid. This is not a performance optimization, but it's a good practice to validate input data.

4. Return Statement: Although modern compilers add a return statement at the end of the `main` function if it's missing, it's still a good practice to explicitly return 0 to indicate the program has ended successfully.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int n, m;
    if (!(std::cin >> n >> m)) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Invalid input.\n";
        return 1;  // return non-zero value to indicate an error
    }

    std::cout << n - m - 1 << '\n';

    return 0;  // indicate that program ended successfully
}
```

This optimized code maintains the same functionality and output as the original code. It takes two integers as input and prints the result of `n - m - 1`. The changes mainly enhance the coding style and readability without affecting the performance in a significant way.
