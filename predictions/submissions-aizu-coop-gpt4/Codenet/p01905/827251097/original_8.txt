The given code is already optimized as it is a simple program with very little computational work. However, some minor improvements can still be made in terms of code organization and portability:

1. Code Analysis:
    - The code reads two integers from the standard input, calculates their difference minus one, and prints the result.
    - The "bits/stdc++.h" header is used, which includes all the standard library headers. It's generally not recommended because it can slow down the compile time and it's not portable. 

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - Replace "bits/stdc++.h" with only the necessary headers for this task, which are "stdio.h" for input/output functions. This will reduce the compile time and increase the portability of the code.
    - Replace "scanf" and "printf" with their safer and more modern alternatives, "std::cin" and "std::cout" from the C++ Standard Library. These are type safe and can prevent potential runtime errors. 

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    - Remove "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" and replace it with "#include <iostream>". This will only include the necessary headers for this task, reducing the compile time and making the code more portable.
    - Replace "scanf" with "std::cin" and "printf" with "std::cout". "std::cin" and "std::cout" are safer than "scanf" and "printf" because they are type safe and can prevent potential runtime errors.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  std::cout << n - m - 1 << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
Despite these changes, it's important to note that these optimizations are minor and the original code was already highly efficient due to its simplicity. The changes primarily improve the code's style, safety, and portability rather than its runtime or memory usage.
