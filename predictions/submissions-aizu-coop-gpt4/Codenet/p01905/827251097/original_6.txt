This piece of code is almost as efficient as it can be, given its simplicity. It reads two integers from the input, subtracts the second from the first, subtracts one more, and then prints the result. The performance of this code is excellent as the complexity is O(1), and it only uses a very small, fixed amount of memory.

However, there are a few potential improvements that could be made, mainly for code quality rather than performance:

1. **Include only necessary headers**: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a convenience header file used in competitive programming that includes nearly all standard library headers. This is overkill for such a simple program, and it can slow down the compilation significantly. Instead, you should include only what you need. In this case, `stdio.h` is enough.

2. **Return a value from main**: By convention, the `main` function should return an integer. This is used by the operating system to determine if the program ran successfully. A return value of 0 typically indicates success.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
  printf("%d\n", n - m - 1);
  return 0;
}
```

This code should behave exactly the same as the original code, but it follows better coding practices and is minimally more efficient due to the reduced number of included header files.
