The given code is a simple program that reads two integers, subtracts the second from the first, and then subtracts one more, printing the result. This is a very straightforward and efficient program, but there are still some areas that could be optimized:

1. **Code Analysis**: The code uses `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes all standard library C++ headers, which can slow down the compilation time. There are no other obvious performance bottlenecks here as the operations are quite simple.

2. **Optimization Strategy**:
    1. **Headers**: Instead of using `bits/stdc++.h`, include only the necessary headers.
    2. **Input/Output operations**: The `scanf` and `printf` functions are slightly less efficient than their C++ counterparts `cin` and `cout`. Moreover, using `endl` to print a newline character also flushes the output buffer, which can slow down the output. It's better to use "\n" instead.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    1. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary headers. This will speed up the compilation time. In this case, we only need `<iostream>`.
    2. Replace `scanf` with `cin` and `printf` with `cout`. These changes will make the program more idiomatic C++ and can offer slight performance improvements.
    3. Replace `endl` with "\n". This avoids unnecessary buffer flushes, which can slow down the output.

4. **Optimized Code Block**:
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  cout << n - m - 1 << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This code preserves the functionality of the original code but in a more efficient manner. It should be noted, however, that the performance improvement here might be negligible in practice, given the already efficient nature of the original code.
