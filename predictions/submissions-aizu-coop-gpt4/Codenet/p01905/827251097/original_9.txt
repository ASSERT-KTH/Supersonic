The provided C++ code is already quite optimized and efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. The code does not have any loops, unnecessary computations, or inefficient data structures. It simply reads two integers from the standard input, subtracts the second from the first (and then subtracts 1), and prints the result to the standard output.

Potential improvements could be made in terms of code readability, structure, and safety:

1. The "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" directive is generally discouraged because it includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compile time. It's better to include only the headers that are actually used.
2. The return statement is missing in the main function. Although the C++ standard allows for it to be omitted (in which case it defaults to "return 0;"), it's often considered good practice to include it for clarity and to explicitly show that the program has finished successfully.
3. Using safer IO operations. Although scanf and printf are faster, they are prone to errors and are not type safe. Using cin and cout along with ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); can give the same speed and are safer.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  if(scanf("%d%d", &n, &m) != 2) { // To handle scanf error
     fprintf(stderr, "Failed to read n and m\n");
     return 1;
  }
  printf("%d\n", n - m - 1);
  return 0;
}
```

This code includes only the necessary standard library header, "<cstdio>", adds a return statement to the main function, and checks the return value of scanf to ensure that the correct number of inputs were read. These changes make the code safer and more understandable without affecting its efficiency.
