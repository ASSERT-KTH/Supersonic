The given C++ code doesn't really have any performance issues. It's a simple program that reads two integers, subtracts the second from the first, subtracts 1 more, and then outputs the result. There's no looping, no complex data structures, and minimal computation to be done. However, we can make some improvements in terms of good coding practices, which indirectly leads to better performance and maintainability.

Here's an optimized version of the code:

```C++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int n, m;
    std::cin >> n >> m;
    std::cout << n - m - 1 << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

1. I replaced `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with `#include <iostream>`. It's not recommended to use `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because it includes a lot of unnecessary headers and can slow down the compilation process. In this case, we only need `<iostream>` for input/output operations.

2. I replaced `scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);` with `std::cin >> n >> m;`. Similarly, `printf("%d\n", n - m - 1);` is replaced by `std::cout << n - m - 1 << std::endl;`. In C++, it's better to use `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations as they are more type-safe and easier to use than `scanf` and `printf`.

3. Added `return 0;` at the end of the `main` function. Even though it's not necessary in C++, as the compiler adds it automatically, it's a good practice to manually add it for clarity and to indicate that the program has completed successfully.

Please note that these changes won't significantly improve the performance of this specific code because it's already simple and efficient. However, these are good coding practices that can improve the performance and maintainability of larger, more complex programs.
