The given code is a simple C++ program that reads two integers from standard input and prints the difference of the two integers minus one. Since this program is already very simple and has a linear time complexity of O(1), there isn't much room for significant performance optimization. 

However, we can make some minor improvements to the code style and readability:

1. Instead of including the entire "bits/stdc++.h" library, we can include only the specific libraries that are needed. This may slightly reduce the compilation time and make it clear which libraries are being used.

2. We can add comments to make the code more readable.

3. We can give the variables more meaningful names to make the code more understandable.

4. Finally, we can add error checking to the scanf function to ensure that the correct number of inputs were read.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio> // for scanf and printf

int main() {
  // Define two integers to hold the user's input.
  int firstNumber, secondNumber;

  // Read the two numbers from standard input.
  // Check the return value of scanf to ensure that two inputs were read.
  if (scanf("%d%d", &firstNumber, &secondNumber) != 2) {
    printf("Error: Expected two integers as input.\n");
    return 1; // Return an error code.
  }

  // Calculate the difference between the two numbers minus one.
  int differenceMinusOne = firstNumber - secondNumber - 1;

  // Print the result.
  printf("%d\n", differenceMinusOne);

  return 0; // Indicate that the program completed successfully.
}
```

This version of the code is slightly longer, but it is more robust and easier to understand.
