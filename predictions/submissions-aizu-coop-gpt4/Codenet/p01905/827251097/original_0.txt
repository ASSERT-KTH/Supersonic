The given C++ code is already quite efficient as it performs a simple arithmetic operation (subtraction). However, it's still possible to make some minute optimizations:

1. Code Analysis: 
   The code reads two integer values (n and m) from the standard input, performs subtraction operation (n - m - 1), and prints the result to the standard output. The code is straightforward and doesn't have any apparent performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usage.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Use of `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file: This header file includes almost all standard library header files in C++. Although it's convenient during competitive programming, it's not suitable for production code as it increases the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary header files. 
   - Using `scanf` and `printf` for I/O operations: While there's nothing wrong with using these functions, in C++, it's more common to use `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. However, `scanf` and `printf` are faster than `cin` and `cout`. To speed up `cin` and `cout`, we can use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`. 

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   - Replace `<bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary header files. In this case, we only need `<iostream>`.
   - Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` to speed up `cin` and `cout`.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    int n, m;
    std::cin >> n >> m;
    std::cout << n - m - 1 << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code performs the same operation as the original one but is more in line with C++ coding practices. However, note that the actual performance gain might be negligible because the original code was simple and already efficient.
