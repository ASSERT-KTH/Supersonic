The provided code is pretty straightforward and efficient already. It reads two integers from standard input, calculates the difference between them (subtracting an extra 1), and then outputs the result. Given the simplicity of the program, there are minimal opportunities for optimization. However, there are a couple of points that can be improved for best practices:

1. **Include Specific Libraries**: Including `<bits/stdc++.h>` is a bad practice because it includes all standard libraries, which can lead to an increase in compilation time. Since we only need `scanf` and `printf`, we can replace `<bits/stdc++.h>` with `<cstdio>`.

2. **Return Status**: Although not explicitly required in C++, it is a good practice to return a status from the `main` function to indicate whether the program has completed successfully or not. This can be useful when the program is used in scripts or with other programs.

Optimized Code:

```c++
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
  printf("%d\n", n - m - 1);
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code is essentially identical in terms of performance, but it is more compatible with good C++ coding practices.
