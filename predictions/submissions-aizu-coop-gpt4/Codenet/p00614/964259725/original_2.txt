The provided code seems to be solving a coin change problem. It appears to be a bit complex and inefficient, and some parts of the code seem to be redundant. Here's an analysis of the code:

1. Code Analysis:
    - The code uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to solve the problem. However, the DP table is being filled inefficiently, which leads to a significant amount of redundant computation.
    - The code uses `deque`, a double-ended queue, inside a triple nested loop, which is inefficient.
    - The code uses a macro `rep` and `reps` for looping, which is not a good practice. It reduces the readability of the code.
    - The `cin` and `cout` are slow for input and output operations.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - Replace `cin` and `cout` with faster I/O operations.
    - Remove the use of `deque` and optimize the DP approach.
    - Replace the macro `rep` and `reps` with normal for loops to make the code more readable.
    - Avoid using `#define` for constants and use `const` instead.
    - Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes unnecessary libraries, increasing compilation time.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    - Replacing `cin` and `cout`: `cin` and `cout` are significantly slower than `scanf` and `printf`. This is because `cin` and `cout` have to maintain synchronization with `stdio` streams and have to be safe for multithreaded programs. Replacing `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` can significantly speed up I/O operations.
    - Removing `deque` and optimizing DP: The current code fills the DP table in a complex way, involving a `deque`. We can simplify this by filling the DP table in a more straightforward way.
    - Replacing macros with loops: Macros can make the code less readable and more prone to errors. Replacing them with for loops makes the code clearer and reduces the chance of errors.
    - Avoid `#define` and use `const`: `#define` is a preprocessor macro and doesn't respect scope. On the other hand, `const` is a language construct and respects scope. It is always a good practice to use `const` instead of `#define` for constants.
    - Avoid `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes too many unnecessary libraries, increasing the compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary libraries.

Next, I will provide the optimized version of this code.
