This is a fairly complex C++ program. The main function seems to be solving some sort of problem involving coins with different values, and the code is written to make use of dynamic programming to solve it. Here are a few suggestions to optimize this code:

1. Code Analysis:
   - Using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes all standard library headers, which can increase compile time.
   - Using `#define int long long`: Converting int to long long can slow down operations since long long takes more memory and processing power than int.
   - Using `typedef vector<int> vint`, `typedef pair<int, int> pint`, `typedef vector<pint> vpint`: These typedefs are not used in the code.
   - Using `#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (n); i++)` and `#define reps(i, f, n) for (int i = (f); i < (n); i++)`: The macros are used to replace for loops but they might introduce debugging difficulties.
   - The variables `dp`, `C`, `N` and `P` are not self-explanatory and the code lacks comments explaining their purpose.
   - Use of magic numbers like `1001001001` and `2500` which are not self-explanatory.

2. Optimization Strategy:

   - Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with only the necessary headers.
   - Use `int` instead of `long long` if the values can fit into an integer.
   - Remove unused typedefs.
   - Replace macros with for loops for readability and easier debugging.
   - Use meaningful variable names and comments to explain the purpose of variables.
   - Define magic numbers as constants with meaningful names.
   - Use `std::array` instead of C-style arrays for type safety and additional functionalities.
   - Use more efficient data structures where applicable. For instance, `std::deque` could be replaced with a priority queue if the purpose is to maintain a sorted queue.
   - Use `std::min` and `std::max` instead of `chmin` and `chmax` for readability.
   - Use `std::fill` instead of `std::fill_n` for readability and safer code.
   - Optimize the algorithm if possible, e.g. by eliminating unnecessary loops or computations.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   - Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary headers. This reduces the compile time and makes it clear which libraries are actually being used.
   - Replace `long long` with `int` where possible. This reduces memory usage and speeds up computations.
   - Remove unused typedefs. This simplifies the code and reduces confusion.
   - Replace macros with for loops. This improves readability and makes the code easier to debug.
   - Use meaningful variable names and add comments. This makes the code easier to understand for other developers.
   - Replace magic numbers with named constants. This makes the code easier to read and understand.
   - Replace C-style arrays with `std::array`. This provides type safety and additional functionalities.
   - Use `std::min` and `std::max` instead of `chmin` and `chmax`. This simplifies the code and makes it easier to read.
   - Replace `std::fill_n` with `std::fill`. This simplifies the code and makes it safer.
   - Optimize the algorithm to reduce unnecessary computations. This improves the runtime efficiency of the code.
