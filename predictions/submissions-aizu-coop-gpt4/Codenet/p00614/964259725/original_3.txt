Upon analyzing the code, it seems to be solving some kind of a coin change problem with a dynamic programming approach. The code works, but there are some potential optimizations that can be made to improve its performance and memory efficiency.

Here's the optimization strategy:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file includes too much and is not standard. You should include only what you need, like `#include <vector>`, `#include <iostream>`, `#include <algorithm>`, `#include <deque>`, and `#include <utility>`.

2. Use a more specific data type for the integer variables. The code currently uses `long long` for all integer variables, which may use more memory than necessary. For example, if we know that a variable will not exceed the range of an `int`, we can use `int` instead of `long long`.

3. Avoid using macros for common operations (`rep`, `reps`, `all`, `each`, `pb`, `fi`, `se`). Not only do these make the code harder to read for people not familiar with your specific macros, but they also don't provide any performance benefits. For loop unrolling, modern compilers are generally better at deciding when to unroll loops.

4. Use `std::min` and `std::max` functions instead of the `chmin` and `chmax` functions. This will make the code easier to understand for other developers and may also be slightly faster due to the built-in functions being optimized.

5. Use `std::array` instead of C-style arrays. `std::array` is safer and more modern and brings no performance penalty compared to C-style arrays.

6. Avoid using `deque::size()`, instead use `deque::empty()` to check if the deque is empty. This is because `deque::size()` is not guaranteed to be a constant time operation, but `deque::empty()` is.

7. The `1001001001` value seems to be a placeholder for an infinite value. Instead, we can use `std::numeric_limits<int>::max()` to represent this, making the code more readable and portable.

8. Instead of using `while (cin >> P)`, we can use `while (std::cin >> P && P != 0)` to reduce the nested condition inside the while loop.

9. Clear the deque at the beginning of each iteration in the outer loop. This will ensure that we're not carrying over any values from the previous iteration.

10. Using `std::endl` causes the output to be flushed, which is slower than just outputting a newline character (`'\n'`).

With these optimizations, the code should run more efficiently and use less memory. The trade-off is that the code might be a little more complex due to the explicit use of STL functions and types, but it's a worthy trade-off for the performance benefits. 

Now, let's proceed to implement these optimizations. Please note that all the optimizations are done keeping the functionality intact and changes are minimal where possible. The code is also well-commented to highlight the changes made and to make the code easily understandable.
