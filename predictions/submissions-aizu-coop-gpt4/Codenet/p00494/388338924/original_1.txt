The provided C++ code reads a string of characters from the standard input and finds the maximum number of consecutive 'J', 'O', and 'I' characters in that order. It counts the number of consecutive 'J's, 'O's, and 'I's and checks if the counts of 'O' is less than or equal to both 'J' and 'I'. If so, it updates the maximum count. 

Here's the optimization plan:

1. **Optimize String Initialization**: The initial `fill` operation that sets all elements of the array `x` to 'A' is unnecessary since `scanf` will overwrite these values. Removing this operation will save processing time.

2. **Optimize String Length Calculation**: The function `strlen` is O(n). The length of the string is only calculated once, so this isn't a significant performance hit. However, it's possible to calculate the length of the string while it's being read, which will slightly optimize the code.

3. **Optimize Loop Structure and Conditional Checks**: The current nested while loop structure and if checks are redundant and can be optimized. Instead of using a different while loop for every letter, we can use a switch-case structure inside a single while loop.

4. **Remove Unnecessary Scanf Call**: The final `scanf` call is unnecessary and can be removed. 

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    char x[1000005];
    int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0, leng = 0, maxi = 0;
    
    // Read input and calculate length
    for (leng = 0; (x[leng] = getchar()) != '\n'; ++leng);
    x[leng] = 0; // Null-terminate the string
    
    while (a < leng) {
        switch(x[a]) {
            case 'J':
                while (x[a] == 'J') {
                    b++;
                    a++;
                }
                while (x[a] == 'O') {
                    c++;
                    a++;
                }
                while (x[a] == 'I') {
                    d++;
                    a++;
                }
                if (b >= c && c <= d) {
                    maxi = max(maxi, c);
                }
                b = 0;
                c = 0;
                d = 0;
                break;
            default:
                a++;
        }
    }
    printf("%d\n", maxi);
    return 0;
}
```
This optimized code is more efficient, as it removes unnecessary memory writes and redundant loops, and simplifies condition checks. It should offer a noticeable improvement in running time for large inputs.
