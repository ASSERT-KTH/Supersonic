Code Analysis:

The provided code reads in a string of characters, then looks for sequences of 'J', 'O', and 'I' characters in that order. It counts the number of each character in a sequence and then checks if the number of 'J's is greater than or equal to the number of 'O's and the number of 'O's is less than or equal to the number of 'I's. If so, it updates the maximum count of 'O's found in such a sequence. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Efficient Data Structures: The data structures used in the code are efficient for the task at hand. However, the string x is declared as a large global character array and then filled with 'A'. This is unnecessary and inefficient since the string size should ideally be based on the input.

2. Redundant Computations: `strlen(x)` is being computed once and used in the loop condition. This is an efficient use and no optimization is needed here.

3. Loop Optimization: The while loops can be replaced with for loops, which makes the code more readable.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler level optimizations like `-O2` or `-O3` can be used to optimize the code further.

Optimization Steps:

1. Remove the `fill(x, x + 1000005, 'A');` line. This is unnecessary as `x` will be overwritten by the `scanf` call.

2. Replace the while loops with for loops for better readability and understanding of the code.

3. Use string instead of character array. This will make the code cleaner and eliminate the need for `strlen(x)`. It also allows us to dynamically allocate only the necessary amount of memory.

4. Remove the unnecessary `scanf("%d", &a);` at the end.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string x;
  cin >> x;
  int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0, maxi = 0;
  for (int a = 0; a < x.length();) {
    if (x[a] != 'J') {
      a++;
    } else {
      for (; x[a] == 'J'; a++) {
        b++;
      }
      for (; x[a] == 'O'; a++) {
        c++;
      }
      for (; x[a] == 'I'; a++) {
        d++;
      }
      if (b >= c && c <= d) {
        maxi = max(maxi, c);
      }
      b = c = d = 0;
    }
  }
  cout << maxi << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the code is easier to read and understand. It also uses dynamic memory allocation for the string, which is more efficient, and removes unnecessary steps, increasing its overall performance.
