Code Analysis:
The given C++ program reads a string and counts the maximum number of sequences that form the pattern "JOI", where the 'O' count should be less than or equal to counts of both 'J' and 'I'. The given code is not optimal because the while loop for each character ('J', 'O', 'I') is separate, which results in unnecessary iterations over the string characters. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Combine the three separate while loops for 'J', 'O', and 'I' into a single loop to reduce the number of iterations over the string.

2. Remove the initial use of the fill() function to set all elements of the string to 'A'. This operation is not necessary and increases memory usage.

3. Use a switch-case statement instead of multiple if-else statements for better readability and efficiency.

4. Avoid global variables whenever possible.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Combining the separate while loops for 'J', 'O', and 'I': In the given code, there are three separate while loops that iterate over the entire string each time. This can be optimized by combining these three loops into a single loop. This will reduce the number of iterations from 3*n to n, where n is the length of the string, resulting in a significant performance gain.

2. Removing the use of fill() function: The fill() function is used to set all elements of the string to 'A'. This operation is not necessary, as the string is overwritten with the input string in the next step. So, this operation can be removed to save memory and execution time.

3. Using a switch-case statement: The multiple if-else statements in the given code can be replaced with a switch-case statement. This will make the code more readable and slightly more efficient.

4. Avoiding global variables: Global variables can lead to code that is difficult to understand and debug. In the given code, all variables are declared as global. This can be optimized by declaring the variables in the scope where they are used.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  char x[1000005];
  scanf("%s", x);
  int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0, maxi = 0;
  int leng = strlen(x);
  while (a < leng) {
    char ch = x[a];
    switch (ch) {
      case 'J':
        while(x[a] == 'J') {
          b++;
          a++;
        }
        while(x[a] == 'O') {
          c++;
          a++;
        }
        while(x[a] == 'I') {
          d++;
          a++;
        }
        if (b >= c && c <= d) {
          maxi = max(maxi, c);
        }
        b = 0;
        c = 0;
        d = 0;
        break;
      default:
        a++;
        break;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", maxi);
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code is expected to run faster and use less memory than the original code, while still producing the same output.
