Code Analysis:
The given C++ code reads a string from standard input, which consists of characters 'J', 'O' and 'I'. It then finds the maximum length of substring "JOI" that can be formed such that the number of 'O's is the minimum of 'J's and 'I's on either side.

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:
1. The 'fill' operation at the beginning of the program is unnecessary and consumes time and memory, as the array is immediately overwritten by the 'scanf' function.
2. Nested while-loops are used to count the number of consecutive 'J's, 'O's, and 'I's which is not efficient.
3. The variables 'b', 'c', and 'd' are reset to 0 after every complete JOI sequence is processed. This could be a performance bottleneck if the input string is large and contains many such sequences.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove the unnecessary 'fill' operation.
2. Use a single loop to traverse the string, keeping count of the number of 'J's, 'O's, and 'I's.
3. Use an efficient data structure, such as a stack, to keep track of the lengths of the JOI sequences.
4. Use compiler optimizations to increase the execution speed of the program.

Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <stack>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

char x[1000005];
int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0, e, f, i, j, k, maxi = 0;

int main() {
  scanf("%s", x);
  int leng = strlen(x);
  stack<int> st;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < leng; i++) {
    if (x[i] == 'J') {
      b++;
    } else if (x[i] == 'O') {
      c++;
    } else if (x[i] == 'I') {
      d++;
    }
    if (b >= c && c <= d) {
      st.push(c);
    }
    if (x[i] != x[i + 1]) {
      b = 0;
      c = 0;
      d = 0;
    }
  }
  
  while (!st.empty()) {
    maxi = max(maxi, st.top());
    st.pop();
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", maxi);
  scanf("%d", &a);
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code eliminates the unnecessary 'fill' operation, replaces nested while-loops with a single for-loop, and uses a stack to keep track of the maximum length of a JOI sequence. The trade-off is a slight increase in code complexity due to the use of a stack. However, the performance gain likely outweighs this drawback.
