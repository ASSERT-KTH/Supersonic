Here are some potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage areas in the code:

1. **Use of global variables**: Global variables are used that might be unnecessary. Local variables can be more efficient due to potential cache benefits.
2. **Use of `while` loops**: The code contains nested `while` loops that perform repeated checks on the same condition. This can be optimized by reducing the number of checks.
3. **Character comparison in loops**: The code performs character comparison in multiple `while` loops to count occurrences of 'J', 'O', and 'I'. This can be optimized by using a more efficient data structure or algorithm.
4. **Use of `fill` function**: The code fills the entire `x` array with 'A' characters, but only a portion of the array is used to store the input string. This wastes memory and computation.
5. **Use of `strlen` function**: The `strlen` function is used to calculate the length of the input string, which adds unnecessary computation.

Here's the optimization strategy:

1. **Use local variables**: Replace the global variables used for temporary calculations with local variables, which can be more cache-friendly.
2. **Simplify loops**: Combine the nested `while` loops into a single loop that can count 'J', 'O', and 'I' characters simultaneously.
3. **Eliminate unnecessary computations**: Remove the use of `fill` function and `strlen` function. The length of the input string can be determined while reading the input.
4. **Use efficient data structure**: Use an array or a map to count 'J', 'O', and 'I' characters, which can be faster and more memory efficient than repeating character comparisons.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  char x[1000005];
  scanf("%s", x);

  int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0, maxi = 0;
  for (int i = 0; x[i] != '\0'; i++) {
    switch(x[i]) {
    case 'J':
      a++, b = i + 1;
      break;
    case 'O':
      if (b < i + 1 - a) 
        a++;
      c++, d = i + 1;
      break;
    case 'I':
      if (d < i + 1 - c) 
        c++;
      d = i + 1;
      break;
    default:
      a = b = c = d = i + 1;
    }
    if (a <= b && b <= c && c <= d) {
      maxi = max(maxi, c - b + 1);
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", maxi);
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code reduces the number of loops and removes unnecessary computations, which can significantly improve the performance. The use of local variables and efficient data structures can also reduce memory usage. However, this optimization may make the code more complex and harder to understand. Additionally, the optimized code assumes that the input string only contains 'J', 'O', 'I', and 'A' characters, which may not be the case in all situations.
