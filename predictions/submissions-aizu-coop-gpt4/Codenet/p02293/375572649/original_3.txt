This program appears to be well-optimized from a computational perspective. However, there are a few improvements that can be made to make it more efficient in terms of memory usage and execution speed.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. Efficient Input/Output: Using scanf and printf for input/output operations is good as they are faster than cin and cout in C++. However, the program can be further optimized by using fast I/O operations.

2. Avoid Using Complex Data Type: The complex data type in C++ is a template class that provides functionalities to manipulate complex numbers. It has a lot of overhead and we don't need all of its functionalities here. If we operate on double data type directly, it will be faster.

3. Redundant Computations: The program computes complex number k for each test case, then checks the imaginary and real parts of k. This can be optimized by computing and checking in one step.

4. Code Readability: In C++, it's recommended to use C++ libraries instead of C libraries for better code readability, maintainability, and to utilize the power of C++.

Here is the optimized code considering the above points:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // fast I/O
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n;
    double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;

    cin >> n;
    while (n--) {
        cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by;
        cin >> cx >> cy >> dx >> dy;

        double realPart = (bx - ax) * (dx - cx);
        double imagPart = (by - ay) * (cy - dy);

        if (imagPart == 0)
            cout << "2\n";
        else if (realPart == 0)
            cout << "1\n";
        else
            cout << "0\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Here, the code is optimized by replacing complex data type with double, which reduces memory usage and execution time. The redundant computations are also minimized. Fast I/O operations are used for faster execution. The code uses C++ libraries which makes it more readable and maintainable.
