The given program reads a series of 2D coordinates from the input, constructs complex numbers from the differences between these coordinates, and multiplies these complex numbers. Then it checks the imaginary and real parts of the result and prints a different integer value based on the conditions met. Here's a step-by-step optimization strategy for this code:

1. **Code Analysis**: The code is fairly efficient with no apparent performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usage. However, there are a few areas where improvements can be made:

    - The usage of `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes all the standard libraries, can be replaced with specific required headers to reduce compilation time.
    - The usage of `scanf` and `printf` functions for input and output operations can be replaced with `cin` and `cout` for better readability and safety.
    - The usage of `complex<double>` for 2D points can be replaced with a simpler data structure such as `pair<double, double>` for better readability and performance.

2. **Optimization Strategy**:

    - Replace `<bits/stdc++.h>` with specific headers such as `<iostream>`, `<complex>`, and `<utility>`.
    - Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`.
    - Replace `complex<double>` with `pair<double, double>`.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:

    - Replacing `<bits/stdc++.h>` with specific headers will reduce compilation time because the compiler needs to process fewer files. However, the developer needs to add the headers manually as needed.
    - Replacing `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` will improve code safety because these functions automatically handle type checking. It also makes the code more readable, especially for C++ developers. The trade-off is a slight performance decrease, but it's usually negligible.
    - Replacing `complex<double>` with `pair<double, double>` will make the code more readable and potentially faster, because `std::pair` is simpler and lighter than `std::complex`. However, the developer needs to manually calculate the multiplication of two points and the real and imaginary parts of a point, which increases code complexity.

4. **Optimized Code Block**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;
  cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by >> cx >> cy >> dx >> dy;
    pair<double, double> k = { (bx - ax) * (dx - cx) - (by - ay) * (cy - dy), (bx - ax) * (cy - dy) + (by - ay) * (dx - cx) };
    if (k.second == 0)
      cout << "2\n";
    else if (k.first == 0)
      cout << "1\n";
    else
      cout << "0\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code replaces `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`, replaces `complex<double>` with `pair<double, double>`, and calculates the multiplication of two points and the real and imaginary parts manually. These changes make the code safer, more readable, and potentially faster.
