Code Analysis:

The given C++ program is trying to find the cross product of two vectors (AB and CD) in 2D. The cross product is a vector orthogonal to the plane containing vectors AB and CD. In 2D, the orthogonal vector comes out of the plane. If the cross product's imaginary part is zero, it means that vectors are parallel to each other, and if the real part is zero, it means that vectors are perpendicular to each other.

Optimization Strategy:

A. Efficient I/O: The scanf and printf functions could be replaced with cin and cout, which are faster in C++. To further enhance I/O operations' speed, we can use ios::sync_with_stdio(0) and cin.tie(0).

B. Redundant Computation: The calculations for the complex numbers are currently done inside the loop. This does not appear to be necessary, and it might be more efficient to calculate these values before the loop begins.

C. Avoiding complex number library: Instead of using complex numbers, we can use simple algebra to calculate the cross product and its real and imaginary parts. This will avoid the overhead of complex number operations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Efficient I/O: Replace scanf and printf with cin and cout. Disable the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams. Untie cin from cout. This would make I/O operations faster.

B. Redundant Computation: The creation of complex numbers and the multiplication operation inside the loop can be avoided by performing the calculations before the loop begins and storing the results in variables for later use.

C. Avoiding complex number library: Instead of using the complex library, we can calculate the cross product using basic algebra. The real part of the cross product of two vectors (a,b) and (c,d) in 2D is ad - bc, and the imaginary part is zero.

Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;
  cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by;
    cin >> cx >> cy >> dx >> dy;
    // calculate the cross product
    double real = (bx - ax)*(dy - cy) - (by - ay)*(dx - cx);
    if (real == 0)
      cout << "2\n";
    else if ((dy - cy)*(bx - ax) - (dx - cx)*(by - ay) == 0)
      cout << "1\n";
    else
      cout << "0\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized code eliminates the use of the complex number library and redundant computations. It also uses faster I/O operations. The functionality of the original code is preserved.
