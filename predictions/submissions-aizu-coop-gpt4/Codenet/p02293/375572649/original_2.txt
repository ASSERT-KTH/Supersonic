1. Code Analysis:

The given code is a C/C++ program that performs complex number operations. The main inefficiency in the code lies in the I/O operations. The code uses scanf and printf functions for input and output operations, which are slower compared to cin and cout in terms of performance. The code also includes the "bits/stdc++.h" header, which includes all standard C++ headers, which can slow down the compilation time.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Use faster I/O functions: Replace scanf and printf functions with cin and cout for faster I/O operations. This can significantly improve the execution time for programs with heavy I/O operations.

B. Use specific headers: The "bits/stdc++.h" header includes all standard C++ headers which increases compilation time. It's better to include only the needed headers.

C. Use ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false): This line of code disconnects the standard C streams with their corresponding C++ streams. This makes C++ I/O operations faster. 

D. cin.tie(NULL): This line of code unties cin from cout. Tied streams ensure that one stream is flushed automatically before each I/O operation on the other stream. So, untying them can also improve I/O performance.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Use faster I/O functions: scanf and printf functions are slower compared to cin and cout. Using cin and cout can improve the code's performance, especially in cases with heavy I/O operations. 

B. Use specific headers: Including the "bits/stdc++.h" header includes all standard C++ headers, which can increase the compilation time. Including only the necessary headers can reduce the compilation time, thus speeding up the execution process.

C. Use ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false): This line of code disconnects the standard C streams from their corresponding C++ streams. This can make C++ I/O operations faster. This change might make the execution faster, but it can cause problems if we mix C and C++ style I/O in the code.

D. cin.tie(NULL): Tying cin to cout ensures that cout is flushed before every input operation. Untying them can improve I/O performance. However, this might cause issues if we expect the output to be flushed before taking input.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>

using namespace std;

typedef complex<double> P;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n;
    double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;
    
    cin >> n;
    
    while (n--) {
        cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by;
        cin >> cx >> cy >> dx >> dy;
        
        P k = P(bx - ax, by - ay) * P(dx - cx, cy - dy);
        
        if (k.imag() == 0)
            cout << "2\n";
        else if (k.real() == 0)
            cout << "1\n";
        else
            cout << "0\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This optimized code preserves the functionality of the original code while potentially improving the performance by using faster I/O operations and only including necessary headers.
