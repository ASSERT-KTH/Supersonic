1. Code Analysis:
The given code is reading multiple pairs of complex numbers and performing some operations on them. It is using complex numbers from the standard library, which is a bit heavy for this kind of operation. Also, it is checking the results of these operations in a sequential way, which might not be the most efficient.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Avoid "using namespace std;". It may cause name collision, which is a potential source of bug.
   - Replace complex math library usage with custom lightweight operations.
   - Use more efficient I/O operations.
   - Avoid unnecessary computations.
   - Utilize conditional ternary operator to make the code more efficient.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Avoid "using namespace std;". Large scale projects often end up with bugs due to namespace collision. Though it may not directly relate to performance, it is a good practice to avoid it.
   2. The complex library is a bit heavy for this kind of operation. We can replace it with some lightweight operations without losing the original functionality.
   3. The original code uses scanf and printf for I/O operations. We can replace these with cin and cout, which are more idiomatic in C++, and also use '\n' instead of printf where applicable.
   4. Instead of executing if-else statements sequentially, we can utilize the conditional ternary operator to make the code more efficient.
   5. Avoid unnecessary computation by storing the result in a variable and using it in the conditional check.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

struct Point {
    double x;
    double y;
};

double crossProduct(Point a, Point b) {
    return a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    while (n--) {
        Point a, b, c, d;
        std::cin >> a.x >> a.y >> b.x >> b.y >> c.x >> c.y >> d.x >> d.y;
        b.x -= a.x; b.y -= a.y;
        d.x -= c.x; d.y -= c.y;
        double cross = crossProduct(b, d);
        double dot = b.x * d.x + b.y * d.y;
        std::cout << (cross == 0 ? (dot == 0 ? 1 : 2) : 0) << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, we have replaced complex number operations with lightweight custom operations. The code is more readable and efficient as it avoids sequential execution of if-else statements and unnecessary computations.
