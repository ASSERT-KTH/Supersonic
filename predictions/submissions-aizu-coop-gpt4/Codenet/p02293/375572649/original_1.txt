# Code Analysis:
The above code is a C++ program that reads multiple sets of eight double numbers from the standard input. Each set of eight numbers represents the coordinates of four points. The program calculates a complex number from two vectors represented by these points and decides on the output based on the imaginary and real parts of the complex number.

The program is relatively simple and there are not many areas where we may need to optimize. However, there is a couple of things that we can do to improve the code in terms of readability, maintainability, and potentially performance.

# Optimization Strategy:
1. **Replace scanf with cin**: The scanf function is a C function and it's generally slower than cin in C++. We can replace scanf with cin for better performance and also for better code readability.

2. **Replace printf with cout**: Similar to the previous point, we can replace printf with cout for better performance and readability.

3. **Avoid using bits/stdc++.h**: This header file includes practically the entire standard library, which increases the compilation time significantly. It's better to include only the necessary libraries.

4. **Avoid using namespace std**: This can potentially lead to name clashes, which would be hard to debug.

5. **Use std::complex instead of typedef**: This will make it clearer what type P is and improve code readability.

6. **Use const for variables that are not being changed**: This can improve code readability and potentially allow the compiler to make some optimizations.

# Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Replace scanf with cin and printf with cout**: This will make the code more C++-like and also potentially faster. The reason is that scanf and printf are C functions and they are generally slower than their C++ counterparts. Moreover, cin and cout are safer to use because they don't require the programmer to specify the type of the variable being read or printed.

2. **Avoid using bits/stdc++.h and using namespace std**: Including bits/stdc++.h is a bad practice because it includes all standard libraries, increasing the compilation time significantly. Also, using the std namespace can lead to name clashes. It's better to specify the namespace for each standard library function or object we use.

3. **Use std::complex instead of typedef**: This will make the code more readable by making it clear that P is a complex number.

4. **Use const for variables that are not being changed**: This can improve code readability and potentially allow the compiler to make some optimizations. In this case, the complex number k is not being changed after it's being calculated, so we can declare it as const.

# Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>

int main() {
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;
  std::cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    std::cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by >> cx >> cy >> dx >> dy;
    const std::complex<double> k = std::complex<double>(bx - ax, by - ay) * std::complex<double>(dx - cx, cy - dy);
    if (k.imag() == 0)
      std::cout << "2\n";
    else if (k.real() == 0)
      std::cout << "1\n";
    else
      std::cout << "0\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, we have replaced scanf and printf with cin and cout, respectively. We have also avoided using bits/stdc++.h and the std namespace. We have used std::complex instead of a typedef for P, and we have made k const.
