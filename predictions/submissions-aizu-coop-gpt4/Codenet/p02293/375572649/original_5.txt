Analysis:
The provided code takes an initial number of test cases. For each test case, it reads in 8 floating point numbers and performs some calculations using the complex number library. The code then determines if the complex number's imag() function equals 0, if the real() function equals 0, or neither, and prints out a number based on this.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use of C++ Standard Library Header: Using <bits/stdc++.h> includes all the standard C++ libraries which results in a longer compilation time. It is better to include only the necessary headers required for the program.

2. I/O Operations: In C++, the printf and scanf functions are faster than cin and cout for input/output operations. However, we could further optimize this by using the ios::sync_with_stdio() function. It will make input/output operations faster by not synchronizing C++ standard streams with their C counterparts.

3. Redundant Computation: The real() and imag() functions of the P object are called multiple times. We could store these values in variables to reduce the number of function calls.

4. Efficient Data Type: Instead of using complex<double> which is a memory-intensive data type, we can use two double variables to represent a complex number. This reduces memory usage.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio> // to use scanf and printf
#include <complex> // to use complex numbers

int main() {
  
  // make C++ input/output operations faster
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  
  // use double instead of complex<double> for memory efficiency
  double real_part, imag_part;
  
  while (n--) {
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf", &ax, &ay, &bx, &by);
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf", &cx, &cy, &dx, &dy);
    real_part = (bx - ax) * (dx - cx);
    imag_part = (by - ay) * (cy - dy);
    
    // store the real and imaginary parts in variables to reduce function calls
    if (imag_part == 0)
      printf("2\n");
    else if (real_part == 0)
      printf("1\n");
    else
      printf("0\n");
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:
The main trade-off here is that the code becomes a bit more verbose because we are not using the complex<double> type and its methods directly. However, this is a negligible increase in complexity for a noticeable increase in performance.
