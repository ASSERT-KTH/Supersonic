1. Code Analysis:
This program seems to be performing some tax calculations based on a given inputs `x`, `y`, and `s`. The code is running in a while loop until `x`, `y`, and `s` are not zero. Within the while loop, it's creating a two-dimensional vector `tax` of size 1000x2. Then, it is running another while loop until `a < s` where `a` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Inside this inner loop, it's calculating `b` and checking some conditions to decide whether to store values in `tax` and update `maxi`.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   A. Inefficient Data Structure:
   A large 2D vector of size 1000x2 `tax` is being created in each iteration of the outer loop but only a few elements of this vector are being used. This is a waste of memory.

   B. Redundant Computation:
   The code `int)((a * (100 + x)) / 100.0` is being computed multiple times in each iteration of the inner loop. This computation can be stored in a variable to avoid redundancy.

   C. Loops Optimization:
   There are no opportunities for loop unrolling or tail recursion optimization in this case. 

   D. Compiler Optimization:
   The compiler optimization is beyond the source code level. However, using `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flags during compilation can help to optimize the code further.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   A. Use a Dynamic Structure:
   Instead of creating a large 2D vector, we can use a dynamic data structure like `std::vector` and `push_back()` method to add elements.

   B. Store Computed Values:
   Compute `int)((a * (100 + x)) / 100.0` once and store it in a variable to avoid redundant computation.

   C. Trade-offs:
   The trade-off for these optimizations is that the code might become a bit more complex, but it would be more efficient in terms of memory usage and computation.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int x, y, s;
  while (cin >> x >> y >> s && (x || y || s)) {
    vector<pair<int, int>> tax;
    int maxi = 0, a = 1, b, a_tax;
    while (a < s) {
      a_tax = (int)((a * (100 + x)) / 100.0);
      b = (s - a_tax + 1) / ((100 + x) / 100.0);
      if (a_tax + (int)((b * (100 + x)) / 100.0) == s && b != 0) {
        tax.push_back({a, b});
        maxi = max(maxi, (int)((a * (100 + y)) / 100.0) +
                             (int)((b * (100 + y)) / 100.0));
      }
      a++;
    }
    cout << maxi << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, I have used a vector of pairs instead of a 2D vector to save memory. I have also computed `(int)((a * (100 + x)) / 100.0)` once and stored it in `a_tax` variable to avoid redundant computation.
