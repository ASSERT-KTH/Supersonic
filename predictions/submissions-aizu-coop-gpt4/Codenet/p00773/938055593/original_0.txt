Code Analysis:
This program takes input of three integers x, y, and s, and calculates a maximum value maxi based on these inputs. It iterates through different pairs of values a and b and stores them in a 2D vector 'tax'. The value of maxi is calculated using a and b in a specific formula. There are several areas in this code that could potentially be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Redundant Memory Usage: The 2D vector 'tax' is used to store pairs of a and b. However, these values are not used elsewhere in the program, which means that this data structure is redundant. We can eliminate this vector entirely.
2. Redundant Computations: The calculations for the values of b and maxi are repeated many times. We can optimize these by calculating them only once and storing the results in variables.
3. Loop Optimization: The while loop can be replaced with a for loop, which is generally more efficient in C++. This also allows us to calculate the value of a directly, instead of incrementing it by 1 at the end of each iteration.
4. No need for checking b != 0: As the loop starts with a = 1, and b is calculated using the formula (s - (int)((a * (100 + x)) / 100.0) + 1) / ((100 + x) / 100.0), b will never be zero, so this check is unnecessary.

Optimization Steps:
1. Remove the declaration and usage of the 'tax' vector. This reduces memory usage and eliminates the need to index into the vector, which saves computation time.
2. Calculate the values of b and maxi only once per iteration. Store these in variables and use them in the if statement and the calculation of maxi. This reduces the number of computations, which improves performance.
3. Replace the while loop with a for loop. This typically improves performance in C++. It also allows us to calculate the value of a directly, rather than incrementing it by 1 at the end of each iteration.
4. Remove the check for b != 0, as this is unnecessary.

Trade-offs:
These optimizations improve performance and reduce memory usage, but they do make the code slightly more complex. They also assume that the input values are within a certain range and that the calculations do not cause overflows or other numerical issues.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int x, y, s;
  while (cin >> x >> y >> s && (x || y || s)) {
    int maxi = 0;
    for (int a = 1; a < s; a++) {
      int b = (s - (int)((a * (100 + x)) / 100.0) + 1) / ((100 + x) / 100.0);
      int sum = (int)((a * (100 + x)) / 100.0) + (int)((b * (100 + x)) / 100.0);
      if (sum == s) {
        maxi = max(maxi, (int)((a * (100 + y)) / 100.0) +
                             (int)((b * (100 + y)) / 100.0));
      }
    }
    cout << maxi << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code performs the same calculations as the original code, but it does so more efficiently. It reduces memory usage by eliminating the 'tax' vector, and it reduces computation time by calculating the values of b and maxi only once per iteration. It also uses a for loop instead of a while loop, which typically improves performance in C++.
