Code Analysis:
The given code is a C++ program that computes tax for a given set of inputs. In each iteration, it calculates the tax for pairs of values and stores the maximum tax calculated so far. It uses a 2D vector to store the pairs of values and the maximum tax. The main performance bottlenecks in the code are:

1. The use of a 2D vector to store the pairs, which is inefficient in terms of memory usage.
2. The repeated calculation of the same expressions.
3. The inefficient use of division operations which are computationally expensive.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the 2D vector with two integer variables to store the pairs. This reduces memory usage and improves access time.
2. Store the result of repeated calculations in variables to avoid recalculating the same values.
3. Replace the division operations with equivalent multiplication operations where possible. Division is more computationally expensive than multiplication.

Optimization Steps:

1. Replace the 2D vector with two integer variables `a` and `b`. Instead of storing all pairs, we only need to store the pair that yields the maximum value of `maxi`.

Explanation: This approach reduces memory usage and improves access time because accessing a variable in memory is faster than accessing an element in a 2D vector. The trade-off is that we lose the history of all pairs, but this is acceptable because we are only interested in the pair that gives the maximum `maxi`.

2. Store the repeated calculation `(100+x)/100.0` in a variable `tax_rate`.

Explanation: This avoids the need to calculate the same value in multiple places, thereby reducing computation time. The trade-off is a slight increase in memory usage to store the variable, but this is outweighed by the reduction in computation time.

3. Replace the division operations with equivalent multiplication operations where possible.

Explanation: Division is more computationally expensive than multiplication. By replacing division operations with multiplication operations, we can reduce computation time. The trade-off is a slight increase in code complexity, but this is outweighed by the reduction in computation time.

Optimized Code:

```C++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int x, y, s;
  while (cin >> x >> y >> s && (x || y || s)) {
    int maxi = 0, a = 1, b, a_val, b_val;
    double tax_rate = 1.0 / ((100 + x) / 100.0);
    while (a < s) {
      b = (s - (int)(a * tax_rate) + 1) * tax_rate;
      a_val = (int)(a * tax_rate);
      b_val = (int)(b * tax_rate);
      if (a_val + b_val == s && b != 0) {
        maxi = max(maxi, (int)((a * (100 + y)) / 100.0) + (int)((b * (100 + y)) / 100.0));
      }
      a++;
    }
    cout << maxi << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
