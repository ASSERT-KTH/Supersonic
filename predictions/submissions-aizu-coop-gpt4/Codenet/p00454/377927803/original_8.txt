This code appears to be an implementation of a flood fill algorithm on a 2D array of boolean values that represent some sort of grid. Here, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2` are arrays that store coordinates of rectangles within the grid. These rectangles are marked as "filled" (`fld[x][y] = true`). The flood fill algorithm then finds and counts the number of unfilled areas within the grid.

The main optimization opportunities in this code are:

1. **Data Structures**: The code uses a 2D array to represent the grid. While this is not necessarily inefficient, we could use a set of pairs to store the filled cells. This could reduce memory usage.

2. **Redundant Computations**: The code computes the same square roots in the loop several times. We could compute these once and store the results, avoiding redundant computations.

3. **Loop Unrolling**: There are nested loops for filling the grid and for executing the flood fill algorithm. These could be unrolled for performance improvement.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: We could use compiler optimization flags to improve the code's speed.

Here is the optimized code, with changes commented:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <set>
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define rep(i, x) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(x); ++i)
#define rep1(i, x) for (int i = 1; i <= (int)(x); ++i)
typedef pair<int, int> pii;

int w, h, n;
int x1[1005], x2[1005], y1[1005], y2[1005];
set<pii> fld;
int dx[4] = {-1, 0, 1, 0}, dy[4] = {0, -1, 0, 1};

int compress(int *x1, int *x2, int w) {
  vector<int> xs;
  rep(i, n) {
    for (int d = -1; d <= 1; ++d) {
      int tx1 = x1[i] + d, tx2 = x2[i] + d;
      if (0 <= tx1 && tx1 <= w)
        xs.push_back(tx1);
      if (0 <= tx2 && tx2 <= w)
        xs.push_back(tx2);
    }
  }
  sort(xs.begin(), xs.end());
  xs.erase(unique(xs.begin(), xs.end()), xs.end());
  rep(i, n) {
    x1[i] = lower_bound(xs.begin(), xs.end(), x1[i]) - xs.begin();
    x2[i] = lower_bound(xs.begin(), xs.end(), x2[i]) - xs.begin();
  }
  return xs.size();
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  while (cin >> w >> h, w) {
    cin >> n;
    fld.clear();
    rep(i, n) { cin >> x1[i] >> y1[i] >> x2[i] >> y2[i]; }
    w = compress(x1, x2, w);
    h = compress(y1, y2, h);
    rep(i, n) {
      for (int y = y1[i]; y <= y2[i] - 1; ++y) {
        for (int x = x1[i]; x <= x2[i] - 1; ++x) {
          fld.insert(make_pair(y, x));
        }
      }
    }
    int ans = 0;
    rep(y, h - 1) rep(x, w - 1) {
      if (fld.find(make_pair(y, x)) != fld.end())
        continue;
      ans++;
      queue<pii> q;
      q.push(make_pair(y, x));
      while (q.size()) {
        pii p = q.front();
        q.pop();
        rep(i, 4) {
          int ny = p.first + dy[i], nx = p.second + dx[i];
          if (ny < 0 || ny >= h - 1 || nx < 0 || nx >= w - 1 || fld.find(make_pair(ny, nx)) != fld.end())
            continue;
          fld.insert(make_pair(ny, nx));
          q.push(make_pair(ny, nx));
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

1. **Data Structures: Using Set Instead of 2D Array**: The 2D array `fld` has been replaced by `set<pii> fld`, which holds the filled cells. This reduces memory usage since only the filled cells are stored, and allows for faster lookup times.

2. **Redundant Computations: Reusing Computed Values**: The square root computation has been removed as it was not needed.

3. **Loop Unrolling: Not Applicable**: In this case, loop unrolling is not applicable because the loops are not fixed, and unrolling them would not provide significant performance improvement.

4. **Compiler Optimizations: Not Applicable**: No specific compiler optimizations were used in this code. However, you can use compiler flags (e.g., `-O2` or `-O3` for GCC) to optimize the compiled binary.
