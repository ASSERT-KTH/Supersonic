The given code appears to be a solution to a competitive programming problem. It attempts to find the number of disconnected areas in a 2D grid, where some cells are blocked. The grid is formed by compressing given ranges of integers. The primary areas to optimize here are:

1. Data Structures: The code uses a 2D boolean array 'fld' to represent the grid. This structure is efficient for the given problem, so no change is needed.

2. Redundant Computations: The compress function is called twice, once for 'x' coordinates and once for 'y' coordinates. It could be optimized to handle both at once. However, this might complicate the code, so we'll keep it as it is for now.

3. Loops: The nested loop in the main function is a key performance bottleneck. We can attempt to optimize it.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler flags can be used to optimize the performance of the code. However, since the code is likely intended to be run on a variety of compilers in competitive programming environments, we'll leave this out of scope.

Optimization steps:

1. Queue Optimization: The standard library queue used in the BFS can be slow due to dynamic memory allocation. We can replace it with a simple vector and manually manage the queue interface, which can be faster.

2. Avoiding Redundant Queue Insertions: The code currently pushes a cell into the queue before marking it as visited. If there are multiple paths to a cell, it might be pushed into the queue multiple times before it's popped and marked as visited. To avoid this, we can mark a cell as visited right when it's pushed into the queue.

3. Loop Unrolling: The loop that checks the four neighbors of a cell can be unrolled to avoid the overhead of loop iteration.

4. Optimizing the compress function: The compress function currently sorts the coordinates, removes duplicates, and then finds new indices for each coordinate. The finding of new indices can be optimized by storing the sorted coordinates in a map instead of a vector. This gives O(1) look-up time instead of O(log n).

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

#define rep(i, x) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(x); ++i)
#define all(a) a.begin(), a.end()
using pii = pair<int, int>;

int w, h;
int n;
int x1[1005], x2[1005];
int y1[1005], y2[1005];
bool fld[1005 * 6 + 2][1005 * 6 + 2];

int compress(int *x1, int *x2, int w) {
  vector<int> xs;
  rep(i, n) {
    for (int d = -1; d <= 1; ++d) {
      int tx1 = x1[i] + d, tx2 = x2[i] + d;
      if (0 <= tx1 && tx1 <= w)
        xs.push_back(tx1);
      if (0 <= tx2 && tx2 <= w)
        xs.push_back(tx2);
    }
  }
  sort(all(xs));
  xs.erase(unique(all(xs)), end(xs));
  
  unordered_map<int, int> xs_map;
  int idx = 0;
  for(int x : xs)
    xs_map[x] = idx++;

  rep(i, n) {
    x1[i] = xs_map[x1[i]];
    x2[i] = xs_map[x2[i]];
  }
  return xs.size();
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  while (cin >> w >> h, w) {
    cin >> n;
    memset(fld, 0, sizeof fld);
    rep(i, n) { cin >> x1[i] >> y1[i] >> x2[i] >> y2[i]; }
    w = compress(x1, x2, w);
    h = compress(y1, y2, h);
    rep(i, n) {
      for (int y = y1[i]; y <= y2[i] - 1; ++y) {
        for (int x = x1[i]; x <= x2[i] - 1; ++x) {
          fld[y][x] = true;
        }
      }
    }
    int ans = 0;
    vector<pii> q;
    int head = 0; // Our manual queue head index
    rep(y, h - 1) rep(x, w - 1) {
      if (fld[y][x])
        continue;
      ans++;
      q.push_back(pii(y, x));
      fld[y][x] = true;
      while (head < q.size()) {
        pii p = q[head++];
        int ny, nx;
        ny = p.first - 1, nx = p.second;
        if (ny >= 0 && !fld[ny][nx]) {
          q.push_back(pii(ny, nx));
          fld[ny][nx] = true;
        }
        ny = p.first, nx = p.second - 1;
        if (nx >= 0 && !fld[ny][nx]) {
          q.push_back(pii(ny, nx));
          fld[ny][nx] = true;
        }
        ny = p.first + 1, nx = p.second;
        if (ny < h - 1 && !fld[ny][nx]) {
          q.push_back(pii(ny, nx));
          fld[ny][nx] = true;
        }
        ny = p.first, nx = p.second + 1;
        if (nx < w - 1 && !fld[ny][nx]) {
          q.push_back(pii(ny, nx));
          fld[ny][nx] = true;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
This code should have the same functionality as the original but with some performance improvements.
