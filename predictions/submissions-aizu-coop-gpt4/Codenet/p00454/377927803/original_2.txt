1. **Code Analysis:**

The given program is a C++ solution for a competitive programming problem. It reads the width and height of a field and a set of rectangular areas within the field. It then counts the number of disconnected areas which are not covered by any of the rectangles.

Potential bottlenecks:

- Redundant calculations and operations: The program has multiple occurrences of the same calculations and operations, which can potentially slow down the execution.
- Inefficient search: The program uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find all disconnected areas which are not covered by any of the rectangles. This could be optimized using a more efficient search algorithm.
- Memory usage: The program uses a 2D boolean array to represent the field, which can potentially use up a lot of memory.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**

A. Use more efficient data structures:
- The program uses a 2D boolean array to represent the field. We can replace this with a set (or unordered_set for faster lookups) of coordinates that are not covered by any rectangles.

B. Remove redundant and unnecessary computations:
- The program calculates the coordinates of the rectangles multiple times. We can calculate these coordinates once and store them for future use.

C. Optimize loops:
- The program uses nested loops to go through the field and check each cell. We can optimize this by only visiting the cells that are not covered by any rectangles.

D. Compiler optimizations:
- We can use compiler optimizations such as -O3 to optimize the run-time performance of the code.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

A. Replace the 2D array with a set of coordinates:
- The current representation of the field as a 2D array can lead to high memory usage. We can replace this with a set of coordinates that are not covered by any rectangles. This will significantly reduce the memory usage as we only store the necessary coordinates.

B. Remove redundant computations:
- The program calculates the coordinates of the rectangles multiple times. We can calculate these coordinates once and store them in a list. This will reduce the number of computations, leading to faster execution.

C. Optimize loops:
- The program uses nested loops to go through the field and check each cell. We can optimize this by only visiting the cells that are not covered by any rectangles. This will significantly reduce the number of iterations, leading to faster execution.

D. Compiler optimizations:
- We can use compiler optimizations such as -O3 to optimize the run-time performance of the code. These optimizations include function inlining, loop unrolling, and many others. They can significantly improve the performance of the code.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

Please note that the exact optimization will depend on the details of the problem and the given constraints. Here is a general idea of how the optimized code might look like:

```
//... the rest of the code remains the same

// Replace the 2D boolean array with a set of coordinates
set<pair<int, int>> uncovered_cells;

// Calculate and store the coordinates of the rectangles once
vector<pair<int, int>> rectangles;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
  cin >> x1[i] >> y1[i] >> x2[i] >> y2[i];
  rectangles.push_back(make_pair(x1[i], y1[i]));
  rectangles.push_back(make_pair(x2[i], y2[i]));
}

// Add all cells to the set of uncovered cells
for(int x = 0; x < w; x++){
  for(int y = 0; y < h; y++){
    uncovered_cells.insert(make_pair(x, y));
  }
}

// Remove the cells that are covered by the rectangles
for(auto rectangle : rectangles){
  for(int x = rectangle.first; x < rectangle.second; x++){
    for(int y = rectangle.first; y < rectangle.second; y++){
      uncovered_cells.erase(make_pair(x, y));
    }
  }
}

//... the rest of the code remains the same

```
