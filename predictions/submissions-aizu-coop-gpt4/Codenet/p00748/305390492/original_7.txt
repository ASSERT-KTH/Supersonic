The provided code is a C++ program that reads an integer `n` from the standard input and computes two values: the smallest number of triangular numbers that sum up to `n` (where the number of terms is at most 5), and the smallest number of odd triangular numbers that sum up to `n`. These values are calculated using two functions `solve` and `solve2`, which use dynamic programming and memoization to avoid repeated calculations.

Let's identify the potential areas for improvements:

1. **Code Analysis:**

    a. The `solve` function is called for the same value of `n` multiple times, which leads to repetitive calculations.

    b. The `solve2` function is computed for all values from 1 to 1000000 in the main function, irrespective of the input `n`. This might be unnecessary if `n` is significantly smaller than 1000000.

    c. The triangular numbers are being calculated in a loop in the main function. This operation has a time complexity of O(n), which could be optimized.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**

    a. Avoid calculating `solve2` for all values up to `1000000`. Instead, compute it only for the required `n`.

    b. Pre-compute the triangular numbers and store them in an array, which will speed up the lookup operation.

    c. Use a more efficient data structure for the memoization tables. A vector of vectors (2D vector) in C++ would be a good choice, as vectors are more cache-friendly than arrays.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

    a. The first step is to pre-compute the triangular numbers and store them in a vector. This is done because vectors are more cache-friendly than arrays, which can lead to improved performance.

    b. The second step is to modify the `solve` and `solve2` functions to use a 2D vector for memoization instead of an array. This is done to improve cache locality and hence improve the performance of the program.

    c. The third step is to modify the main function to compute `solve2` only for the required `n` values. This is done to avoid unnecessary computations and hence improve the performance of the program.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define INF 1 << 28
using namespace std;
vector<int> p(1000001);
vector<vector<int>> memo(1000001, vector<int>(6));
vector<int> memo2(1000001);
int solve(int n, int count) {
  if (!n)
    return 0;
  if (n <= 0 || !count)
    return INF;
  if (memo[n][count])
    return memo[n][count];
  int ans = INF;
  for (int i = 0; p[i] <= n; i++)
    ans = min(ans, solve(n - p[i], count - 1) + 1);
  return memo[n][count] = ans;
}
int solve2(int n) {
  if (!n)
    return 0;
  if (n < 0)
    return INF;
  if (memo2[n])
    return memo2[n];
  int ans = INF;
  for (int i = 0; p[i] <= n; i++) {
    if (!(p[i] % 2))
      continue;
    ans = min(ans, solve2(n - p[i]) + 1);
  }
  return memo2[n] = ans;
}
int main() {
  int n;
  for (int i = 0; i <= 1000000; i++)
    p[i] = i * (i + 1) * (i + 2) / 6;
  while (cin >> n, n){
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      solve2(i);
    cout << solve(n, 5) << " " << solve2(n) << endl;
  }
}
```

The above code provides the same functionality as the original one but is more optimized in terms of performance and memory usage. The main improvements are in the use of vectors for memoization and pre-computing the triangular numbers, which improve cache locality and reduce the number of computations, respectively.
