The given code seems to be related to a kind of dynamic programming problem.

1. Code Analysis:
   - Both the functions solve() and solve2() are recursive functions, which call themselves with a smaller argument - this is often a performance bottleneck due to the overhead of function calls and can lead to stack overflow for large inputs. 
   - The memoization arrays 'memo' and 'memo2' are used to store intermediate results to avoid re-computation, which is a good practice in dynamic programming. However, their sizes are fixed and quite large (1M elements), which may waste memory if the actual input size is much smaller. 
   - In the main function, the array 'p' is precomputed, which is also a good practice to avoid redundant computations. However, the precomputation is done for all possible input values, which may not be necessary and can waste both time and memory. 
   - The precomputation of memo2 array is done in a separate loop, which can be merged into the precomputation of 'p' array to save one loop iteration over all possible input values.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Convert recursive DP to iterative DP: This can save the overhead of function calls and avoid the risk of stack overflow. It also makes the code easier to understand and debug.
   - Dynamic memory allocation for memoization arrays: This can save memory if the actual input size is much smaller than the maximum possible size. 
   - Merge precomputation loops: This can save one loop iteration over all possible input values.
   - Early stopping in DP computation: If an optimal solution has been found (e.g., the minimum number of steps is 1), we can stop the loop immediately to save time.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   - First, we convert the recursive functions solve() and solve2() to iterative ones. The iterative version of solve() function would look like this:
     ```
     for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
       for (int j = 0; j <= 5; j++) {
         if (i == 0) {
           memo[i][j] = 0;
         } else if (j == 0) {
           memo[i][j] = INF;
         } else {
           for (int k = 0; p[k] <= i; k++) {
             memo[i][j] = min(memo[i][j], memo[i - p[k]][j - 1] + 1);
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```
     The iterative version of solve2() function would look similar.
   - Then, we allocate memory for the memoization arrays dynamically according to the actual input size 'n'. For example:
     ```
     int** memo = new int*[n + 1];
     for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
       memo[i] = new int[6];
     }
     int* memo2 = new int[n + 1];
     ```
     Don't forget to free the allocated memory at the end of the program:
     ```
     for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
       delete[] memo[i];
     }
     delete[] memo;
     delete[] memo2;
     ```
   - Next, we merge the precomputation loops of 'p' array and 'memo2' array into one loop:
     ```
     for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
       p[i] = i * (i + 1) * (i + 2) / 6;
       if (i > 0) {
         for (int j = 0; p[j] <= i; j++) {
           if (!(p[j] % 2)) {
             continue;
           }
           memo2[i] = min(memo2[i], memo2[i - p[j]] + 1);
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - Finally, we add an early stopping condition in the DP computation loop: if an optimal solution has been found, we stop the loop immediately. For example:
     ```
     for (int k = 0; p[k] <= i; k++) {
       memo[i][j] = min(memo[i][j], memo[i - p[k]][j - 1] + 1);
       if (memo[i][j] == 1) {
         break;
       }
     }
     ```
     The same condition can be added in the computation of 'memo2' array.
