The given C++ code appears to be a dynamic programming problem, where the goal is to find the minimum number of tetrahedral numbers (represented by the array 'p') that sum up to 'n', for two different cases. The 'solve' function seeks to find the minimum number using up to five tetrahedral numbers, while 'solve2' only considers odd tetrahedral numbers. There are several areas in this code where optimization can be applied.

### 1. Code Analysis:

Upon analyzing the code, we can note several areas of potential optimization:

- There's a generation of the 'p' array with tetrahedral numbers that is not optimized. The generation of the array could be stopped once the tetrahedral number exceeds the maximum 'n' (1000000 in this case).
- The function 'solve' and 'solve2' are using a top-down dynamic programming approach (also known as memoization). However, a bottom-up approach could be more memory efficient and faster because it eliminates the overhead of recursion and function calls. 
- The 'solve2' function is called for all values from 1 to 1000000 at the start, which is unnecessary and could be optimized.
- The condition p[i] % 2 in 'solve2' function checks if the number is even and continues the loop if true. It is redundant as tetrahedral numbers generated by the formula are all positive integers and every third one starting from index 2 (0-indexed) is even.

### 2. Optimization Strategy:

- Optimize the generation of tetrahedral number array.
- Convert the top-down dynamic programming approach to a bottom-up approach.
- Avoid pre-calculating all values in 'solve2' function.
- Remove the redundant check for even numbers in 'solve2' function.

### 3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

- **Step 1**: The generation of the 'p' array with tetrahedral numbers is not optimized. We will stop the generation once the tetrahedral number exceeds the maximum 'n' (1000000 in this case). This will save time and memory.

- **Step 2**: The functions 'solve' and 'solve2' are using a top-down dynamic programming approach (also known as memoization). However, a bottom-up approach could be more memory efficient and faster because it eliminates the overhead of recursion and function calls. 

- **Step 3**: In the main function, 'solve2' is called for all values from 1 to 1000000 at the start. This is unnecessary and we can optimize it by only calling 'solve2' when needed.

- **Step 4**: In the 'solve2' function, there is a condition p[i] % 2, which checks if the number is even and continues the loop if true. This is redundant because tetrahedral numbers are all positive integers and every third one starting from index 2 (0-indexed) is even. We can optimize this by only iterating over odd indices.

### 4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#define INF 1 << 28
using namespace std;
int p[1000001];
int memo[1000001][6];
int memo2[1000001];

void solve2(int n) {
  memo2[0] = 0;
  for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    int ans = INF;
    for (int j = 0; p[j] <= i && j % 2 == 0; j++)
      ans = min(ans, memo2[i - p[j]] + 1);
    memo2[i] = ans;
  }
}

void solve(int n) {
  for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    memo[i][0] = (i == 0)? 0 : INF;
    for(int j = 1; j <= min(i, 5); j++) {
      int ans = INF;
      for(int k = 0; p[k] <= i; k++)
        ans = min(ans, memo[i - p[k]][j - 1] + 1);
      memo[i][j] = ans;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  for (int i = 0; i <= 1000000; i++) {
    p[i] = i * (i + 1) * (i + 2) / 6;
    if(p[i] > 1000000) {
      p[i] = -1;
      break;
    }
  }
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    solve(n);
    solve2(n);
    cout << memo[n][5] << " " << memo2[n] << endl;
  }
}
```

In this optimized code, we generate only required tetrahedral numbers, use bottom-up dynamic programming approach, pre-calculate only required answers by calling solve and solve2 when needed, and eliminate the redundant check for even numbers in solve2.
