After analyzing the code, it's clear that the program is implementing two types of dynamic programming to solve two problems. The first function, 'solve', is calculating the minimum number of pentagonal numbers that sum to 'n' using at most 'count' numbers. The second function, 'solve2', is calculating the minimum number of pentagonal numbers that sum to 'n', but only using odd pentagonal numbers. The two methods use memoization to store previous results and avoid repeated calculations.

Optimization Strategy:

The code can be optimized by reducing repeated calculations and improving the structure of the loops. Here is the proposed optimization strategy:

1. For the 'solve' function, we can avoid calculating 'solve(n - p[i], count - 1) + 1' multiple times by storing it in a variable and reusing it. This change will reduce the number of function calls and improve performance.

2. In the 'solve' function, instead of starting the loop from 'i = 0', we can start from 'i = count - 1'. This will not affect the program's output because we can't use more than 'count' numbers to sum up to 'n'.

3. In the 'solve2' function, instead of checking whether 'p[i]' is an odd number in each iteration, we can generate two separate arrays, one for all pentagonal numbers and another for odd pentagonal numbers. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

4. In the 'main' function, 'solve2(i)' is called for all 'i' from 1 to 1000000. Instead, we can call 'solve2(n)' only when needed.

Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#define INF 1 << 28
using namespace std;
int p[1000001];
int odd_p[500001];  // array for odd pentagonal numbers
int memo[1000001][6];
int memo2[1000001];

int solve(int n, int count) {
  if (!n)
    return 0;
  if (n <= 0 || !count)
    return INF;
  if (memo[n][count])
    return memo[n][count];
  int ans = INF;
  for (int i = count - 1; p[i] <= n; i++) {  // start from 'count - 1'
    int temp = solve(n - p[i], count - 1) + 1;
    ans = min(ans, temp);
  }
  return memo[n][count] = ans;
}

int solve2(int n) {
  if (!n)
    return 0;
  if (n < 0)
    return INF;
  if (memo2[n])
    return memo2[n];
  int ans = INF;
  for (int i = 0; odd_p[i] <= n; i++) {  // use odd pentagonal numbers
    int temp = solve2(n - odd_p[i]) + 1;
    ans = min(ans, temp);
  }
  return memo2[n] = ans;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  int odd_index = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i <= 1000000; i++) {
    p[i] = i * (i + 1) * (i + 2) / 6;
    if (p[i] % 2)  // check if it's an odd number
      odd_p[odd_index++] = p[i];  // store in the array of odd pentagonal numbers
  }
  while (cin >> n, n)
    cout << solve(n, 5) << " " << solve2(n) << endl;  // call 'solve2(n)' only when needed
}
```

This optimized code minimizes the number of repeated calculations and loop iterations, thereby improving efficiency. However, the trade-off is that it uses a little more memory to store the odd pentagonal numbers.
