The provided code appears to be creating and manipulating a tree-like data structure. Each node in the tree contains an id, a link to its parent, a link to its leftmost child, and a link to its right sibling. The nodes are stored in an array and manipulated as per user input. The depth, type and children of each node are printed as output.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Data Structure Optimization: The data structure seems appropriate for the problem at hand and doesn't need optimization.
2. Redundant or Unnecessary Computations: The function getDepth traverses the tree from a given node to the root to find the depth. This is an O(n) operation that is performed every time a node is printed. We can optimize this by calculating the depth of a node while the tree is being created and storing it in the node itself. This will make the depth retrieval an O(1) operation.
3. Loop Optimization: The loops seem to be efficient and don't need much optimization.
4. Compiler Optimization: Compiler optimization flags like -O2 or -O3 can be used while compiling the code to enhance the performance. However, one must be careful as these optimizations can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.

Optimization Steps:
1. Modify the 'node' struct to include a 'depth' field. This field will store the depth of the node in the tree.
2. In the loop that creates the tree, calculate the depth of a node by adding 1 to the depth of its parent and store it in the node.
3. Modify the getDepth function to simply return the depth stored in the node.
4. Compile the code with an optimization flag like -O2.

Trade-offs: Adding the 'depth' field increases the memory usage of each node by the size of an 'int'. However, this increase is insignificant compared to the time saved by not having to calculate the depth each time it's needed.

Optimized Code Block:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct node {
  int id;
  int depth;  // added depth field
  struct node *parent;
  struct node *leftMostChild;
  struct node *rightSibling;
} * nodePointer;

// rest of the function declarations...

int main(void) {
  // ...
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // ...
    for (j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      // ...
      arr[c1]->parent = arr[id];
      arr[c1]->depth = arr[id]->depth + 1;  // calculate and store depth
      // ...
    }
  }
  // ...
}

// rest of the functions...

int getDepth(nodePointer p) {
  return p->depth;  // return stored depth
}
```
Remember to compile the code with an optimization flag like -O2 to further enhance performance.
