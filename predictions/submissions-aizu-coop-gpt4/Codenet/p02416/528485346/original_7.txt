1. **Code Analysis**

The given code reads strings of numbers from the input in an infinite loop until it encounters a string starting with '0'. For each string, it calculates the sum of the digits and prints the sum.

Here are the potential performance issues:

- The `strlen(num)` function is called at each iteration of the loop, which results in unnecessary computation since the length of the string does not change within the loop. This is a O(n) operation at each iteration, which makes the whole loop run in O(n^2) time complexity.
- The `scanf` and `printf` functions are slower than other IO operations like `cin` and `cout` in C++.

2. **Optimization Strategy**

A. Replace inefficient operations with more efficient alternatives where possible.
- Store the length of the string in a variable before the loop instead of calling `strlen(num)` at each iteration.
- Use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf` for faster IO operations.

B. Remove redundant computations.
- Calculate the string length once and use it in the loop.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. Storing the string length in a variable: The length of the string `num` is calculated at each iteration which is computationally expensive. Instead, we should calculate the length only once before the loop starts and use that value in the loop.

2. Using faster IO operations: The `scanf` and `printf` functions are slower compared to `cin` and `cout`. As such, replacing them can lead to faster execution times.

4. **Optimized Code Block**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string num;
    while (1) {
        cin >> num;
        if (num[0] == '0')
            break;
        int sum = 0;
        int len = num.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            sum += num[i] - '0';
        }
        cout << sum << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Changes Made:**

- Replaced `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` for faster IO operations.
- Changed `char num[1001]` to `string num` for easier manipulation.
- Stored the length of the string in `len` before the loop to avoid repeated calls to `strlen` or `string::length`.
- Replaced `strlen(num) > i` with `i < len` to avoid unnecessary computation.
