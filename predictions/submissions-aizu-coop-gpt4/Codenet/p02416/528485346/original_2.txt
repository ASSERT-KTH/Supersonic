## 1. Code Analysis

The above code reads a string of digits from the user, calculates the sum of the digits, and prints it. It keeps doing this until the user enters '0'. 

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:

- The `strlen(num)` function is called within the loop condition every iteration. This leads to redundant computation since the length of the string doesn't change during the loop iterations.
- The code reads the input using `scanf` which is slower compared to `std::cin`.

## 2. Optimization Strategy

A. Inefficient data structures: Not an issue in this program.

B. Redundant computations: The `strlen(num)` function call is redundant and can be computed once before the loop starts.

C. Loops or recursive calls: The for loop can be optimized by removing the redundant `strlen(num)` function call.

D. Compiler optimizations: Not considered in this optimization.

## 3. Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Compute the string length once before the loop starts and store it in a variable. This will reduce redundant computation and make the loop condition check faster.

2. Replace `scanf` with `std::cin` for faster input.

## 4. Optimized Code Block

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    char num[1001];
    while (1) {
        cin >> num;
        if (num[0] == '0')
            break;
        int sum = 0;
        int len = strlen(num); // compute the string length once before the loop starts
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) { // use the pre-computed string length
            sum += num[i] - '0';
        }
        cout << sum << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The optimized code still preserves the functionality and output of the original code. It just reduces redundant computation and uses faster input function.
Trade-offs: There isn't any significant trade-off in this optimization. The code complexity remains the same and the performance is improved.
