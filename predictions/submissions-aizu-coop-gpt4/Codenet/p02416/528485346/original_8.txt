1. Code Analysis:

This program reads a string of numbers from the input, calculates the sum of the digits in the string, and prints the sum. It uses a loop to read the individual characters in the string, converts each character to the equivalent integer value, and adds this value to a running sum. The program repeats this operation until it encounters a string that starts with a '0'. 

The potential performance bottlenecks include:

- The use of the `strlen` function inside the loop condition. This function is O(n), so the time complexity of the loop is O(n^2). 

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Inefficient data structures: The use of a character array to store the string is not necessarily inefficient, but the way it is used can be improved.

B. Redundant computations: The length of the string is computed in every iteration of the loop, which is unnecessary. 

C. Loops that can be optimized: The for-loop can be optimized by calculating the string length once before the loop starts.

D. Compiler optimizations: These might not be directly applicable in this case, but it's always a good idea to compile with optimization flags such as `-O2` or `-O3` for C/C++.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. The first optimization step is to calculate the length of the string once before the loop starts. This way, we only calculate the length of the string once, reducing the time complexity of the loop from O(n^2) to O(n). This should result in significant performance improvements for long strings.

B. Trade-offs: There aren't any significant trade-offs in this case. The code complexity remains roughly the same; we just moved the `strlen` call out of the loop.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  char num[1001];
  while (1) {
    scanf("%s", num);
    if (num[0] == '0')
      break;
    int sum = 0;
    int numLength = strlen(num);  // Calculate string length once before the loop
    for (int i = 0; i < numLength; i++) {  // Use pre-calculated string length
      sum += num[i] - '0';
    }
    printf("%d\n", sum);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The only change made is the addition of the `numLength` variable, which is calculated before the loop, and the change in the loop condition to use `numLength` instead of `strlen(num)`. This ensures that the length of the string is calculated only once per iteration of the while-loop, rather than once per iteration of the for-loop, reducing unnecessary computations.
