Code Analysis:

This code reads a string of numbers, computes the sum of the digits, and prints the sum. Although the code is straightforward and simple, there's a noticeable inefficiency in the for loop. In each iteration, the function `strlen(num)` is called, which traverses the entire string to compute its length. This makes the loop take time proportional to the square of the length of the string, which is unnecessary.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The current data structures used in the code are efficient for the specific problem. A char array is the best choice for storing a string, and an integer is necessary for the sum.

2. Redundant Computations: The program is calling `strlen(num)` in every loop iteration. This can be avoided by calling it once before the loop starts and storing the result.

3. Optimizable Loops: The loop can be optimized by removing the redundant `strlen(num)` call.

4. Compiler optimizations: In this case, there are no specific compiler optimizations or pragma directives necessary.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. We'll first calculate the length of the string and store it in a variable before entering the loop. This will save us from recalculating it in every iteration. It will reduce the time complexity of the program from O(n^2) to O(n), where n is the length of the string.

2. There are no trade-offs within this optimization. The code complexity doesn't increase and performance is improved.

Optimized Code Block:

```C++
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  char num[1001];
  while (1) {
    scanf("%s", num);
    if (num[0] == '0')
      break;
    int sum = 0;
    int len = strlen(num); // compute the length only once
    for (int i = 0; len > i; i++) { // use the pre-computed length
      sum += num[i] - '0';
    }
    printf("%d\n", sum);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, the length of the string is calculated only once before the loop. This significantly improves the performance of the code for long strings.
