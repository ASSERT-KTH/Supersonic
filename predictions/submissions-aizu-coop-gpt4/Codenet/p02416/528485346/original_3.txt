**Code Analysis**

This program reads in a string of numbers and calculates the sum of the digits in the number. It continues to do this until the input string is '0'. The potential inefficiencies in this code are:

1. The use of strlen() function in the loop condition. This function calculates the length of the string every time the loop iterates, which is inefficient because the length of the string does not change during the loop execution.

2. The use of scanf and printf for input/output. Though not necessarily inefficient, these functions are slower compared to their C++ counterparts cin and cout.

**Optimization Strategy**

Based on the identified inefficiencies, the following optimization strategies can be applied:

1. Calculate the length of the string once before the loop begins and store it in a variable. Replace the strlen() function in the loop condition with this variable.

2. Replace scanf and printf with cin and cout for faster input/output.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. Remove the strlen() call from the loop condition: The strlen() function iterates over the entire string to calculate its length. Since the string length doesn't change during the execution of the loop, calling this function in each iteration is redundant and inefficient. We can optimize this by calculating the length of the string once before the loop begins and storing it in a variable. Then, replace the strlen() call in the loop condition with this variable.

    This change will reduce the time complexity of the loop from O(n^2) to O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because previously, for each character in the string, the program was iterating over the entire string again to calculate its length. Now, the program only iterates over the string once.

2. Replace scanf and printf with cin and cout: The scanf and printf functions are part of the C standard library and are slower compared to their C++ counterparts cin and cout. This is because scanf and printf have to parse the format string in each call, while cin and cout use the type information at compile time to determine how to handle the input/output. Replacing scanf and printf with cin and cout can therefore result in faster input/output.

**Optimized Code Block**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string num;
  while (1) {
    cin >> num;
    if (num[0] == '0')
      break;
    int sum = 0;
    int len = num.length(); //Calculate the length of the string once
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) { //Replace strlen() call with len
      sum += num[i] - '0';
    }
    cout << sum << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

**Trade-offs**

The main trade-off in this optimization process is the slight increase in code complexity due to the introduction of the len variable. However, the performance gain from this change is significant and usually worth the slight increase in complexity. 

In terms of the change from scanf/printf to cin/cout, there's no significant trade-offs as both provide similar functionality, but cin/cout perform faster in the context of C++.
