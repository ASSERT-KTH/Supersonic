Code Analysis:
This program reads strings of digits from the standard input, until it finds a string starting with '0'. For each string read (excluding the final '0' string), it calculates the sum of the digits and prints it. The code is simple and easy to understand, but there is a significant performance bottleneck in the loop where the sum of the characters is computed.

The function strlen(num) is called at each iteration of the loop, which makes the time complexity of the program O(n^2), where n is the length of the string. The function strlen computes the length of the string by traversing it until it finds a null character, so calling it repeatedly in a loop is inefficient.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: The data structures used in the code are efficient for the task at hand.
2. Redundant Computation: The call to strlen(num) in the for loop is redundant and can be computed once before the loop.
3. Loops: The loop could be optimized by removing the redundant strlen call.
4. Compiler Optimizations: There is not much scope for compiler optimization in this code as it is quite straightforward.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Store the result of strlen(num) in a variable before the loop begins. This will improve performance because strlen will only be computed once, rather than at each iteration of the loop. The time complexity will be reduced from O(n^2) to O(n).
2. There is no trade-off in this optimization as it reduces time complexity without increasing code complexity or affecting the output.

Optimized Code Block:
```
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  char num[1001];
  while (1) {
    scanf("%s", num);
    if (num[0] == '0')
      break;
    int sum = 0;
    int len = strlen(num);  // Compute the length once before the loop
    for (int i = 0; len > i; i++) {  // Replace the call to strlen with the computed length
      sum += num[i] - '0';
    }
    printf("%d\n", sum);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code maintains the same functionality as the original code but with improved efficiency.
