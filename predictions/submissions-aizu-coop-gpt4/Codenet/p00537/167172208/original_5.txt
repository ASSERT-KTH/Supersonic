1. Code Analysis:
This is a Segment Tree based solution. The code is using segment trees to keep track of the ranges where increments happen. Then, it queries the segment tree to find the sum in a range and then uses it to compute the final result. The code is already quite efficient, but there are a few areas where small improvements could be made.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Use of efficient data structures:
The code is already using efficient data structures like vectors to store the segment tree data. There are no significant changes required in this area.

B. Remove redundant computations:
There are no redundant computations in the code. Each computation is necessary for the functioning of the Segment Tree.

C. Optimize loops and recursive calls:
The recursive calls in the code are necessary for the Segment Tree operations. However, in the Query function, we can reduce the total number of recursive calls by rearranging the condition checks.

D. Compiler optimizations:
The compiler can often optimize the code better if the loops are unrolled. GCC also has a built-in function __builtin_expect which can hint the compiler about the likelihood of a condition being true.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Reordering condition checks in Query function:
In the Query function, we are checking three conditions. However, we can change the order of these checks to reduce the number of recursive calls. The condition (a <= l && r <= b) is more likely to be true than the others, so we can check it first.

B. Use of __builtin_expect in condition checks:
In the Query and Add functions, the condition checks can be optimized by using the __builtin_expect function. This function provides a hint to the compiler about the expected result of a condition check, which can help the compiler optimize the code. We expect the conditions (a >= r || b <= l) and (a <= l && r <= b) to be false most of the time, so we can use __builtin_expect with these conditions.

C. Loop unrolling:
The for loop in the main function can be unrolled to improve performance. Loop unrolling is a technique used to increase the speed of the loops by reducing the overhead of loop control instructions.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized form of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
struct SegmentTree {
  vector<int> seg, add;
  int sz;
  SegmentTree(int n) {
    sz = 1;
    while (sz < n)
      sz *= 2;
    seg.assign(sz * 2 + 1, 0), add.assign(sz * 2 + 1, 0);
  }
  void Add(int a, int b, int x, int k, int l, int r) {
    if (__builtin_expect((a >= r || b <= l), 0)) {
      return;
    } else if (__builtin_expect((a <= l && r <= b), 0)) {
      add[k] += x;
    } else {
      Add(a, b, x, 2 * k + 1, l, (l + r) / 2);
      Add(a, b, x, 2 * k + 2, (l + r) / 2, r);
      seg[k] =
          seg[2 * k + 1] + add[2 * k + 1] + seg[2 * k + 2] + add[2 * k + 2];
    }
  }
  int Query(int a, int b, int k, int l, int r) {
    if (__builtin_expect((a <= l && r <= b), 1))
      return (seg[k] + add[k]);
    if (__builtin_expect((a >= r || b <= l), 0))
      return 0;
    return (Query(a, b, 2 * k + 1, l, (l + r) / 2) +
            Query(a, b, 2 * k + 2, (l + r) / 2, r) + add[k]);
  }
  void Add(int a, int b, int x) { Add(a, b, x, 0, 0, sz); }
  int Query(int a, int b) { return (Query(a, b, 0, 0, sz)); }
};
int main() {
  int N, M, P[100000];
  scanf("%d %d", &N, &M);
  SegmentTree segtree(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &P[i]);
    --P[i];
  }
  for (int i = 1; i < M; i++) {
    int u = min(P[i - 1], P[i]), v = max(P[i - 1], P[i]);
    segtree.Add(u, v, 1);
  }
  long long ret = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i+= 2) {
    long long used1 = segtree.Query(i, i + 1);
    long long used2 = i + 1 < N - 1 ? segtree.Query(i+1, i + 2) : 0;
    int A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2;
    scanf("%d %d %d", &A1, &B1, &C1);
    if (i + 1 < N - 1)
        scanf("%d %d %d", &A2, &B2, &C2);
    ret += min(used1 * A1, C1 + used1 * B1);
    if (i + 1 < N - 1)
        ret += min(used2 * A2, C2 + used2 * B2);
  }
  cout << ret << endl;
}
```
