After analyzing the code, here are some of the possible optimizations:

1. **Inefficient Data Structures**: The 2D array `dp` is initialized with a size of `4001 x 5`, which is larger than what's needed. The second dimension (`i`) only goes up to `4`, so a size of `5` is sufficient.

2. **Redundant Computations**: The same values in array `dp` are computed multiple times due to the nested loops. We can reduce the time complexity by avoiding these redundant computations.

3. **Loops/Recursive Calls**: The three nested loops have a high time complexity. We can optimize the code by reducing the number of iterations in these loops.

4. **Compiler Optimizations/Pragma Directives**: We can use compiler optimization flags like `-O3` to improve the performance of the code. 

## Optimization Strategy

1. **Efficient Data Structures**: Reduce the size of the 2D array `dp` to `4001 x 5`.

2. **Avoid Redundant Computations**: After the array `dp` is updated in the third nested loop, we can continue to use the updated value in the next iteration. This way, we avoid recalculating the same value multiple times.

3. **Optimize Loops**: In the third loop, the condition `k <= 1000` is not necessary because `k` will always be less than or equal to `1000` as `j <= 4000`.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: When compiling the code, use the `-O3` flag for maximum optimization.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Reduce Array Size**: The size of the second dimension of the array `dp` can be reduced from `4001` to `5` as `i` only goes up to `4`.

2. **Avoid Redundant Computations**: After the value of `dp[j][i]` is updated in the third loop, we can use this updated value in the next iteration instead of recalculating it. This will reduce the time complexity of the program.

3. **Optimize Loops**: Remove the condition `k <= 1000` from the third loop as it is not necessary. This will reduce the number of iterations in the loop and improve the performance of the code.

4. **Compiler Optimization**: When compiling the code, use the `-O3` flag for maximum optimization. This tells the compiler to perform high-level optimizations such as loop unrolling and function inlining, which can significantly improve the runtime of the code.

## Optimized Code Block

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  unsigned long long dp[4001][5];
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 4001; j++)
      dp[j][i] = i == 1 && j <= 1000 ? 1 : 0;
  for (int i = 2; i <= 4; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j <= 4000; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k <= j; k++)
        dp[j][i] += dp[j - k][i - 1];
  int n;
  while (cin >> n)
    cout << dp[n][4] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Compile with `-O3` flag for maximum optimization.
