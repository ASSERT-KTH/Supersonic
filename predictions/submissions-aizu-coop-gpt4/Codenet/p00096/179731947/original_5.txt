Here is a step-by-step optimization:

1. Code Analysis:
   - The provided code initializes a 2-dimensional array `dp[4001][5]` and fills it with calculation results.
   - The calculations are based on a triple-nested loop.
   - After the calculations, the program waits for the user to enter a number `n` and then prints out `dp[n][4]`.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Loop Unrolling: The outer loop in the initialization of `dp` has a small loop count (5). We can unroll this loop to reduce the overhead of loop control.
   - Loop Interchange: Interchanging the order of the loops in the initialization of `dp` can improve cache locality and thus performance.
   - Avoiding Redundant Computations: In the triple-nested loop, it is unnecessary to calculate `dp[j - k][i - 1]` repeatedly for the same `j`, `k`, and `i`. We can store it in a variable and reuse it.
   - Early Termination: If the user doesn't provide any input, the program should terminate immediately instead of waiting for input.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   - Loop unrolling is a common optimization technique that reduces the overhead of loop control flow by executing the loop body multiple times per loop iteration. It is most effective when the loop count is small and known at compile time, as is the case here.
   - Interchanging the order of the loops in the initialization of `dp` can improve cache locality, as accessing elements in a row-major order (as in C++) is more cache-friendly than accessing them in a column-major order.
   - Storing `dp[j - k][i - 1]` in a variable can reduce redundant computations, as the value of `dp[j - k][i - 1]` does not change within the innermost loop.
   - Early termination can save resources by not waiting for user input when it is not provided.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  unsigned long long dp[4001][5];
  // Loop unrolling and loop interchange
  for (int j = 0; j < 4001; j++) {
    dp[j][0] = 0;
    dp[j][1] = j <= 1000 ? 1 : 0;
    dp[j][2] = dp[j][3] = dp[j][4] = 0;
  }

  for (int i = 2; i <= 4; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j <= 4000; j++) {
      unsigned long long sum = 0;
      for (int k = 0; k <= j && k <= 1000; k++) {
        sum += dp[j - k][i - 1];  // Avoid redundant computations
        dp[j][i] = sum;
      }
    }

  int n;
  if (cin >> n)  // Early termination
    cout << dp[n][4] << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
