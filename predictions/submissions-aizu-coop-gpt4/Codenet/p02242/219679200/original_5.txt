Code Analysis:
The provided C++ program is a simple implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph. The Graph class uses an adjacency matrix representation, which makes it easy to access the weights of the edges but uses a lot of memory for large sparse graphs. 

The function dijkstra() in Graph class is the most CPU-intensive part of the program, as it uses two nested loops to find the shortest path.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use an adjacency list instead of an adjacency matrix: For sparse graphs (which are common in real world), adjacency lists use much less memory than adjacency matrices. This will save memory and potentially improve cache performance.

2. Use a priority queue to find the next vertex to visit: Instead of scanning all vertices to find the next vertex to visit, which takes O(n) time, we can use a priority queue data structure, which can find the next vertex in O(log n) time.

3. Avoid unnecessary computation: dist[j] is updated even when the new distance is not less than the current one. We can add a condition to avoid this unnecessary computation.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Change the adjacency matrix to an adjacency list. This will reduce memory usage and can improve cache efficiency because we only need to access the neighbors of the current node, not all nodes. However, the code will be a little bit more complex because we need to deal with dynamic arrays or linked lists.

2. Use a priority queue to keep track of the nodes with the shortest distance that are not visited yet. In the current implementation, we scan all nodes to find the next node to visit. This takes O(n) time. If we use a priority queue, this can be done in O(log n) time. The trade-off is that we need to use additional memory to store the queue.

3. In the current code, dist[j] is updated even when the new distance is not less than the current one. We can add a condition to avoid this unnecessary computation. This will reduce the number of computations, but the code will be slightly more complex.

Optimized Code Block:
Please note that it's not possible to optimize the code without changing its structure significantly. Therefore, the optimized code will not look like the original one.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

using uint = unsigned int;
using P = pair<uint, uint>;

const uint INF = 1e9+7;
struct edge { uint to, cost; };

vector<vector<edge>> G;
vector<uint> d;

void dijkstra(uint s) {
    priority_queue<P, vector<P>, greater<P> > que;
    d.assign(G.size(), INF);
    d[s] = 0;
    que.push(P(0, s));

    while(!que.empty()) {
        P p = que.top(); que.pop();
        uint v = p.second;
        if(d[v] < p.first) continue;
        for(auto &e : G[v]) {
            if(d[e.to] > d[v] + e.cost) {
                d[e.to] = d[v] + e.cost;
                que.push(P(d[e.to], e.to));
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    uint n;
    scanf("%u", &n);
    G.resize(n);
    uint u, k, c, v;
    for (uint i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        scanf("%u %u", &u, &k);
        for (uint j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
            scanf("%u %u", &c, &v);
            G[u].push_back((edge){c, v});
        }
    }
    dijkstra(0);
    for (uint i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        printf("%u %u\n", i, d[i]);
    }
}
```
In this optimized code, we represent the graph using adjacency list and use a priority queue to find the next node to visit in dijkstra() function. Also, we update the distance of a node only when we found a shorter path to it.
