**Code Analysis:**

This code implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for a graph using an adjacency matrix. The primary performance bottlenecks in this code are:

1. Memory Usage: The code uses an adjacency matrix to represent the graph, which has a space complexity of O(n^2). This is inefficient for sparse graphs where there are not many edges between nodes.

2. Time Complexity: The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm as implemented is O(n^2), which is due to the nested for loop in the dijkstra method.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. Data Structures: We can replace the adjacency matrix with an adjacency list, which is a more efficient data structure for sparse graphs. This will reduce the space complexity from O(n^2) to O(n + E), where E is the number of edges.

2. Redundant Computations: We can avoid redundant computation of `base_dist + es[j]` by only calculating it once and storing the result.

3. Loops: We can optimize the loop in the dijkstra method by using a priority queue to keep track of the nodes with the shortest distances. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O((n + E) log n).

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use the `-O2` or `-O3` compiler options to enable various compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and dead code elimination.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Replace the adjacency matrix with an adjacency list: This reduces the space complexity from O(n^2) to O(n + E), where E is the number of edges. The trade-off is that accessing an edge now takes O(n) time, but this is acceptable because the adjacency list is traversed only once in Dijkstra's algorithm.

2. Avoid redundant computations: We can avoid the redundant computation of `base_dist + es[j]` by only calculating it once and storing the result. This will save time in each iteration of the inner loop in the dijkstra method.

3. Optimize the loop in the dijkstra method: We can use a priority queue to keep track of the nodes with the shortest distances. This allows us to quickly find the next node to visit, reducing the time complexity from O(n^2) to O((n + E) log n). The trade-off is the additional memory required for the priority queue.

4. Enable compiler optimizations: We can use the `-O2` or `-O3` compiler options to enable various compiler optimizations. These optimizations can significantly reduce the running time of the code, but they may make the code harder to debug.

**Optimizing the given code with these strategies will require significant changes, including a change in data structure. Hence, a complete rewrite of the code is necessary. This rewrite will ensure the functionality of the code remains intact while improving its performance.**
