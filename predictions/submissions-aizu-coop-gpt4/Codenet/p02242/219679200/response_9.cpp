The provided code is for Dijkstra's shortest path problem, which is a well-known graph problem. The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, and the Dijkstra algorithm is implemented using arrays to keep track of visited nodes and distances.

Code Analysis:
1. The adjacency matrix 'g_' consumes O(n^2) space. This could be optimized if the graph is sparse, i.e., has fewer edges.
2. The Dijkstra algorithm runs in O(n^2) time. The algorithm's time complexity can be improved with a priority queue.
3. The 'visited' array is allocated on the stack, which could cause a stack overflow if 'n_' is large. It should be allocated on the heap.
4. The 'scanf' and 'printf' functions are slower than 'cin' and 'cout', even though they are used here with the expectation of better performance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Implement the graph with an adjacency list instead of an adjacency matrix to save space.
2. Use a priority queue to improve the Dijkstra algorithm's time complexity.
3. Allocate the 'visited' array on the heap instead of the stack to avoid stack overflow.
4. Use 'cin' and 'cout' with 'ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);' to improve input/output speed.

Here are the step-by-step changes:

1. Change adjacency matrix to adjacency list:
   - Instead of a 2D array, use a vector of vectors to represent the graph.
   - This will save a lot of space if the graph is sparse.
   - The trade-off is that edge existence checks become O(n), but this is not an issue in this case because the graph is a simple graph (no multiple edges).

2. Use a priority queue in Dijkstra's algorithm:
   - Instead of scanning all nodes every time to find the node with the smallest distance, use a priority queue (min heap).
   - The node with the smallest distance will always be at the top of the queue.
   - This will improve the time complexity of the algorithm from O(n^2) to O((V+E)logV), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

3. Allocate the 'visited' array on the heap:
   - Change 'bool visited[n_];' to 'bool *visited = new bool[n_];'.
   - Don't forget to delete the array at the end of the function to avoid memory leaks.

4. Use faster input/output:
   - Replace 'scanf' and 'printf' with 'cin' and 'cout'.
   - Add 'ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);' at the beginning of the main function to speed up 'cin' and 'cout'.

Please note that the original code and the proposed changes assume that the node indices start from 0, not 1. If the input indices start from 1, you need to adjust the indices when reading the input and writing the output.
