The provided code is a C++ implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm. Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a graph. This implementation is not optimized for performance and memory usage. Here are a few potential bottlenecks:
1. The graph is stored in a 2D array. This can be inefficient if the graph is sparse, i.e., if it has relatively few edges compared to the number of nodes. 
2. The Dijkstra algorithm is implemented with a time complexity of O(n^2) where n is the number of nodes in the graph. This is because it scans all nodes in each iteration to find the node with the minimum distance. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use an adjacency list to store the graph instead of a 2D array. This will reduce memory usage in case of sparse graphs.
2. Use a priority queue (heap) to find the node with the minimum distance in each iteration of the Dijkstra algorithm. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O((E+V)logV), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.

Trade-offs:
While these optimizations will improve performance and memory usage, they will also make the code a bit more complex. For instance, handling an adjacency list and a priority queue is more complex than handling a 2D array.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdio>

using uint = unsigned int;
const uint INFINIT = 100000 * 100 + 1;

struct Edge {
  uint to, cost;
};

typedef std::pair<uint, uint> P;  // Pair of minimum distance and vertex

class Graph {
  uint n_;
  std::vector<std::vector<Edge>> g_;

public:
  Graph(uint n) : n_(n), g_(n_) {}
  
  void add_edge(uint u, uint c, uint v) {
    g_[u].push_back((Edge){c, v});
  }

  void dijkstra(uint *dist) {
    std::priority_queue<P, std::vector<P>, std::greater<P>> queue;
    fill(dist, dist + n_, INFINIT);
    dist[0] = 0;
    queue.push(P(0, 0));

    while (!queue.empty()) {
      P p = queue.top();
      queue.pop();
      uint v = p.second;
      if (dist[v] < p.first) continue;
      for (uint i = 0; i < g_[v].size(); i++) {
        Edge e = g_[v][i];
        if (dist[e.to] > dist[v] + e.cost) {
          dist[e.to] = dist[v] + e.cost;
          queue.push(P(dist[e.to], e.to));
        }
      }
    }
  }
};

int main() {
  uint n;
  std::scanf("%u", &n);
  Graph g(n);
  uint u, k, c, v;
  for (uint i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::scanf("%u %u", &u, &k);
    for (uint j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
      std::scanf("%u %u", &c, &v);
      g.add_edge(u, c, v);
    }
  }
  uint dist[n];
  g.dijkstra(dist);
  for (uint i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::printf("%u %u\n", i, dist[i]);
  }
}
```
In the optimized code, the graph is stored in an adjacency list (a vector of vectors of Edge structs). An Edge struct is used to store the destination node and the cost of the edge. The Dijkstra algorithm uses a priority queue to select the node with the minimum distance in each iteration. The priority queue is implemented as a heap, and it automatically sorts the nodes based on their distances. The node with the minimum distance is always at the top of the heap. This reduces the time complexity of the algorithm.
