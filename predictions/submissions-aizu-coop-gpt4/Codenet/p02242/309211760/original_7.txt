This code appears to implement the Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. The data structure used to represent the graph is a 2D array. While this is a simple and direct approach, it may not be the most efficient one, particularly for sparse graphs where many of the entries in the array will be unused. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use an Adjacency List instead of an Adjacency Matrix: If the graph is sparse (i.e., the number of edges is much less than the number of vertices squared), it may be more space-efficient to use an adjacency list representation instead of an adjacency matrix. In an adjacency list, each vertex maintains a list of its neighbors, which can drastically reduce memory usage for sparse graphs. 

2. Use a Priority Queue: The current implementation scans all the vertices to find the one with the minimum distance at each step. This operation is O(n), but it can be improved to O(log n) with the use of a priority queue (heap). 

3. Avoid unnecessary re-computation: The current implementation involves repeated scanning of vertices that have already been processed and marked as BLACK. This is unnecessary and can be avoided.

4. Compiler optimizations: Use compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` for further optimizations like inlining, loop unrolling etc.

Optimized Code Block:

Let's apply these strategies to optimize the code. The optimized code might look something like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

static const int MAX = 100;
static const int INFTY = (1 << 21);
static const int WHITE = 0;
static const int BLACK = 2;
int n;
vector<pair<int, int>> adj[MAX]; // adjacency list

void dijkstra() {
  int d[MAX];
  fill(d, d + n, INFTY);
  d[0] = 0;
  
  priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
  pq.push({0, 0});

  while (!pq.empty()) {
    int u = pq.top().second; pq.pop();
    if (d[u] == BLACK) continue; // if already processed, skip
    d[u] = BLACK;
    for (auto &p : adj[u]) {
      int v = p.first, w = p.second;
      if (d[v] > d[u] + w) {
        d[v] = d[u] + w;
        pq.push({d[v], v}); // push into the priority queue
      }
    }
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << i << " " << (d[i] == INFTY ? -1 : d[i]) << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  cin >> n;
  int k, c, u, v;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> u >> k;
    for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      cin >> v >> c;
      adj[u].push_back({v, c}); // build the adjacency list
    }
  }
  dijkstra();
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we have replaced the adjacency matrix with an adjacency list to save memory. We have also added a priority queue to quickly find the vertex with the minimum distance. This reduces the complexity from O(n) to O(log n) per operation. Furthermore, we have avoided scanning already processed vertices by checking the color of the vertex before processing it.
