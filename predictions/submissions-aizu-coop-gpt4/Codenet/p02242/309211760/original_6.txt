The given program is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(V^2), where V is the number of vertices in the graph. For a dense graph with 100 nodes, this can result in up to 10,000 operations per iteration, which can be quite slow.

Let's summarize the steps we can take to optimize this program:

1. Use a priority queue data structure: The current implementation uses a simple linear search to find the vertex with the smallest distance value. This can be significantly optimized by using a priority queue data structure, which provides constant-time access to the smallest element.

2. Reduce memory usage: The 2D matrix M can be replaced with an adjacency list to save memory. An adjacency list is more space-efficient for sparse graphs as it only stores the nodes each vertex is directly connected to.

3. Avoid unnecessary computations: The code currently checks if color[v] != BLACK && M[u][v] != INFTY before performing a relaxation operation. This check can be avoided by ensuring that each vertex is only inserted into the priority queue if it's not already in the queue.

4. Use compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations can be enabled using the -O3 flag when compiling the program. This will enable all compiler optimizations and can result in significant speed improvements.

The revised code implementation, with the above optimizations, would look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

static const int MAX = 100;
static const int INFTY = (1 << 21);

vector<pair<int, int>> adj[MAX]; // adjacency list

void dijkstra() {
  vector<int> d(MAX, INFTY); // distance array
  d[0] = 0;
  priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq; // min-priority queue
  pq.push({0, 0});

  while (!pq.empty()) {
    int u = pq.top().second;
    pq.pop();

    for (auto &edge : adj[u]) {
      int v = edge.first, w = edge.second;
      if (d[v] > d[u] + w) {
        d[v] = d[u] + w;
        pq.push({d[v], v});
      }
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
    cout << i << " " << (d[i] == INFTY ? -1 : d[i]) << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  int k, c, u, v;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> u >> k;
    for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      cin >> v >> c;
      adj[u].push_back({v, c});
    }
  }

  dijkstra();
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code uses a priority queue for efficient minimum element retrieval and an adjacency list for memory-efficient graph representation. It also uses vector instead of arrays for better memory management and dynamic sizing. The optimized code reduces the time complexity from O(V^2) to O((V + E) log V), where E is the number of edges in the graph.
