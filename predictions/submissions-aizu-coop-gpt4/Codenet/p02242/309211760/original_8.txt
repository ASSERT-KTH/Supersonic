Code Analysis:
This code implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. It reads the number of vertices and edges from the input, then computes the shortest path from vertex 0 to all other vertices. The results are printed on the standard output. The main performance bottlenecks are due to the use of an adjacency matrix to represent the graph and the inefficient way of finding the vertex with the smallest distance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use an adjacency list instead of an adjacency matrix: The adjacency matrix requires a lot of memory (O(n^2)) even when the graph is sparse. An adjacency list is more efficient in such cases.

2. Use a priority queue to find the vertex with the smallest distance: Currently, the program scans all vertices to find the one with the smallest distance. This can be optimized by using a priority queue (min heap).

3. Avoid unnecessary color changes: The program marks a vertex as GRAY when its distance is updated. However, this isn't necessary for Dijkstra's algorithm. We can remove these color changes.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Change the data structure for the graph: Instead of using an adjacency matrix, we will use an adjacency list. An adjacency list is a vector of (vertex, weight) pairs. When adding an edge, we add a pair to the list of the source vertex.

2. Use a priority queue to find the vertex with the smallest distance: We use a priority queue of (distance, vertex) pairs. The priority queue is a min heap, so the pair with the smallest distance is always on top. When we need to find the vertex with the smallest distance, we simply extract the top element from the priority queue. This operation is O(log n) compared to O(n) for the current implementation.

3. Remove unnecessary color changes: We simply remove the color array and all operations related to it. This simplifies the code and makes it run faster.

Trade-offs: The optimized code is bit more complex due to the use of a priority queue and an adjacency list. However, the performance gain in terms of both time and space complexity is significant, especially for large, sparse graphs.

Optimized Code Block:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

const int MAX = 100;
const int INFTY = INT_MAX;

vector<pair<int, int>> adjList[MAX];
int dist[MAX];

void dijkstra() {
  priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
  fill(dist, dist + MAX, INFTY);
  dist[0] = 0;
  pq.push({0, 0});
  while (!pq.empty()) {
    int u = pq.top().second;
    pq.pop();
    for (auto &edge : adjList[u]) {
      int v = edge.first, weight = edge.second;
      if (dist[v] > dist[u] + weight) {
        dist[v] = dist[u] + weight;
        pq.push({dist[v], v});
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int u, k, v, c;
    cin >> u >> k;
    for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      cin >> v >> c;
      adjList[u].push_back({v, c});
    }
  }
  dijkstra();
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << i << " " << (dist[i] == INFTY ? -1 : dist[i]) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
