The given code implements the Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. This algorithm is relatively efficient, with a time complexity of O(n^2) for a dense graph when implemented as in the current code. However, there are still some potential optimizations that can be made.

1. **Use of priority_queue:** Instead of searching for the minimum value in the array d[] in every iteration, we can use a priority_queue (heap) data structure. The priority_queue always keeps the smallest element at the top and thus, we can get the node with the minimum distance in O(1) time complexity. However, insertion in a priority_queue takes O(log(n)) time complexity. This is still better than the original code where both operations take O(n) time.

2. **Avoid unnecessary computations:** In the given code, the condition `color[v] != BLACK && M[u][v] != INFTY` is checked for every pair of nodes (u, v). However, if `color[v] == BLACK`, we can skip the inner loop completely.

3. **Memory usage:** The adjacency matrix M[][] is initialized with INFTY for all pairs of nodes, even if there is no direct edge between them. This is not efficient as it uses unnecessary memory. Instead, we can use an adjacency list to store only the nodes that are directly connected. This will significantly reduce memory usage for sparse graphs.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** You can also use compiler optimizations like `-O2` or `-O3` flag. However, these optimizations are generally used for micro-optimizations and may not significantly affect the performance.

Here is the optimized code block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#define INFTY (1<<21)
#define MAX 100
using namespace std;

struct edge {
    int to, cost;
};

typedef pair<int, int> P;
vector<edge> G[MAX];
int n, d[MAX];

void dijkstra() {
    priority_queue<P, vector<P>, greater<P>> que;
    fill(d, d + n, INFTY);
    d[0] = 0;
    que.push(P(0, 0));

    while (!que.empty()) {
        P p = que.top(); que.pop();
        int v = p.second;
        if (d[v] < p.first) continue;
        for (int i = 0; i < G[v].size(); i++) {
            edge e = G[v][i];
            if (d[e.to] > d[v] + e.cost) {
                d[e.to] = d[v] + e.cost;
                que.push(P(d[e.to], e.to));
            }
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << i << " " << (d[i] == INFTY ? -1 : d[i]) << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int u, k;
        cin >> u >> k;
        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            int v, c;
            cin >> v >> c;
            G[u].push_back((edge){v, c});
        }
    }
    dijkstra();
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, I used the STL priority_queue to implement a min-heap and an adjacency list to store the graph. You can see that the main logic of the code remains the same; however, the way we store and access data is optimized. Also, we have avoided unnecessary computations by checking the distance before inserting it into the priority queue.
