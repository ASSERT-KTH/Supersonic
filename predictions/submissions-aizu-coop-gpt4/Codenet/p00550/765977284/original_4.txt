The provided C++ program is a complex piece of code that seems to solve a problem involving graph traversal and queries. The main optimization opportunities in this program can be found in the following areas:

1. **I/O operations**: As I/O operations are one of the costliest operations in terms of time, reducing the number of these can significantly speed up the program.

2. **Data structures**: The program uses several arrays and vectors for storing different types of data, some of which may not be efficient for the operations being performed.

3. **Loops and function calls**: The code contains several loops and function calls that may be optimized to improve performance.

4. **Memory usage**: The code uses a lot of global variables, which can lead to inefficient memory usage.

Here's a detailed optimization strategy:

1. **I/O operations**: Instead of using `getchar_unlocked()`, which is not a standard function and can cause undefined behavior, use `scanf()` for reading input. Also, rather than using `printf()` for each output, collect all outputs in a string or stringstream and print it once at the end.

2. **Data structures**: Use `std::array` instead of C-style arrays for fixed-size arrays. This will give you the benefits of a standard container (like bounds checking in debug mode) without any overhead. Also, consider using `std::deque` instead of `std::queue` for the queue, as `std::deque` has generally better performance.

3. **Loops and function calls**: The `bfs()` function is called multiple times with different parameters. Consider splitting it into two functions, each optimized for a specific set of parameters.

4. **Memory usage**: Reduce the scope of variables as much as possible to improve memory usage. Also, consider initializing variables at the time of declaration.

Here's the optimized code. The changes made are explained in the comments:
