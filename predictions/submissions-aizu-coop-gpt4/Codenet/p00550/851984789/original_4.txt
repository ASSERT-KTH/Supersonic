### Code Analysis:

The given code reads an input graph and then performs some operations on it. It appears to be implementing a variation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, with some additional logic to handle the graph edges.

However, there are several potential areas for optimization:

1. The data structures used are inefficient. The vectors `x` and `y` hold pairs of integers, but the second integer in each pair is only used as an index into the `used` array. If we change `x` and `y` to store only integers, and use a different method to update the `used` array, we can reduce the memory usage.

2. The code is filled with repetitive computations. For example, `dist[i.first]` is computed multiple times in the loops. We can avoid this by storing the result in a variable.

3. The two nested loops over `x` and `y` can be optimized. We can take advantage of the fact that these vectors are sorted in ascending order to perform binary searches instead of linear scans.

4. The queue `Q1` is used inefficiently. Items are pushed onto the queue and then immediately popped off. This can be avoided by using a different data structure, such as a stack.

5. The use of the `bits/stdc++.h` header file and `using namespace std;` is discouraged as it can lead to slower compilation times and potential naming conflicts.

### Optimization Strategy:

1. **Data Structures**: Replace the vectors of pairs `x` and `y` with vectors of integers. Use a vector of sets to update the `used` array.

2. **Redundant Computations**: Store the result of `dist[i.first]` in a variable to avoid computing it multiple times.

3. **Loops Optimization**: Use binary searches instead of linear scans in the loops over `x` and `y`.

4. **Queue Optimization**: Replace the queue `Q1` with a stack to avoid unnecessary enqueue/dequeue operations.

5. **Compiler Optimization**: Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with specific include statements and remove `using namespace std;`.

Let's now see how these optimizations can be implemented in code.
