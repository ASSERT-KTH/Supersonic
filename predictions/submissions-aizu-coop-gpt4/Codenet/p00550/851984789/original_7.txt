This is a graph-related program that uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to calculate shortest paths from a source node, and it seems to be performing some sort of edge removal operation in a second phase. Here are some optimization suggestions:

1. **Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`**: This header file includes quite a lot of libraries, many of which are not necessary for your program, causing longer compile time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries like `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`, `#include <queue>`, and `#include <algorithm>`.

2. **Try to minimize input/output overhead**: Using `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout` can improve the program's speed. Also, you can use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` at the beginning of the main function to disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams.

3. **Avoid using `std::pair` for storing edges**: Using pair increases the memory overhead. Instead, you can use a struct with more descriptive field names. This not only makes the code easier to understand, but also can be more memory-efficient.

4. **Use adjacency list representation for the graph**: Currently, you use `x` and `y` for storing graph relationships. It would be better to use a struct to represent graph nodes, where each node has a list of adjacent nodes.

5. **Avoid unnecessary computations and memory usage**: In your code, `U` and `used` seem to be serving similar purposes. Try to consolidate these into a single array.

6. **Optimize the BFS algorithm**: Right now, you're running BFS on every query. Instead, you can run BFS once and store the result, then use this information to answer each query in constant time.

Here's the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

struct Edge {
    int to, id;
};

int n, m, q, a[210000], b[210000], c, dist[110000], T[110000], cnt;
vector<Edge> adj[110000], y[110000];
queue<int> Q;
bool used[210000];

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    cin >> n >> m >> q;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        cin >> a[i] >> b[i];
        adj[a[i]].push_back({b[i], i});
        adj[b[i]].push_back({a[i], i});
    }
    fill(dist, dist + n + 1, 999999);
    dist[1] = 0;
    Q.push(1);
    while (!Q.empty()) {
        int a1 = Q.front();
        Q.pop();
        for (Edge &e : adj[a1]) {
            if (dist[e.to] > dist[a1] + 1) {
                dist[e.to] = dist[a1] + 1;
                Q.push(e.to);
            }
        }
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (Edge &e : adj[i]) {
            if (dist[i] < dist[e.to]) {
                y[i].push_back({e.to, e.id});
                T[e.to]++;
            }
        }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        cin >> c;
        c--;
        queue<Edge> Q1;
        int ss = -1;
        if (dist[a[c]] < dist[b[c]])
            ss = b[c];
        if (dist[a[c]] > dist[b[c]])
            ss = a[c];
        if (ss >= 1 && T[ss] == 0 && !used[c]) {
            Q1.push({ss, c});
            while (!Q1.empty()) {
                int to = Q1.front().to, id = Q1.front().id;
                Q1.pop();
                if (T[to] != 0 || used[id])
                    continue;
                T[to]--;
                used[id] = true;
                if (T[to] != 0)
                    continue;
                cnt++;
                T[to] = 1;
                for (Edge &e : y[to]) {
                    if (T[e.to] == 0)
                        Q1.push(e);
                }
            }
        }
        cout << cnt << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This version of the code is more efficient and follows good coding practices. It uses structs instead of pairs for better readability, minimizes input/output overhead and unnecessary computations, and optimizes the BFS algorithm.
