The given code appears to be an implementation of a complex graph problem, with multiple edges between nodes and certain nodes prioritized over others. The code reads graph data from the input, performs some calculations, and then processes a series of queries. 

The main performance bottlenecks identified are:

1. The use of `std::vector` to store the nodes of the graph. Each `std::vector` involves dynamic memory allocation, which can be slow. Additionally, the use of `std::vector::push_back` can occasionally result in a resize operation, which involves allocating a new array and copying all elements to it.

2. The use of `std::queue`, which also involves dynamic memory allocation. 

3. The repeated computation of `dist[i.first] > dist[a1] + 1` and `dist[i] < dist[j.first]`.

4. The use of `std::pair`, which is less efficient than using two separate arrays due to the extra indirection.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace `std::vector` and `std::queue` with statically-allocated arrays and indices to simulate a stack or queue. This will eliminate the overhead of dynamic memory allocation.

2. Precompute and store the results of `dist[i.first] > dist[a1] + 1` and `dist[i] < dist[j.first]` to avoid redundant computations.

3. Replace `std::pair` with two separate arrays.

4. Use `++i` instead of `i++` in for-loops to avoid unnecessary temporary object creation.

5. Use `#pragma omp parallel for` to parallelize independent for-loops.

Please note that some of these optimizations might make the code more complex or less readable. Always consider the trade-off between performance and maintainability when optimizing code.
