1. Code Analysis:

The given code is solving a graph-related problem. The code reads graph edges, computes the shortest path from vertex 1 to all other vertices, and then processes a set of queries. Each query involves traversing a subgraph and counting the number of nodes visited.

The primary performance bottlenecks in the code are:

- The use of vectors of pairs to store adjacency lists: This requires a large amount of memory and degrades cache performance because of the non-contiguous memory layout.
- The use of boolean arrays for marking visited edges and nodes: This takes up more memory than necessary, and traversing these arrays is cache-inefficient.
- The use of several global variables: This makes the code harder to understand, reason about, and optimize.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A1. Replace vectors of pairs with adjacency lists using a more efficient data structure, such as a list of structs. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache performance because structs are stored contiguously in memory.

A2. Replace the boolean arrays used for marking with bitsets. This will substantially reduce memory usage, as each bitset only uses 1 bit per element, compared to boolean arrays which use at least 8 bits per element. Bitsets also provide constant-time access and modification operations, similar to arrays.

A3. Encapsulate the graph and its related operations in a class. This will make the code more manageable, easier to reason about, and easier to optimize.

B. Redundant computations:

The dist array is initialized with a large value (999999). Instead, the code can initialize it with the maximum integer value, which will make the code more robust and eliminate the need for a magic number.

C. Loops and recursive calls:

The main while loop in the code, which processes the queries, can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary checks and computations.

D. Compiler optimizations:

The -O3 flag can be used to instruct the compiler to perform several optimizations, such as loop unrolling and function inlining, which can significantly speed up the code.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A1. The code currently uses vectors of pairs to represent adjacency lists. This is inefficient because each pair requires two integer-sized memory locations, and the pairs are not stored contiguously in memory, which degrades cache performance. Instead, the code can use a list of structs, where each struct represents an edge and contains two integers. This will provide a contiguous memory layout and improve cache performance.

A2. The code uses boolean arrays to mark visited edges and nodes. This wastes memory because each boolean value requires at least 8 bits of memory. Instead, the code can use bitsets, which only require 1 bit per element. This will substantially reduce memory usage, and bitsets also provide constant-time access and modification operations, similar to arrays.

A3. The code uses several global variables, which makes the code harder to optimize and reason about. Instead, the code can encapsulate the graph and its related operations in a class. This will make the code more manageable and easier to reason about.

B. The dist array is initialized with a large value (999999). This is a magic number that may not be large enough for all possible inputs. Instead, the code can initialize the dist array with the maximum integer value. This will make the code more robust and eliminate the need for a magic number.

C. The main while loop in the code, which processes the queries, can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary checks and computations. For example, the code currently checks whether a node has been visited and whether an edge has been used before processing a node. Instead, the code can mark a node as visited and an edge as used immediately after processing it, which will avoid the need for these checks.

D. The -O3 flag can be used to instruct the compiler to perform several optimizations, such as loop unrolling and function inlining, which can significantly speed up the code.
