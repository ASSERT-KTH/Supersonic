This code appears to be a dynamic programming problem with some sorting and calculation operations. The provided code can be optimized in several areas to improve performance and reduce memory usage.

**Code Analysis**

The main performance bottlenecks in the code are:

1. Multiple for-loops with nested loops, which have high time complexity.
2. Sorting operations, which can have high time complexity depending on the data involved.
3. Use of `vector::push_back` method for adding elements to vectors, which can lead to several memory reallocations and copies when the vector grows.
4. Use of `memset` function on large arrays, which can be time-intensive.
5. Use of `std::map` and `std::set`, which can be inefficient due to their internal tree-based structure.

**Optimization Strategy**

1. **Data structures**: Using `std::unordered_map` and `std::unordered_set` instead of `std::map` and `std::set` can be significantly faster for lookup operations due to their internal hash table structure.

2. **Redundant Computations**: The code contains redundant computation in the `dp` calculation loop. The maximum value is calculated over the entire range of `v[id[i]].size() + 1` for every `j`. This can be optimized by calculating the maximum value incrementally and reusing the previously calculated maximum value.

3. **Loop Optimizations**: Loop unrolling can be used to optimize the loops for better performance. Compiler optimizations like `-O2` or `-O3` can also help to improve the performance.

4. **Memory allocation**: Using `vector::reserve` method to preallocate memory can reduce the number of memory reallocations and copies when the vector grows.

5. **Use of `memset`**: Replace `memset` with `std::fill` or `std::fill_n` which are type-safe and work with all types of containers.

**Optimized Code Block**

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define INF 1 << 30
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, K;
  cin >> n >> K;
  vector<int> id, v[2005];
  id.reserve(n); // Reserve memory for 'n' elements
  rep(i, n) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    id.push_back(b - 1);
    v[b - 1].push_back(a);
  }
  sort(id.begin(), id.end());
  id.erase(unique(id.begin(), id.end()), id.end());
  rep(i, id.size()) {
    int j = id[i];
    sort(v[j].begin(), v[j].end(), greater<int>());
  }
  fill(&d[0][0], &d[0][0] + sizeof(d) / sizeof(ll), 0); // Replace memset with std::fill
  vector<P> p;
  p.reserve(id.size()); // Reserve memory for 'id.size()' elements
  rep(i, id.size()) {
    int j = id[i];
    REP(k, 1, v[j].size() + 1) {
      d[j][k] += d[j][k - 1] + v[j][k - 1] + (k - 1) * 2;
      p.push_back(mp(k, d[j][k]));
    }
  }
  fill(&dp[0][0], &dp[0][0] + sizeof(dp) / sizeof(ll), 0); // Replace memset with std::fill
  rep(i, id.size()) {
    ll max_res = 0;
    rep(j, K + 1) {
      ll res = dp[i][j];
      rep(k, v[id[i]].size() + 1) {
        if (j >= k) {
          res = max(res, dp[i][j - k] + d[id[i]][k]);
        }
      }
      max_res = max(max_res, res); // Calculate max incrementally
      dp[i + 1][j] = max_res; // Use the previously calculated max value
    }
  }
  cout << dp[id.size()][K] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimization strategy will vary depending on the specific details and requirements of your problem. For example, if you are dealing with multithreaded code, you may want to consider other factors such as synchronization and thread safety. It's also important to measure the performance of your code before and after optimization to ensure that your changes have a positive impact.
