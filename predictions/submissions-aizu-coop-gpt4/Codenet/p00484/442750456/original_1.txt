This is a dynamic programming code with a nested loop structure that is used for iteration. The repeated iteration of the loop structure can have an impact on performance. Here is the proposed optimization strategy.

1. Avoid Repeated Computation: The computation `v[id[i]].size()` in the nested `rep` loop is being evaluated repeatedly. This can be avoided by calculating this value once and storing it in a variable before the loop.

2. Efficient Use of Data Structures: The `vector` data structure is used extensively throughout the code. The vector is an efficient data structure when it comes to accessing and adding elements, but if we are to remove elements frequently, it can be inefficient. In this case, we are removing elements from the vector `id` with the `erase` function. This can be optimized by using a `set`, which ensures unique elements and avoids the need to use `unique` and `erase` functions.

3. Loop Unrolling: Loop unrolling is a technique that can reduce the overhead of loop control instructions at the cost of increasing the size of the binary. We can apply this technique to loops that have a small, constant number of iterations.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Use compiler flags for optimization such as `-O2` or `-O3` when compiling the code. These flags instruct the compiler to focus on code optimization.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#define REP(i, k, n) for (int i = k; i < n; i++)
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define INF 1 << 30
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
ll d[15][2005], dp[2005][2005];
int main() {
  int n, K;
  cin >> n >> K;
  set<int> idSet; // use set instead of vector
  vector<int> v[2005];
  rep(i, n) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    idSet.insert(b - 1); // insert into set
    v[b - 1].push_back(a);
  }
  // convert set to vector
  vector<int> id(idSet.begin(), idSet.end());
  
  for (auto &i : id) {
    sort(v[i].begin(), v[i].end(), greater<int>());
  }
  memset(d, 0, sizeof(d));
  vector<P> p;
  for (auto &j : id) {
    REP(k, 1, v[j].size() + 1) {
      d[j][k] += d[j][k - 1] + v[j][k - 1] + (k - 1) * 2;
      p.push_back(mp(k, d[j][k]));
    }
  }
  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
  rep(i, id.size()) {
    rep(j, K + 1) {
      ll res = dp[i][j];
      int idSize = v[id[i]].size() + 1; // avoid repeated computation
      rep(k, idSize) {
        if (j >= k) {
          res = max(res, dp[i][j - k] + d[id[i]][k]);
        }
      }
      dp[i + 1][j] = res;
    }
  }
  cout << dp[id.size()][K] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

The trade-offs are that the code becomes slightly more complex and less readable. But this is a reasonable trade-off for better performance.
