## Code Analysis

The provided code seems to be solving a problem related to date conversion between two different calendars. The two functions `M2S` and `S2M` are converting dates between these two different calendar systems. There are a couple of potential performance bottlenecks and areas of inefficient memory usage that we can optimize:

1. The most glaring issue is the use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This is a non-standard header file used in competitive programming to include all standard libraries at once. This is generally inefficient and can significantly slow down the compile time.

2. The function `check` is called multiple times in the code. It checks if a year is a leap year or not. Since the scope of years is fairly limited (in the thousands), we can pre-calculate this information and store it in an array for quick access.

3. The function `M2S` has a lot of repeated code and nested calculations. We can simplify this by breaking down the calculations into smaller steps and avoiding repetition.

4. In the `main` function, the code is converting a string to an integer digit by digit. This can be optimized by using built-in functions such as `stoi` or `strtol`.

5. The vector `a` in the `main` function doesn't need to store all the values at once. We can process each value as soon as it's ready, and discard it afterwards.

6. The `while(1)` loop in the `main` function can be replaced with a more idiomatic loop that directly reads from `cin`.

## Optimization Strategy

Here's the strategy for optimizing the given code:

1. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the specific standard libraries that are actually being used.

2. Pre-calculate and store the results of the `check` function in an array for quick lookup.

3. Simplify the `M2S` function by breaking down nested calculations into smaller steps and avoiding code repetition.

4. Use built-in functions to convert strings to integers in the `main` function.

5. Process each value in the `main` function as soon as it's ready, and discard it afterwards.

6. Replace the `while(1)` loop in the `main` function with a more idiomatic loop that directly reads from `cin`.

## Optimized Code Block

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

struct S {
  ll y, m, d;
};

struct Ma {
  ll b, ka, t, w, ki;
};

int M[] = {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
bool leapYear[3000];

void precalculateLeapYears() {
  for(int i = 0; i < 3000; i++) {
    leapYear[i] = (i % 4 == 0 && (i % 100 != 0 || i % 400 == 0));
  }
}

S M2S(ll b, ll ka, ll t, ll w, ll ki) {
  ka += b * 20;
  t += ka * 20;
  w += t * 18;
  ki += w * 20;
  S res;
  res.y = 2012, res.m = 12, res.d = 21 + ki;
  if (res.d <= 31)
    return res;
  while (res.d / (365 + leapYear[res.y + 1]))
    res.y++, res.d -= (365 + leapYear[res.y]);
  if (res.d == 0)
    res.m--, res.d = M[res.m - 1] + (leapYear[res.y] && res.m == 2);
  if (res.d <= 31)
    return res;
  res.y++, res.m = 1, res.d -= 31;
  while (res.d / (M[res.m - 1] + (leapYear[res.y] && res.m == 2))) {
    res.d -= (M[res.m - 1] + (leapYear[res.y] && res.m == 2));
    res.m++;
  }
  if (res.d == 0)
    res.m--, res.d = M[res.m - 1] + (leapYear[res.y] && res.m == 2);
  return res;
}

Ma S2M(ll y, ll m, ll d) {
  y -= 2012;
  if (y)
    d += 10;
  else
    d = (d - 21);
  for (int i = 0; i < m - 1 && y; i++)
    d += (M[i] + (i == 1 && leapYear[y + 2012]));
  y--;
  while (y > 0)
    d += (365 + leapYear[y + 2012]), y--;
  Ma res;
  d %= 13 * 20 * 20 * 18 * 20;
  res.ki = d;
  res.w = res.ki / 20;
  res.ki %= 20;
  res.t = res.w / 18;
  res.w %= 18;
  res.ka = res.t / 20;
  res.t %= 20;
  res.b = res.ka / 20;
  res.ka %= 20;
  return res;
}

int main() {
  precalculateLeapYears();
  for(string str; cin >> str && str != "#";) {
    vector<int> a;
    size_t pos = 0;
    while ((pos = str.find('.')) != string::npos) {
      a.push_back(stoi(str.substr(0, pos)));
      str.erase(0, pos + 1);
    }
    a.push_back(stoi(str));
    if (a.size() == 5) {
      S ans = M2S(a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3], a[4]);
      cout << ans.y << "." << ans.m << "." << ans.d << endl;
    } else {
      Ma ans = S2M(a[0], a[1], a[2]);
      cout << ans.b << "." << ans.ka << "." << ans.t << "." << ans.w << "."
           << ans.ki << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code improves the performance by reducing the number of calculations and memory usage. The code complexity is slightly increased due to the addition of the precalculation function and the use of the `stoi` function. However, the overall readability of the code is improved by removing the redundant `while(1)` loop and using the `cin >> str` directly in the for loop.
