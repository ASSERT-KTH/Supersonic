This code seems to be an implementation of a priority queue using a heap data structure. There are several areas where this code can be optimized.

1. **Code Analysis:**

   Few potential bottlenecks in the code are:
   - Unnecessary computations in 'getlr' method where modulo operation is performed twice.
   - In the 'hin' function, a multiplication operation is repeated.
   - Use of multiplication operation in 'gets' function where shift operation could be used.
   - The frequent use of array indexing, which can be optimized by using pointers.
   
2. **Optimization Strategy:**

     1. Use temporary variables to store the results of repeated computations.
     2. Replace multiplication with shift operation wherever possible.
     3. Use pointers instead of array indexing for faster access.
     4. Compiler optimizations: Use the `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flags when compiling the program.
  
3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

   1. In the 'getlr' method, the result of `M[i] * M[i]` is computed twice. It's more efficient to compute it once and store the result in a temporary variable.
   
      Trade-offs: This will slightly increase the memory usage, but the performance gain outweighs this minor increase.
   
   2. In the 'hin' function, `i / 2` is computed multiple times. It's better to compute it once and store the result in a temporary variable.
   
      Trade-offs: This will slightly increase the memory usage, but the performance gain outweighs this minor increase.
   
   3. In 'gets' function, `k[i][j] * (s[j] - '0')` is equivalent to `k[i][j] << (s[j] - '0')` which is faster.

      Trade-offs: This change makes the code slightly less readable, but the performance gain outweighs this minor drawback.
   
   4. Replace array indexing with pointers for faster access. 
   
      Trade-offs: This might make the code slightly less intuitive for beginners, but the performance gain outweighs this minor drawback.
   
   5. Use of `-O2` or `-O3` compiler optimization flags can lead to optimization in terms of loop unrolling, function inlining and others.

4. **Optimized Code Block:** The optimized code is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
long long a[2] = {101, 103};
long long M[2] = {1e9 + 7, 1e9 + 9};
long long d[2][300010], k[2][300010];
long long R = 1, C = 1, H[2000010], N[2000010], h[300010];
int hyouka(int a, int b) {
  if (C < b)
    return 1;
  if (C < a || b == 0)
    return 0;
  return N[H[a]] < N[H[b]] || N[H[a]] == N[H[b]] && h[H[a]] < h[H[b]] ? 1 : 0;
}
void hin(long long a) {
  int i = C++, half;
  N[H[0] = R] = a;
  while (i > 1) {
    half = i / 2;
    if(!hyouka(0, half)) break;
    H[i] = H[half];
    i = half;
  }
  H[i] = R++;
}
// ... Rest of the code follows with similar changes
```
