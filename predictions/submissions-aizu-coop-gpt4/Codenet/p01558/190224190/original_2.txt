This C++ program seems to be implementing some sort of hash-based string comparison algorithm where it reads a string and performs various operations (like shifting the focus window left, right, or comparing substrings). It uses two hash functions to ensure the accuracy of the comparison. The hashes are stored in a priority queue for comparison. The priority queue is implemented as a binary heap.

Although the program is well-structured, there are several areas where performance can be improved:

1. **Optimizing Hash Computations**:

    The `getlr()` function is used to compute the hash value of a substring from 'l' to 'r' using two different hash functions. It is called multiple times during the execution with the same 'l' and 'r' values. The results of these computations could be memoized (cached) to avoid recomputing the same values.

2. **Optimizing Priority Queue Operations**:

    Priority queue operations (i.e., `hin` and `hout`) are not optimized. The use of a standard library priority queue (like `std::priority_queue` in C++) could improve the efficiency of these operations.

3. **Avoiding Unnecessary String Comparisons**:

    The `match()` function is used to compare two strings for equality. However, it is not necessary to compare the strings if their hash values are different. So, we can return false as soon as we find that the hash values are different.

4. **Reducing Memory Usage**:

    The program uses several large arrays (`d`, `k`, `H`, `N`, `h`) to store intermediate results. We can try to reduce the memory usage by reusing these arrays as much as possible, and by using more efficient data structures where appropriate. For example, `d` and `k` can be reduced to a single dimension array.

5. **Compiler Optimizations**:

    The use of compiler optimization flags (like `-O2` or `-O3` for GCC) can also help to speed up the running time of the program.

6. **Optimizing Input/Output Operations**:

    The use of `scanf` and `printf` functions for input/output operations can be slower than using standard C++ input/output streams (`std::cin` and `std::cout`). So, we can replace these functions with their C++ counterparts.

Let's proceed to implement these optimizations and see how they improve the performance of the program.
