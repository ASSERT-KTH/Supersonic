The code provided is quite complicated and involves various operations such as hashing, heap operations, and string manipulations. The code seems to be solving a specific problem rather than being a general-purpose code block. As such, optimization will be on a per-case basis and may not apply to all situations. Here are some general strategies that can be used to optimize this code:

**1. Code Analysis:**

The code is implementing a rolling hash and priority queue (heap) algorithm. It is essentially creating and managing two heaps, each based on a different hash function. The heaps are then used to compare and count unique strings. 

**2. Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Using Built-in Data Structures**: The code implements a heap/priority queue with arrays which is understandable but it's more beneficial to use built-in data structures for such purposes. This not only reduces chances of bugs but also makes the code more readable and easier to maintain. 

2. **Avoiding Unnecessary Computations**: Some computations are performed more than needed. For example, `getlr(l, r, 0)` is computed twice. It would be better to compute this value once and store it in a variable.

3. **Using Efficient I/O Methods**: The code uses `scanf` and `printf`, which are slower for input/output operations. Using faster alternatives like `getchar_unlocked` and `putchar_unlocked` can improve I/O performance.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Using Built-in Data Structures**: The built-in priority_queue data structure from C++ STL can be used instead of the manual heap implementation. This requires replacing the `hin`, `hout`, and `hyouka` functions with equivalent operations on `priority_queue`.

2. **Avoiding Unnecessary Computations**: The `getlr(l, r, 0)` is computed twice in the main function. We can compute this value once and store it in a variable to avoid unnecessary computation.

3. **Using Efficient I/O Methods**: Replacing `scanf` and `printf` with faster alternatives like `getchar_unlocked` and `putchar_unlocked`.

**4. Optimized Code Block:**

Due to the complexity of the code and the fact that it solves a specific problem, it's not possible to provide a full optimized code block here. However, the following is a simplified example of how to implement the above optimization steps:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Define priority_queue (heap)
priority_queue<long long, vector<long long>, greater<long long>> pq;

// Replace hin() function
void hin(long long a) {
    pq.push(a);
}

// Replace hout() function
int hout() {
    int rt = pq.top();
    pq.pop();
    return rt;
}

// ...

// Main function
int main() {
    // ...

    // Compute getlr(l, r, 0) once and store in a variable
    long long getlr_val = getlr(l, r, 0);
    h[R] = getlr_val;
    hin(getlr_val);

    // ... 

    return 0;
}
```

This code snippet implements the optimization steps discussed above, but it is not a full implementation of the original program. Note that the code uses C++ STL which is not available in C. If you need to stick with C, you would need to implement these data structures and functions by yourself.
