**Code Analysis**

This program is a dynamic programming solution for the coin change problem. It takes as input the number of denominations `m` and the total sum `n`. The coin denominations are stored in the array `c`. The array `mini` is used to store the minimum number of coins needed to make up each value from 1 to `n`. 

The code starts by initializing all elements of the `mini` array to a large number `INF`. Then it iterates through each coin denomination, and for each denomination, it iterates from 0 to `n - c[i]`, updating the minimum number of coins needed for each value. 

The performance of this code mainly depends on the size of `n` and `m`. It has a time complexity of O(n*m) due to the two nested loops.

**Optimization Strategy**

1. **Preprocessing**: The code sorts the coin denominations array `c`. However, the order of denominations is not crucial in this problem. So, the sorting operation, which has a time complexity of O(m log m), can be removed to save time.

2. **Memory Allocation**: The `mini` array is statically allocated with a size of 50001, which may be excessive if `n` is small. Dynamically allocating the size of `mini` based on the value of `n` will reduce memory usage.

3. **Initialization**: The code initializes the `mini` array to `INF`. Instead of using a loop for initialization, we can use `std::fill_n`, which might be faster because it's optimized for performance.

4. **Loop Optimization**: The inner loop iterates from 0 to `n - c[i]`. Instead of starting from 0, we can start from `c[i]`, as `mini[j]` for `j < c[i]` won't be affected by `c[i]`.

5. **Compiler Optimization**: To further speed up the program, we can enable some compiler optimizations like `-O3` which performs several optimization techniques like inlining, loop unrolling, etc.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **Remove sorting**: The `std::sort` function is removed because the order of coin denominations does not affect the result. This reduces the time complexity from O(m log m) to O(m).

2. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Instead of statically allocating 50001 elements, we dynamically allocate `(n + 1)` elements to the `mini` array. This reduces memory usage, especially when `n` is small.

3. **Use `std::fill_n` for Initialization**: Instead of a loop, we use `std::fill_n` to initialize the `mini` array. This function is often faster than a loop because it is optimized for performance.

4. **Optimize Inner Loop**: The inner loop is modified to start from `c[i]` instead of 0. This reduces the number of iterations, thus saving time.

5. **Compiler Optimization**: Compiler optimizations are not reflected in the code itself, but can be enabled during compilation by adding `-O3` flag.

**Trade-Offs**

The main trade-off of these optimizations is code complexity. Using dynamic memory allocation and `std::fill_n` might make the code slightly harder to understand for beginners. However, the performance gains are worth it.

**Optimized Code Block**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 2000000000;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  vector<int> c(m + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    cin >> c[i];
  }
  vector<int> mini(n + 1, INF);
  mini[0] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (int j = c[i]; j <= n; j++) {
      mini[j] = min(mini[j], mini[j - c[i]] + 1);
    }
  }
  cout << mini[n] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Remember to compile the code with `-O3` flag to enable compiler optimizations.
