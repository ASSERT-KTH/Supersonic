Code Analysis:
The given C++ program is trying to solve a problem similar to the Coin Change problem, a well-known problem in dynamic programming. The program takes two inputs: 'n' which represents the target value and 'm' which is the count of available coin denominations. The denominations are stored in array 'c'. The array 'mini' is used to store the minimum number of coins required to achieve the value of each index. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Redundant Computations: The computation 'j + c[i]' is being performed twice in the innermost loop. We can store the result in a variable and use that instead. This will save computation time.

2. Memory Access: In the nested loop, we are accessing the values of 'mini' array multiple times. We can reduce this by storing the value of 'mini[j]' in a local variable.

3. Input/Output Stream: In C++, 'cin' and 'cout' are slower compared to 'scanf' and 'printf'. We can replace 'cin' and 'cout' with 'scanf' and 'printf' for faster input/output operations.

4. Compiler Optimization: We can use the '-O2' or '-O3' flag during compilation to instruct the compiler to optimize the code further.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Store the value of 'j + c[i]' in a variable 'temp' and replace 'j + c[i]' with 'temp' in the innermost loop. This change will reduce the calculations performed inside the loop, thus improving the performance.
2. Store 'mini[j]' in a local variable 'minj' and use 'minj' in the minimum calculation. This change will reduce the number of times we are accessing the memory to get 'mini[j]', thus improving the performance.
3. Replace 'cin' and 'cout' with 'scanf' and 'printf'. This change will improve the input/output operations' speed, thus improving the overall performance of the program.
4. Compile the program with '-O2' or '-O3' flag to enable compiler optimization.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <math.h>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 2000000000;
int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);  // Faster I/O operation
  int c[21];
  int mini[50001];
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &c[i]);  // Faster I/O operation
  }
  sort(c + 1, c + 1 + m);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    mini[i] = INF;
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= n - c[i]; j++) {
      int temp = j + c[i];  // Avoiding redundant computation
      int minj = mini[j];  // Reducing memory access
      mini[temp] = min(minj + 1, mini[temp]);
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", mini[n]);  // Faster I/O operation
  return 0;
}
```
To compile, use `g++ -O2 file.cpp` or `g++ -O3 file.cpp`. This will provide additional performance improvements.
