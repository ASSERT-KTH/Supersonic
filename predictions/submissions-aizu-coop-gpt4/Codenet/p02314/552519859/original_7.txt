The given code is a dynamic programming solution to a problem related to coin change. It calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make a specific amount. Here are some optimizations we can make:

1. We can avoid the sort operation on the coin denominations array. The sorting does not seem to affect the final output, as we are not trying to minimize the denominations used, but rather the total count of coins used. This can save us `O(m log m)` time.

2. We can initialize the `mini` array using `std::fill_n` instead of a for loop. This will not necessarily make the code faster, but it will make it cleaner and easier to understand.

3. We can leverage `std::min` function directly during assignment to `mini[j + c[i]]` instead of creating an intermediate variable.

4. We can use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(NULL)`, these statements can speed up I/O operations in C++.

Below is the optimized version of the given code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits>
using namespace std;

const int INF = numeric_limits<int>::max();

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    int c[21];
    int mini[50001];
    fill_n(mini, n+1, INF); // Filling mini array with INF
    mini[0] = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        cin >> c[i];
    }

    // Removed sort operation here
  
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= n - c[i]; j++) {
            // Using std::min function directly during assignment
            mini[j + c[i]] = min(mini[j] + 1, mini[j + c[i]]);
        }
    }

    cout << mini[n] << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

Remember that optimization often comes with trade-offs. In this case, the main trade-off is that the code may become slightly less intuitive to someone unfamiliar with C++ idioms such as `fill_n`. However, the gain in efficiency and the readability improvement for those familiar with the language likely outweigh this downside.
