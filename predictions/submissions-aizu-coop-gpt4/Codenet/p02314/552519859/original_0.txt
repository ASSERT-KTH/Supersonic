Code Analysis:
The provided C++ program reads two integers `n` and `m` from the user, then reads `m` more integers into an array `c`. The array is sorted and then used to calculate the minimum number of elements from `c` that can sum up to `n`, which is stored in the array `mini`.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses arrays to store the input and the intermediate results. Arrays are efficient in terms of memory usage, but a vector could be more flexible and easier to work with in terms of adding or removing elements.

2. Redundant Computations: The sorting operation is unnecessary. The order of the coins doesn't affect the final result because we are trying to find the minimum number of coins that sum up to `n` in a dynamic programming approach.

3. Loops and Recursive Calls: The nested for loops aren't avoidable in this case because we need to iterate over all coins and all possible values up to `n`. However, we can optimize the inner loop by starting from `c[i]` instead of `0`, because any amount less than `c[i]` can't be formed using `c[i]`.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use faster I/O methods to speed up the program execution.

Optimization Steps:

1. Remove the `sort` function call. Sorting the coins doesn't affect the final result because we are trying to find the minimum number of coins that sum up to `n` in a dynamic programming approach.

2. Start the inner loop from `c[i]` instead of `0`. Any amount less than `c[i]` cannot be formed using `c[i]`.

3. Use faster I/O methods. `scanf` and `printf` are faster than `cin` and `cout` respectively.

Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
#include <math.h>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 2000000000;
int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  int c[21];
  int mini[50001];
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &c[i]);
  }
  fill(mini, mini+n+1, INF); // initialize mini array with INF
  mini[0] = 0; // base case
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (int j = c[i]; j <= n; j++) {
      mini[j] = min(mini[j], mini[j - c[i]] + 1);
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", mini[n]);
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code removes the unnecessary sorting operation, improves the inner loop by starting from `c[i]`, and uses faster I/O methods. It preserves the functionality of the original code and produces the same output.
