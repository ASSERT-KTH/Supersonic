## Code Analysis
The given C++ program reads two integer values `n` and `m` from the standard input. It then reads `m` integer values into an array `c`. The array `c` is sorted and an array `mini` is initialized with a value `INF` for indices from 1 to `n`. Afterwards, the program performs a set of computations to update the `mini` array. Finally, the program prints the value of `mini[n]` to the standard output.

The computations seem to be some kind of dynamic programming, where each `mini[j + c[i]]` is being updated as the minimum of its current value and `mini[j] + 1`. This suggests that the `mini` array is storing some optimal solutions to subproblems, and these solutions are being used to compute the solution to larger problems.

## Optimization Strategy
This program can benefit from the following optimizations:

1. **Redundant computations:** The current program sort the `c` array but doesn't seem to take advantage from the sorted order. We can avoid sorting the array unless it's necessary for the logic of the program.

2. **Efficient data structures:** The `mini` array is initialized with a large number `INF` in a separate loop. We can initialize this array with `INF` at the time of declaration itself.

3. **Compiler optimizations:** The program can benefit from compiler optimizations like `-O2` or `-O3` which will make the compiler perform loop unrolling and other optimizations automatically.

4. **Input/Output optimization:** The use of std::cin and std::cout for input and output can be slower than using scanf and printf. We can replace cin and cout with scanf and printf to improve the I/O performance.

## Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **Avoid sorting the array:** The current program sorts the `c` array but it doesn't seem to benefit from the sorted order. Therefore, we can avoid sorting the array unless it's necessary for the logic. This will save the time taken to sort the array, which is O(m log m) in the worst case.

2. **Initialize `mini` array efficiently:** The `mini` array is initialized with `INF` in a separate loop. This can be done at the time of declaration itself, saving the time taken to initialize the array in a separate loop. This will not improve the time complexity, but it will make the code slightly faster and cleaner.

3. **Enable compiler optimizations:** We can enable compiler optimizations like `-O2` or `-O3` when compiling the program. These optimizations will make the compiler perform several optimizations automatically, including loop unrolling, which can make the program faster.

4. **Optimize I/O operations:** The use of std::cin and std::cout for input and output can be slower than using scanf and printf. Therefore, we can replace cin and cout with scanf and printf to improve the I/O performance. This will not improve the time complexity, but it can make the program faster in practice.

## Optimized Code Block
Below is the optimized code block with the changes discussed above:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 2000000000;

int main() {
    int n, m;
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
    int c[21];
    int mini[50001] = {0};
    fill(mini + 1, mini + n + 1, INF);

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &c[i]);
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= n - c[i]; j++) {
            mini[j + c[i]] = min(mini[j] + 1, mini[j + c[i]]);
        }
    }
    printf("%d\n", mini[n]);
    return 0;
}
```

Changes:
- Replaced `std::cin` and `std::cout` with `scanf` and `printf`.
- Removed `std::sort` call, as the sorted order of `c` doesn't seem to be used.
- Initialized `mini` with `INF` at the time of declaration.
- Removed `#include <iostream>` and `#include <math.h>` as they are not used.
