**Code Analysis**

This code is trying to solve a specific type of problem known as coin change problem with minimum number of coins. Given an amount `n` and `m` types of coins with different denominations (`c[i]`), the program finds the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount `n`. 

The main performance bottlenecks are in the inner loop, where the program iteratively checks every possible combination of coins, and the sorting operation. 

**Optimization Strategy**

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The `mini` array is initialized with a size of `50001`, which is a fixed, arbitrarily large size. This is inefficient if the input `n` is much smaller than `50001`. This array can be dynamically allocated to size `n+1` instead to save memory.

2. Redundant Computations: The `sort` operation on the `c` array is unnecessary and can be removed. The ordering of coin denominations does not affect the final result.

3. Loops or Recursive Calls: The inner loop can be optimized. As it stands, for each coin, the program checks each possible sum up to `n`. This could potentially be improved by avoiding repeated computations through dynamic programming.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use the `-O2` or `-O3` flag during compilation to enable all possible compiler optimizations. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. Dynamically allocate the `mini` array to size `n+1`. This will reduce memory usage when `n` is much smaller than `50001`.

2. Remove the `sort` operation on the `c` array. This will reduce computation time without affecting the final result.

3. The inner loop can be optimized by starting from `c[i]` and going up to `n`. This way, we ensure that each coin denomination is only considered once for each sum, thereby reducing redundant operations.

**Optimized Code Block**

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 2000000000;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  vector<int> c(m+1);
  vector<int> mini(n+1, INF); // Dynamically allocate to size n+1 and initialize to INF

  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    cin >> c[i];
  }

  mini[0] = 0; // You need 0 coins to make a sum of 0

  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (int j = c[i]; j <= n; j++) { // Start from c[i] and go up to n
      mini[j] = min(mini[j], mini[j - c[i]] + 1);
    }
  }

  cout << mini[n] << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces memory usage by using a dynamic array for `mini` and reduces computation time by removing the unnecessary sort operation and optimizing the inner loop. It preserves the functionality and output of the original code.
