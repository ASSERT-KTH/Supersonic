Code Analysis:

The provided code is a C++ program that calculates the Damerau-Levenshtein distance between pairs of strings and prints the pairs that have a distance less than or equal to a given threshold. Damerau-Levenshtein distance is a measure of the difference between two strings, which is the minimum number of operations (consisting of insertions, deletions or substitutions of a single character, or transposition of two adjacent characters) required to change one string into the other.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Data Structures: The unordered_map data structure is used to store distances. This can lead to slower access times due to possible hash collisions. A vector or an array can be used to speed up access times, especially if the keys are integers, which is the case here.
   
2. Redundant Computations: The minimum function is called with four arguments in each iteration of the inner loop. This can be optimized by calculating the minimum incrementally.

3. Loops: The two inner loops iterate over the strings a and b. The calculation of the Damerau-Levenshtein distance is a time-consuming process. It might be beneficial to use a faster string comparison method as a preliminary check before calculating the distance.

The following steps will be taken to optimize the code:

1. Replace the unordered_map data structure with a two-dimensional vector for storing distances in the Damerau-Levenshtein distance calculation. This will speed up access times.

2. Calculate the minimum incrementally in the inner loop to minimize the number of operations.

3. Use a faster string comparison method as a preliminary check before calculating the Damerau-Levenshtein distance. This can be done by checking the lengths of the strings. If the difference in lengths is greater than the given threshold, the distance calculation can be skipped.

4. Sort the strings in advance, and then compare each string with the next one in the sorted array. This can potentially reduce the number of comparisons.

The following is the optimized code: 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int damerau_levenshtein_distance(const string &a, const string &b) {
    int m = a.size();
    int n = b.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1));
    for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++)
        dp[i][0] = i;
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++)
        dp[0][j] = j;
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            int cost = a[i-1] == b[j-1] ? 0 : 1;
            dp[i][j] = min({dp[i-1][j] + 1, dp[i][j-1] + 1, dp[i-1][j-1] + cost});
            if (i > 1 && j > 1 && a[i-1] == b[j-2] && a[i-2] == b[j-1])
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-2][j-2] + cost);
        }
    }
    return dp[m][n];
}

void solve(int n) {
    int d;
    vector<string> name(n);
    cin >> d;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> name[i];
    sort(name.begin(), name.end());
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (abs((int)name[i].size() - (int)name[j].size()) > d)
                continue;
            if (damerau_levenshtein_distance(name[i], name[j]) <= d) {
                ++count;
                cout << name[i] << "," << name[j] << endl;
            }
        }
    }
    cout << count << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    for (;;) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        if (!n)
            break;
        solve(n);
    }
    return 0;
}
