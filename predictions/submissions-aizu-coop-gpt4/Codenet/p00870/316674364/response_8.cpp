The provided code is quite large and complex, so let's break it down section by section. The main performance bottlenecks seem to be the nested loops and the heavy use of string manipulation and complex data structures. Here is a targeted optimization strategy:

1. Redundant Computations: The same computations are performed multiple times in different parts of the code. These computations can be stored in variables and reused to reduce computational overhead.

2. String Concatenation: The `+=` operator is used for string concatenation. This operator creates a new string and copies the old string to the new one, which is inefficient. Instead, we can use a `std::stringstream` or `std::string::append()` method which are more efficient.

3. Avoid excessive use of `std::vector`: The code uses `std::vector` in multiple places. While `std::vector` is a powerful and flexible data structure, it can sometimes be less efficient than native arrays or other data structures like `std::array` if not used properly.

4. Avoid Dynamic Memory Allocation: The code uses a dynamic 2D array `vis` which is initialized multiple times within a loop. Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation are expensive operations. It's better to allocate memory once and reuse it.

5. Use of Bit Manipulation: The code uses bit manipulation to store states. This is a good practice for reducing memory usage, but the code can be optimized further by using bitsets (`std::bitset`) which are faster.

6. Loop Optimizations: The nested loops in the `solve()` function can be optimized using loop unrolling and other loop optimization techniques. 

7. Remove Unused Functions and Variables: The code contains several unused functions and variables. These should be removed to clean up the code and improve readability.

8. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This can speed up the I/O operations in C++.

9. Compiler Optimizations: Use `-O3` flag for gcc or g++ to enable all optimization.

10. Function Inlining: Small functions which are called frequently can be inlined for performance boost.
