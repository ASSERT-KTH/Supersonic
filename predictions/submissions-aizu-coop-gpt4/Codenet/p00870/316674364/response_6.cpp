The given C++ code is quite complex and contains many computations. After analyzing the code, I've identified potential bottlenecks and areas for optimization. Here's the strategy for code optimization:

1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The given code uses arrays and STL queue for storing data. However, there is no immediate need to change these as they are efficient for the operations being performed.

2. **Redundant Computations:** The code contains several repeated computations that could benefit from memoization or from being moved outside loops. 

3. **Loops and Recursion Optimization:** There are several nested loops in the code that could potentially be optimized. One such example is the nested loop inside the `solve()` function, which iterates over all elements from 1 to the size of the text.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** Using compiler optimization flags can significantly boost the performance of the code. For this code, we could consider using the `-O3` flag for the g++ compiler.

Now let's go step by step:

1. **Redundant Computations:**

The first optimization we can make is to move the computations that are not dependent on the loop variables outside the loops. This includes the calculation of `gha` values, which can be calculated once and stored for later use. This would eliminate the need to compute these values inside the nested loops, thus reducing the computational overhead.

2. **Loops and Recursion Optimization:**

The nested loops inside the `solve()` function iterate over all elements of the text and all subsets of a set of size `n`. In the worst case, this results in a time complexity of `O(n * 2^n)`, which is quite inefficient. We can optimize this by using dynamic programming or bit manipulation techniques to efficiently iterate over all subsets of the set.

3. **Compiler Optimizations:**

Adding compiler optimization flags can greatly improve the performance of the code. For the g++ compiler, the `-O3` flag can be used to enable all optimization flags, including `-O2`, `-O1`, and `-O0`. This would allow the compiler to perform various optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, and others.

4. **Code Clean-Up:**

The code contains several unused variables and functions. Removing these would not only make the code cleaner and easier to read, but it would also slightly improve the performance by reducing the memory footprint of the program.

Once these optimizations are implemented, the code should run significantly faster and use less memory. However, it's important to note that these optimizations may make the code more complex and harder to understand. Therefore, it's crucial to balance performance gains with code readability and maintainability.
