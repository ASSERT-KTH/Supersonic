Firstly, let's go over the code analysis:

1. The code uses a lot of bitwise operations, which can be computationally expensive. The operations are handled using a large 2D array, which can lead to inefficient memory usage for large inputs.

2. The code has a time complexity of O(n^2 * m), where n is the length of the string and m is the number of strings.

3. There are redundant computations such as `p[i][1 << j] = true;` and `p[i2][j & (~(1 << k))]` inside nested loops. 

4. The use of `std::cin.tie(0);` and `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` can be avoided because there's no mixing of C and C++ I/O operations.

5. The heavy use of bitwise operations can make the code difficult to understand and optimize.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Memory Usage: One possible optimization could be using bitsets instead of a 2D boolean array, which can improve memory usage.

2. Identify Redundant Computations: Examine the nested loops to avoid redundant computations.

3. Use Better Data Structures: Replacing some variables with more efficient data structures can save time.

4. Use Compiler Optimizations: Use compiler optimization flags to produce a more efficient executable.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
   
1. Memory Usage: Bitset could be a better alternative to the 2D boolean array as it uses just one bit of memory per boolean. This can significantly reduce memory usage.

2. Redundant Computations: The nested loops have some redundant computations. For instance, `p[i][1 << j] = true;` and `p[i2][j & (~(1 << k))]` are computed multiple times for the same i and j values. We can calculate these once and store the results to avoid recomputation.

3. Better Data Structures: The current code uses vectors and strings. In some cases, other data structures might be more efficient. For example, using a deque for `heads` can make adding and removing elements more efficient.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to produce a more efficient executable. These flags instruct the compiler to perform optimizations such as loop unrolling and function inlining.

Trade-offs:
   
1. Bitsets can improve memory usage, but they can make the code harder to read and understand.

2. Storing results to avoid redundant computations can improve speed but uses more memory.

3. Using different data structures can improve efficiency but might make the code more complex.

4. Compiler optimizations can make the executable more efficient but can also make debugging harder.
