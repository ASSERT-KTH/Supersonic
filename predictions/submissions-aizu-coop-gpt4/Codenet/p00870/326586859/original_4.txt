Code Analysis:
The provided code is an implementation of an algorithm that reads in two sets of strings and checks for the presence of all permutations of the first set in the second set. The code contains several areas that can be optimized to improve its performance and efficiency.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The 2D boolean array 'p' is being used to store whether or not a particular permutation of the first set of strings is present in the second set of strings. This is inefficient as the size of the array is fixed and can waste memory if the input is small. An alternative would be to use a dynamic data structure like a hashmap or a vector of vectors, which can adjust its size based on the input.

2. Redundant Computations: The code checks for the presence of each permutation in the second set of strings multiple times. This is redundant and can be avoided by storing the result of the check in a data structure for future reference.

3. Loop Optimization: The nested loop structure used for the permutation check can be optimized using a technique called 'loop unrolling'. This involves decreasing the number of iterations of the loop by performing more operations in each iteration.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The use of the 'rep' macro for loop declarations can be replaced with standard for loop declarations. This can allow the compiler to make better decisions about loop optimizations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replacing the 2D boolean array with a vector of vectors: This will allow the data structure to adjust its size based on the input, saving memory. This change is easy to implement and should not introduce any additional complexity into the code.

2. Storing the result of permutation checks: Instead of checking for the presence of each permutation in the second set of strings multiple times, the result of the check can be stored in a data structure for future reference. This will reduce the amount of computation required and improve performance.

3. Loop unrolling: The nested loop structure used for the permutation check can be replaced with a loop that performs more operations per iteration. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

4. Replacing the 'rep' macro with standard for loop declarations: This will allow the compiler to make better decisions about loop optimizations, further improving performance.
