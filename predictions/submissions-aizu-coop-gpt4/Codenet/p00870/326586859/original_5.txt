1. Code Analysis:
The provided code is a C++ program that appears to be solving a string matching problem with multiple smaller strings. The inputs to the program are two integers (n and m) followed by n strings and m strings. The program constructs a new string from the m strings and checks how many times any permutation of the n strings appears in the new string. 

The code uses bit manipulation to represent all possible combinations of the n strings and dynamic programming to avoid recomputation. Specifically, the 'p' array keeps track of whether each combination of strings can be found starting at each position in the new string. The 'sum_len' array stores the total length of each combination of strings. 

2. Optimization Strategy:
Looking at the code, there are several areas we could optimize:

    A. Data Structures: The 'p' array is declared as a static bool array with dimensions of 5000 by 1<<12. This is likely to be more memory than needed for most inputs and the dimensions are hard-coded which means it may not be enough for some inputs. We could use a dynamic data structure like a vector instead and resize it based on the inputs.

    B. Redundant Computations: The 'sum_len' array is computed for all 1<<n combinations of strings. However, many of these combinations may not be used in the dynamic programming part of the code. We could compute these values on demand to save time.

    C. Loop Optimizations: The loop that iterates over all combinations of strings is currently a nested loop inside the loop that iterates over all positions in the new string. This results in a lot of unnecessary computations as the same combination is checked at many positions. We could change the order of these loops to compute the result for each combination once and then apply it to all applicable positions.

    D. Compiler Optimizations: We could use compiler directives like '#pragma GCC optimize' to hint the compiler to optimize the code for speed.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    A. Data Structures: Replace the 'p' array with a vector and resize it based on the inputs 'n' and 'm'. This will allow the data structure to use only as much memory as needed and accommodate any input size.

    B. Redundant Computations: Compute the 'sum_len' values on demand inside the dynamic programming loop. This will save time by avoiding unnecessary computations.

    C. Loop Optimizations: Change the order of the loops in the dynamic programming part of the code. Compute the result for each combination of strings once and then apply it to all applicable positions. This will reduce the number of computations and improve the runtime of the code.

    D. Compiler Optimizations: Add the '#pragma GCC optimize' directive at the top of the code to hint the compiler to optimize the code for speed. This can result in significant performance improvements on some compilers and input sizes.
