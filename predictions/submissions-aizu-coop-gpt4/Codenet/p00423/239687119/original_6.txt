The provided code is a simple C++ program that reads game scores of two players a and b from the standard input, cumulates the scores and stores them in vectors veca and vecb respectively. The program keeps reading data until it encounters an input of 0. Finally, it prints out the scores from the vectors.

## Code Analysis
1. The code reads input in a loop, which can be costly in terms of time complexity.
2. The vectors veca and vecb store the total scores. This implies redundant memory usage, as we could directly print the scores instead of storing them first.
3. The program uses if-else conditions to decide which player's score to increase. This could be optimized.
4. The variables are not properly named, which can lead to confusion and errors.
5. There is an unused variable 'vec'.

## Optimization Strategy

1. **Reduce Memory Usage**: Instead of storing all results in memory, we can print the result immediately after each calculation, which will reduce the memory usage significantly.
2. **Optimize If-Else Conditions**: We can use a ternary operator to simplify the if-else structure that decides which player's score to increase.
3. **Code Readability**: Properly name the variables to enhance code readability and maintainability.
4. **Remove Unused Variables**: Remove the unused variable 'vec' to clean up the code.

## Optimized Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int numGames;
  int scoreA = 0, scoreB = 0;
  int gameScoreA, gameScoreB;

  while (1) {
    std::cin >> numGames;
    if (numGames == 0)
      break;
    else {
      for (int i = 0; i < numGames; ++i) {
        std::cin >> gameScoreA >> gameScoreB;
        scoreA += (gameScoreA >= gameScoreB) ? gameScoreA + gameScoreB : gameScoreA;
        scoreB += (gameScoreB > gameScoreA) ? gameScoreA + gameScoreB : gameScoreB;
      }
      std::cout << scoreA << " " << scoreB << std::endl;
      scoreA = 0;
      scoreB = 0;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This new version of the code reduces memory usage, simplifies the if-else conditions, improves readability with better variable names, and removes the unused variable 'vec'. The functionality remains the same as the original code.
