**Code Analysis**

The code accepts input pairs, computes their sum, and stores the results into two vectors. The code is simple but it can be optimized in terms of input/output operations, memory usage, and computational performance.

**Optimization Strategy**

1. **Input/Output Operations (I/O operations)**: I/O operations are generally slow and can significantly slow down the program execution. Minimizing the frequency of I/O operations can improve the running speed of the program. `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` can be used to unsync the C++ standard streams with their C counterparts, thereby speeding up input and output operations.

2. **Memory Usage**: The vectors `veca` and `vecb` are used to store all the computed results before printing them out. This is unnecessary and can lead to high memory usage if the input size is large. The results can be printed out immediately after computation to save memory.

3. **Unnecessary Computations**: The code computes `game_a + game_b` twice in the case where `game_a` is not equal to `game_b`. This is unnecessary and can be avoided by computing the sum once and storing it in a variable.

4. **Use of C++ Standard Library Functions**: The use of `std::vector::size()` in the loop condition may result in the function being called at each iteration, which is inefficient. While most modern compilers optimize this automatically, it is good practice to store the size in a variable before the loop to ensure that the function is not called unnecessarily.

**Optimized Code Block**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // Speed up cin and cout operations
  std::cin.tie(nullptr); // Unbind cin from cout to improve performance

  int n;
  int a = 0;
  int b = 0;
  int game_a, game_b;

  while (1) {
    std::cin >> n;
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    else {
      for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cin >> game_a >> game_b;
        int sum = game_a + game_b; // Calculate sum once to avoid redundant computation
        if (game_a == game_b) {
          a += sum;
          b += sum;
        } else if (game_a > game_b)
          a += sum;
        else
          b += sum;
      }
      std::cout << a << " " << b << std::endl; // Print results immediately to save memory
      a = 0;
      b = 0;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of Optimizations**

1. `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(nullptr)` are used to speed up cin and cout operations by unsyncing the C++ standard streams from their C counterparts and unbinding cin from cout respectively.

2. The results are printed out immediately after computation instead of storing all the results in vectors and printing them out later. This saves memory as the vectors are not needed.

3. The sum of `game_a` and `game_b` is computed once and stored in a variable to avoid redundant computation. The variable is then used in the if-else conditions.

4. The use of `std::vector::size()` in the loop condition has been removed as it is not needed. It can be inefficient if the function is called at each iteration, although most modern compilers optimize this automatically.
