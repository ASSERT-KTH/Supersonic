Let's start with the code analysis:

The program reads pairs of numbers until it encounters a zero. It uses these pairs to calculate the cumulative scores for two hypothetical players (a and b) in a game. The scores for each round are saved in two vectors (veca and vecb) and printed at the end.

Here are some potential optimization points:

1. Memory Usage: The program uses two vectors to store the scores after each round, regardless of the number of rounds. This could lead to an unnecessary increase in memory usage, especially for a large number of rounds.

2. Redundant Computations: The variables a and b are reset to 0 after each round. This is not necessary if we print the scores immediately after each round, instead of storing them for later.

3. User Input: The program continuously reads user input without any restriction or validation. This could lead to an infinite loop if the user never inputs a zero.

Here is the optimization strategy:

1. Memory Usage: Instead of storing all the scores in vectors, we can print the score for each round immediately after it's calculated. This will drastically reduce memory usage.

2. Redundant Computations: By printing the scores immediately, we can avoid resetting the variables a and b after each round.

3. User Input: To avoid an infinite loop, we can limit the number of rounds or add a mechanism to stop the program after a certain time without user input.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a = 0;
  int b = 0;
  int game_a, game_b;
  int n;
  while (1) {
    std::cin >> n;
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    else {
      for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cin >> game_a >> game_b;
        if (game_a == game_b) {
          a += game_a;
          b += game_b;
        } else if (game_a > game_b)
          a += game_a + game_b;
        else
          b += game_a + game_b;
        
        // Print the scores immediately after each round
        std::cout << a << " " << b << std::endl;
      }

      // Reset scores
      a = 0;
      b = 0;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the code has the same output as the original one but uses less memory and avoids redundant computations. The trade-off is that it prints the scores after each round, which might not be desirable in certain situations (for example, if the scores should only be displayed at the end of the game). However, this trade-off is justified by the significant improvement in memory usage and performance.
