**1. Code Analysis:**

The given code is a simple game scoring program where two players (a & b) play a series of games (n) and their scores are captured. If both players score the same, each player's score is added to their total. If one player scores more than the other, the total score (game_a + game_b) is added to the player with the higher score. The total score for each player is stored in a vector (veca for player a and vecb for player b) after each round.

The while loop runs indefinitely until it encounters an input of 0 for the number of games, which breaks the loop.

Performance bottlenecks in the code:
- Input operation (std::cin) is a blocking operation and can slow down the execution.
- The repeated use of std::vector::push_back, which can potentially trigger multiple reallocations and copying of the entire array.
- The final loop to print the scores is traversing the entire vector again.

**2. Optimization Strategy:**

A. Use faster I/O operations.
B. Use reserve function to preallocate memory for vectors to avoid reallocations.
C. Combine the score calculation and printing into one loop to avoid traversing the vectors multiple times.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

A. Faster I/O Operations:
    The std::cin and std::cout operations are slower compared to other I/O operations. We can use std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), std::cin.tie(NULL) and '\n' instead of std::endl for faster I/O operations.

B. Preallocate Memory for Vectors:
    The std::vector::push_back function can potentially trigger a reallocation and copying of the entire array each time it is called. By using the reserve function, we can preallocate memory for the vectors, reducing the number of reallocations and copying operations needed.

C. Combine Calculation and Printing:
    Instead of storing the scores in vectors and printing them in a separate loop, we can print the scores immediately after calculating them. This will avoid the need to store the scores and traverse the vectors again.

**4. Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  std::cin.tie(NULL); 
  int n;
  int game_a, game_b;
  while (1) {
    std::cin >> n;
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    else {
      int a = 0, b = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cin >> game_a >> game_b;
        if (game_a == game_b) {
          a += game_a;
          b += game_b;
        } else if (game_a > game_b)
          a += game_a + game_b;
        else
          b += game_a + game_b;
      }
      std::cout << a << " " << b << '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version, we have eliminated the usage of vectors and combined the calculation and printing steps. This not only reduces the memory usage but also the running time of the program.
