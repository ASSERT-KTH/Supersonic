First, let's analyze the code.

This C++ program seems to simulate a series of games between two players (A and B). The scores for each game are input through the standard input (std::cin). If the scores are equal, both players get their own scores added to their total score. If one player's score is higher, that player gets the sum of both scores. The total scores for all games in a series are stored in two vectors (veca and vecb). The program stops taking input when 0 is entered. Finally, the total scores for each series are printed.

Potential performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usage are:

1. The use of std::vector for storing the scores: std::vector is a dynamic array. It provides flexibility but at the cost of performance. It incurs overhead both in terms of memory (it needs to allocate more memory than required to accommodate future elements) and time (insertion of new elements can lead to reallocation and copying of the entire array).

2. The use of an infinite while loop: It can be replaced with a do-while loop that will run at least once, eliminating the need for the initial check.

3. The repeated addition and assignment operations: These operations can be replaced with a single combined operation (addition assignment), which is generally faster.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace std::vector with std::list. std::list is a doubly-linked list that provides fast insertions and does not require reallocation. This change will reduce memory overhead and make insertions faster.

2. Replace the while loop with a do-while loop. This will eliminate the need for the initial check and make the loop termination condition clearer.

3. Use addition assignment (+=) instead of separate addition and assignment operations.

Optimized Code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <list>

int main() {
  int n;
  int a = 0;
  int b = 0;
  int game_a, game_b;
  std::list<int> list_a, list_b;

  do {
    std::cin >> n;
    if (n == 0)
      break;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      std::cin >> game_a >> game_b;
      if (game_a == game_b) {
        a += game_a;
        b += game_b;
      } else if (game_a > game_b)
        a += game_a + game_b;
      else
        b += game_a + game_b;
    }
    list_a.push_back(a);
    list_b.push_back(b);
    a = 0;
    b = 0;
  } while (n != 0);

  auto iter_a = list_a.begin();
  auto iter_b = list_b.begin();

  for (; iter_a != list_a.end() && iter_b != list_b.end(); ++iter_a, ++iter_b) {
    std::cout << *iter_a << " " << *iter_b << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the code keeps the same functionality while improving the time and memory efficiency. The use of std::list instead of std::vector reduces memory overhead and makes insertions faster. The use of a do-while loop makes the loop termination condition clearer and eliminates the need for the initial check. Finally, the use of addition assignment (+=) combines addition and assignment into one operation, which is generally faster than doing them separately.
