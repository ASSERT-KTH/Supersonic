# Code Analysis:

The given code is a C++ program which reads a series of strings as inputs and increments a counter each time it encounters specific pairs of consecutive strings. The potential performance bottlenecks in this code are:

1. String comparison: The code uses string comparison to increment the counter, `ans`. String comparison can be slow, especially if the strings are long.

2. Unnecessary memory usage: The code uses a lot of macros which are not required and increase the memory footprint of the program.

3. The `cin` and `cout` objects are not synchronized with `stdio`, which may cause unnecessary overhead.

# Optimization Strategy:

1. Use integer representation for string comparison: Instead of comparing strings, we can map each string to an integer and compare integers which is a faster operation.

2. Remove unnecessary macros and typedefs: The code includes several macros and typedefs that are not used. These should be removed to reduce the memory footprint of the program.

3. Add `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` at the start of the `main` function to disable synchronization of `cin` and `cout` with `stdio` for faster I/O operations.

4. Consider using `'\n'` instead of `endl` for new line. `endl` causes a flush operation which can be slower.

# Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Map strings to integers: We map each of the four strings "lu", "ru", "ld", and "rd" to an integer. This way, we can compare integers instead of strings, which is faster.

2. Remove unnecessary macros and typedefs: We remove all the unused macros and typedefs from the code. This reduces the memory footprint of the program.

3. Disable synchronization of `cin` and `cout`: We add `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` at the start of the `main` function to disable synchronization of `cin` and `cout` with `stdio`. This can speed up I/O operations.

4. Use '\n' instead of `endl`: We replace `endl` with `'\n'` for new line, because `endl` causes a flush operation which can be slower.

# Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  unordered_map<string, int> str_to_int = {{"lu", 0}, {"ru", 1}, {"ld", 2}, {"rd", 3}};
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    int ans = 0;
    int now = -1, next;
    string temp;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> temp;
      next = str_to_int[temp];
      if ((now == 0 && next == 1) || (now == 1 && next == 0) ||
          (now == 2 && next == 3) || (now == 3 && next == 2))
        ans++;
      now = next;
    }
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:

1. While this optimized code is faster and uses less memory, it has a slight increase in complexity due to the addition of the `unordered_map` and the conversion of strings to integers.

2. By using '\n' instead of `endl`, we might risk not flushing the output stream as frequently, which could potentially cause issues in some scenarios where immediate flushing is necessary.
