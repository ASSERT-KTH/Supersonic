## Code Analysis
This program reads a series of strings from the standard input and increments a counter each time it encounters a certain pair of strings in sequence. The pairs of strings are (`lu` and `ru`), (`ru` and `lu`), (`ld` and `rd`), and (`rd` and `ld`).

## Optimization Strategy
1. **Loops:** The main loop of this program reads the strings and checks if they form a specific pair. This loop is already efficient and there's not much room for optimization.
2. **String Comparison:** The string comparisons can be optimized. Instead of performing four separate string comparisons for each string pair, we can use a map or a hash table to store the string pairs and their corresponding increment values. This will reduce the number of string comparisons from 4 to 1.
3. **Data Structures:** The string now and next can be combined into one string with a delimiter, this will help us to reduce one string assignment operation inside the loop.
4. **Compiler Optimizations:** We can use the `-O3` compiler flag to enable a wide range of performance optimizations during compilation, including function inlining and loop unrolling.

## Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **Use Map for String Comparison:** 
    * We replace the four separate string comparisons with a check against a map of string pairs. This map is populated before the loop with the pairs of strings that should increment the counter. This way, the loop only needs to perform a single map lookup for each string, which is faster than performing four string comparisons.
    * Trade-offs: This increases the complexity of the code slightly, but it's a worthwhile trade-off for the potential speedup.
2. **Combine `now` and `next` Strings:** 
    * We eliminate the variable `now` and instead append the new string to `next` with a delimiter in between. This reduces the number of string assignments inside the loop.
    * Trade-offs: This makes the code slightly harder to read, but it helps to improve performance by reducing the number of operations inside the loop.
3. **Use `-O3` Compiler Flag:** 
    * When compiling the program, we use the `-O3` compiler flag to enable a range of performance optimizations. This can help to speed up the program significantly, especially for large inputs.
    * Trade-offs: The `-O3` flag can increase the compilation time and make the compiled program larger, but these are usually acceptable trade-offs for the potential speedup.

## Optimized Code Block
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

typedef unordered_map<string, int> umsi;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  umsi valid_pairs;
  valid_pairs["lu,ru"] = 1;
  valid_pairs["ru,lu"] = 1;
  valid_pairs["ld,rd"] = 1;
  valid_pairs["rd,ld"] = 1;
  
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    int ans = 0;
    string next;
    cin >> next;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
      string temp;
      cin >> temp;
      next += ("," + temp);
      if (valid_pairs.find(next) != valid_pairs.end()) {
        ans += valid_pairs[next];
      }
      next = temp;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
To compile the code, use the command: `g++ -O3 -o optimized optimized.cpp`
