Code Analysis:

This is a C++ program that reads a series of strings from the standard input and counts the number of transitions between certain pairs of strings. The pairs of strings that are counted are: "lu" to "ru", "ru" to "lu", "ld" to "rd", and "rd" to "ld". The count is then output to the standard output.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Redundant Computations: The program repeatedly compares the current string to four constant values. We can reduce this to a single operation by converting the strings to an enumeration and using a lookup table to determine whether a transition should be counted.

2. Inefficient Data Structures: The program uses strings to represent the states, which is not efficient. We can use an enumeration instead, which will make comparisons and assignment operations faster.

3. Compiler Optimizations: We can use the `-O3` compiler flag to enable all optimization options in the GCC compiler. This will instruct the compiler to apply various performance optimizations when compiling the program.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Convert Strings to Enumeration: We can define an enumeration with four values: LU, RU, LD, RD. Then, we can create a lookup table that maps strings to their corresponding enumeration values. This will allow us to convert the input strings to their corresponding enumeration values, thus reducing the number of comparisons in the main loop.

2. Use Lookup Table for Transitions: Instead of comparing the current string to four constant values, we can use a 2D array that represents a transition matrix. Each cell in the matrix will indicate whether a transition from one state to another should be counted. This will reduce the number of comparisons in the main loop from four to one.

3. Enable Compiler Optimizations: We can add the `-O3` compiler flag to the build command to enable all optimization options in the GCC compiler.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>

enum State {
  LU,
  RU,
  LD,
  RD,
  INVALID
};

int main() {
  std::map<std::string, State> state_map = {
      {"lu", LU}, {"ru", RU}, {"ld", LD}, {"rd", RD}};
  bool transitions[4][4] = {{0, 1, 0, 0},
                            {1, 0, 0, 0},
                            {0, 0, 0, 1},
                            {0, 0, 1, 0}};
  int n;
  while (std::cin >> n, n) {
    int ans = 0;
    State now = INVALID, next;
    std::string input;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      std::cin >> input;
      next = state_map[input];
      if (now != INVALID && transitions[now][next]) {
        ans++;
      }
      now = next;
    }
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we eliminate the need to compare strings multiple times by replacing the string comparisons with integer comparisons. This significantly improves the performance of the program. The `-O3` compiler flag should be added to the build command when compiling this program.
