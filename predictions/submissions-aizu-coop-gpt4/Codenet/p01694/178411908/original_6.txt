Analysis: 
The given C++ code reads a list of strings from the standard input and counts the number of specific transitions between consecutive strings. The code is written in C++ and does not seem to contain any major performance bottlenecks, but it could be optimized for efficiency.

Optimization Strategy:

1. The inefficient data structure in the given code is the string comparison operation. This operation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the string length. Instead of comparing strings, we could map the strings to integers and compare the integers instead, which would result in a time complexity of O(1).

2. Redundant computations: The code checks each pair of strings separately with four "if" statements. This could be simplified using a map or an array to store the valid transitions, reducing the number of checks to just one.

3. Loops or recursive calls: The given code only contains a single loop, which is necessary to process every string. As such, there is no optimization needed in terms of loops or recursive calls.

4. Compiler optimizations: No specific compiler optimizations are needed for this code. The changes suggested should be enough to optimize the code without the need for compiler hints.

Optimization Steps:

1. Replace the string comparison with integer comparison:

    We can map the strings "lu", "ru", "ld", "rd" to integers 0, 1, 2, 3 respectively. This way, we can replace the costly string comparison operation with a much faster integer comparison operation.

2. Simplify the transition checks:

    We can use an array to store the valid transitions, where the indices of the array represent the current and next states. For example, if the current state is "lu" (0) and the next state is "ru" (1), then we can just check if transitions[0][1] is true.

3. Trade-offs: 

    The main trade-off here is that the code will become slightly more complex due to the use of an array to store the transitions. However, this is a minor increase in complexity and is justified by the significant reduction in time complexity.

Optimized Code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

// Define the valid transitions
bool transitions[4][4] = {{false, true, false, false},
                          {true, false, false, false},
                          {false, false, false, true},
                          {false, false, true, false}};

int main() {
  // Map the strings to integers
  map<string, int> strToInt = {{"lu", 0}, {"ru", 1}, {"ld", 2}, {"rd", 3}};

  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    int ans = 0;
    string nowStr, nextStr;
    int now = -1, next;

    // Process each string
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> nextStr;
      next = strToInt[nextStr];

      // If now != -1, then we have a previous string to compare with
      if (now != -1 && transitions[now][next]) {
        ++ans;
      }

      now = next;
    }

    cout << ans << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
This code should perform significantly better than the original code, especially when the number of strings (n) is large.
