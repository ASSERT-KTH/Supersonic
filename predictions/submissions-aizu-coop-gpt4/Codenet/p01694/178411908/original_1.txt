1. Code Analysis: The code reads a sequence of string inputs and increments a counter each time it detects a specific pattern of two consecutive strings. 

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. The data structures are not inefficient, but using `std::unordered_map` may speed up the pattern comparison.
    2. Instead of having four separate 'if' statements, we can use a map to hold the pairs and check if the next pair exists in the map in one operation.
    3. Optimizing the loops is not applicable here, as the code contains only a single loop that cannot be unrolled or transformed into tail recursion.
    4. Compiler optimizations are not required in this case.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. We will use an `std::unordered_map` to hold the pairs of strings that increment the counter. This will allow us to check for the presence of a pair in one operation, as opposed to the four 'if' statements in the original code.
    2. The trade-off here is a slightly increased memory usage due to the map, versus a potential increase in speed from the faster pair checks.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  unordered_map<string, int> pattern = {
    {"luru", 1},
    {"rulu", 1},
    {"ldrd", 1},
    {"rdld", 1}
  };

  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    int ans = 0;
    string now = "", next;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> next;
      string pair = now + next;
      if (pattern.find(pair) != pattern.end())
        ans++;
      now = next;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Here, we concatenate the previous string (now) and the current string (next) and check if this pair is in the map. If it is, we increment the counter. This replaces the four 'if' statements in the original code, potentially speeding up the execution time.
