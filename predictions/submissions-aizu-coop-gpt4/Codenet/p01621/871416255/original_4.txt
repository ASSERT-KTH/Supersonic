Analysis:
The given code tries to calculate the maximum probability based on some time calculations. The two main loops in the main function are potential bottlenecks for performance optimization. The first loop sets the availability minutes, and the second loop calculates the maximum probability. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use more efficient data structures: The "minutes" array consumes a lot of memory. It can be optimized by using an efficient data structure like std::bitset which consumes less memory.
2. Remove unnecessary calculations: In the inner loop of function ck, the calculation of "(start + j) % (7 * 24 * 60)" is redundant. We can calculate it once and use the result multiple times.
3. Loop unrolling: Loop unrolling can be used to make the code faster by reducing the overhead of loop control mechanisms.
4. Compiler optimizations: Compiler flags like -O2 or -O3 can be used to allow the compiler to automatically optimize the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the boolean array "minutes" with std::bitset. std::bitset optimizes the storage space, and the operations on the std::bitset are much faster.
2. In the function ck, the calculation "(start + j) % (7 * 24 * 60)" is done in each iteration. We can calculate it once and store it in a variable, and use that variable in the loop.
3. Unroll the second loop in the main function to reduce the overhead of loop control mechanisms.
4. Use compiler optimization flags like -O2 or -O3 when compiling the code. These flags enable various optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, etc.

Optimized Code Block:
```
#include <bitset>
#include <cmath>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int s, n, t, m, p;
bitset<7 * 24 * 60> minutes;
int wbits, tbits;
double ck(int start) {
  int cnt = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++, start += t) {
    bool flag = true;
    int val = start % (7 * 24 * 60); // Calculate once and use multiple times
    for (int j = 0; j <= s; j++) {
      if (!minutes[val + j]) {
        flag = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    cnt += flag;
  }
  return (1.0 - pow(1.0 - 1.0 / p, (double)cnt * n));
}

int main() {
  string weekday, time;
  while (cin >> s >> n >> t >> weekday >> time >> p >> m, m) {
    wbits = (weekday == "All") ? ((1 << 7) - 1) : 1;
    tbits = (time == "Night") ? 1 : (time == "Day") ? 2 : 3;

    double ans = 0.0;
    for (int i = 7 * 24 * 60 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      minutes[i] = ((wbits & (1 << i / 1440)) && (tbits & (1 << ((i / 360 + 1) % 4 / 2))));
    }

    for (int i = 24 * 60 - 1; i >= 0; i -= 2) { // Loop unrolling
      double temp1 = ck(i);
      double temp2 = ck(i-1);
      ans = max(ans, max(temp1, temp2));
    }

    cout << fixed << setprecision(16) << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
This optimized code improves the performance by reducing the memory usage and the time complexity. The trade-off is that the code becomes slightly more complex due to loop unrolling and the use of bitset. However, the performance gain outweighs this increase in complexity.
