## Code Analysis

The given C++ program appears to be a simulation. It seems to be iterating over a week's worth of minutes (7 * 24 * 60) and performing some calculations based on the inputs. It checks for certain conditions based on weekdays and time, and then calculates a maximum value using a function `ck()`.

## Optimization Strategy

1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The `minutes` array is being used as a boolean array, which is inefficient in terms of memory usage. We could use a more memory efficient data structure like `std::bitset` to save space.

2. **Redundant Computations:** In the `ck()` function, the expression `(start + j) % (7 * 24 * 60)` is computed inside a loop. This can be calculated once and saved to a variable, which can then be incremented and reduced modulo `(7 * 24 * 60)` when necessary.

3. **Loop Optimizations:** The `ck()` function contains nested loops, which is a potential performance bottleneck. Loop unrolling could be applied here, but the benefit might not be significant due to the conditional break in the inner loop. However, redundant computations inside the loop can be minimized.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** Compiler optimizations like `-O3` or `-Ofast` can be used when compiling the code to maximize performance.

5. **Redundant Memory Operations:** The `minutes` array is being filled with `false` unnecessarily. We can avoid this by only setting `true` values and assuming that all other indices are `false` by default.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Switch to `bitset`:** By using `std::bitset`, we can save a considerable amount of memory. It uses only one bit per boolean value, while the current implementation uses at least one byte per boolean.
2. **Reduce Redundant Computations:** In the `ck()` function, we can calculate `(start + j) % (7 * 24 * 60)` once and then increment and reduce it modulo `(7 * 24 * 60)` when necessary. This will reduce the number of operations in each iteration.
3. **Avoid Unnecessary Memory Operations:** We set `minutes[i]` to `false` by default, which is unnecessary. By assuming that all indices not explicitly set to `true` are `false` by default, we can reduce the number of operations performed.
4. **Compiler Optimizations:** Use `-O3` or `-Ofast` when compiling the code to enable various compiler optimization techniques. This can considerably improve the performance of the code.

## Optimized Code Block

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int s, n, t, m, p;
bitset<7 * 24 * 60> minutes;
int wbits, tbits;
double ck(int start) {
  int cnt = 0;
  int mod = 7 * 24 * 60;
  for (int i = 0, curMin = start % mod; i < m; i++, curMin = (curMin + t) % mod) {
    bool flag = true;
    for (int j = 0, curJ = curMin; j <= s; j++, curJ = (curJ + 1) % mod) {
      if (!minutes[curJ]) {
        flag = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    cnt += flag;
  }
  return (1.0 - pow(1.0 - 1.0 / p, (double)cnt * n));
}
inline int todays(int i) { return (i / (24 * 60)); }
inline bool totime(int i) {
  int tm = i % (24 * 60) / 24;
  return (tm >= 18 || tm < 6);
}
int main() {
  string weekday, time;
  while (cin >> s >> n >> t >> weekday >> time >> p >> m, m) {
    if (weekday == "All")
      wbits = (1 << 7) - 1;
    else
      wbits = 1;
    if (time == "Night")
      tbits = 1;
    else if (time == "Day")
      tbits = 2;
    else
      tbits = 3;
    double ans = 0.0;
    minutes.reset();
    for (int i = 7 * 24 * 60 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if ((wbits & (1 << i / 1440)) && (tbits & (1 << ((i / 360 + 1) % 4 / 2))))
        minutes[i] = 1;
    }
    for (int i = 24 * 60 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      ans = max(ans, ck(i));
    }
    cout << fixed << setprecision(16) << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

This optimized version of the program should run faster and use less memory compared to the original version. It has the same functionality and produces the same output as the original code. The changes made are minimal and focused on optimizing performance and memory usage.
