Analysis:

The provided C++ program is a time scheduler. It takes several inputs such as a weekday, time, and other parameters, then calculates a maximum value based on these inputs. The program uses a bit manipulation method to organize the weekdays and times. It uses a large boolean array, `minutes[7 * 24 * 60]`, to store the availability of each minute within a week. It uses two for-loops to calculate the maximum value, which can be quite inefficient when the inputs are large.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Data structures: The boolean array `minutes` is initialized to false at the beginning of every loop in the main function. This initialization can be avoided by resetting the `minutes` array only when needed.

2. Redundant computations: The program calculates the `ck` function for each minute of the day. This is unnecessarily repetitive because the `ck` function only depends on the starting time and doesn't change within a day. Therefore, it is sufficient to calculate the `ck` function once per day.

3. Loops: The loop which initializes the `minutes` array can be optimized by using bit manipulation techniques.

4. Compiler optimizations: The `-O3` flag can be used during compilation to enable all optimization options and generate the fastest possible code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. To avoid unnecessary initialization of the `minutes` array, we only reset the `minutes` array when a new input is received. This can be achieved by adding a `memset` call at the start of the input loop in the main function.

2. To avoid redundant computation of the `ck` function, we calculate the `ck` function once per day and store the results in an array. We then use this array to find the maximum value.

3. The initialization of the `minutes` array can be optimized by using bitwise operations. Instead of checking each minute separately, we can calculate the state for each day and time period once and use it for all minutes in that period.

4. Using the `-O3` compiler flag during compilation will enable all compiler optimizations and generate the fastest possible code.

Trade-offs:

The proposed optimizations will increase the complexity of the code. However, the potential performance gain outweighs this downside.

Here's the optimized code block:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int s, n, t, m, p;
bool minutes[7 * 24 * 60];
int wbits, tbits;
double ck_values[7 * 24];

double ck(int start) {
  int cnt = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++, start += t) {
    bool flag = true;
    for (int j = 0; j <= s; j++) {
      if (!minutes[(start + j) % (7 * 24 * 60)]) {
        flag = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    cnt += flag;
  }
  return (1.0 - pow(1.0 - 1.0 / p, (double)cnt * n));
}

int main() {
  string weekday, time;
  while (cin >> s >> n >> t >> weekday >> time >> p >> m, m) {
    memset(minutes, false, sizeof(minutes)); // reset minutes array
    if (weekday == "All")
      wbits = (1 << 7) - 1;
    else
      wbits = 1;
    if (time == "Night")
      tbits = 1;
    else if (time == "Day")
      tbits = 2;
    else
      tbits = 3;
    for (int i = 7 * 24 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      bool state = (wbits & (1 << i / 1440)) && (tbits & (1 << ((i / 360 + 1) % 4 / 2)));
      fill_n(&minutes[i*60], 60, state);
    }
    for (int i = 24 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      ck_values[i] = ck(i*60); // calculate ck once per day
    }
    double ans = *max_element(ck_values, ck_values + 24);
    cout << fixed << setprecision(16) << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

This optimized code should perform significantly faster than the original program while producing the same output.
