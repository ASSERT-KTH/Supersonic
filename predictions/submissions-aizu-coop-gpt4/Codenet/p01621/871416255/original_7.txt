1. Code Analysis:
The given code seems to be a simulation of a system that calculates the probability of an event occurring at certain times of the day and week. The code checks every minute in a week to see if it meets the given conditions. This is a heavy computation and the code can be optimized.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Use of the more efficient data structures: The current code uses an array of boolean values to store whether a certain time is valid or not. Since the array size is fixed and known in advance, we can use a bitset instead of an array. A bitset is more memory-efficient as it uses only one bit per boolean value.
    2. Redundant Computations: The ck function is called for every minute of the day, even though many of these minutes will have the same conditions. We can avoid these redundant computations by caching the results of the ck function.
    3. Loops Optimization: The current code fills the minutes array in a loop that runs from the end of the array to the beginning. We can improve this by filling the array in a single pass from start to end.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Changing the data structure from an array to a bitset: A bitset is more memory-efficient than an array of booleans. This change will reduce the memory usage of the code, improving its performance.
    2. Caching the results of the ck function: The ck function is called for every minute of the day. However, many of these minutes will have the same conditions, and hence the same return value from the ck function. By storing these results in a cache and reusing them, we can avoid redundant computations, improving the performance of the code.
    3. Optimizing the loop that fills the minutes array: The current code fills the minutes array in a loop that runs from the end of the array to the beginning. By filling the array in a single pass from start to end, we can reduce the number of iterations of the loop, improving the performance of the code.

Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int s, n, t, m, p;
bitset<7 * 24 * 60> minutes;
int wbits, tbits;
unordered_map<int, double> cache;

double ck(int start) {
  if (cache.find(start) != cache.end())
    return cache[start];

  int cnt = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++, start += t) {
    bool flag = true;
    for (int j = 0; j <= s; j++) {
      if (!minutes[(start + j) % (7 * 24 * 60)]) {
        flag = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    cnt += flag;
  }
  
  double ans = (1.0 - pow(1.0 - 1.0 / p, (double)cnt * n));
  cache[start] = ans;
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  string weekday, time;
  while (cin >> s >> n >> t >> weekday >> time >> p >> m, m) {
    if (weekday == "All")
      wbits = (1 << 7) - 1;
    else
      wbits = 1;
    if (time == "Night")
      tbits = 1;
    else if (time == "Day")
      tbits = 2;
    else
      tbits = 3;

    for (int i = 0; i < 7 * 24 * 60; i++) {
      if ((wbits & (1 << i / 1440)) && (tbits & (1 << ((i / 360 + 1) % 4 / 2))))
        minutes[i] = true;
      else
        minutes[i] = false;
    }
    
    double ans = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 24 * 60; i++) {
      ans = max(ans, ck(i));
    }
    cout << fixed << setprecision(16) << ans << endl;
    cache.clear();
  }
}
