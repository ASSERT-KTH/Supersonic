**Code Analysis**

The code above is written in C++ and it seems to be a scheduling algorithm. The algorithm is designed to optimize the schedule of an event that lasts a specified "s" minutes, repeated "n" times, with "t" minutes between each event. It tries to find the optimal time to start scheduling these events, taking into consideration the days of the week, the time of day (day or night or both), the probability of each event's success "p", and the total "m" number of days to run the events.

The program uses bitwise operations to store the days of the week and the time of day in binary format. It then iterates through each minute in a week to find the optimal start time that maximizes the chance of success for these events.

**Optimization Strategy**

1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The boolean array "minutes" of size 7*24*60 is used to store available minutes in a week. This data structure is not efficient in term of memory. An alternative could be a bitset which would use less memory.

2. **Redundant Computations:** The function "ck" is called for each minute in a day (1440 times), and within this function, another loop iterates "m" times. This results in redundant computations, as the same value is computed multiple times.

3. **Loops:** The two nested loops in the "ck" function and the loop in the main function can be optimized. 

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** We can use compiler flags like -O3 to optimize the code at compile time. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **Using Bitset Instead of Boolean Array:** The boolean array "minutes" can be replaced with a bitset. Bitsets are more memory-efficient as they use 1 bit per boolean value, unlike boolean arrays, which use at least 1 byte per value.

2. **Avoiding Redundant Computations:** We can avoid redundant computations in the "ck" function by precomputing the number of possible events for each starting minute and storing these values in an array. This way, we only need to compute these values once.

3. **Optimizing Loops:** The loops in the "ck" function and the main function can be optimized by unrolling the inner loop in the "ck" function and by using an iterator instead of an index in the main function.

4. **Using Compiler Optimizations:** Using compiler flags like -O3 can help optimize the code at compile time.

**Trade-offs**

The trade-off of these optimization steps is that the code might become a bit more complex, but the gain in performance and reduced memory usage should outweigh this downside. 

Now let's implement these changes in the code.
