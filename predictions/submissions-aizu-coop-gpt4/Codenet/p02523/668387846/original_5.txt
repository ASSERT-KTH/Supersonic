1. Code Analysis:
The provided code is a simple C++ program that reads in the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers, computes the absolute value of their difference, and prints it out. The code is quite simple and there are no obvious performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usage. However, there is one part of the code that needs to be corrected for proper functionality.

2. Optimization Strategy:
The main issue with the code is not really about performance but about functionality. The `std::complex::real()` and `std::complex::imag()` functions are used incorrectly. These functions are used to get the real and imaginary parts of a complex number respectively. To set the real and imaginary parts, you should use the assignment operator, like so: `P1.real(value);` and `P1.imag(value);`.

3. Step-by-step Explanation:
The only optimization necessary here is to correct the usage of the `real()` and `imag()` functions. We set the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers P1 and P2 correctly. This change improves the functionality of the code, allowing it to correctly compute the absolute value of the difference between two complex numbers.

4. Optimized Code Block:
Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  complex<double> P1, P2;
  double real_part, imag_part;

  cin >> real_part >> imag_part;
  P1.real(real_part);
  P1.imag(imag_part);

  cin >> real_part >> imag_part;
  P2.real(real_part);
  P2.imag(imag_part);

  printf("%.5f\n", abs(P1 - P2));
  return 0;
}
```

Here, we first read in the real and imaginary parts into temporary variables, then use these values to set the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers P1 and P2.
