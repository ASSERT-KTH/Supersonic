Code Analysis: The given code takes input for two complex numbers P1 and P2, and then calculates and prints the absolute difference between these two numbers. It's a simple, straightforward code, and the potential for performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage seems minimal. However, there's one thing we can optimize here: the input operation.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structure: Currently, there are no inefficient data structures in the code.
2. Redundant or Unnecessary Computations: There are no redundant or unnecessary computations in the code.
3. Loop or Recursion Optimization: There are no loops or recursive calls in the code.
4. Compiler Optimizations: There's no specific compiler optimization required for this code.
5. Efficient Input Operation: Reading data into the complex<double> objects P1 and P2 can be optimized. Currently, the code tries to read the data directly into the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers using the .real() and .imag() functions. This approach is not effective, as these functions return the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, but they don't allow you to read the input directly into them. A better approach is to read the real and imaginary parts into temporary variables and then construct the complex numbers using these variables.

Step-by-step Explanation:
1. Efficient Input Operation: First, we'll declare two temporary variables, say a and b, of type double. We'll read the input into these variables. We'll do this twice: once for the real and imaginary parts of P1, and once for the real and imaginary parts of P2. The complex<double> objects P1 and P2 will then be constructed using these temporary variables. This approach is more efficient and more in line with the intended usage of the .real() and .imag() functions.

Trade-offs: The optimized code will be slightly longer (a couple of lines more) than the original code, but the increase in code complexity is negligible.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  double a, b;
  complex<double> P1, P2;
  cin >> a >> b;
  P1 = complex<double>(a, b);
  cin >> a >> b;
  P2 = complex<double>(a, b);
  printf("%.5f\n", abs(P1 - P2));
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, we've added two temporary variables a and b, and we're reading the input into these variables. We're then constructing the complex<double> objects P1 and P2 using these variables.
