The provided code reads in two complex numbers and prints out the absolute value of the difference between them. The code is simple and straightforward, and there is no obvious performance bottleneck or inefficient memory usage in it. However, we can still make a few optimizations:

1. **Optimization Strategy**

   A. **Avoiding namespace std**: It's a good practice to avoid `using namespace std`. This helps prevent naming conflicts, which can lead to bugs that are difficult to track down.

   B. **Using cin and cout instead of a mix with printf**: Mixing cin/cout and scanf/printf can lead to problems because they can have different buffering behaviors. To keep things consistent, it's better to use cin and cout exclusively. 

   C. **Optimizing I/O operations**: The cin and cout operations can be slow, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. We can speed them up by disabling synchronization with the C standard I/O library.

2. **Step-by-Step Explanation**

   A. **Avoiding namespace std**: We will remove the line `using namespace std;` and instead, we will explicitly use the `std::` prefix where necessary. This can prevent potential naming conflicts.

   B. **Using cin and cout instead of a mix with printf**: We will replace the printf function with cout and setprecision function from the iomanip library. It's better to use either cin/cout or scanf/printf consistently rather than mixing them.

   C. **Optimizing I/O operations**: We will add two lines at the beginning of the main function to disable synchronization with the C standard I/O library and to untie cin from cout. This can significantly speed up I/O operations.

3. **Optimized Code Block**

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);
  
  std::complex<double> P1, P2;
  std::cin >> P1.real() >> P1.imag() >> P2.real() >> P2.imag();
  std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(5) << std::abs(P1 - P2) << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code block preserves the functionality and output of the original code while incorporating the optimizations discussed above.
