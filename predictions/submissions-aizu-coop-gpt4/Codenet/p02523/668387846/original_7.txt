1. Code Analysis:
The given C++ code reads two complex numbers from standard input and prints out the absolute difference between them using a printf() function. But there's an issue with the code. The cin statement trying to read the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers is incorrect. The real() and imag() functions of std::complex return the real and imaginary parts of the complex number respectively, they don't provide a way to input these values. This would lead to a compilation error.

2. Optimization Strategy:
The C++ code does not have any performance bottlenecks, and it uses a minimal amount of memory. There's not much room for optimization in terms of performance or memory usage. The main issue here is the incorrect usage of cin with the real() and imag() functions, which needs to be corrected.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
The main step here is to correctly read the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers P1 and P2. This can be done by first reading the real and imaginary parts into temporary variables, and then using these variables to construct the complex numbers.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  double real1, imag1, real2, imag2;  // Declare temporary variables for real and imaginary parts

  // Correctly read the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers
  cin >> real1 >> imag1 >> real2 >> imag2;

  // Construct the complex numbers using the read values
  complex<double> P1(real1, imag1);
  complex<double> P2(real2, imag2);

  // Print the absolute difference between the complex numbers
  printf("%.5f\n", abs(P1 - P2));

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code correctly reads the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers from standard input, and it maintains the original functionality of printing out the absolute difference between the two complex numbers. The changes are minimal and preserve the simplicity of the original code.
