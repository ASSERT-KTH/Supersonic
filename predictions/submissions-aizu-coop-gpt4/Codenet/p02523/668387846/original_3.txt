The code is simple and clean, but there are a few areas where we can optimize:

1. Code Analysis: 
    - The code uses complex numbers, which are much heavier than primitive types such as int or double. 
    - The code uses cin and cout for input and output, which are slower than scanf and printf.
    - The use of 'endl' can be inefficient due to unnecessary flushing of the output buffer.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - Substitute complex numbers with primitive type.
    - Use scanf and printf instead of cin and cout.
    - Avoid using 'endl' and use '\n' instead.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    1. Substitute complex numbers with primitive type:
        - Rationale: Complex numbers are much heavier than primitive types (such as double). In this case, we can simply use two pairs of double to store the real and imaginary parts of P1 and P2, which can save memory and improve performance.
        - Trade-offs: The code may be slightly more complicated, but the performance gain is generally worth it.

    2. Use scanf and printf instead of cin and cout:
        - Rationale: scanf and printf are generally faster than cin and cout. Since the code is input/output bound, using scanf and printf can significantly improve performance.
        - Trade-offs: scanf and printf are slightly harder to use than cin and cout, but they are still manageable.

    3. Avoid using 'endl' and use '\n' instead:
        - Rationale: 'endl' will flush the output buffer every time it's used, which can be very inefficient. Using '\n' instead can improve performance.
        - Trade-offs: None. It's a straightforward optimization.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cmath>
int main() {
  double P1_real, P1_imag, P2_real, P2_imag;
  scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf", &P1_real, &P1_imag, &P2_real, &P2_imag);
  printf("%.5f\n", hypot(P1_real - P2_real, P1_imag - P2_imag));
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we've replaced the two complex numbers with four doubles, replaced cin and cout with scanf and printf, and replaced 'endl' with '\n'. Note that we've used the hypot function from cmath to calculate the distance between P1 and P2, which is faster and more accurate than manually calculating the square root of the sum of the squares.
