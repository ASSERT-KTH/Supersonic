Code Analysis:
1. The program receives two complex numbers as inputs, calculates the distance between them and prints the result.
2. The calculation of the distance between two points is straightforward and does not present a clear opportunity for optimization.
3. The performance of the code is not a concern here; the code is simple and does not involve intensive computation or large data structures.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The code is already efficient and does not need further optimization.
2. However, the code can be made more readable and maintainable by using more descriptive variable names and appropriate comments.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  // Rename P1 and P2 to point1 and point2 for better readability.
  complex<double> point1, point2;

  // Input the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers.
  cin >> point1.real() >> point1.imag() >> point2.real() >> point2.imag();

  // Calculate and print the distance between the two points.
  // The precision of the output is set to 5 decimal places.
  printf("%.5f\n", abs(point1 - point2));

  return 0;
}
```

Please note, it's not recommended to use the `using namespace std;` in the global scope. This can lead to namespace pollution and potential naming conflicts in larger projects. In the given code, since it's a simple one, it doesn't pose much of a problem. However, in a larger project with complex structure, it's better to avoid this. Also, we can replace `printf` with `std::cout` which is more C++ style and provides type safety unlike `printf`. 

Here is a slightly modified version considering these factors:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  // Rename P1 and P2 to point1 and point2 for better readability.
  std::complex<double> point1, point2;

  // Input the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers.
  std::cin >> point1.real() >> point1.imag() >> point2.real() >> point2.imag();

  // Calculate and print the distance between the two points.
  // The precision of the output is set to 5 decimal places.
  std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(5) << abs(point1 - point2) << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code is not necessarily 'optimized' in terms of performance but it is more aligned with C++ coding standards.
