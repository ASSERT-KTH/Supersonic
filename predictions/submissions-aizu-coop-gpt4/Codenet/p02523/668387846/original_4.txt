Analysis:
The given program calculates the distance between two complex numbers P1 and P2. The code itself is quite optimal. However, there are some small improvements that can be made to it.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Read and Write Operations: Reading and writing operations are costly in terms of time. We can use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);` to make input/output operations faster.

2. Use of printf and scanf: The functions printf and scanf are faster than cin and cout. We can use scanf for input and printf for output.

3. Initialization of complex numbers: Instead of reading the real and imaginary parts separately, we can read them together using complex constructor.

Step-by-step Explanation:

1. We will add `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);` at the start of main(). This will make input/output operations faster. This works by unsynchronizing C++ standard streams with their C counterparts, and tying cin to NULL, which helps to speed up cin and cout considerably.

2. We will replace cin and cout with scanf and printf as they are faster for input and output operations. We need to use "%lf" as the format specifier for double in scanf and printf.

3. Instead of reading the real and imaginary parts separately, we can read them together using the complex constructor. This makes the code cleaner and more efficient.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL); 
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  double real1, imag1, real2, imag2;
  scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf", &real1, &imag1, &real2, &imag2);
  
  complex<double> P1(real1, imag1), P2(real2, imag2);
  
  printf("%.5f\n", abs(P1 - P2));
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program will perform faster due to more efficient input/output operations and better initialization of complex numbers.
