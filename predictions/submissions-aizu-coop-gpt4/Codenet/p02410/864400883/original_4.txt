Code Analysis:

The provided C++ code reads two integers 'n' and 'm' from the input, representing the dimensions of a matrix and a vector respectively. It then reads the elements of the matrix and the vector from the input. After that, it computes the dot product of each row of the matrix with the vector and prints the results. 

1. The memory usage of the code is inefficient. It uses two fixed size arrays 'a' and 'b'. The array 'a' uses a large amount of memory regardless of the size of the matrix, while the array 'b' is not necessary at all because its elements can be read directly from the input when they are needed.

2. The computation of the dot product is straightforward and cannot be optimized much. However, the code could be slightly optimized by moving the initialization of the variable 'c' inside the outer loop.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Efficient usage of memory: The fixed size array 'a' can be replaced by a dynamically allocated array that uses only the necessary amount of memory. The array 'b' can be eliminated completely.

2. Reducing unnecessary computations: The initialization of the variable 'c' can be moved inside the outer loop, so it is not executed on every iteration of the inner loop.

3. Loop optimization: The loops are already efficient and cannot be optimized further.

4. Compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations are usually not recommended because they can make the code less portable and more difficult to debug. However, if performance is a critical issue, the following optimizations could be considered:
   - Use compiler optimization flags like -O2 or -O3.
   - Use the 'restrict' keyword to hint the compiler that the matrix and the vector do not overlap in memory.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the fixed size array 'a' by a dynamically allocated array. This reduces the memory usage of the program and makes it possible to handle larger matrices. The trade-off is that dynamic memory allocation is slightly slower than static memory allocation, but this is usually not a significant issue for large matrices.

2. Eliminate the array 'b'. Instead of reading the elements of the vector into an array, read them directly from the input when they are needed. This reduces the memory usage of the program and slightly simplifies the code.

3. Move the initialization of the variable 'c' inside the outer loop. This slightly reduces the number of computations and makes the code more readable.

4. If performance is a critical issue, consider using compiler optimization flags and the 'restrict' keyword. The trade-off is that these optimizations can make the code less portable and more difficult to debug.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    int** a = new int*[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        a[i] = new int[m];
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            cin >> a[i][j];
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int c = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            int y;
            cin >> y;
            c += a[i][j] * y;
        }
        cout << c << endl;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        delete[] a[i];
    }
    delete[] a;

    return 0;
}
```
