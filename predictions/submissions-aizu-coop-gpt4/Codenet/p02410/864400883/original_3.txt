This program reads two inputs, `n` and `m`, from the user. It then reads `n*m` numbers (matrix `a`) and `m` numbers (vector `b`) from the user. The program multiplies each row of the matrix `a` with the vector `b` and outputs the result. 

The current code is already reasonably efficient because it has a time complexity of O(n*m) which is the best we can do for this problem as we have to at least visit each element of the matrix once. However, there are still some minor optimizations we can apply:

1. Code Analysis:
    1. Redundant Variables: The code uses unnecessary variables `x` and `y` for input. We can directly store the input in the matrix and array.
    2. Memory Usage: The size of the matrix `a` and the vector `b` are fixed at 100. Ideally, we should allocate only the memory we need.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Redundant Variables: We will remove `x` and `y` and directly assign the user input to the respective elements in the matrix and array.
    2. Memory Usage: We will use dynamic allocation to only allocate the memory that we need for the matrix and array.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Redundant Variables: By removing `x` and `y` we will reduce the number of operations (assignments) in our program, which will slightly improve the performance of our program.
    2. Memory Usage: By using dynamic allocation, we will reduce the memory footprint of our program, which can be significant when `n` and `m` are much smaller than 100.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  
  cin >> n >> m;

  // dynamically allocate memory for the matrix and vector
  int** a = new int*[n];
  for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    a[i] = new int[m];
  int* b = new int[m];

  int c = 0;

  // read the matrix and vector from the user
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      cin >> a[i][j];
    }
  }
  for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    cin >> b[j];
  }

  // compute and print the result
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      c += a[i][j] * b[j];
    }
    cout << c << endl;
    c = 0;
  }

  // deallocate the memory we allocated earlier
  for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    delete [] a[i];
  delete [] a;
  delete [] b;

  return 0;
}
```

Please note that dynamically allocating memory can lead to memory leaks if not managed properly. Always remember to deallocate any memory you allocate.
