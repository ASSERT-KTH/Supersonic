Code Analysis:

The provided code reads two 2D arrays, performs a matrix multiplication operation, and outputs the result. The main performance bottlenecks in this code are:

1. Use of cin and cout for input/output: cin and cout operations are slower compared to scanf and printf.
2. Inefficient memory utilization: The program uses a 2D array to store the input matrix which is an inefficient use of memory if the matrix is sparse (contains a lot of zeros).

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use scanf and printf: Replace cin and cout operations with scanf and printf to speed up IO operations.
2. Efficient memory usage: If the input matrices are sparse, using a compressed sparse row (CSR) format or a similar sparse matrix representation can save a lot of memory.

Step-by-step Explanation:

1. Replacing cin and cout with scanf and printf: C++ streams (cin, cout) are considerably slower than C-style input/output (scanf, printf). Therefore, replacing them can result in a noticeable performance improvement.
2. Efficient memory usage: In the case of sparse matrices, using a 2D array to store the matrix can lead to a lot of wasted memory. In such cases, using a sparse matrix representation like CSR can save a lot of memory. However, this optimization may not always be beneficial, particularly if the matrix is not sparse. So, considering this, we will not change the data structure in this case.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  int x, y, a[100][100], b[100];
  int c = 0;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      scanf("%d", &x);
      a[i][j] = x;
    }
  }
  for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    scanf("%d", &y);
    b[j] = y;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      c += a[i][j] * b[j];
    }
    printf("%d\n", c);
    c = 0;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version, we have replaced all the cin and cout operations with scanf and printf. This should help to speed up the input/output operations for the program. The functionality and output of the program have been preserved.
