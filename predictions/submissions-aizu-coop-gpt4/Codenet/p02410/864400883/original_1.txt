## Code Analysis:

The provided C++ program is a simple matrix-vector multiplication application which reads two inputs: a matrix `a` of dimensions `n x m` and a vector `b` of dimension `m`. It multiplies each row of the matrix with the vector, resulting in a new vector of dimension `n`. 

The multiplication operation is performed using two nested loops, which is a common approach but it can be a potential performance bottleneck if `n` and `m` are large numbers. 

## Optimization Strategy:

1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The current data structure in use is a two-dimensional static array for the matrix `a`. This is efficient enough for the given context, as the access time for any element is constant. The same applies to the vector `b` which is a one-dimensional static array.

2. **Redundant Computations:** The matrix-vector multiplication operation is performed in a separate double loop after reading all the input. This could be optimized by performing the multiplication for each row immediately after reading it, which would eliminate the need for storing the matrix `a` completely.

3. **Loop Optimization:** The loop for performing the multiplication operation can be optimized by exploiting the properties of the multiplication operation. Specifically, each row of the matrix is multiplied with the vector independently of the other rows, and the multiplication operation is associative. This allows us to perform the multiplication for each row immediately after reading it.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** Compiler flags such as `-O2` or `-O3` can be used to instruct the compiler to perform optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, etc. These could potentially improve the performance of the program.

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Performing multiplication immediately after reading a row:** The multiplication operation for each row can be performed immediately after reading it. This can be achieved by moving the multiplication loop inside the loop that reads the matrix. This would reduce the memory usage of the program as the matrix `a` would no longer need to be stored. The trade-off is that the code complexity would increase slightly due to the additional nesting of loops.

## Optimized Code Block:

The optimized code with the above mentioned optimization is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  int x, y, b[100];
  int c = 0;
  cin >> n >> m;

  // Read vector b
  for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    cin >> y;
    b[j] = y;
  }

  // Read matrix a and perform multiplication immediately
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    c = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      cin >> x;
      c += x * b[j];
    }
    cout << c << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code performs the same operations as the original code but uses less memory by eliminating the need to store the matrix `a`. The complexity of the code is slightly increased due to the additional nesting of loops. However, the overall performance of the program is improved as it requires less memory and performs fewer operations.
