Code Analysis:
This code reads two integer inputs, 'n' and 'm', followed by 'n' rows of 'm' integers each (forming a 2D array), and then 'm' more integers for an array 'b'. It then multiplies each row of the 2D array with the array 'b', and outputs the sum for each row.

There are no major performance bottlenecks in this code given the constraints. However, there are a few areas where we can make improvements:

1. Memory Usage: The 2D array 'a' is a fixed-size array with a size of 100x100. This may be wasteful if 'n' and 'm' are significantly less than 100. 

2. Redundant Computations: There are no redundant computations in the code.

3. Loop Optimization: There are no recursive calls or opportunities for loop unrolling in the code. 

4. Compiler Optimizations: No specific compiler optimizations or pragma directives are used in the code.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Dynamic Memory Allocation: Rather than using a fixed-size 2D array, we can use a dynamically allocated 2D array that only uses as much memory as needed for 'n' and 'm'.

Step-By-Step Explanation:

1. Dynamic Memory Allocation: Currently, the code always allocates a 2D array of size 100x100, which can be a waste of memory if 'n' and 'm' are significantly smaller. By using dynamic memory allocation, we can ensure that the 2D array only uses as much memory as needed. This can reduce memory usage and potentially improve performance by reducing the amount of memory that needs to be accessed.

The trade-off is that dynamic memory allocation can add some complexity to the code, as we need to manually manage memory. However, given the small scale of this program, this should not be a significant concern.

Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    
    int** a = new int*[n];
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        a[i] = new int[m];

    int* b = new int[m];
    int c = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            cin >> a[i][j];
        }
    }
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        cin >> b[j];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            c += a[i][j] * b[j];
        }
        cout << c << endl;
        c = 0;
    }

    // Delete dynamically allocated memory
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        delete [] a[i];
    delete [] a;
    delete [] b;

    return 0;
}
```

The optimized code first reads 'n' and 'm' and then dynamically allocates memory for a 2D array 'a' of size 'n' x 'm' and a 1D array 'b' of size 'm'. The rest of the code remains largely unchanged. At the end of the program, the dynamically allocated memory is deleted to prevent memory leaks. This code should have the same functionality as the original code, but with reduced memory usage when 'n' and 'm' are significantly less than 100.
