**Code Analysis:**
The code is a simple C++ program that performs matrix-vector multiplication. It takes as input the dimensions of the matrix and the matrix and vector elements, performs the multiplication, and outputs the result. The code is simple and direct, but there are a few areas where we can optimize it for better performance.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Inefficient data structures:** The matrix 'a' and vector 'b' are stored in arrays of fixed size [100][100] and [100] respectively. If 'n' and 'm' are smaller than 100, this leads to wasted space. We should use dynamic allocation to ensure that only the necessary space is used.

2. **Redundant computations:** There are no redundant computations in the code. All the computations are necessary for the matrix-vector multiplication.

3. **Loops and recursive calls:** The nested loops for input and multiplication are necessary for the task. However, the reset of 'c' to 0 after each output can be moved to just before the inner loop starts. This avoids the unnecessary reset when the outer loop finishes.

4. **Compiler optimizations:** We can use the 'restrict' keyword to inform the compiler that for every pair of arrays they point to, the arrays do not overlap. This allows the compiler to make certain optimizations because it knows that writing to one array will not affect the other.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Dynamic Allocation:** Replace the fixed size arrays with dynamically allocated ones. This reduces the memory usage when 'n' and 'm' are less than 100.

2. **Loop optimization:** Move the reset of 'c' to just before the inner loop starts. This avoids an unnecessary operation when the outer loop finishes.

3. **Compiler Directive:** Use the 'restrict' keyword to allow the compiler to make certain optimizations.

**Trade-offs:** 

The use of dynamic allocation may increase the complexity of the code slightly, but it is a commonly used feature in C++ and should not pose a problem for most developers. The use of the 'restrict' keyword is a hint to the compiler and does not guarantee optimization, but it generally improves performance without any downsides.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;

  // Dynamic allocation of arrays
  int** a = new int*[n];
  for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      a[i] = new int[m];
  int* b = new int[m];

  int c = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      cin >> a[i][j];
    }
  }
  for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    cin >> b[j];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    c = 0;  // Reset c here
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      c += a[i][j] * b[j];
    }
    cout << c << endl;
  }

  // Free the dynamically allocated memory
  for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    delete [] a[i];
  delete [] a;
  delete [] b;

  return 0;
}
```
