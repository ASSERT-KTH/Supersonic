**Code Analysis**

The given program appears to be performing a matrix-vector multiplication. The matrix is "inact", the vector is "act", and the result is stored in "ans". Here are the potential areas for optimization:

1. Initialization of arrays: Although initializing arrays is necessary, doing it for the entire size of a 100x100 matrix and two 100-element vectors might be inefficient when the actual size used (defined by "row" and "col") is smaller.

2. Loop structures: The program contains multiple nested for-loops which iterate over the arrays. These loops could potentially be optimized.

**Optimization Strategy**

1. Dynamically allocate memory: Instead of statically allocating maximum memory, we can dynamically allocate memory based on user input for "row" and "col". This will save memory when the matrix/vector size is smaller than the maximum size.

2. Use pointer arithmetic: Instead of using array indexing, we can use pointer arithmetic which can be faster.

3. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler flags to optimize the code.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. Dynamically allocate memory: We first ask for the "row" and "col" inputs, then allocate only as much memory as needed. This reduces memory usage, particularly when "row" and "col" are much less than 100. The trade-off is that dynamic allocation is slightly slower than static allocation, but this is generally negligible compared to the memory saved.

2. Use pointer arithmetic: Instead of accessing array elements using brackets (e.g., array[i]), we use pointers to access and iterate through array elements. This can be faster because it reduces the overhead of index computation.

3. Compiler optimizations: By using the -O3 optimization level, the compiler will make several optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining etc., which can significantly speed up the code.

**Optimized Code Block**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int row, col;
  scanf("%d %d", &row, &col);

  // Dynamically allocate memory
  int **inact = (int**) malloc(row * sizeof(int*));
  for(int i = 0; i < row; i++)
    inact[i] = (int*) malloc(col * sizeof(int));
  int *act = (int*) malloc(col * sizeof(int));
  int *ans = (int*) malloc(row * sizeof(int));

  // Use pointer arithmetic for initialization
  for (int *p = ans; p != ans + row; ++p)
    *p = 0;

  // Read input
  for (int i = 0; i < row; i++)
    for (int *p = inact[i]; p != inact[i] + col; ++p)
      scanf("%d", p);
  for (int *p = act; p != act + col; ++p)
    scanf("%d", p);

  // Compute multiplication
  for (int i = 0; i < row; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < col; j++)
      ans[i] += inact[i][j] * act[j];

  // Print results
  for (int *p = ans; p != ans + row; ++p)
    printf("%d\n", *p);

  // Free memory
  for(int i = 0; i < row; i++)
    free(inact[i]);
  free(inact);
  free(act);
  free(ans);

  return 0;
}
```
