1. Code Analysis:

The provided code is a simple C program that performs a matrix-vector multiplication. It initializes two arrays (`inact` and `act`) with input values, multiplies the `inact` matrix with the `act` vector, and stores the results in the `ans` array. The code is largely efficient, but there are a few areas we can optimize.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    1. Redundant Initialization: The code initializes every element of the `inact`, `act`, and `ans` arrays to zero, regardless of the actual required size (`row` and `col`), which is input later on. This is wasteful when `row` and `col` are significantly less than 100.

    2. Memory Usage: The `inact` matrix is declared with a fixed size of 100x100, which can be excessive if the actual number of rows and columns is significantly less. We can use dynamic memory allocation to only allocate as much memory as needed, reducing memory usage.

    3. Compiler Optimizations: Modern compilers can perform a variety of optimizations, such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and more. We can enable these optimizations by providing certain compiler flags.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    1. Redundant Initialization: Instead of initializing all elements of `inact`, `act`, and `ans` to zero, we initialize only those elements that we are going to use later. This can be done by moving the initialization inside the loop where we read the inputs.

    2. Memory Usage: To optimize memory usage, we can use dynamic memory allocation to allocate only as much memory as needed for the `inact` array. We use `malloc` to allocate memory for the `inact` array after we know the exact number of rows and columns.

    3. Compiler Optimizations: We can enable compiler optimizations by adding the `-O3` flag when compiling the program. This flag tells the compiler to perform various optimizations including loop unrolling, function inlining, and more.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h> // Required for dynamic memory allocation

int main() {
  int **inact; // Declare as double pointer
  int act[100];
  int ans[100];
  int row, col;
  int i, j;

  scanf("%d %d", &row, &col);

  // Dynamic memory allocation for 'inact'
  inact = (int **)malloc(row * sizeof(int *));
  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    inact[i] = (int *)malloc(col * sizeof(int));
  }

  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      scanf("%d", &inact[i][j]);
    }
    ans[i] = 0; // Initialize 'ans'
  }

  for (i = 0; i < col; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &act[i]);
    act[i] = 0; // Initialize 'act'
  }

  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      ans[i] += inact[i][j] * act[j];
    }
  }

  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", ans[i]);
  }

  // Free dynamically allocated memory
  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    free(inact[i]);
  }
  free(inact);

  return 0;
}
```

To compile the code with optimizations, use the following command:

`gcc -O3 -o program program.c`
