**Code Analysis:**

The provided code performs a matrix-vector multiplication. The 2D array 'inact' represents the matrix, 'act' is the vector, and 'ans' stores the result of the multiplication. The code initializes and inputs values for the matrix and the vector, performs the multiplication, and prints the result.

The code looks clean and well-structured, but there are a few areas where performance can be improved:

1. The initialization of 'inact', 'act', and 'ans' arrays are done in a loop which runs 100 times, regardless of the actual size of the arrays.

2. The initialization for 'inact' array is done for all cells, even if the matrix is not fully filled (if row < 100 or col < 100).

3. The code lacks compiler optimizations which could greatly improve performance.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. Optimize Initialization: Instead of initializing the arrays in a loop, memset can be used to initialize the arrays to 0. This will be faster and more efficient.

2. Delayed Initialization: Delay the initialization of the 'inact' array until the actual size of the matrix is known (after reading 'row' and 'col'). This way, only the required cells are initialized, saving time and memory.

3. Compiler Optimizations: Use gcc compiler flags, such as -O3, to enable various compiler optimizations including loop unrolling, function inlining, etc.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Optimize Initialization: Instead of using a loop to initialize the arrays, use memset to initialize all elements of the arrays to 0. This is faster and more efficient because memset is usually implemented in assembly, and can take advantage of specific processor instructions that can set large blocks of memory very quickly.

2. Delayed Initialization: Instead of initializing all cells of 'inact' array, delay the initialization until the actual size of the matrix is known. This way, only the cells that are needed are initialized, which saves both time and memory.

3. Compiler Optimizations: Enable compiler optimizations by using the -O3 flag when compiling the program. This flag enables all optimization options, including loop unrolling and function inlining, which can significantly improve the performance of the program.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  int inact[100][100];
  int act[100];
  int ans[100];
  int row, col;

  // Use memset to initialize the arrays 'act' and 'ans' to 0
  memset(act, 0, sizeof(act));
  memset(ans, 0, sizeof(ans));

  scanf("%d %d", &row, &col);

  // Initialize only the required cells of the 'inact' array
  for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      inact[i][j] = 0;
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      scanf("%d", &inact[i][j]);
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < col; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &act[i]);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      ans[i] += inact[i][j] * act[j];
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", ans[i]);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Compile this program using -O3 flag for optimizations:
```
gcc -O3 -o prog prog.c
```

While the optimizations in the code itself are minimal, the use of compiler optimizations can lead to significant improvements in performance.
