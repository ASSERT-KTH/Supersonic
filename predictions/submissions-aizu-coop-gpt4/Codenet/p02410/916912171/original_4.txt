**Code Analysis:**

This program performs matrix-vector multiplication. From the code, it appears that the matrix and vector sizes are dynamic (input by the user), but are assumed to be at most 100. The following are the major steps involved in the program:

1. Initialize two 1D arrays `act` and `ans` and a 2D array `inact` to zero.
2. Read in the dimensions of the matrix (rows and columns).
3. Read in the elements of the matrix `inact`.
4. Read in the elements of the vector `act`.
5. Perform matrix-vector multiplication to calculate `ans`.
6. Print the result vector `ans`.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Memory Usage:** Currently, the program always allocates memory for 100x100 elements for the matrix and 100 elements for the vectors, even if the actual size is much smaller. This can waste a significant amount of memory if the actual size is much smaller than 100. To fix this, we can dynamically allocate memory based on the actual size.

2. **Unnecessary Initialization:** The program initializes `inact`, `act`, and `ans` to zero at the start even though their actual values are read from user input later. This is unnecessary and can be removed.

3. **Compiler Optimizations:** We can use compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` when compiling the program.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Memory Usage:**
    - Declare pointers for `inact`, `act`, and `ans`.
    - After reading the dimensions, dynamically allocate memory for `inact`, `act`, and `ans` based on the actual size.

2. **Unnecessary Initialization:**
    - Remove the initialization of `inact`, `act`, and `ans` to zero at the start. Since we read their actual values from user input later, this initialization is unnecessary.

3. **Compiler Optimizations:**
    - When compiling the program, use the `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flags. These flags enable various optimizations that can significantly speed up the program, such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and dead code elimination.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int **inact;
  int *act, *ans;
  int row, col;
  int i, j;

  scanf("%d %d", &row, &col);

  // Allocate memory based on actual size
  inact = (int **)malloc(row * sizeof(int *));
  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    inact[i] = (int *)malloc(col * sizeof(int));
  }
  act = (int *)malloc(col * sizeof(int));
  ans = (int *)malloc(row * sizeof(int));

  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      scanf("%d", &inact[i][j]);
    }
  }
  for (i = 0; i < col; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &act[i]);
  }
  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    ans[i] = 0;  // Initialize ans[i] to zero before summing
    for (j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      ans[i] += inact[i][j] * act[j];
    }
  }
  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", ans[i]);
  }

  // Free the allocated memory
  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    free(inact[i]);
  }
  free(inact);
  free(act);
  free(ans);

  return 0;
}
```

**Note:** This optimized code should be compiled with `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flags for best performance.
