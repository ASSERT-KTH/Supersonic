This C program appears to be performing a matrix-vector multiplication. The inact array is a 2-dimensional matrix, and the act array is a vector. The multiplication results are stored in the ans array. The code then prints the result.

The code seems to be well-structured and doesn't have any obvious performance bottlenecks or excessive memory usage. However, there are a few optimizations that can be made to improve performance:

1. Initialization of Arrays: The program initializes the entire 2D array inact and 1D arrays act, and ans to 0. However, the actual inputs may not fill up the entire array. This results in unnecessary operations. Instead of initializing the whole array, we can initialize only the parts that are about to receive inputs.

2. Unnecessary Multiplication: The program multiplies inact[i][j] with act[j] for each i. If act[j] is 0, this multiplication is not necessary. Adding a check for this can save unnecessary multiplications.

3. I/O Calls Optimization: The standard input/output functions (printf and scanf) are quite slow. The performance can be significantly improved by reducing the number of these operations. We can use a character buffer to store the result and print it once at the end instead of printing each result in a separate printf call.

4. Compiler Optimization: We can use compiler optimizations to improve the performance. For gcc, we can use the -O2 or -O3 optimization flags.

Now, let's implement these optimizations:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int inact[100][100];
  int act[100];
  int ans[100];
  int row, col;
  int i, j;
  char buffer[400]; // Buffer to store the results
  scanf("%d %d", &row, &col);
  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    ans[i] = 0; // Initialize ans[i] before it is used
    for (j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      scanf("%d", &inact[i][j]);
    }
  }
  for (i = 0; i < col; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &act[i]);
    if (act[i] == 0) continue; // Skip if act[i] is 0
    for (j = 0; j < row; j++) {
      ans[j] += inact[j][i] * act[i];
    }
  }
  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    int len = sprintf(buffer + strlen(buffer), "%d\n", ans[i]); // Append ans[i] to buffer
  }
  printf("%s", buffer); // Print the results in one go
  return 0;
}
```

Compile the C program with optimization flags:

```
gcc -O2 program.c -o program
```

This optimized code should run faster than the original, especially for large inputs. It also uses slightly less memory by avoiding unnecessary initialization. However, it's a little bit more complex due to the additional checks and buffer handling.
