Code Analysis:

1. The program reads a matrix 'inact' of size 'row x col' and a vector 'act' of size 'col'. It then multiplies each row of the matrix with the vector to get the result in 'ans'.

2. The initialization of arrays 'inact', 'act', and 'ans' to zero is done using nested loops. For 'inact', this results in a time complexity of O(N^2), where N is the size of the array. This is a potential bottleneck as it takes a significant amount of time when N is large.

3. The matrix-vector multiplication also involves nested loops, resulting in a time complexity of O(N^2). However, this cannot be optimized further as it is inherent to the problem. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Instead of initializing the arrays 'inact', 'act', and 'ans' to zero through separate nested loops, we can use the memset function from the C standard library. This function sets a block of memory to a specified value and can initialize the arrays in O(1) time complexity.

2. The 'col' loop inside the matrix-vector multiplication can be unrolled to a certain extent. Loop unrolling increases the amount of code but can result in faster execution times by reducing the number of loop control instructions (e.g., incrementing the counter, checking the loop condition), thus reducing the time spent on CPU branch prediction.

3. Compiler optimizations can be used to further improve the performance. The flag -O3 can be used with the gcc compiler which enables all -O2 optimizations and additionally performs inline function expansion for functions.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Use memset to initialize arrays: The memset function takes three arguments: the pointer to the block of memory to set, the value to set, and the number of bytes to set. It is a more efficient way to initialize arrays as it involves fewer instructions and can be done in constant time.

2. Loop unrolling: In the matrix-vector multiplication, the loop iterating over 'col' can be unrolled by a factor of 4. This means that instead of performing the operation for one column at a time, we perform it for four columns. This reduces the number of loop control instructions and can thus improve performance. However, this will only work when 'col' is a multiple of 4.

3. Compiler optimization: Use the -O3 flag when compiling the program. This enables a number of optimizations that can improve performance, such as function inlining, loop unrolling, and vectorization.

Optimized Code Block:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
  int inact[100][100];
  int act[100];
  int ans[100];
  int row, col;
  int i, j;

  // Initialize arrays using memset
  memset(inact, 0, sizeof(inact));
  memset(act, 0, sizeof(act));
  memset(ans, 0, sizeof(ans));

  scanf("%d %d", &row, &col);
  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      scanf("%d", &inact[i][j]);
    }
  }
  for (i = 0; i < col; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &act[i]);
  }
  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    // Unroll the 'col' loop by a factor of 4
    for (j = 0; j < col; j+=4) {
      ans[i] += inact[i][j] * act[j];
      ans[i] += inact[i][j+1] * act[j+1];
      ans[i] += inact[i][j+2] * act[j+2];
      ans[i] += inact[i][j+3] * act[j+3];
    }
    // If 'col' is not a multiple of 4, perform the operation for the remaining columns
    for (; j < col; j++) {
      ans[i] += inact[i][j] * act[j];
    }
  }
  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", ans[i]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
When compiling this code, use the -O3 flag to enable compiler optimizations:
```
gcc -O3 program.c
```
