Code Analysis:

The given code is a simple C program that reads four integers from the user in an infinite loop until the first integer is 0. If the first number is not 0, it prints a sequence of '(' characters and then prints the four numbers separated by '+'. There are several areas that can be optimized here:

1. The loop that prints the '(' character performs the putchar operation 110,000 times, which is quite inefficient. Each putchar operation involves a call to the underlying system function to write the character to stdout, which is time-consuming.

2. The usage of scanf for reading integers may not be the most efficient. The scanf function has significant overhead and can be replaced with a faster function if performance is the primary concern.

3. The program uses a fixed-size array to store the input numbers, which is not inefficient in this case, but it could be optimized if the number of inputs was variable or extremely large.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Instead of calling putchar 110,000 times, we can create a buffer filled with the required number of '(' characters and print it all at once.

2. We can replace scanf with a more efficient function for reading integers, such as fgets combined with sscanf.

3. Though not exactly necessary for this case, we could replace the fixed-size array with a dynamic array for storing the input numbers if we were dealing with a variable number of inputs or extremely large inputs.

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define NUM_CHARS 110000

int main() {
  char buffer[NUM_CHARS + 1];
  memset(buffer, '(', NUM_CHARS);
  buffer[NUM_CHARS] = '\0';  // Null-terminate the string

  int a[4];
  char input[50];

  while (1) {
    fgets(input, 50, stdin);
    sscanf(input, "%d%d%d%d", &a[0], &a[1], &a[2], &a[3]);

    if (a[0] == 0) {
       break;
    }

    printf("%s", buffer);
    printf("%d+%d+%d+%d", a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);
    putchar('\n');
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. We've replaced the loop that calls putchar 110,000 times with a buffer that contains 110,000 '(' characters. Printing this buffer all at once is much more efficient than making 110,000 separate calls to putchar. The trade-off here is that this change uses more memory to store the buffer.

2. The scanf function has been replaced with fgets and sscanf. fgets reads the entire line of input at once, and sscanf then parses the integers from this input. This combination tends to be faster than scanf. The trade-off here is a slight increase in code complexity.

3. A fixed-size array is retained as it's efficient for this specific case. In case of variable or large inputs, one could consider using dynamic arrays (malloc, realloc) which would increase code complexity and management but provides flexibility.
