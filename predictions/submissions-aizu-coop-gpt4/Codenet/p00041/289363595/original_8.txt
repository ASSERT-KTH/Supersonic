**Code Analysis:**

The given code is a simple C program that reads four integers from the standard input in every loop iteration until the first integer read is zero. After reading the integers, it prints 110000 opening parentheses, followed by the sum of the four integers, and then a newline.

**Potential Performance Bottlenecks:**

1. The program prints 110000 opening parentheses in a loop using `putchar`, which is a function for outputting a single character. This is inefficient because it involves 110000 function calls, each of which writes a single character to the output.

2. The program reads four integers in every loop iteration, even if the first integer is zero, and the loop should terminate. This is an unnecessary operation if the first integer is zero.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. Instead of calling `putchar` 110000 times, we could use `printf` to print all the opening parentheses at once. This would reduce the number of function calls and potentially improve the performance.

2. We could break the loop immediately after reading the first integer if it's zero. This would avoid unnecessary `scanf` calls.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Replace the `putchar` loop with a `printf` call. `printf` can print a repeated character using a format specifier. The format specifier for a repeated character is `%.*s`, where `*` denotes the number of repetitions.

   Trade-off: This will increase the memory usage because we need to allocate a string for the repeated character. However, this is a reasonable trade-off given the performance gain from reducing the number of function calls.

2. Break the loop immediately after reading the first integer if it's zero. This will avoid unnecessary `scanf` calls.

   Trade-off: This will slightly complicate the code because we need to handle the first integer separately from the rest. However, this is a minor increase in complexity, and the performance gain is significant.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a[4];
  char parentheses[110001];  // An array to hold the parentheses
  
  // Initialize the parentheses array
  for (int i = 0; i < 110000; ++i)
      parentheses[i] = '(';
  parentheses[110000] = '\0';  // Null-terminate the string

  while (1) {
    // Read the first integer
    scanf("%d", &a[0]);
    if (a[0] == 0) {
      break;
    }

    // Read the remaining integers
    for (int i = 1; i < 4; ++i) {
      scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    }

    // Print the parentheses and the sum
    printf("%s%d+%d+%d+%d\n", parentheses, a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);
  }
}
```
The optimized code has the same output as the original code but should run faster and use memory more efficiently.
