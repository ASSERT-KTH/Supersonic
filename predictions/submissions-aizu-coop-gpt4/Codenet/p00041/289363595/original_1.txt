1. Code Analysis:
The code reads four integers from the standard input indefinitely until the first integer is zero. After reading each set of four integers, it prints 110000 '(' characters, followed by the four integers separated by '+' characters. It uses an array of four integers 'a' to store the inputs temporarily.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. Avoid unnecessary I/O Operations: The code prints 110000 '(' characters in a loop. This is a heavy I/O operation which can be optimized.
   2. Use of efficient I/O methods: 'scanf' and 'printf' are slower compared to other I/O methods available in C. The code can benefit from using faster I/O methods.
   3. Minimize the use of system calls: Each call to 'putchar' is a system call which is expensive. It's better to reduce the number of system calls.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Avoid unnecessary I/O Operations: Instead of printing '(' character 110000 times in a loop, we can create a string with 110000 '(' characters and print it once. This reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(1).
   2. Use of efficient I/O methods: 'scanf' and 'printf' are slower because they have to parse the format string. We can use 'getchar' and 'putchar' for faster I/O.
   3. Minimize the use of system calls: Instead of calling 'putchar' for each character, we can print the whole string in one go using 'fputs'.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  int a[4];
  char buffer[110001];

  memset(buffer, '(', 110000);  // Fill buffer with '('
  buffer[110000] = '\0';  // Null-terminate the buffer

  while (1) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
      scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    }
    if (a[0] == 0) {
      break;
    }

    fputs(buffer, stdout);  // Print 110000 '(' characters
    printf("%d+%d+%d+%d\n", a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);
  }
}
```

Trade-offs: The optimized code uses an additional buffer of size 110001 bytes. However, this trade-off is acceptable because the memory usage is still constant and does not depend on the input size. The performance gain from reducing the number of I/O operations and system calls significantly outweighs the minor increase in memory usage.
