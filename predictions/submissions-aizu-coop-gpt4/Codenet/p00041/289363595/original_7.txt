## Code Analysis
The given C program reads four integers at a time until it encounters a zero as the first integer. For each set of integers, it prints 110000 left parentheses followed by the four integers separated by plus signs. 

## Optimization Strategy
1. **Compiler Optimizations**: Enable compiler optimizations, such as `-O2` or `-O3`, which can make a significant difference in the runtime of the program without modifying the code.

2. **I/O Operations**: I/O operations, including `printf` and `putchar`, are generally slow. Optimizing them can considerably enhance the performance of the program.

3. **Memory Usage**: The array `a` is not being used efficiently; it is read, then tested for a break condition, and then used for output. This can be improved by handling the break condition immediately after reading the input.

## Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **Compiler Optimizations**: To use compiler optimizations, simply compile the program with the `-O2` or `-O3` flags. These flags enable a variety of optimizations that can improve the performance of the program.

2. **Optimize I/O Operations**: Instead of using `putchar` in a loop to print the parentheses, we can create a string of 110000 parentheses and print it once using `printf`. This can be done at the start of the program, as this string is constant and reused in every loop iteration.

3. **Memory Usage**: To optimize memory usage, we can break the loop immediately after detecting a zero in the first element of the array. This way, we avoid the unnecessary iterations through the remaining elements of the array.

## Trade-offs
The optimization of I/O operations increases the memory usage slightly because a string of 110000 parentheses is created. However, the improvement in the program's performance is significant enough to justify this small increase in memory usage.

## Optimized Code Block

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  int a[4];
  char parens[110001];
  memset(parens, '(', 110000);
  parens[110000] = '\0';

  while (1) {
    scanf("%d", &a[0]);
    if (a[0] == 0) {
      break;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i < 4; ++i) {
      scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    }
    printf("%s%d+%d+%d+%d\n", parens, a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we create a string `parens` with 110000 parentheses at the start of the program. We break the loop immediately if the first integer is zero. Finally, we use `printf` to print the parentheses and the four integers together.
