Code Analysis:

This C++ code reads a line defined by two points and then reads a set of points. For each point, it computes the projection of the point on the line and prints the coordinates of the projected point.

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The data structures used in this code are quite efficient. The complex data type is a good choice for representing points in 2D space, as it provides an elegant way to manipulate coordinates.

2. Redundant Computations: The line equation is constant for all points, but the program calculates the projection for each point independently. This could be optimized.

3. Loops or Recursive Calls: There is a loop to iterate through each query point, but it seems necessary. However, the projection computation inside the loop could be optimized.

4. Compiler Optimizations: This code doesn't seem to have any compiler-specific optimizations.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Precompute Part of the Projection: The direction vector of the line (L.p2 - L.p1) is constant for all points. We can calculate this outside of the loop to avoid redundant computations.

2. Use Fast I/O: The code already uses cin.tie(0) and ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0), which are common techniques to speed up I/O operations in C++. However, we can use printf and scanf instead of cin and cout for faster I/O.

3. Avoid Complex Numbers: Complex numbers in C++ add some overhead to the computation. Since we are only dealing with 2D points, we can use a simple struct to represent a point and manually implement the necessary operations.

4. Avoid using "bits/stdc++.h": This header file includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which can slow down the compile time. Including only the necessary libraries can speed up the compilation.

Optimized Code Block:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

struct Point {
    double x, y;
};

struct Line {
    Point p1, p2;
};

Point operator-(const Point& a, const Point& b) {
    return {a.x - b.x, a.y - b.y};
}

Point operator+(const Point& a, const Point& b) {
    return {a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y};
}

Point operator*(const Point& a, double b) {
    return {a.x * b, a.y * b};
}

double dot(const Point& a, const Point& b) {
    return a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.precision(15);

    Line L;
    cin >> L.p1.x >> L.p1.y >> L.p2.x >> L.p2.y;

    Point lineVec = L.p2 - L.p1;

    int Q;
    cin >> Q;
    while (Q--) {
        Point p;
        cin >> p.x >> p.y;

        double t = dot(p - L.p1, lineVec) / dot(lineVec, lineVec);
        Point w = L.p1 + lineVec * t;

        cout << w.x << " " << w.y << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, the projection calculation is simplified by precomputing the direction vector of the line. Also, the complex data type is replaced with a simple struct, and the necessary operations are implemented manually. This can reduce the overhead of the complex data type and make the code more readable. The usage of "bits/stdc++.h" is also avoided to speed up the compilation.
