After analyzing the provided code, I found that it is already well-optimized, but there are few minor improvements that can be made:

1. **Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`**: This header file includes most of the standard C++ libraries and is quite heavy. It's better to include only the necessary libraries. This will reduce compilation time and memory usage.

2. **Avoid using `using namespace std;`**: This can cause namespace pollution and may lead to name conflicts, which could be a performance issue in a large codebase. It's better to use `std::` prefix before each standard library object.

3. **Avoid using `std::endl;` for newlines**: `std::endl` performs a newline and also a flush operation, which can be expensive. It's better to use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl`.

4. **Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`**: This can speed up I/O operations by decoupling C and C++ standard streams. However, it should be noted that C-style I/O (`printf`, `scanf`, etc.) and C++-style I/O (`cin`, `cout`, etc.) should not be mixed after calling this function.

5. **Input Optimization**: If the program is I/O bound, we can replace the use of `cin` with direct system calls for faster input.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>
#include <vector>
#include <iomanip>

struct CWW {
  CWW() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(0);
    std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(15);
  }
} STAR;

using D = double;
const D EPS = 1e-8;
const D INF = 1e9;
using Point = std::complex<D>;

struct Segment {
  Point p1, p2;
  Segment(const Point &p1 = Point(), const Point &p2 = Point())
      : p1(p1), p2(p2) {}
};

struct Line {
  Point p1, p2;
  Line(const Point &p1 = Point(), const Point &p2 = Point()) : p1(p1), p2(p2) {}
};

struct Circle {
  Point c;
  D r;
  Circle(const Point &c = Point(), const D &r = 0.0) : c(c), r(r) {}
};

using Polygon = std::vector<Point>;

std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &is, Point &a) {
  D x, y;
  is >> x >> y;
  a = Point(x, y);
  return is;
}

std::ostream &operator<<(std::ostream &os, Point &a) {
  os << real(a) << " " << imag(a);
  return os;
}

std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &is, Line &l) {
  Point p1, p2;
  is >> p1 >> p2;
  l = Line(p1, p2);
  return is;
}

D dot(const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  return real(a) * real(b) + imag(a) * imag(b);
}

D cross(const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  return real(a) * imag(b) - imag(a) * real(b);
}

Point projection(const Point &a, const Point &b) { return a * real(b / a); }

int main() {
  Line L;
  std::cin >> L;
  int Q;
  std::cin >> Q;
  while (Q--) {
    Point p;
    std::cin >> p;
    Point w = L.p1 + projection(L.p2 - L.p1, p - L.p1);
    std::cout << w << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that while the changes proposed will reduce memory usage and potentially improve efficiency, they won't affect the runtime complexity of your program. Hence, for large inputs, the time taken by the program will still grow at the same rate.
