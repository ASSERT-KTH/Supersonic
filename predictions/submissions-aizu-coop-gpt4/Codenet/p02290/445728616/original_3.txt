Code Analysis:
This program reads a series of points, and for each point, it projects it onto the line defined by two other points. It uses complex numbers to represent points in the plane, and the computation is done in double-precision floating point arithmetic. The function `project` is responsible for the main computations, and is called once per point. The program's most time-consuming part is expected to be the division and multiplication operations in this function.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Since the complex numbers are only used to represent points in the plane, and the only operations are addition and multiplication, we can replace the complex numbers with a simple struct that represents a point. This will avoid the overhead of complex number operations, which are more general and thus more costly than necessary.

2. The division operation in the `project` function is expensive. We can replace the expression `c / b` with `c * conj(b) / norm(b)`, where `conj` is the complex conjugate and `norm` is the squared magnitude. This will replace the division by a multiplication and a division by a scalar, which is faster.

3. Instead of reading and writing floating point numbers using `cin` and `printf`, we can use `scanf` and `printf` with the `%f` format specifier, which are faster.

4. The `main` function reads and processes each point one at a time. Since all the points are independent, we can process them in parallel using OpenMP, which can provide a significant speedup on multi-core processors.

Optimized Code Block:
Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

struct Point {
  double x, y;
  Point() {}
  Point(double x, double y) : x(x), y(y) {}
  Point operator- (const Point &p) const {
    return Point(x - p.x, y - p.y);
  }
  Point operator* (double a) const {
    return Point(x * a, y * a);
  }
};

double dot(const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  return a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y;
}

double norm(const Point &p) {
  return p.x * p.x + p.y * p.y;
}

Point project(const Point &a, const Point &b, const Point &c) {
  Point base = b - a;
  double r = dot(c - a, base) / norm(base);
  return a + base * r;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy;
  scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf%d", &ax, &ay, &bx, &by, &n);
  Point a(ax, ay), b(bx, by);
  while (n--) {
    scanf("%lf%lf", &cx, &cy);
    Point c(cx, cy);
    Point p = project(a, b, c);
    printf("%.8f %.8f\n", p.x, p.y);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: Although parallel processing with OpenMP was suggested, it is not implemented in the above code because it is assumed that the input size is small enough that the overhead of creating and managing threads outweighs the benefits of parallel processing. If the input size is much larger, parallel processing can significantly improve the performance.
