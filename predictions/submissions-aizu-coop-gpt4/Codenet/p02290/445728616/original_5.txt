Code Analysis:
The given C++ code performs a geometric projection operation on a complex number plane. The function 'project' takes three complex points as input and projects the third point onto the line defined by the first two points. 

It seems that the code is well optimized in terms of algorithmic complexity. However, there are still a few areas where performance can be improved.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid global namespace std: The 'using namespace std' directive can introduce name conflicts and can make the code harder to reason about. It's better to specifically use std:: when using the standard library functions or objects.

2. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of standard library files, which can significantly increase compilation time. It's better to include only the specific standard headers that are actually used in the program.

3. Input/Output operations: The cin and cout operations are slower compared to scanf and printf. This is due to the fact that cin/cout are synchronized with the C standard streams, causing them to be slower. Replacing cin/cout with scanf/printf can speed up the I/O operations.

4. Avoid using complex numbers for 2D points: The std::complex class in C++ is versatile, but it might not be the most efficient representation for 2D points in terms of memory and performance. Using a simple struct to represent points could be more efficient.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>

struct Point {
  double x, y;

  Point operator-(const Point &p) const {
    return {x - p.x, y - p.y};
  }

  Point operator*(double scalar) const {
    return {x * scalar, y * scalar};
  }

  Point operator+(const Point &p) const {
    return {x + p.x, y + p.y};
  }

  double dot(const Point &p) const {
    return x * p.x + y * p.y;
  }

  double norm() const {
    return x * x + y * y;
  }
};

Point project(Point a, Point b, Point c) {
  b = b - a;
  c = c - a;
  double t = c.dot(b) / b.norm();
  return a + b * t;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy;
  scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %d", &ax, &ay, &bx, &by, &n);
  while (n--) {
    scanf("%lf %lf", &cx, &cy);
    Point p = project({ax, ay}, {bx, by}, {cx, cy});
    printf("%.8f %.8f\n", p.x, p.y);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version of the code, we've replaced the complex numbers with a simple struct to represent points in 2D space. The arithmetic and dot product/norm operations have been implemented as member functions of the struct. This change can improve performance by avoiding the overhead of complex number operations. The I/O operations have been replaced with faster scanf/printf functions.
