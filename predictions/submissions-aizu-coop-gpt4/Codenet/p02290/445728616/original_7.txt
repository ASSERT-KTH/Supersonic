Code Analysis:

The provided C++ code performs projections of points onto the line defined by two other points. The code is fairly efficient, but there are several areas where it can be optimized.

1. The code uses complex numbers to handle 2D points. While this approach is correct, it involves unnecessary complex arithmetic operations, some of which can be costly in terms of performance.

2. The code reads the input using cin, which is slower than using scanf. Similarly, it uses printf to print the output, which is faster than cout. The inconsistency in using cin and printf can be rectified.

3. The code includes the entire "bits/stdc++.h" library, which can slow down the compile time.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a struct to represent 2D points instead of complex numbers to eliminate unnecessary complex arithmetic operations.

2. Consistently use scanf and printf for input and output operations to speed up the program.

3. Include only necessary libraries to speed up the compile time.

Optimization Steps:

1. Replace complex<double> by a struct with two doubles, x and y. This will simplify the code and eliminate the need for complex arithmetic operations.

2. Replace cin by scanf to speed up input operations. This will make the input and output operations consistent, both using the C-style scanf and printf functions.

3. Include only the necessary libraries. This will speed up the compile time. We only need iostream for input/output operations and cmath for mathematical operations.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

struct Point {
  double x, y;
};

Point project(Point a, Point b, Point c) {
  b.x -= a.x, b.y -= a.y, c.x -= a.x, c.y -= a.y;
  double t = (c.x*b.x + c.y*b.y) / (b.x*b.x + b.y*b.y);
  return {a.x + t*b.x, a.y + t*b.y};
}

int main() {
  int n;
  Point a, b, c;
  scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %d", &a.x, &a.y, &b.x, &b.y, &n);
  while (n--) {
    scanf("%lf %lf", &c.x, &c.y);
    Point p = project(a, b, c);
    printf("%.8f %.8f\n", p.x, p.y);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should run faster and use less memory than the original code. The trade-off is a slight increase in code complexity due to the introduction of the Point struct and the explicit arithmetic operations. However, this increase in complexity is minimal and should not affect the maintainability of the code.
