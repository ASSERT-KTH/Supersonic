This program is implementing the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The algorithm is fairly efficient, but there are a few possible optimizations:

1. Code Analysis:
    - The initialization of `int i` is unnecessary as it is not used anywhere in the program.
    - The `while` loop condition checks `c > 0` at each iteration, causing an unnecessary condition check on each loop iteration.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - Remove the unnecessary variable declaration.
    - Modify the `while` loop to a `do...while` loop since we know the loop will run at least once. This will remove the unnecessary condition check on the first iteration.

3. Step-By-Step Explanation:
    - The removal of `int i` is straightforward: it's not used anywhere, so removing it won't affect the program in any way. This will reduce the memory footprint of the program.
    - Changing the `while` loop to a `do...while` loop allows us to avoid an unnecessary condition check on the first iteration. This is beneficial because we know that the loop will always run at least once (since `c` is initialized to `1`). The condition is then checked at the end of each iteration, saving one condition check overall.

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b, c = 1;
  scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
  do {
    c = a % b;
    a = b;
    b = c;
  } while (c > 0);
  printf("%d\n", a);
}
```

This optimized code does the same job as the original code but with a slightly reduced memory footprint and potentially faster execution due to fewer condition checks. However, note that these optimizations are on a very small scale and may not lead to noticeable performance improvements in this particular case. They are more impactful in larger, more complex programs.
