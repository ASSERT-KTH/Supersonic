Code Analysis:
The given C program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two input numbers. The GCD is calculated using the Euclidean algorithm, which utilizes a while loop to continuously divide the larger number by the smaller one and replace the larger number with the remainder until the remainder reaches zero. The smaller number at this point is the GCD.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Unnecessary Memory Usage: The variable 'i' is declared but not used. Removing unnecessary variables will help to reduce memory usage.
2. Unoptimized Loops: The while loop continues execution until the remainder 'c' is 0. This could be optimized by directly using 'b' as the condition in the while loop because when 'c' becomes 0, 'b' will also be 0 in the next iteration.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the unused variable 'i' to reduce memory usage.
2. Replace the condition in the while loop from 'c > 0' to 'b != 0'. This change removes the need for the variable 'c'. This results in less memory usage and faster program execution because it reduces the number of operations in each loop iteration.

Optimized Code Block:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
  while (b != 0) {
    int remainder = a % b;
    a = b;
    b = remainder;
  }
  printf("%d\n", a);
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version, there is no need for the variable 'c', and we've removed the unused variable 'i'. We've slightly changed the logic inside the while loop, but the functionality and output remain the same. The memory usage is reduced, and the loop runs faster because it performs one less operation in each iteration.
