The provided code block is an implementation of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. It reads two integers from the standard input, then uses a loop to iteratively calculate the remainder of the division of the two numbers until the remainder is zero. The GCD is then the non-zero remainder from the last iteration.

1. Code Analysis:
   The code is already quite efficient, but there's a minor improvement we can make. Currently, the loop continues to execute even if the modulus operation results in zero. This is unnecessary and can be avoided. 

2. Optimization Strategy:
   We can make the program slightly more efficient by altering the loop condition to stop as soon as `b` becomes zero, rather than computing the modulus operation one more time. 

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Change the loop condition from `c > 0` to `b != 0` to prevent an unnecessary iteration. This optimization reduces the total number of iterations by one when `b` becomes zero. 

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
  while (b != 0) { // Change loop condition to stop when b is zero
    int c = a % b;
    a = b;
    b = c;
  }
  printf("%d\n", a);
}
```

This optimized code maintains the same functionality as the original code. It calculates the GCD of two numbers and prints the result. However, it slightly improves the efficiency by preventing an unnecessary loop iteration when the modulus operation results in zero.
