Code Analysis:
The program is a simple implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. It reads two integers from standard input, and repeatedly applies the Euclidean algorithm until the remainder (c) becomes zero. It then prints the GCD (a).

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies:
1. The while loop condition checks if c > 0. However, since c is initialized to 1, the loop always runs at least once. This unnecessary check can be avoided.
2. The program does not handle the case where b > a. In the Euclidean algorithm, it is typically assumed that a > b. If b > a, the program will run one unnecessary iteration of the loop.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the while loop with a do-while loop. This way, the loop condition is checked after the first iteration, thus eliminating the unnecessary check at the beginning.
2. Add a check at the beginning to swap a and b if b > a. This ensures that a > b, allowing the Euclidean algorithm to proceed more efficiently.

Step by Step Explanation:
1. Replace the while loop with a do-while loop: This ensures that the loop condition is checked after the loop body has executed at least once. Since c is initialized to 1, the loop body is guaranteed to execute at least once, so this change eliminates an unnecessary check at the beginning of the loop.
2. Add a check to swap a and b if b > a: The Euclidean algorithm proceeds more efficiently if a > b. By ensuring this condition at the beginning of the program, we can avoid one unnecessary iteration of the loop in the case where b > a.

Trade-offs: These changes do not significantly increase the complexity of the program, and they should improve its efficiency slightly. They also do not alter the functionality of the program.

Optimized Code Block:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b, c = 1, i, temp;
  scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
  
  // Swap a and b if b > a
  if (b > a) {
    temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
  }

  // Use a do-while loop to eliminate unnecessary check at the beginning
  do {
    c = a % b;
    a = b;
    b = c;
  } while (c > 0);

  printf("%d\n", a);
}
```
