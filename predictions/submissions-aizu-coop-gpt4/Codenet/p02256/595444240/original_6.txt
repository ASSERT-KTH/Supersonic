1. Code Analysis:
The given code is a simple C program to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using Euclid's algorithm. The user inputs two numbers, and the program calculates their GCD and prints it.

The code is simple and straightforward, but there's a potential improvement that we can make to its performance:

- The program uses a while loop to calculate the GCD. The number of iterations is dependent on the input numbers. This can be optimized by using recursion which has better performance for this problem.

2. Optimization Strategy:
We can optimize this program by replacing the while loop with a recursive function to calculate the GCD of two numbers. The recursive approach has a better performance for this problem due to its nature.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
- Replace the while loop with a recursive function to calculate the GCD.

This recursive approach is more efficient because it reduces the number of iterations needed to find the GCD. The while loop in the original code continues until 'b' becomes zero, which can take many iterations depending on the input numbers. But with the recursive function, the GCD is found in fewer iterations. 

The trade-off here is that recursion may cause stack overflow for extremely large input numbers. But in practice, this is not a concern as the input numbers are usually not very large.

4. Optimized Code Block:
Here is the optimized code:

```
#include <stdio.h>

// Recursive function to calculate GCD
int gcd(int a, int b) {
  if (b == 0) 
    return a;
  return gcd(b, a % b);
}

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
   
  // Call the recursive function to find GCD
  int result = gcd(a, b);
  printf("%d\n", result);

  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, I have defined a recursive function 'gcd' which calculates the GCD of two numbers. In the 'main' function, I call this 'gcd' function to find the GCD of the input numbers. This optimized code has better performance as it finds the GCD in fewer iterations compared to the original code.
