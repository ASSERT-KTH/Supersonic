The given code is quite complex and involves many mathematical computations. Therefore, the optimization strategy will be mainly focused on reducing the number of computations and improving memory management.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Avoid unnecessary calculations:** The code performs a lot of mathematical calculations. We can store the results of frequently used calculations to avoid recalculating them. 

2. **Avoid unnecessary memory allocation:** The code uses many vectors and pairs which are not necessary. We can try to reduce the use of these data structures where possible.

3. **Optimize loop operations:** The code uses many loops that can be optimized. We can try to reduce the number of loop iterations or avoid nested loops where possible.

4. **Compiler optimizations:** We can use compiler flags to optimize the code. For example, we can use the -O2 or -O3 flags to enable level 2 or level 3 optimization.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Avoid unnecessary calculations:** 
   - The function `cross` is called multiple times with the same arguments. We can calculate it once and store the results for future use. The same applies to the `dist_LP` function. 

2. **Avoid unnecessary memory allocation:** 
   - In the main function, a vector of pairs `c` is created to store the intersection points and their corresponding boolean values. However, we are only interested in the total count of changes in the boolean values. Therefore, we can avoid storing all the points and directly calculate the total count.

3. **Optimize loop operations:** 
   - In the main function, there is a loop that iterates over the vector `c` to calculate the total count of changes in the boolean values. We can optimize this operation by calculating the total count directly during the creation of the vector `c`.

4. **Compiler optimizations:** 
   - We can use the -O3 flag to enable level 3 optimization. This will allow the compiler to perform loop unrolling, function inlining, and other optimizations to improve the performance of the code.

**Optimized Code Block:**

Due to the complexity of the code, it's hard to provide an optimized code block without a specific context. However, here is the optimized main function based on the above strategies:

```
int main() {
  fast_io();
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    Seg s;
    cin >> s.first >> s.second;
    Point rota(1, -arg(s.second - s.first));
    s.first *= rota, s.second *= rota;
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int res = 0;
    bool prev = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      Seg t;
      int o, l;
      cin >> t.first >> t.second >> o >> l;
      t.first *= rota, t.second *= rota;
      if (intersect_SS(s, t)) {
        bool curr = (o ^ l);
        if (i > 0 && curr != prev) ++res;
        prev = curr;
      }
    }
    cout << res << endl;
  }
}
```
In this code, we directly calculate the total count of changes in the boolean values during the creation of the vector `c`. This avoids the use of the vector `c` and the second loop, thus reducing the memory usage and the number of loop iterations.
