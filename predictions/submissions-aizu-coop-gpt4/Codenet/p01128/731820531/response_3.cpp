This code seems to be an implementation of a geometric algorithm, possibly a variant of the line sweep algorithm. Here are several strategies to optimize the code:

1. **Redundant Header Files**: The program includes many header files, some of which are not used in the code. This unnecessarily increases the program's compilation time. We can get rid of those unused headers.

2. **Using Exit Statements**: The code uses `exit(1)` in certain error conditions, which abruptly stops the program. It's better to throw exceptions, which can be caught and handled.

3. **Data Structure**: The code is using `vector<pair<Point, bool>>` to store the intersection points. We can use a `map<Point, bool>` instead. This will keep the intersections sorted, eliminating the need for the `sort()` function, and will also improve the search efficiency from `O(n)` to `O(logn)`.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: We can use compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to enable optimizations at the compiler's end. 

5. **Input/Output Optimization**: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output, which are slower compared to `scanf` and `printf`. We can replace `cin` and `cout` to speed up I/O operations.

6. **Using `auto`**: C++11 introduced the `auto` keyword, which can be used to automatically deduce the type of a variable at compile-time. It can be used in `for` loops to make the code cleaner and easier to read.

7. **Avoiding Global Variables**: The code has several global variables and type definitions. It is generally a good practice to avoid global variables and define variables in the scope where they are used. This can avoid potential bugs and makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain. 

8. **Using `constexpr`**: The code has several constant values defined. We can use `constexpr` instead of `const` for such values. `constexpr` tells the compiler to evaluate the value of the variable at compile-time as opposed to run-time, which can improve performance.

9. **Recursion Optimization**: There seem to be no recursive calls in the code. If there were, we could apply techniques like memoization or converting the recursive function to an iterative one to optimize them.

10. **Loop Optimization**: There doesn't seem to be any loop that can be unrolled or parallelized.
