The given code is solving a geometric problem involving lines and points in a 2D space. The code seems quite complex due to a large number of functions performing different operations like checking for intersection between lines, calculating distances, etc. Here are a few potential improvements:

1. **Code Analysis**: There are a lot of unnecessary header files included which are not used anywhere in the code. This can increase the compilation time. Also, the usage of macros and templates can make the code hard to understand and debug.

2. **Optimization Strategy**: 
   - **Header Files**: Remove unnecessary header files. This would speed up the compilation time.
   - **Global Variables**: Minimize the use of global variables. They can lead to side effects if not managed properly and can make the code hard to maintain and debug.
   - **Error Handling**: The existing code uses `exit(1)` for error handling which immediately terminates the program. Instead, throwing exceptions can be a better approach for error handling as they provide a way to react to exceptional circumstances (like runtime errors) in programs by transferring control to special functions called handlers.
   - **Complex Numbers**: The code uses complex numbers for storing coordinates which can add unnecessary overhead. A simple struct with x and y coordinates would be more efficient and easier to understand.
   - **Functions**: Some functions do similar things with slightly different parameters. These could possibly be consolidated, reducing the amount of redundant code.
   - **Data Structures**: The vector `c` stores pairs of Points and bools, and is sorted and iterated over multiple times. A more efficient data structure, like a set or map, could be used to automatically sort the elements and provide faster lookups.
   
3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:

   - **Step 1**: Remove the unused header files from the code. Keep only the ones which are actually being used in the code.
   - **Step 2**: Replace global variables with local ones wherever possible. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.
   - **Step 3**: Replace `exit(1)` calls with appropriate exception handling mechanisms.
   - **Step 4**: Replace usage of complex numbers for storing coordinates with a simple struct with x and y coordinates.
   - **Step 5**: Consolidate similar functions into one, reducing redundancy in the code.
   - **Step 6**: Replace the usage of vector with a more efficient data structure like set or map to automatically sort the elements and provide faster lookups.
