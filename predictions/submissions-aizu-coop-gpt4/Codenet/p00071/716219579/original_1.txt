The given C++ program is a solution to a problem where a 2D grid is given and we are required to start from a point (x, y) and recursively travel in all four directions, changing the value of the cell from 1 to 0. 

1. Code Analysis: The code is already quite optimized and uses depth-first search (DFS) for exploring the grid. DFS is a standard algorithm for this kind of problem. There are no obvious performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usage. However, some improvements can be made to the code.

2. Optimization Strategy: Here are a few strategies that could be used to optimize the code:
    1. Unnecessary loop inside the solve function for 'j' can be removed as it appears that it is always iterating from 1 to 3.
    2. The use of the macro 'REP' can be replaced with range-based for loops for better readability.
    3. Since 'M', 'dx', and 'dy' are fixed-size arrays, they can be declared as std::array for type safety.
    4. The solve function can be made iterative to avoid function call overhead and recursion stack space.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Removing the loop for 'j' inside the solve function: Inside the solve function, there is a loop for 'j' from 1 to 3, which seems unnecessary as 'j' is only used to calculate the next cell's position. It causes the function to check the same cell multiple times. By removing this loop, we can reduce unnecessary calculations.
    2. Replacing macros with range-based for loops: Macros like 'REP' are a legacy from the C language, and they can cause issues like unintended side effects. They also make the code harder to read. Using range-based for loops instead of macros can improve code readability and safety.
    3. Using std::array instead of C-style arrays: C-style arrays are not type safe and can lead to bugs. std::array is a container that encapsulates fixed size arrays, and it comes with benefits of standard C++ container, like knowing its own size.
    4. Making the solve function iterative: Recursion has overhead of function calls and uses stack space, which can be problematic for large inputs. By converting the recursive function to an iterative one, we can avoid these issues. However, this will increase the complexity of the code.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <string>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
using P = pair<ll, ll>;

array<array<ll, 8>, 8> M;
array<int, 4> dx = {1, 0, -1, 0};
array<int, 4> dy = {0, 1, 0, -1};

void solve(int y, int x) {
  // Use a stack to avoid recursion
  stack<P> stk;
  stk.push({y, x});

  while (!stk.empty()) {
    P p = stk.top();
    stk.pop();

    M[p.first][p.second] = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      int ny = p.first + dy[i], nx = p.second + dx[i];
      if (ny >= 0 && ny < 8 && nx >= 0 && nx < 8 && M[ny][nx] == 1) {
        stk.push({ny, nx});
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (auto &row : M) {
      string s;
      cin >> s;
      for (int k = 0; k < 8; k++) {
        row[k] = s[k] - '0';
      }
    }

    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    solve(y - 1, x - 1);
    cout << "Data " << i + 1 << ":" << endl;

    for (const auto &row : M) {
      for (const auto &cell : row) {
        cout << cell;
      }
      cout << endl;
    }
  }
}
