From the code given, it's a simple recursive program that simulates a kind of "flood fill" in a 2D grid. The program reads an ASCII map from input, then starts from a point and recursively marks all connected cells with the same value as zero.

Code Analysis:

1. The code uses recursion to spread from a cell to its four neighboring cells, which may lead to a large call stack if the input is large.

2. There are unnecessary computations, such as the computation of nx and ny, which are performed even if the condition (ny >= 0 && ny < 8 && nx >= 0 && nx < 8) is false.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Convert the recursion to an iterative approach using a stack or queue to avoid large call stacks.

2. Avoid computing nx and ny if not necessary.

3. The defined macros FOR and REP are not used in the code, so they can be removed.

4. While writing the output, we are writing each character individually, which might be slower due to numerous IO operations. We can reduce this by using a buffer to store the output and writing it all at once.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> P;

int n, y, x, M[9][9];
int dx[] = {1, 0, -1, 0};
int dy[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};

void solve(int y, int x) {
  queue<P> q;
  q.push(P(y, x));
  M[y][x] = 0;
  
  while (!q.empty()) {
    P pos = q.front();
    q.pop();
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
        int ny = pos.first + dy[i] * j, nx = pos.second + dx[i] * j;
        if (ny >= 0 && ny < 8 && nx >= 0 && nx < 8 && M[ny][nx] == 1) {
          M[ny][nx] = 0;
          q.push(P(ny, nx));
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
      string s;
      cin >> s;
      for (int k = 0; k < 8; k++) { 
        M[j][k] = s[k] - '0'; 
      }
    }
  
    cin >> x >> y;
    solve(y - 1, x - 1);

    cout << "Data " << i + 1 << ":" << endl;
    for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < 8; k++) { 
        cout << M[j][k];
      }
      cout << endl;
    }
  }
}
```

This code avoids recursion by using a queue to manage cells to process, and only pushes new cells onto the queue if they're within the grid and their value is 1. This is more efficient since we avoid the overhead of recursive calls and only process valid cells.

We also removed unused macros and headers to reduce the size of the code and avoid potential confusion about their purpose. The code functionality remains the same, but it should be faster and use less memory, especially for large inputs.
