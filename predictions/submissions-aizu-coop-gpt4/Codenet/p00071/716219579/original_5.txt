**Code Analysis:**

The given C++ program seems to be a part of some game logic or puzzle solution involving a grid (8x8 matrix), where each cell can be in two states (0 or 1). The program reads the grid from the standard input, and then performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from a given point, changing all reachable 1s to 0s.

The main performance bottleneck of this program is the depth-first search (DFS) implemented in the `solve` function. This function makes a recursive call for each cell in the grid that contains a 1, which can lead to a deep recursion stack and high memory usage in case of a large continuous area of 1s. 

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The data structures used in this program are fairly efficient for the task at hand. However, there is a potential for optimization in the way the DFS is implemented.

2. **Redundant Computations:** In the `solve` function, the new coordinates `ny` and `nx` are computed four times, once for each direction. This is redundant and can be optimized.

3. **Loops or Recursive Calls:** The DFS implemented as a recursive function is the main performance bottleneck in this program. The recursion can be replaced with an iterative approach using a stack to reduce memory usage.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** The compiler can be instructed to optimize the program for speed using the `-O2` or `-O3` command-line options.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Replace Recursive DFS with Iterative DFS:** The recursive DFS can be replaced with an iterative approach using a stack. This can significantly reduce memory usage in case of a large continuous area of 1s. The trade-off is a slightly increased code complexity.

2. **Eliminate Redundant Computations:** The new coordinates `ny` and `nx` can be computed once and reused for each direction. This can slightly improve the performance of the program.
