The given program implements a Lazy Segment Tree data structure in C++. This data structure is frequently used for efficient range queries on arrays. However, there are still a few areas that can be optimized in this program, such as memory allocation, loop unrolling, and reducing unnecessary operations.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Memory Allocation: The vector in C++ is a dynamic array, and its size can be changed at runtime. However, resizing vectors on the fly can be costly in terms of time and memory. Therefore, we should preferably allocate memory for vectors in the constructor instead of the init function.

2. Loop Unrolling: The build function contains a loop that can be unrolled to improve performance. Loop unrolling is a technique used to increase the speed of the loops by reducing the number of iterations.

3. Reducing Unnecessary Operations: The eval function checks if the lazy value is not equal to zero before proceeding. This check is unnecessary as the function can handle the zero case without extra computation.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Memory Allocation: In the constructor, we can calculate the size 'N' and allocate memory for the vectors. This will ensure that memory is allocated only once, reducing the overhead of resizing the vector multiple times.

2. Loop Unrolling: In the build function, we can unroll the loop by processing two elements at a time. This will reduce the number of iterations by half, resulting in faster execution.

3. Reducing Unnecessary Operations: In the eval function, we can remove the if condition checking if the lazy value is zero. Even if the lazy value is zero, the computations inside the if condition will have no effect, so it's safe to remove this check.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
template <typename Monoid> struct LazySegmentTree {
private:
  int N;
  vector<Monoid> node, lazy;

public:
  LazySegmentTree(int sz) {
    N = 1;
    while (N < sz)
      N <<= 1;
    node.resize(2 * N - 1, 0);
    lazy.resize(2 * N - 1, 0);
  }
  void build(vector<Monoid> &v) {
    int sz = int(v.size());
    for (int i = 0; i < sz; i++) {
      node[i + N - 1] = v[i];
    }
    for (int i = N - 2; i >= 0; i -= 2) {
      node[i] = node[i * 2 + 1] + node[i * 2 + 2];
      node[i - 1] = node[(i - 1) * 2 + 1] + node[(i - 1) * 2 + 2];
    }
  }
  void eval(int k) {
    node[k] += lazy[k];
    if (k < N - 1) {
      lazy[2 * k + 1] += lazy[k] / 2;
      lazy[2 * k + 2] += lazy[k] / 2;
    }
    lazy[k] = 0;
  }
  // rest of the code remains the same
};
```
Please note that the loop unrolling optimization in the build function is only beneficial when the size of the vector 'v' is large. For small sizes, the overhead of extra computations might outweigh the benefits of reduced iterations.
