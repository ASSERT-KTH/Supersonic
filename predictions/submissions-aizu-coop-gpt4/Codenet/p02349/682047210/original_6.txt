The given code implements a lazy propagation segment tree, a data structure that allows efficient range updates and queries on an array. While the code is already quite efficient, I notice a few areas that we might improve:

1. **Inefficient Data Structures**: The current implementation uses `std::vector` to store the nodes and lazy updates, which is generally a good choice. However, we might be able to reduce memory usage by using a custom data structure that combines `node` and `lazy` into a single object.

2. **Redundant Computations**: I notice that the code often performs the same computations multiple times, such as `2 * k + 1` or `(l + r) / 2`. We could store these values in variables to avoid repeating these computations.

3. **Compiler Optimizations**: We may use compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to ask the compiler to optimize the code further.

Here is my optimization strategy:

1. **Combine `node` and `lazy` into a single structure**: By combining these two vectors into a single vector of structs, we can potentially reduce memory usage. This is because each `std::vector` has some overhead for management and capacity, and by combining them we only need to pay this overhead once. 

2. **Store repeated computations in variables**: In several places in the code, the same computation is performed multiple times. For example, in the `add` function, `2 * k + 1` is calculated three times. Storing this value in a variable can reduce the number of computations.

3. **Use compiler optimization flags**: Compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` can further optimize the code.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

struct Node {
    ll node, lazy;
    Node() : node(0), lazy(0) {}
};

template <typename Monoid> struct LazySegmentTree {
private:
  int N;
  vector<Node> tree;

public:
  LazySegmentTree(int sz = 0) { init(sz); }
  void init(int sz) {
    N = 1;
    while (N < sz)
      N <<= 1;
    tree.resize(2 * N - 1);
  }
  void build(vector<Monoid> &v) {
    int sz = int(v.size());
    init(sz);
    for (int i = 0; i < sz; i++) {
      tree[i + N - 1].node = v[i];
    }
    for (int i = N - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
      tree[i].node = tree[2 * i + 1].node + tree[2 * i + 2].node;
    }
  }
  void eval(int k) {
    if (tree[k].lazy != 0) {
      tree[k].node += tree[k].lazy;
      if (k < N - 1) {
        tree[2 * k + 1].lazy += tree[k].lazy / 2;
        tree[2 * k + 2].lazy += tree[k].lazy / 2;
      }
      tree[k].lazy = 0;
    }
  }
  void add(int a, int b, Monoid x) { add(a, b, x, 0, 0, N); }
  void add(int a, int b, Monoid x, int k, int l, int r) {
    eval(k);
    if (b <= l || r <= a)
      return;
    if (a <= l && r <= b) {
      tree[k].lazy += x * (r - l);
    } else {
      int mid = (l + r) / 2;
      int kk = 2 * k;
      add(a, b, x, kk + 1, l, mid);
      add(a, b, x, kk + 2, mid, r);
      tree[k].node = tree[kk + 1].node + tree[kk + 2].node;
    }
  }
  Monoid getSum(int a, int b) { return getSum(a, b, 0, 0, N); }
  Monoid getSum(int a, int b, int k, int l, int r) {
    if (b <= l || r <= a)
      return 0;
    eval(k);
    if (a <= l && r <= b)
      return tree[k].node;
    int mid = (l + r) / 2;
    int kk = 2 * k;
    Monoid vl = getSum(a, b, kk + 1, l, mid);
    Monoid vr = getSum(a, b, kk + 2, mid, r);
    return vl + vr;
  }
};

int main() {
  int n, q;
  cin >> n >> q;
  LazySegmentTree<ll> seg(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    int c;
    cin >> c;
    if (c == 0) {
      ll s, t, x;
      cin >> s >> t >> x;
      seg.add(s - 1, t, x);
    } else {
      int s;
      cin >> s;
      cout << seg.getSum(s - 1, s) << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code performs the same function as the original, but with potentially reduced memory usage and fewer computations. However, it's important to note that these optimizations may not significantly improve the running time, as the primary computational complexity is inherent to the algorithm itself.
