Code Analysis:
The given code is a C++ implementation of a Fenwick Tree, also known as a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT). This data structure is used for accumulating frequency tables, dynamically. It allows for the efficient calculation of prefix sums in a mutable array of numbers. The code reads the size of the array and the number of operations from input, then performs each operation. Operations are of two types: calculating the prefix sum up to a given index, or updating a range of values in the array by a given amount.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Redundant Computations: The expression "i & -i" is used multiple times in the code. This operation calculates the least significant bit of 'i'. Since this calculation is used multiple times in the same loop, we can store the result in a variable to avoid recalculating it. This will slightly reduce the runtime.

2. Use of Constants: The constant 'maxn' is defined but not used anywhere in the code. Removing unused constants can make the code cleaner and easier to read.

3. Efficient I/O operations: The use of the standard cin and cout functions for input/output can be slow. We can speed up these operations by using faster I/O methods.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can enable compiler optimizations using compiler flags. For instance, we can use the -O2 flag to enable level 2 optimizations, which may significantly improve performance in some cases.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Redundant Computations: In each loop, we calculate "i & -i" multiple times. This operation finds the least significant bit of 'i'. By storing this result in a variable, we can avoid recalculating it. This approach reduces the number of operations per loop iteration, thereby improving speed.

2. Use of Constants: The constant 'maxn' is not used in the code, so we can remove it to make the code cleaner.

3. Efficient I/O operations: The cin and cout functions are slower compared to other I/O methods. We can use scanf and printf instead to speed up I/O operations.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations can be enabled using compiler flags. The -O2 flag enables a set of optimizations that can significantly improve performance.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#define ll long long

ll S[100005];
int n, q;

int main() {
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &q);
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    bool op;
    scanf("%d", &op);
    if (op) {
      int k;
      scanf("%d", &k);
      ll ans = 0;
      for (int i = k, j; i > 0; i -= j) {
        j = i & -i; // Store the result of 'i & -i' in 'j'
        ans += S[i];
      }
      printf("%lld\n", ans);
    } else {
      int s, t, x;
      scanf("%d %d %d", &s, &t, &x);
      for (int i = s, j; i <= n; i += j) {
        j = i & -i; // Store the result of 'i & -i' in 'j'
        S[i] += x;
      }
      for (int i = t + 1, j; i <= n; i += j) {
        j = i & -i; // Store the result of 'i & -i' in 'j'
        S[i] -= x;
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code maintains the functionality of the original code while improving performance and readability. The trade-offs involved are minimal, primarily being a slight increase in code complexity due to the added variables for storing the results of 'i & -i'. However, the performance gain from reducing the number of computations per loop iteration outweighs this trade-off.
