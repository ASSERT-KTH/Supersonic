1. Code Analysis:
The given C++ code appears to be implementing a Fenwick tree or Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) to perform range updates and prefix sum queries. A BIT is a data structure that can efficiently perform these operations in logarithmic time. However, there are some performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the code:

   - Using `cin` and `cout` for I/O operations. These are significantly slower compared to other methods like `scanf` and `printf`.
   - The limit (i.e., 'n') for the second and third 'for' loops in the 'else' clause should be 't' and 'n+1' respectively, not 'n'. This is because the range update operation in a BIT is applied from the start index 's' to the end index 't'.
   - The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` directive includes more libraries than the code actually needs, which can increase compilation time.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Use `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout` for I/O operations.
   - Correct the limit for the 'for' loops in the 'else' clause.
   - Include only the necessary libraries.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   - Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`: The I/O operations using `cin` and `cout` are slower because they have to synchronize with the C stdio library, which adds extra overhead. `scanf` and `printf` are faster because they don't have this synchronization.
   - Correct the 'for' loop limits: The Fenwick tree range update should be applied up to 't' and the 'for' loop for applying the negative update should start from 't+1' and go up to 'n+1'.
   - Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and include only the necessary libraries: `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a multitude of libraries, and including all of them unnecessarily can increase compilation time. In this code, only `iostream` and `cstdio` are required.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<cstdio>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int maxn = 100005;
ll S[maxn];
int n, q;
int main() {
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &q);
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    bool op;
    scanf("%d", &op);
    if (op) {
      int k;
      scanf("%d", &k);
      ll ans = 0;
      for (int i = k; i > 0; i -= i & -i)
        ans += S[i];
      printf("%lld\n", ans);
    } else {
      int s, t, x;
      scanf("%d %d %d", &s, &t, &x);
      for (int i = s; i <= t; i += i & -i)
        S[i] += x;
      for (int i = t + 1; i <= n + 1; i += i & -i)
        S[i] += -x;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimized code assumes that the input is correctly formatted and within allowed limits. Error checking and validation of inputs might be necessary in a production environment.
