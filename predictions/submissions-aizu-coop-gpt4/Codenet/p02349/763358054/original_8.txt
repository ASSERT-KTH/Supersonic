Code Analysis:
The given C++ code is for a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) based program that performs two operations on an array, namely range updates and prefix sum queries. It reads the number of elements in the array and the number of operations from user input. Then, it iterates over each operation. If the operation is a prefix sum query, it calculates and prints the prefix sum up to the kth element. If the operation is a range update, it increments all elements in the range [s, t] by x.

Potential Bottlenecks:
1. The use of the 'bits/stdc++.h' header file, which includes almost all the standard C++ libraries and may increase the compilation time.
2. The use of cin and cout for input/output operations, which can be slower than using scanf and printf.
3. The lack of any method to ensure synchronization between C and C++ standard streams.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the 'bits/stdc++.h' header file with specific required header files.
2. Use scanf and printf instead of cin and cout for faster I/O operations.
3. Add a method to ensure synchronization between C and C++ standard streams.
4. Use fast input/output method if running on an online judge which supports it.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace 'bits/stdc++.h' with required headers:
   The 'bits/stdc++.h' header file includes almost all the standard C++ libraries, which can increase the compilation time. So, it's generally better to include only the specific libraries that the code needs.

2. Use scanf and printf instead of cin and cout:
   The cin and cout operations are slower than scanf and printf. So, we can replace cin and cout with scanf and printf to speed up I/O operations.

3. Synchronize C and C++ standard streams:
   Before we can use scanf and printf alongside cin and cout, we need to ensure that the C and C++ standard streams are synchronized. This can be done by adding the line 'ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)' at the beginning of the main function.

4. Use fast input/output method:
   If the code is to be run on an online judge which supports fast I/O methods, we can use the following lines to speed up input/output operations:
   ```
   cin.tie(NULL);
   cout.tie(NULL);
   ```
   
Trade-offs:
The key trade-off here is that using scanf and printf instead of cin and cout can make the code more difficult to read, as the syntax of scanf and printf is more complex than that of cin and cout. However, the performance gain from using scanf and printf can be significant, especially for problems that involve a large amount of I/O.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>

using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int maxn = 100005;
ll S[maxn];
int n, q;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &q);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    bool op;
    scanf("%d", &op);
    
    if (op) {
      int k;
      scanf("%d", &k);
      int ans = 0;
      for (int i = k; i > 0; i -= i & -i)
        ans += S[i];
      printf("%d\n", ans);
    } else {
      int s, t, x;
      scanf("%d %d %d", &s, &t, &x);
      for (int i = s; i <= n; i += i & -i)
        S[i] += x;
      for (int i = t + 1; i <= n; i += i & -i)
        S[i] -= x;
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code will perform the same operations as the original code but faster, especially for large inputs.
