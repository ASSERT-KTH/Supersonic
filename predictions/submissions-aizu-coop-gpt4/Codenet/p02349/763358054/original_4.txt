#### Code Analysis:

This code appears to be implementing a Fenwick tree (also known as a Binary Indexed Tree) data structure, a data structure that can efficiently update elements and calculate prefix sums in an array of numbers.

Here are the potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:

1. The code is using `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input and output, which are known to be slower than other input/output methods in C++.
2. It is not pre-allocating memory for the Fenwick tree, which could lead to inefficient memory usage. 

#### Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace `std::cin` and `std::cout` with faster alternatives for input/output, such as C-style `scanf` and `printf`.
2. Pre-allocate memory for the Fenwick tree data structure. 
3. Use bitwise operations to calculate the prefix sum and update the elements, which are faster than arithmetic operations.

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace `std::cin` and `std::cout` with `scanf` and `printf`: The iostream objects `std::cin` and `std::cout` are known to be slower than their C-style counterparts `scanf` and `printf`. This is because the former have to synchronize with the C standard streams, while the latter do not have to. This change can lead to significant improvements in performance for input/output-heavy programs.

2. Pre-allocate memory for the Fenwick tree: The Fenwick tree in the given code is not pre-allocated, which could lead to inefficient memory usage. By pre-allocating the memory for the Fenwick tree, we can avoid the overhead of memory allocation during the update and query operations.

3. Use bitwise operations: The given code is already using bitwise operations to calculate the prefix sum and update the elements. Bitwise operations are generally faster than arithmetic operations, so this is an efficient way to implement the Fenwick tree.

#### Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
typedef long long ll;
const int maxn = 100005;
ll S[maxn];
int n, q;
int main() {
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &q);
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    bool op;
    scanf("%d", &op);
    if (op) {
      int k;
      scanf("%d", &k);
      ll ans = 0;
      for (int i = k; i > 0; i -= i & -i)
        ans += S[i];
      printf("%lld\n", ans);
    } else {
      int s, t, x;
      scanf("%d %d %d", &s, &t, &x);
      for (int i = s; i <= n; i += i & -i)
        S[i] += x;
      for (int i = t + 1; i <= n; i += i & -i)
        S[i] += -x;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

#### Trade-offs:

These changes improve the performance of the program at the cost of making the code slightly less readable and more difficult to debug. The C-style `scanf` and `printf` functions are less intuitive and more prone to errors (such as type mismatches) than their C++ counterparts `std::cin` and `std::cout`. However, the performance gain is often significant enough to justify this trade-off.
