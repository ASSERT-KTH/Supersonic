This is a C++ program that seems to solve some sort of graph-related problem, probably finding the number of cycles in a directed graph. There are many global variables and arrays, and the code makes heavy use of recursion. It is using DFS to find cycles and dynamic programming to solve the sub-problems. This kind of program structure is not ideal for performance optimization, but there are still a few things we could do to optimize this code.

Optimization Strategy:

1. **Avoid std::vector reallocation:** The `g` and `r` vectors are frequently appended to using the `push_back()` method. If the vectors reach their capacity, they need to reallocate their underlying array, which can slow down the program. Preallocating space with `reserve()` can avoid this.
2. **Replace recursion with iteration:** In the `dfs()` and `solve()` functions, recursion is used. Recursion involves a fair amount of overhead due to function call overhead and can lead to stack overflow for large inputs. We can replace it with iteration.
3. **Avoid repeated calculations:** The `sz()` function is called repeatedly inside loops. We can calculate the size once and store it in a variable.
4. **Compiler optimization flags:** We can use compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to let the compiler optimize the code.

Note: This code is significantly more complex due to the replacement of recursion with iteration. Whether this complexity is worth the potential performance benefit depends on the exact requirements and constraints of your project.
