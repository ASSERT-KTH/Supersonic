Analysis:
The provided code seems to be a depth-first search (DFS) problem related to graph theory. The DFS algorithm is used to traverse or search graph data structures. This algorithm starts at a root node, explores as far as possible along each branch before backing up, and continues until all vertices are visited. The code seems to be well-structured, but there are a few areas that can be optimized.

Optimization strategy:
1. Avoid using macros: Using macros like "#define" can make debugging more difficult since they are processed by the preprocessor before compilation. Instead, we can use constants or inline functions.
2. Dynamic Memory Allocation: The use of large static memory can be replaced with dynamic memory allocation to conserve memory space.
3. Avoid using "using namespace std": This can lead to name clashing issues, which can be a problem for large projects.
4. Use more meaningful names: Good variable names make the code more readable and maintainable.
5. Avoid using global variables: Global variables can make the code harder to understand and debug, and can lead to unexpected results due to side effects.
6. The vector g and r have a fixed size of 1010. This size can be made dynamic according to the input size N to save memory space.
7. The function "f" and "solve" are using recursion, which can be optimized using dynamic programming to avoid unnecessary computations.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

The optimizations in this code are aimed at improving readability and maintainability, reducing memory usage by using dynamic memory allocations, and avoiding unnecessary computations by using dynamic programming technique in the solve function. This optimized code still retains the functionality and output of the original code.
