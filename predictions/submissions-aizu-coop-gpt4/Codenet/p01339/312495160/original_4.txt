The given code is a C++ program that seems to solve a problem related to graphs, specifically directed graphs. It appears to perform some sort of depth-first search (DFS) operation, followed by a dynamic programming (DP) approach to calculating a result based on the graph's structure. 

The code can be optimized in the following ways:

1. **Inefficient use of `vector` in DFS**: In the `dfs` function, the variable `g[cur]` is accessed multiple times and its size is calculated repeatedly. This can be improved by storing the size of the vector in a variable and using it in the loop.

2. **Repeated calculations in the `solve` function**: In the `solve` function, the result is calculated using a recursive function call, which can potentially lead to repeated calculations for the same node. This can be avoided by using a memoization strategy, which the code already attempts to do with the `dp` array. However, proper initialization and resetting of the `dp` array is necessary to ensure correct results.

3. **Usage of global variables**: The code uses several global variables, which can lead to difficult-to-debug issues. It's generally a good practice to limit the scope of variables as much as possible.

4. **Inefficient data structures**: The `vector` data structure is used in several places where the size of the structure is known in advance. Replacing these with arrays can reduce overhead.

5. **Compiler optimizations**: Modern compilers have several flags that can be used to automatically optimize the code. For example, the `-O2` flag could be used with the GCC compiler to perform several automatic optimizations. However, you should be careful with these flags, as they can sometimes cause unexpected behavior.

Here's an optimized version of the code with the above changes:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define MOD 1000000007LL
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef vector<ll> vi;

ll solve(int v, vi* r, int* used, ll* dp) {
  ll &res = dp[v];
  if (res != -1)
    return res;
  used[v] = 1;
  res = 1;
  for(auto &i : r[v]) { res = res * solve(i, r, used, dp) % MOD; }
  res = (res + 1) % MOD;
  return res;
}

ll f(int start, vi* g, vi* r, int* used, ll* dp, int* inCycle, int* List, int* cycle) {
  int l = 0;
  int c = 0;
  stack<int> st;
  st.push(start);
  while(!st.empty()) {
    int cur = st.top();
    st.pop();
    if (used[cur]) {
      int from = 0;
      while (List[from] != cur) from++;
      for(int i = from; i < l; i++) cycle[c++] = List[i];
      return c;
    }
    used[cur] = 1;
    List[l++] = cur;
    for(auto &i : g[cur]) st.push(i);
  }
  cycle[c++] = start;
  return c;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);

  int N, M;
  cin >> N >> M;
  vi g[N], r[N];
  for(int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    int s, d;
    cin >> s >> d;
    s--; d--;
    g[s].push_back(d);
    r[d].push_back(s);
  }

  ll dp[N];
  fill(dp, dp + N, -1);
  int used[N], inCycle[N], List[N], cycle[N];
  fill(used, used + N, 0);
  fill(inCycle, inCycle + N, 0);
  
  ll ans = 1;
  for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (!used[i]) {
      int c = f(i, g, r, used, dp, inCycle, List, cycle);
      ll res = 1;
      for(int j = 0; j < c; j++) inCycle[cycle[j]] = 1;
      for(int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
        for(auto &k : r[cycle[j]]) {
          if (inCycle[k]) continue;
          res = res * solve(k, r, used, dp) % MOD;
        }
      }
      res = (res + 1) % MOD;
      ans = ans * res % MOD;
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}
```

This optimized code should run faster and use less memory than the original, while preserving the original functionality. It also makes use of better programming practices, such as limiting variable scopes and avoiding global variables. The code is also more concise and easier to read, making it simpler to debug and maintain.
