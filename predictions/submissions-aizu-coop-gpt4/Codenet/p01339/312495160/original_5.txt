This C++ program seems to be solving a problem related to graph theory as it contains the structures and variables typical for a graph such as lists for vertices and edges (vi g[1010], r[1010]), indicators for visited vertices (used[1010]) and depth-first search (dfs) function. Given the nature of graph problems, the bottlenecks are likely to be inefficient graph traversals, excessive function calls, or redundant calculations. 

Here are some potential optimizations:

1. **Inefficient Data Structures**: The graph is represented as an adjacency list which is generally an efficient data structure for sparse graphs. However, each adjacency list is a vector which has an O(n) complexity for removing an element. If this operation is done frequently, it can be a performance issue. An alternative data structure, such as a linked list, could be more efficient for this operation, but it would increase the complexity of access operation.

2. **Redundant Computations**: The function solve() is called multiple times with the same argument throughout the program. This means the same computations are performed over and over again. Using memoization (an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again) could significantly improve the performance.

3. **Loop Unrolling**: The loops in this program iterate over the adjacency lists of the vertices. Loop unrolling could speed up the iterations, but the benefit is likely to be small as the number of vertices is small (up to 1010).

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: Use of compiler options for performance optimization can also be considered. For example, the -O3 option for g++ enables several performance-enhancing flags.

5. **Avoiding Global Variables**: The code uses a lot of global variables, which can make the code harder to understand and debug, and can lead to unexpected results if variables are accidentally modified. It can be optimized by minimizing the use of global variables and instead passing them as local variables, function parameters or return values.

The optimized code is shown below:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef vector<long long> vi;
const int maxN = 1010;
const long long MOD = 1000000007LL;
int N, M;
vi g[maxN], r[maxN];
int used[maxN];
int List[maxN], l;
int cycle[maxN], c;
int inCycle[maxN];
long long dp[maxN];

void dfs(int cur) {
  if (used[cur]) {
    int from = 0;
    while (List[from] != cur)
      from++;
    for (int i = from; i < l; i++) { cycle[c++] = List[i]; }
    return;
  }
  used[cur] = 1;
  List[l++] = cur;
  if (g[cur].empty()) {
    cycle[c++] = cur;
    return;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < g[cur].size(); i++) { dfs(g[cur][i]); }
}

long long solve(int v) {
  long long &res = dp[v];
  if (res != -1)
    return res;
  used[v] = 1;
  res = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < r[v].size(); i++) { res = res * solve(r[v][i]) % MOD; }
  res = (res + 1) % MOD;
  return res;
}

long long f(int start) {
  l = 0;
  c = 0;
  dfs(start);
  long long res = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < c; i++) inCycle[cycle[i]] = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < c; i++) 
    for (int j = 0; j < r[cycle[i]].size(); j++) {
      if (inCycle[r[cycle[i]][j]])
        continue;
      res = res * solve(r[cycle[i]][j]) % MOD;
    }
  res = (res + 1) % MOD;
  return res;
}

int main() {
  cin.tie(0);
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin >> N >> M;
  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    int s, d;
    cin >> s >> d;
    s--;
    d--;
    g[s].push_back(d);
    r[d].push_back(s);
  }
  memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
  long long ans = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) if (!used[i]) { ans = ans * f(i) % MOD; }
  cout << ans << endl;
}
