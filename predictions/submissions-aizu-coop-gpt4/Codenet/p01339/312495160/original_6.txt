This program appears to be designed to solve a graph-related problem. It reads in a series of directed edges of a graph, performs depth-first search (DFS) for each node it hasn't visited yet, and calculates the product of the result of the `solve` function for each visited node, modulo a large prime number (`MOD`), as an answer.

Here are some potential areas for optimization:

1. **DFS Function:** The DFS function uses recursion, which can lead to a stack overflow for large input graphs. Iterative DFS might be a better approach.

2. **Data Structures:** The graph is represented as an adjacency list using C++ vectors (`vi g[1010], r[1010]`). While this is generally efficient for sparse graphs, if the graph is dense, an adjacency matrix might be faster.

3. **Function `solve`:** The function `solve` is a recursive function with memoization. It uses an array `dp` to store the already computed values. This approach is generally efficient, but we can still improve it by avoiding the use of global variables and passing the memoization table (`dp`) as a parameter.

4. **Function `f`:** This function performs DFS and calculates the product of the `solve` function for each node. It uses several global variables (`cycle`, `inCycle`, etc.), which can be avoided.

5. **Memory Initialization:** The program uses `memset` to initialize the `dp` array. This can be replaced with `std::fill_n` which is safer with non-trivial types.

6. **Global Variables:** The program uses quite a few global variables (`N`, `M`, `g`, `r`, `used`, `List`, `l`, `cycle`, `c`, `inCycle`, `dp`). We can refactor the code to reduce the number of global variables, which makes code more maintainable and less prone to bugs.

7. **Input/Output Optimization:** The program uses `cin.tie(0); ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);` which un-syncs C++'s I/O streams with C's, making input/output operations faster. This is already a good practice.

Let's implement some of the above-mentioned optimizations:

**Optimized Code:**

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define EPS 1e-9
#define INF 1070000000LL
#define MOD 1000000007LL
#define rep(i, n) rep2(i, 0, n)
#define rep2(i, m, n) for (int i = m; i < (n); i++)
#define pb push_back
#define sz(x) ((int)(x).size())
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef vector<ll> vi;
int N, M;

ll solve(int v, vi r[], ll dp[], int used[]) {
  ll &res = dp[v];
  if (res != -1)
    return res;
  used[v] = 1;
  res = 1;
  rep(i, sz(r[v])) { res = res * solve(r[v][i], r, dp, used) % MOD; }
  res = (res + 1) % MOD;
  return res;
}

ll dfs_and_solve(int start, vi g[], vi r[]) {
  vector<int> List, cycle;
  int l = 0, c = 0;
  int used[1010] = {0}, inCycle[1010] = {0};
  stack<int> s;
  s.push(start);
  while(!s.empty()) {
    int cur = s.top(); s.pop();
    if (used[cur]) {
      int from = 0;
      while (List[from] != cur)
        from++;
      rep2(i, from, l) { cycle[c++] = List[i]; }
      continue;
    }
    used[cur] = 1;
    List[l++] = cur;
    if (sz(g[cur]) != 0) 
      s.push(g[cur][0]);
    else
      cycle[c++] = cur;
  }

  ll res = 1;
  rep(i, c) inCycle[cycle[i]] = 1;
  ll dp[1010];
  fill_n(dp, 1010, -1);
  rep(i, c) rep(j, sz(r[cycle[i]])) {
    if (inCycle[r[cycle[i]][j]])
      continue;
    res = res * solve(r[cycle[i]][j], r, dp, used) % MOD;
  }
  res = (res + 1) % MOD;
  return res;
}

int main() {
  cin.tie(0);
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin >> N >> M;
  vi g[1010], r[1010];
  int used[1010] = {0};
  rep(i, M) {
    int s, d;
    cin >> s >> d;
    s--;
    d--;
    g[s].pb(d);
    r[d].pb(s);
  }
  ll ans = 1;
  rep(i, N) if (!used[i]) { ans = ans * dfs_and_solve(i, g, r) % MOD; }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations make the code cleaner and more efficient by reducing the use of global variables and replacing recursive DFS with iterative DFS. Note that the exact impact on performance and memory usage will depend on the specific input data.
