Code Analysis:
This code contains multiple nested loops, with each loop ranging from 0 to 9. Due to the level of nesting, the number of iterations this program makes is very high, leading to a significant performance bottleneck. 

In addition, the code unnecessarily resets the num array during each iteration of the inner loops, leading to redundant computations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary computations: Initializing num[0][0] and num[1][0] to 0 at each step in the loop is unnecessary and can be avoided. The same applies for the other similar occurrences in the code.
2. Use efficient data structures: The current arrays used in the code are efficient. However, for more complex data structures, using a map or hash table could be more efficient.
3. Optimize loops: Reducing the number of nested loops can significantly improve performance. A possible approach could be using the next_permutation function from the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), which generates all permutations of an array. This would allow you to iterate over permutations directly rather than manually creating them with nested loops.
4. Compiler optimizations: Using compiler optimization flags (like -O2 or -O3 with GCC) could also help improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The num array is initialized to 0 outside the loops. This eliminates the need to reset its values during each iteration.
2. The multiple nested loops are replaced with the next_permutation function. This generates all permutations of the array a[1][], iterating over them directly and avoiding the need for nested loops.
3. Compiler optimization flags are used when compiling the code, which can further improve performance.

Trade-offs:
While using next_permutation simplifies the code and improves performance, it may be less intuitive for someone unfamiliar with the function. Additionally, compiler optimizations can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, and should be used with caution.

Now let's see the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int l = 0; l < n; l++) {
    int a[2][9];
    double winrate1 = 0, winrate2 = 0;

    for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k < 9; k++)
        cin >> a[j][k];

    sort(a[1], a[1] + 9);
    do {
      int geitu = 0, jacky = 0;
      for (int z = 0; z < 9; z++) {
        if (a[0][z] > a[1][z])
          geitu += a[0][z] + a[1][z];
        else
          jacky += a[0][z] + a[1][z];
      }
      if (geitu > jacky)
        winrate1++;
      else if (geitu < jacky)
        winrate2++;
    } while (next_permutation(a[1], a[1] + 9));

    double ans, ans2;
    ans = winrate1 / 362880;
    ans *= 100000;
    ans += 0.5;
    ans = int(ans);
    ans /= 100000;
    ans2 = winrate2 / 362880;
    ans2 *= 100000;
    ans2 += 0.5;
    ans2 = int(ans2);
    ans2 /= 100000;
    cout << ans << " " << ans2 << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the code achieves the same functionality as the original, but with significantly improved performance due to the use of next_permutation and the elimination of unnecessary computations.
