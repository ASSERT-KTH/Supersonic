Code Analysis:
This code takes an integer 'n' as input and then performs a series of calculations 'n' times. For each iteration, it takes as input two 2D arrays 'a' and compares each element pair from the arrays. If the element from the first array is greater than the element from the second array, it sums them and stores the result in 'num[0][x]' (where x is the index), else it stores the sum in 'num[1][x]'. After comparing and summing all pairs, it sums all elements in 'num[0]' and 'num[1]' separately and increments 'winrate1' if the sum of 'num[0]' is greater than 'num[1]', else it increments 'winrate2'. Finally, it prints the win rates as percentages.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The code's main performance bottleneck is the deeply nested for-loops, which result in a time complexity of O(n^9). This can be improved by changing the approach to a more efficient one.
2. The 'num' array is initialized with zeros at the start of every loop iteration, which is redundant. We can initialize it once before entering the loop.
3. The summation of elements in 'num[0]' and 'num[1]' can be done on-the-fly, instead of using a separate loop.
4. The arrays 'a' and 'num' can be replaced with more efficient data structures like vectors. This will not only improve performance but also make the code cleaner.
5. The computation of the win rates can be done directly without the need for intermediate variables 'ans' and 'ans2'.
6. The input/output operations can be optimized by using faster IO methods.
7. Finally, we can use compiler optimization flags for automatic performance improvements.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Instead of nested loops, we can use a permutation generator to get all permutations of the array indices. This will reduce the code complexity and improve performance.
2. Initialize the 'num' array once before entering the loop to avoid redundancy.
3. While comparing and summing the elements from the 'a' arrays, simultaneously add the sums to 'geitu' and 'jacky' to eliminate the need for an extra loop.
4. Replace the arrays with vectors for cleaner code and better performance.
5. Compute the win rates directly and print the result without the need for intermediate variables.
6. Use the 'ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)' function and cin.tie(NULL) to speed up input/output operations.
7. Use compiler optimization flags like '-O2' or '-O3' for automatic performance improvements.

Trade-offs:
1. Using a permutation generator instead of nested loops might increase the code complexity slightly, but the performance gain outweighs this.
2. Using vectors instead of arrays might have a negligible impact on performance due to dynamic memory allocation, but it improves code readability and maintainability.

Optimized Code Block:

Please note that since the given code is complex and involves deep nested loops, the optimized version of the code may not be minimal, but it will significantly improve the performance.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<vector<int>> a(2, vector<int>(9));
  vector<int> num(2);

  for (int l = 0; l < n; l++) {
    double winrate1 = 0, winrate2 = 0;

    for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k < 9; k++)
        cin >> a[j][k];

    vector<int> indices(9);
    iota(indices.begin(), indices.end(), 0);

    do {
      fill(num.begin(), num.end(), 0);
      int geitu = 0, jacky = 0;

      for (int m = 0; m < 9; m++) {
        if (a[0][m] > a[1][indices[m]])
          num[0] = a[0][m] + a[1][indices[m]];
        else
          num[1] = a[0][m] + a[1][indices[m]];
        
        geitu += num[0];
        jacky += num[1];
      }

      if (geitu > jacky)
        winrate1++;
      else if (geitu < jacky)
        winrate2++;
    } while (next_permutation(indices.begin(), indices.end()));

    cout << winrate1 / 362880 << " " << winrate2 / 362880 << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This code should be compiled with '-O2' or '-O3' optimization flag for the best performance.
