Code Analysis:

The code has several nested loops, which is a major performance concern, as the time complexity of the code is currently O(n^9). This is due to the nested for loops running from 0 to 9. Each loop iteration also checks for equality between the current index and all previously computed indices, which adds an additional performance overhead. 

The code also unnecessarily initializes the num array in each loop iteration, which is a waste of resources.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Reducing Loop Complexity: The nested loops can be reduced by using a permutation generating algorithm such as the Standard Template Library (STL) next_permutation function in C++. This will generate all possible permutations of the array elements, which is the main requirement of this code block. 

2. Removing Redundant Initializations: The num array does not need to be initialized to zero at every iteration. This operation can be moved to the start of the program.

3. Better Usage of Data Structures: The code uses arrays for storing data. This can be replaced by vectors, which are more dynamic and flexible.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Use of fast I/O methods can make a considerable difference in execution time where standard input/output operations are heavily used.

Optimization Explanation:

1. The next_permutation function generates the next lexicographically greater permutation. It rearranges the elements in the range [first, last) into the next lexicographically greater permutation, where last is the past-the-end iterator. This will significantly reduce the number of nested loops, thereby improving the code's time complexity.

2. Initializing the num array only once, at the start of the program, will reduce the number of memory operations.

3. Vectors allow for dynamic resizing, which can be beneficial if the size of the data is not known beforehand. This is not directly applicable in this case, but it's a good practice in general to use vectors over arrays.

4. Fast I/O can be achieved by using cin.tie(NULL), ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), and \n instead of endl for output operations, which considerably reduces the time taken for I/O operations.

Trade-offs:

The use of next_permutation and vectors over arrays might make the code a bit harder to understand for beginners, as these are more advanced concepts. However, the performance gain outweighs the increased code complexity.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<int> a[2];
  vector<int> num[2], idx(9);
  int geitu, jacky;
  double winrate1, winrate2;

  for (int l = 0; l < n; l++) {
    winrate1 = 0, winrate2 = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < 9; k++) {
        int temp;
        cin >> temp;
        a[j].push_back(temp);
      }
    }
    
    iota(idx.begin(), idx.end(), 0);

    do {
      num[0].clear();
      num[1].clear();
      for (int m = 0; m < 9; m++) {
        if (a[0][m] > a[1][idx[m]])
          num[0].push_back(a[0][m] + a[1][idx[m]]);
        else
          num[1].push_back(a[0][m] + a[1][idx[m]]);
      }
      geitu = accumulate(num[0].begin(), num[0].end(), 0);
      jacky = accumulate(num[1].begin(), num[1].end(), 0);
      if (geitu > jacky)
        winrate1++;
      else if (geitu < jacky)
        winrate2++;
    } while (next_permutation(idx.begin(), idx.end()));

    double ans, ans2;
    ans = winrate1 / 362880;
    ans *= 100000;
    ans += 0.5;
    ans = int(ans);
    ans /= 100000;
    ans2 = winrate2 / 362880;
    ans2 *= 100000;
    ans2 += 0.5;
    ans2 = int(ans2);
    ans2 /= 100000;
    cout << ans << " " << ans2 << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that it's important to include the `bits/stdc++.h` header to access the `next_permutation` and `iota` functions, and `accumulate` which is used to sum the elements in a container.
