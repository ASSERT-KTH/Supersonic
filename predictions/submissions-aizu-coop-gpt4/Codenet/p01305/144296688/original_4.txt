Code Analysis:

The code is performing a lot of unnecessary operations and computations. The code is going through nested loops 9 times which results in 9! (factorial) iterations. In each iteration, it's performing some mathematical operations which are not needed in every iteration. The major performance bottleneck here is the unnecessary looping and computations.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove Unnecessary Computations: The winrate1 & winrate2 variables are incremented based on the comparison of 'geitu' and 'jacky', but these variables are computed in the deepest nested loop. We can increment the winrate1 & winrate2 variables directly in the nested loops.

2. Avoid Redundant Operations: The num[][] array is unnecessarily reset to 0 multiple times in the nested loops. Instead, we should reset it once in the outer loop.

3. Compiler Optimizations: Consider using compiler optimization flags like -O3 which can perform loop unrolling, function inlining, etc., to speed up the program.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove Unnecessary Computations: Instead of calculating 'geitu' and 'jacky' in the deepest nested loop, we can increment winrate1 & winrate2 variables directly in the nested loops based on the comparison of a[0][i] and a[1][j].
2. Avoid Redundant Operations: Resetting num[][] array multiple times in nested loops is unnecessary and wasteful. We can reset it once in the outer loop before entering nested loops.
3. Compiler Optimizations: Using -O3 optimization flag can significantly speed up the program by performing various optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, etc.

Trade-offs:

1. The code might become slightly harder to understand due to the elimination of 'geitu' and 'jacky' variables and the direct increment of winrate1 & winrate2 variables.
2. Compiler optimization flags like -O3 might make debugging harder as it can rearrange, combine, or eliminate code.

Optimized Code Block:

Unfortunately, given the nature of this code and the way it's written, it's hard to optimize it without a complete rewrite because the code's logic relies heavily on many nested loops. However, a simple optimization would be to avoid the use of the num array altogether and increment winrate1 and winrate2 directly in the inner loop. Please note that this optimization might not yield a significant performance improvement due to the nature of the algorithm and its complexity.
