The given C++ program is a brute-force approach with a considerable number of nested loops. This leads to a high time complexity of O(n!) which makes the program inefficient for large inputs. Here are some potential optimizations that could be made:

1. **Redundant Computation**: A considerable amount of time is spent on redundant computations. The same values are computed multiple times. Using memoization or caching the results of some computations can enhance performance.

2. **Nested Loops**: The program contains many nested loops which increases runtime exponentially. If possible, we should try to reduce the number of nested loops. One way to achieve this might be to use dynamic programming or other more efficient algorithms.

3. **Inefficient Data Structures**: The arrays are not being used effectively. We could use more efficient data structures like hash maps to store and retrieve the computed values more efficiently.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: Compiler optimizations can also be used to improve the performance of the code. For instance, the -O3 flag during compilation could make a notable difference.

5. **Improving I/O operations**: Using faster I/O operations can also enhance the performance. For instance, using scanf/printf instead of cin/cout can make a difference in C++. 

However, it's important to notice that the given code is highly complex and involves a large number of permutations and combinations which inherently have a high time complexity. A complete rewrite might be necessary to achieve significant improvements in performance.
