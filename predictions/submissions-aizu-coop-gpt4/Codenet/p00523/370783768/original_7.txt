1. Code Analysis: 

The given code is a C++ program that performs a binary search on a circular array to find the maximum size of 4 non-overlapping sub-arrays. The main logic of the program has been written in the functions `Find()` and `calc()`. The `Find()` function is used to find 4 non-overlapping sub-arrays each of size greater than or equal to a given size, and `calc()` function is used to check whether such 4 sub-arrays exist for a given size. The binary search is performed on the sizes in the `main()` function.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    A. Inefficient Data Structures: The data structures are efficiently used in the program. Array `A[]` is used to store the values and `sum[]` is used to store the prefix sum. 

    B. Redundant or Unnecessary Computations: The `Find()` function is called from the `calc()` function in a loop which runs from `0` to `N-1`. For each value of `pos`, it is trying to find 4 non-overlapping sub-arrays using binary search. This can be optimized by using dynamic programming to store the maximum sum of subarrays for each position and size which can be used in the subsequent iterations.

    C. Loops or Recursive Calls: The loops are used appropriately, and there are no recursive calls.

    D. Compiler Optimizations or Pragma Directives: The compiler optimizations are not used in the code. Pragma Directives are not used in the code. 

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    1. The `Find()` function is called multiple times with the same parameters which leads to the same computation being done multiple times. This can be optimized by storing the result of the function for each unique parameter in a map or array and reusing it for the subsequent calls with the same parameters. This is known as Dynamic Programming.

    2. In the `calc()` function, the `Find()` function is called for each position from `0` to `N-1`. This can be optimized by using the result of previous computations. For a given `pos` and `size`, if we can find 4 non-overlapping sub-arrays, then we can surely find 4 non-overlapping sub-arrays for the same `pos` and smaller `size`. So, we can store the maximum `size` for which we can find 4 non-overlapping sub-arrays for each `pos` in an array and use it to reduce the number of calls to the `Find()` function.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
const int64 INF = 1LL << 58;
int N, A[200000];
int64 sum[200000];
int64 dp[200000];

bool Find(const int &pos, const int64 &size) {
  int hoge = distance(
      sum, lower_bound(sum + pos + 1, sum + N + pos + 1, sum[pos] + size));
  if (hoge == N + pos + 1)
    return false;
  int fuga = distance(
      sum, lower_bound(sum + hoge + 1, sum + N + pos + 1, sum[hoge] + size));
  if (fuga == N + pos + 1)
    return false;
  int foo = distance(
      sum, lower_bound(sum + fuga + 1, sum + N + pos + 1, sum[fuga] + size));
  return (foo != N + pos + 1);
}

bool calc(int64 size) {
  for (int pos = 0; pos < N; pos++) {
    if (dp[pos] >= size) // use the result of previous computation
      return true;
    if (Find(pos, size)) {
      dp[pos] = size;  // store the result of the computation
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d", &N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    scanf("%d", A + i);
    A[N + i] = A[i];
  }
  sum[0] = A[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < 2 * N; i++) {
    sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + A[i];
  }
  int64 low = 0, high = INF;
  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
  while (high != low) {
    int64 mid = (low + high + 1) >> 1;
    if (calc(mid))
      low = mid;
    else
      high = mid - 1;
  }
  printf("%lld\n", low);
}
```
In the optimized code, I have added a dynamic programming array `dp[]` which stores the maximum size of 4 non-overlapping sub-arrays that can be found for each position. In the `calc()` function, before calling the `Find()` function, I check whether the result of the previous computation can be used. If yes, then I return `true` without calling the `Find()` function. If not, then I call the `Find()` function and store the result of the computation in the `dp[]` array. This reduces the number of calls to the `Find()` function, thus improving the performance of the program.
