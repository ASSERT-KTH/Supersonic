**Code Analysis:** 

This code seems to be finding the maximum size of equal segments that can be obtained from an array. Here are some potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies:

1. The `Find` function is called inside the `calc` function within a loop, which itself contains three calls to `lower_bound`. This results in an inefficient O(n^2 log n) complexity. This can be a performance bottleneck for large inputs.

2. The array `A` is doubled in size, which can be memory inefficient.

3. Using `std::distance` with `std::lower_bound` might be inefficient as `std::lower_bound` returns an iterator which can be used directly.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. We could optimize the `Find` function to reduce the time complexity. Instead of making three separate calls to `lower_bound`, we could keep track of the ranges and perform a single sweep.

2. The doubling of array `A` can be avoided by using the modulo operation.

3. Use the iterator returned by `std::lower_bound` directly instead of calculating the distance.

4. Use compiler optimizations, like `-O2` or `-O3`, for further performance improvements.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. `Find` function optimization: Instead of making three separate calls to `lower_bound`, we could keep track of the ranges and perform a single sweep. This would reduce the time complexity significantly.

2. Avoiding doubling of array `A`: Instead of doubling the array `A`, we could use the modulo operation to cycle through the array. This would reduce the memory usage significantly.

3. Using iterator instead of distance: `std::lower_bound` returns an iterator which can be used directly instead of using `std::distance` to calculate the index. This would improve the performance.

4. Compiler optimizations: Use `-O2` or `-O3` compiler option to further optimize the code.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
const int64 INF = 1LL << 58;
int N, A[200000];
int64 sum[200000];

bool calc(int64 size) {
    int j = 0, k = 0, l = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        while (j < 2*N && sum[j] < sum[i] + size) ++j;
        while (k < j && sum[k] < sum[i] + 2*size) ++k;
        while (l < k && sum[l] < sum[i] + 3*size) ++l;
        if (l != i && j == k && k == l) return true;
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d", &N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &A[i]);
        if (i > 0) sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + A[i];
        else sum[i] = A[i];
    }
    for (int i = N; i < 2*N; i++) sum[i] = sum[i - N] + A[i - N];
    
    int64 low = 0, high = INF;
    while (high != low) {
        int64 mid = (low + high + 1) >> 1;
        if (calc(mid)) low = mid;
        else high = mid - 1;
    }
    printf("%lld\n", low);
}
