Code Analysis:
The given program seems to be a solution to a specific competitive programming problem. It's using a binary search to find the maximum size of a subarray sum in a circular array, with the restriction that four such subarrays can be formed in the array. 

The program is not very efficient because it uses a brute force approach in the `calc` function to check every possible position for the subarrays. This is done for each iteration of the binary search, resulting in a time complexity of approximately O(N^2 logN). Also, the use of `lower_bound()` function with `distance()` in a loop can be expensive, as `lower_bound()` function has a time complexity of O(logN).

Optimization Strategy:

1. Efficient Data Structures: The data structures used in the program are fine and do not require changes. 

2. Redundant Computations: The main source of redundant computation is the `Find` function being called for each position in the array for every iteration of the binary search in the `calc` function. This can be optimized by combining the binary search with the check for subarray positions. 

3. Loops/Recursive Calls: The loops in the `calc` function can be optimized as mentioned above.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations depend on the specific compiler being used but in general, using options such as `-O2` or `-O3` with gcc can lead to performance improvements. 

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Combine the Binary Search with the Check for Subarray Positions: Instead of separately calling the `Find` function for each array position in the `calc` function, we can combine these steps. This can be done by keeping track of the maximum subarray sum that can be formed up to each position in the array and updating this as we iterate through the array. 

2. Optimizing lower_bound usage: Instead of calculating lower_bound separately for each subarray, we can maintain 3 pointers which mark the end of each subarray. These pointers can be moved forward as we iterate through the array.

Trade-off: The main trade-off is that the code becomes a bit more complex and harder to understand due to the combined binary search and subarray position check. However, this optimization significantly improves performance.

Optimized Code Block:
```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
const int64 INF = 1LL << 58;
int N, A[200000];
int64 sum[200000];

bool calc(int64 size) {
  int64 max_sum = 0;
  int64 right[3] = {};
  int64 pos[3] = {};
  for (int i = 1; i < 2*N; i++) {
    while (sum[i] - sum[right[0]] >= size && right[0] < i) {
      right[0]++;
      while (right[1] < right[0] && sum[right[0]] - sum[right[1]] >= size) {
        right[1]++;
        while (right[2] < right[1] && sum[right[1]] - sum[right[2]] >= size) {
          right[2]++;
          max_sum = max(max_sum, sum[right[2]] - sum[pos[0]]);
        }
      }
    }
    pos[0] = min(pos[0], right[0]);
    pos[1] = min(pos[1], right[1]);
    pos[2] = min(pos[2], right[2]);
  }
  return max_sum >= size;
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d", &N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    scanf("%d", A + i);
    A[N + i] = A[i];
  }
  sum[0] = A[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < 2 * N; i++) {
    sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + A[i];
  }
  int64 low = 0, high = INF;
  while (high != low) {
    int64 mid = (low + high + 1) >> 1;
    if (calc(mid))
      low = mid;
    else
      high = mid - 1;
  }
  printf("%lld\n", low);
}
```
