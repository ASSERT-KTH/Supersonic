Code Analysis:
The given code is a C++ program that reads an integer N and an array of N integers, then it duplicates the array and calculates the prefix sum on the 2N array. It is then followed by a binary search operation to find the maximum possible value of a variable "size" that divides the prefix sum array into 4 segments with each segment sum at least "size". It finally prints the maximum "size" found.

The most computationally intensive part of this code is the "calc" function which calls the "Find" function for each index of the sum array. The "Find" function performs three binary searches on the sum array to check if it can be divided into 4 segments. Thus, for each value of "size", the code performs approximately 3N log(N) operations.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The data structures used in the code are efficient and appropriate for the task. No changes are needed in this aspect.

2. Redundant Computations: The "Find" function is called for each index in the sum array. However, the "Find" function performs binary searches that could be avoided if we keep track of the minimum index that satisfies the condition for the previous index.

3. Loops or Recursive Calls: The loop in the "calc" function runs N times for each value of "size". We can reduce the number of iterations by using a two-pointers technique instead of binary searches.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The compiler should be able to optimize the code well without any specific hints.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Instead of using binary searches in the "Find" function, we can use a two-pointers technique. We maintain three pointers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` which represent the starting indices of the next three segments. Initially, they are all set to `pos`.

2. We increment `p1` until the sum from `pos` to `p1` is at least `size`. If we can't do this, we return `false`.

3. Similarly, we increment `p2` until the sum from `p1` to `p2` is at least `size`. If we can't do this, we return `false`.

4. Finally, we increment `p3` until the sum from `p2` to `p3` is at least `size`. If we can't do this, we return `false`.

5. If we have successfully incremented all three pointers, we return `true`.

6. This optimization reduces the time complexity of the "calc" function from O(N log N) to O(N), which significantly improves the running time of the code.

Trade-offs: The main trade-off of this optimization is that the code becomes a bit more complex and harder to understand. However, the significant performance gain outweighs this drawback.

Optimized Code Block:
```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
const int64 INF = 1LL << 58;
int N, A[200000];
int64 sum[200000];

bool calc(int64 size) {
  int p1 = 0, p2 = 0, p3 = 0;
  for (int pos = 0; pos < N; pos++) {
    while (p1 < 2*N && sum[p1] - sum[pos] < size) p1++;
    while (p2 < 2*N && sum[p2] - sum[p1] < size) p2++;
    while (p3 < 2*N && sum[p3] - sum[p2] < size) p3++;
    if (p3 != 2*N) return true;
  }
  return false;
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d", &N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    scanf("%d", A + i);
    A[N + i] = A[i];
  }
  sum[0] = A[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < 2 * N; i++) {
    sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + A[i];
  }
  int64 low = 0, high = INF;
  while (high != low) {
    int64 mid = (low + high + 1) >> 1;
    if (calc(mid))
      low = mid;
    else
      high = mid - 1;
  }
  printf("%lld\n", low);
}
```
This optimized code maintains the functionality of the original code and reduces the running time by minimizing the number of operations performed for each value of "size".
