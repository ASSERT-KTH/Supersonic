This program seems to be a solution to a complex problem involving a grid and various objects in the grid. Here's a summary of the potential performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies:

1. **Redundant memory allocation:** The 3D array `memo2[60][60][4]` is re-initialized in every iteration of the main loop. This is unnecessary and wastes time as the array is of fixed size and could be initialized once and reset as needed.

2. **Inefficient data structures:** The program uses a priority queue to store and retrieve data in sorted order. Depending on the number of elements and operations performed, this might be a performance bottleneck. For relatively small number of elements, an array or vector sorted with efficient sorting algorithms might perform better.

3. **Constant re-computation:** The program repeatedly calculates the same values in loops. For example, the calculation of `fkx + dx2[fway]`, `fky + dy2[fway]`, `fkx + dx2[tway]`, `fky + dy2[tway]` and more are repeated multiple times. These could be calculated once and stored in variables for reuse.

4. **Unnecessary computations:** Several computations are carried out even when they are not necessary. For example, in the nested loops where `atime` is calculated, the condition `if (field[gy][gx]) ok = false;` is checked in each iteration. If `ok` is set to `false`, the loops continue unnecessarily. The loops should break when `ok` becomes `false`.

5. **Compiler optimization:** The program doesn't use any compiler optimization flags or pragma directives. Compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` can greatly improve the performance of the program.

6. **Data retrieval from vector:** The program uses nested vectors to store data and retrieves data from these vectors multiple times. Data retrieval from a vector is an O(1) operation, but it can still slow down the program when done repeatedly in loops.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;
const int dx[4] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
const int dy[4] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
const int dx2[4] = {-1, 0, 2, 1};
const int dy2[4] = {0, 2, 1, -1};
struct aa {
  int x;
  int y;
  int turn;
};
int getdis(const vector<vector<int>> &field, const int fx, const int fy,
           const int gx, const int gy) {
  // ...
}
struct bb {
  int kx;
  int ky;
  int opway;
  int turn;
};
class Compare {
public:
  bool operator()(const bb &l, const bb &r) { return l.turn > r.turn; }
};
int memo2[60][60][4];

// Reset memo2 to default state
void reset_memo2() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 60; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 60; ++j) {
      for (int k = 0; k < 4; ++k) {
        memo2[i][j][k] = 999999;
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    reset_memo2();
    // ...
    while (!que.empty()) {
      bb atop(que.top());
      que.pop();
      const int fkx = atop.kx;
      const int fky = atop.ky;
      const int fway = atop.opway;
      const int fturn = atop.turn;

      int fkx_dx2_fway = fkx + dx2[fway];
      int fky_dy2_fway = fky + dy2[fway];
      
      // ...
      for (int tway = 0; tway < 4; ++tway) {
        if (fway == tway)
          continue;
        // ...
        for (int op = 0; op < 2; ++op) {
          // ...
          for (int lu = 0; lu < 2; ++lu) {
            int fx = fkx_dx2_fway;
            int fy = fky_dy2_fway;
            int gx = fkx + dx2[tway];
            int gy = fky + dy2[tway];
            // ...
            if (field[gy][gx]) {
              ok = false;
              break;
            }
            // ...
          }
          if (!ok) break;
        }
        // ...
      }
      // ...
    }
    // ...
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code reuses computed values and avoids unnecessary computations which should lead to a better performance. It also resets the `memo2` array in a separate function to avoid redundant memory allocations. However, this code is more complicated and harder to read, and debugging might be more difficult. Also, these optimization might not have a significant impact if the number of elements and the size of the data are small.
