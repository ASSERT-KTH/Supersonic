This C++ program appears to be implementing a sort of pathfinding with some specific rules, akin to a puzzle or maze-solving problem. The code is quite complex, and the performance can be improved with a few optimizations.

**Code Analysis**
1. The `getdis` function is called multiple times with the same parameters, which results in recalculating the same values again and again. This is a clear case of redundant computations which can be avoided.
2. The `getdis` function is using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is generally efficient for traversing graphs, but the way the visited nodes are checked can be improved.
3. The main part of the program is a while loop with several nested for loops. This results in high time complexity.
4. The code uses a lot of magic numbers (like 999999, 60, 4, etc.), which are not only bad for readability, but also can be inefficient in terms of memory and calculations.

**Optimization Strategy**
1. Memoization: As the same computations are performed multiple times, we can use a technique called memoization to store the results of expensive function calls and reusing the results when the same inputs occur again.
2. Efficient Data Structures for BFS: A BFS algorithm can be more efficient if we use a proper way to check if a node has been visited before. In this case, we can use a set data structure which allows checking the existence of an element in constant time.
3. Loop Optimization: The nested loops in the main part of the code can be optimized.
4. Constants and Types: Instead of using magic numbers, we can use named constants. Moreover, instead of using `int` for boolean field values, we can use `bool` which uses less memory.

**Optimization Steps**
1. Implement memoization in `getdis` function: Create a map data structure to store the results of `getdis` function. Before doing the actual calculations, check if the result for the given parameters is already stored in the map. If yes, return the stored result. If not, do the calculations and store the result in the map before returning it.
2. Use set in BFS: In `getdis` function, create a set to store visited nodes. Before visiting a node, check if it's already in the set. If yes, skip it. If not, add it to the set and visit it.
3. Optimize loops: Investigate the loops in the main part of the program and try to reduce their number or make them work more efficiently.
4. Use constants and bool type: Replace magic numbers with named constants. Change the type of field values from `int` to `bool`.

**Trade-offs**
The main trade-off of these optimizations is the increase of code complexity, especially with the introduction of memoization. However, considering the potential performance improvements, it should be worth it.
