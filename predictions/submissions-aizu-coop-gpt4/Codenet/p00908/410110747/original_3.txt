The provided C++ code appears to be implementing a version of the A* pathfinding algorithm. It uses a priority queue to find the shortest path in a 2D grid, where certain cells are marked as obstacles. There are several areas in this code where efficiency could be improved and memory usage could be optimized.

Here are the optimization strategies:

1. Data Structures: The 3D array `memo2` is initialized with a constant size of `60x60x4`, regardless of the actual size of the input. This could lead to significant unnecessary memory usage. An alternative would be to dynamically allocate this array based on the input size.

2. Redundant Computations: The code contains several redundant computations, particularly within the nested loops. For instance, the same calculations for `fx`, `fy`, `gx`, `gy` are repeated multiple times. These could be calculated once and stored in temporary variables.

3. Loops and Recursive Calls: The nested loops within the `getdis` function can be optimized by breaking early when a better path is found.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Instruct the compiler to optimize for speed with `-O3` and `-march=native` flags. For g++, this could be done by using the command `g++ -O3 -march=native`.

Here are the step-by-step optimizations:

1. Use dynamic array allocation for memo2:
   - Replace `int memo2[60][60][4];` with `int ***memo2;` and allocate memory dynamically based on the input size.

2. Store results of repeated computations in temporary variables:
   - Calculate `fx`, `fy`, `gx`, `gy` once and store them in variables.

3. Optimize loops:
   - Break the search loop in `getdis` function early when a better path is found.

4. Use compiler optimization flags:
   - `-O3` for speed optimization and `-march=native` for utilizing the full capabilities of the CPU.

Trade-offs: These optimizations might increase the complexity of the code, making it harder to read and maintain. For example, managing dynamic memory can be tricky and prone to memory leaks if not handled properly.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```c++
//...rest of the code

int main() {
  int H, W;
  cin >> H >> W;

  // Dynamic allocation
  int*** memo2 = new int**[H+2];
  for(int i = 0; i < H+2; ++i) {
    memo2[i] = new int*[W+2];
    for(int j = 0; j < W+2; ++j)
      memo2[i][j] = new int[4];
  }

  //...rest of the code

  // Calculate fx, fy, gx, gy once and store them in variables
  int fx = fkx + dx2[fway];
  int fy = fky + dy2[fway];
  int gx = fkx + dx2[tway];
  int gy = fky + dy2[tway];

  //...rest of the code

  // Break the search loop in getdis function early when a better path is found
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    const int nextx = atop.x + dx[i];
    const int nexty = atop.y + dy[i];
    if (!field[nexty][nextx]) {
      if (atop.turn + 1 < memo[nexty][nextx]) {
        memo[nexty][nextx] = atop.turn + 1;
        que.push(aa{nextx, nexty, atop.turn + 1});
        if (nextx == gx && nexty == gy) {
          ans = atop.turn + 1;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  //...rest of the code

  // Deallocate memory
  for(int i = 0; i < H+2; ++i) {
    for(int j = 0; j < W+2; ++j)
      delete [] memo2[i][j];
    delete [] memo2[i];
  }
  delete [] memo2;

  return 0;
}
```

Remember to use the `-O3 -march=native` compiler flags to further optimize the code.
