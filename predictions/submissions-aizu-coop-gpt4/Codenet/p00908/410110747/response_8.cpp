The given C++ code is a bit complicated and seems to be performing some kind of path finding algorithm on a 2D grid. The code contains nested loops and is using data structures like queue and priority queue, which might be causing performance bottlenecks. The use of a 3D array for memoization could also be optimized. 

Here is the optimization strategy:

1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The queue and priority queue used in the code can be replaced by a deque (double-ended queue) to improve performance. The deque data structure provides O(1) time complexity for both insertions and deletions at the end and beginning, while priority_queue and queue provide O(logn) time complexity for insertions.

2. **Redundant Computations:** There are plenty of calculations that are being performed multiple times. These include calculations within loops that do not depend on the loop variable. By moving these calculations outside the loop, performance can be improved.

3. **Loops and Recursion:** The code contains nested loops that are a common cause of performance issues. Loop unrolling can be used to decrease the overhead of loop control instructions, improving performance.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** Some compiler optimizations can be used to improve performance. For instance, the `-O3` optimization level can be used when compiling the code, which enables all `-O2` optimizations and also enables optimizations that are not valid for all standard-compliant programs.

5. **Memory Usage:** The 3D array `memo2` is using a lot of memory. The size of this array can be reduced by using a more efficient data structure such as a hash map, which will only store the necessary values and not the entire grid.

6. **Use of Constants:** The code uses a large constant value `999999` to represent infinity. This can be replaced with `std::numeric_limits<int>::max()` for clarity and to avoid potential overflow problems.
