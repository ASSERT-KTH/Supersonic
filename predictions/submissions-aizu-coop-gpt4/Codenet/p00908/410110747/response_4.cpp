**Code Analysis:**

The program is a pathfinder in a grid-based puzzle where an object needs to move from a start point to an end point. The code uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path. BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before going to the next level.

The program also uses a priority_queue to store the possible next steps, based on a custom comparison function, and a 3-dimensional array to store the minimum turns to reach each cell in each direction.

The major performance bottlenecks include:

1. The BFS algorithm: This algorithm can be slow if the grid is large, as it may need to explore a large number of nodes. 

2. The priority_queue is used to sort the possible next steps based on their total turns, which may be inefficient if the queue size is large.

3. The use of 3-dimensional array: This can be memory intensive if the dimensions are large. 

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. BFS algorithm: The BFS code is already quite optimized, but we can use some heuristics to guide the search. For example, we can use the A* search algorithm, which uses a heuristic to estimate the cost from the current node to the goal, and always selects the node with the lowest total cost (cost so far + estimated cost to goal).

2. Priority_queue: Instead of using a priority_queue, we can use a set or a heap to store the possible next steps, which can be more efficient in terms of time complexity.

3. 3-dimensional array: We can use a hash table instead of a 3-dimensional array to store the minimum turns to reach each cell in each direction. This can significantly reduce memory usage if the dimensions are large.

4. We can replace the multiple constants representing infinity (999999) with a single constant, which will make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

5. We can refactor the code to make it less nested and easier to read. This includes breaking down complex expressions and using meaningful variable names.

6. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler flags to optimize the code, such as -O2 or -O3 for gcc, which perform various optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, etc.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Replace the BFS algorithm with A* search algorithm: This will guide the search towards the goal and reduce the number of nodes that need to be explored. 

2. Replace the priority_queue with a set or a heap: This will reduce the time complexity of sorting the possible next steps.

3. Replace the 3-dimensional array with a hash table: This will reduce memory usage and potentially improve access times.

4. Replace the multiple constants representing infinity with a single constant: This will make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

5. Refactor the code to make it less nested and easier to read: This includes breaking down complex expressions and using meaningful variable names.

6. Use compiler flags to optimize the code: This includes using -O2 or -O3 for gcc, which perform various optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, etc. 

**Trade-offs:**

1. Using A* search algorithm requires a good heuristic, otherwise it may not improve performance and can even make it worse. 

2. Using a set or a heap instead of a priority_queue can improve time complexity, but it may increase code complexity.

3. Using a hash table instead of a 3-dimensional array can reduce memory usage, but it may increase code complexity and potentially decrease performance if the hash function is not good.

4. Refactoring the code to make it less nested and easier to read can improve maintainability, but it may not improve performance.

5. Using compiler flags to optimize the code can improve performance, but it can make the program less portable, as different compilers may not support the same flags.
