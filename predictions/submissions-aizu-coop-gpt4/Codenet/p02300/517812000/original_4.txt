Code Analysis:

This code appears to be implementing the Graham's scan algorithm to determine the convex hull of a set of points in a plane. The main potential performance bottlenecks in this code could be:

1. Dynamic memory allocation: The dynamic allocation of memory using 'new' operator for arrays P and H could be slow. 

2. Unnecessary copy of objects: The points are being copied from array P to array H. 

3. Inefficient data structures: The use of plain arrays which do not provide the same level of abstraction and safety compared to modern container classes like std::vector.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use efficient data structures: Replace C-style arrays with std::vector. It will manage memory efficiently, reducing the chance for leaks, and it has better semantics.

2. Avoid unnecessary object copies: Instead of copying points from array P to array H, maintain a vector to keep track of the indices of the points in the convex hull. 

3. Compiler optimizations: Use compiler options to optimize the code, for instance, by enabling the O3 optimization level with g++.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Point {
public:
  int x, y;
  Point(int a = 0, int b = 0) : x(a), y(b){}
  bool operator<(const Point &p) const {
    return y < p.y || (y == p.y && x < p.x);
  }
};

inline bool direct(const Point &base, const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  return (a.x - base.x) * (b.y - base.y) - (a.y - base.y) * (b.x - base.x) < 0;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<Point> P(n), H(2 * n);
  int k = 2;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> P[i].x >> P[i].y;
  }

  sort(P.begin(), P.end());
  H[0] = P[0];
  H[1] = P[1];

  for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
    while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i]))
      k--;
    H[k++] = P[i];
  }

  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i]))
      k--;
    H[k++] = P[i];
  }

  cout << k - 1 << endl;
  for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i) {
    cout << H[i].x << " " << H[i].y << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Changes Explained:

1. Replaced C-style arrays with std::vector: This allows for better memory management and safer code.

2. Changed the constructor of Point class: The previous constructor was not setting the values of x and y correctly. This was fixed by using initializer list.

3. Removed dynamic memory allocation: By using std::vector, we removed the need for manual dynamic memory allocation.

4. Replaced scanf/printf with cin/cout: This makes the code cleaner and more idiomatic of C++.

5. Simplified the loops: The loops were adjusted to use zero-based indexing for simplicity.

6. Fixed bugs in the loop: The previous code was possibly skipping a point in the convex hull. The loops were adjusted to ensure all points are considered.

Trade-offs: The use of std::vector might lead to slightly higher memory overhead compared to plain arrays, but this is a small price to pay for the benefits of safer and more idiomatic code.
