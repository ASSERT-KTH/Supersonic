Code Analysis:
The existing code constructs a convex hull from a set of points in 2D space. The main bottleneck in the code is the sort operation that has a time complexity of O(n log n). The code also uses dynamic allocation which may lead to memory fragmentation and slower running times. Furthermore, the code does not take advantage of any compiler optimizations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use stack data structure: We can use a stack data structure instead of a dynamic array to hold the points of the convex hull. This will reduce memory fragmentation and improve cache efficiency.

2. Use pragmas or compiler flags: We can use pragma directives or compiler flags to enable certain compiler optimizations like loop unrolling or function inlining.

3. Improve loop structure: The current loops in the code are not structured optimally. We can modify the structure of the loops to improve cache efficiency and reduce branch mispredictions.

4. Avoid unnecessary computations: We can avoid unnecessary computations by pre-computing certain values or reusing computed values.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <stack>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

class Point {
public:
  int x, y;
  Point(int a = 0, int b = 0) : x(a), y(b) {}
  bool operator<(const Point &p) const { return y < p.y || (y == p.y && x < p.x); }
};

inline bool direct(Point &base, Point &a, Point &b) {
  return (long long)(a.x - base.x) * (b.y - base.y) - (long long)(a.y - base.y) * (b.x - base.x) < 0;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  vector<Point> P(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d%d", &P[i].x, &P[i].y);
  }
  sort(P.begin(), P.end());

  stack<Point> H;
  H.push(P[0]);
  H.push(P[1]);

  for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
    while (H.size() >= 2) {
      Point top = H.top(); H.pop();
      Point next_top = H.top();
      if (direct(next_top, top, P[i]))
        H.push(top);
      else
        continue;
    }
    H.push(P[i]);
  }

  printf("%zu\n", H.size());
  while (!H.empty()) {
    printf("%d %d\n", H.top().x, H.top().y);
    H.pop();
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- I replaced dynamic array `H` with a stack as it's more efficient for this problem.
- I used vector `P` instead of a dynamic array for the same reasons.
- I changed the constructor of `Point` to initialize `x` and `y` properly.
- I changed the type of the `direct` function's return value to `long long` to avoid overflow.
- I simplified the loops and removed the redundant computations.
- I also modified the print statement to print the size of the stack, and then print and pop the elements of the stack.
