**Code Analysis:**
This program is an implementation of the Convex Hull algorithm using the Graham's Scan method. Here, the main performance bottlenecks are:

1. Memory Allocation: The dynamic memory allocation operation `new` is used to declare arrays P and H. This process is slower than stack allocation.
2. Data Structure: The `Point` class has a constructor which doesn't initialize the member variables correctly, which could lead to undefined behavior.
3. Unoptimized Loops: The loops in this program can be optimized for better performance.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. Use Stack Allocation: Instead of using dynamic memory allocation (`new`), we can use stack allocation which is faster. For this, we can use `std::vector`.
2. Fix the `Point` class: The constructor of the `Point` class does not initialize its member variables correctly. Fix this for correct behavior.
3. Loop Optimization: The loops can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary calculations. For example, the while loops can be replaced with if statements to avoid unnecessary iterations.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Stack Allocation: Replacing dynamic memory allocation with stack allocation is faster. For this, we can replace `Point *P;` and `Point *H;` with `vector<Point> P(n);` and `vector<Point> H(2*n);`. This operation is faster because stack memory is pre-allocated, whereas dynamic memory allocation requires a system call.

2. Fix `Point` class: The constructor is not initializing the member variables `x` and `y`. Instead it's initializing local variables. We can replace `int x = a;` and `int y = b;` with `x = a;` and `y = b;`.

3. Loop Optimization: The while loops in the program can be replaced with if statements to avoid unnecessary iterations. This is because the while loop checks the condition at each iteration, while the if statement checks only once. This can significantly improve performance in cases where the condition is often false.

**Trade-offs:**

1. Stack Allocation: While stack allocation is faster, it is limited by the size of the stack. Therefore, if 'n' is too large, this method will not work.
2. Loop Optimization: Replacing while loops with if statements can make the code less readable and more prone to errors. However, the performance gain usually outweighs these drawbacks.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
class Point {
public:
  int x, y;
  Point(int a = 0, int b = 0) : x(a), y(b) {}; // Fix the constructor
  bool operator<(const Point &p) const {
    return y < p.y || (y == p.y && x < p.x);
  }
};
inline bool direct(Point &base, Point &a, Point &b) {
  return (a.x - base.x) * (b.y - base.y) - (a.y - base.y) * (b.x - base.x) < 0;
}
int main() {
  int n, i;
  int k = 2;
  vector<Point> P(n); // Use stack allocation
  vector<Point> H(2*n); // Use stack allocation
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d%d", &P[i].x, &P[i].y);
  }
  sort(P.begin(), P.end());
  H[0] = P[0];
  H[1] = P[1];
  for (i = 0; i < n - 2; ++i) {
    if(k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i + 2])) // Loop Optimization
      k--;
    H[k++] = P[i + 2];
  }
  H[k++] = P[n - 2];
  for (i = n; i > 2; i--) {
    if(k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i - 3])) // Loop Optimization
      k--;
    H[k++] = P[i - 3];
  }
  printf("%d\n", k - 1);
  for (i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i) {
    printf("%d %d\n", H[i].x, H[i].y);
  }
  return 0;
}
