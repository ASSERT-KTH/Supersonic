## Code Analysis:

This code seems to be implementing the Graham's scan algorithm, which is used to find the convex hull of a set of points in the plane. A convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points of the set.

The main optimization opportunities here are:

1. The constructor of `Point`. It's not correctly setting the member variables `x` and `y`.
2. Dynamic memory allocation with new. This could be replaced with `std::vector` to manage the memory more efficiently and safely.
3. The use of `scanf` and `printf` for input/output. These functions are slower than the C++ standard library's `cin` and `cout`.
4. The use of post-increment (`k++`) in the loops. This is slower than pre-increment (`++k`).
5. The use of `sort` function. We can make use of `std::sort` with a custom comparator to sort the points.

## Optimization Strategy:

1. Correct the constructor of `Point` to initialize member variables `x` and `y`.
2. Replace dynamic memory allocation with `new` by `std::vector`.
3. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`.
4. Replace post-increment (`k++`) with pre-increment (`++k`).
5. Use `std::sort` with a custom comparator to sort the points.

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. The constructor of `Point` is intended to initialize member variables `x` and `y`, but it is not doing so. We should replace `int x = a;` and `int y = b;` with `x = a;` and `y = b;` respectively.
2. Using `new` for memory allocation can lead to memory leaks if not de-allocated properly. It's safer and more efficient to use `std::vector` instead. It automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation.
3. `scanf` and `printf` are slower than `cin` and `cout`. So, we replace them for better performance.
4. `k++` creates a copy of `k`, increments the original `k`, and then returns the copy. This is slower than `++k`, which just increments `k` and returns it.
5. `std::sort` can take a custom comparator to sort the points. This will make the code cleaner and more efficient.

## Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
class Point {
public:
  int x, y;
  Point(int a = 0, int b = 0) : x(a), y(b) {}
  bool operator<(const Point &p) const {
    return y < p.y || (y == p.y && x < p.x);
  }
};
inline bool direct(Point &base, Point &a, Point &b) {
  return (a.x - base.x) * (b.y - base.y) - (a.y - base.y) * (b.x - base.x) < 0;
}
int main() {
  int n, i;
  int k = 2;
  vector<Point> P, H;
  cin >> n;
  P.resize(n);
  for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    cin >> P[i - 1].x >> P[i - 1].y;
  }
  sort(P.begin(), P.end());
  H.resize(2 * n);
  H[0] = P[0];
  H[1] = P[1];
  for (i = 0; i < n - 2; ++i) {
    while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i + 2]))
      --k;
    H[k++] = P[i + 2];
  }
  H[++k] = P[n - 2];
  for (i = n; i > 2; --i) {
    while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i - 3]))
      --k;
    H[k++] = P[i - 3];
  }
  cout << k - 1 << "\n";
  for (i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i) {
    cout << H[i].x << " " << H[i].y << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized code should run faster and use memory more efficiently than the original code.
