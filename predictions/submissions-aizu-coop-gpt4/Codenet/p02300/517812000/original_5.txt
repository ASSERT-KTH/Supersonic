Here's the Code Analysis:

1. The constructor of the Point class is incorrect. The x and y should be member variables, but they are declared anew as local variables. This means the x and y of a Point object are never initialized.

2. The memory allocated for P and H is not being freed, which would cause memory leaks.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Fix the constructor of the Point class to assign values to the member variables, instead of creating new local variables.

2. Free the memory allocated by the new keyword when it's no longer needed.

3. Use vector instead of a pointer to dynamically allocate memory for P and H. Vectors are easier to manage in terms of memory, and they automatically deallocate memory when destroyed.

4. Make use of const reference in the direct function to avoid unnecessary copy of Point objects.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Point {
public:
  int x, y;
  Point(int a = 0, int b = 0) : x(a), y(b) {};
  bool operator<(const Point &p) const {
    return y < p.y || (y == p.y && x < p.x);
  }
};

inline bool direct(const Point &base, const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  return (a.x - base.x) * (b.y - base.y) - (a.y - base.y) * (b.x - base.x) < 0;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  
  vector<Point> P(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d%d", &P[i].x, &P[i].y);
  }
  
  sort(P.begin(), P.end());
  
  vector<Point> H(2 * n);
  int k = 2;
  H[0] = P[0];
  H[1] = P[1];
  
  for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
    while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i]))
      k--;
    H[k++] = P[i];
  }
  
  for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; --i) {
    while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i]))
      k--;
    H[k++] = P[i];
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", k - 1);
  for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i) {
    printf("%d %d\n", H[i].x, H[i].y);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The constructor of Point is fixed to correctly assign the values to the member variables.

2. The memory leaks are prevented by replacing the raw pointers with vectors, which automatically deallocate memory when the variables go out of scope.

3. The use of the const reference in the direct function avoids unnecessary copying of Point objects, improving the performance a little bit.

4. The loops in the main function are updated to start from the correct indices. This improves the readability of the code and also ensures the correct behavior of the program.
