The given program appears to be solving a variant of the All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) problem, possibly a problem where it is required to find the minimum distance between certain pairs of nodes (those in the set `rei`) in a graph, with a twist of considering a maximum limit `m` for some paths.

The main performance bottlenecks in this code are:

1. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm for APSP, which has a time complexity of O(n^3), is being run twice.
2. The use of a `set` for keeping track of special nodes. Sets in C++ are typically implemented as balanced binary search trees and operations like insertion and lookup have a time complexity of O(log n) in the worst case.
3. Use of dynamic arrays `x` and `b` with size [n][n]. This can lead to high memory consumption for large values of `n`.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Instead of running the Floyd-Warshall algorithm twice, we can run it only once and keep track of the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes. In the second run, we can simply iterate over the special nodes and update the distances if necessary.

2. Instead of using a `set` to keep track of the special nodes, we can use a `vector` and a `bool` array. Insertions and lookups in a `vector` are O(1) operations, and we can use the `bool` array to check whether a node is special in O(1) time.

3. To reduce memory consumption, we can use a single matrix for storing the shortest paths, instead of two. 

4. Use a map for storing the distances between special nodes instead of a matrix.

5. It is also recommended to split the main function into smaller subfunctions to make the code more readable and maintainable.

6. Remove the usage of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;` as they are considered bad practice. Include only the necessary libraries and use the `std::` prefix where necessary.
