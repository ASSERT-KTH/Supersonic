The given C++ program is a graph-based problem which uses Floyd Warshall's algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights. The graph is represented using adjacency matrix. The problem also involves identifying special nodes (rei) which are of interest for the shortest path computation.

The overall time complexity of the code is O(n^3) due to Floyd Warshall's algorithm and it also uses a lot of space for storing the adjacency matrices.

Here are the optimization strategies that we can use:

1. Use an Adjacency List instead of an Adjacency Matrix: The current implementation uses an adjacency matrix to represent the graph which is not space efficient for sparse graphs. An adjacency list can be used to represent the graph which will reduce the memory usage significantly for sparse graphs.

2. Use a Shortest Path Algorithm suited for Sparse Graphs: Floyd Warshall's algorithm is not the best choice for sparse graphs. Algorithms like Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford's can be better choices depending on whether the graph can have negative weights.

3. Remove the redundant computation of shortest paths: The shortest paths between all pairs of nodes are computed twice. This is unnecessary and can be avoided.

4. Use more efficient data structures for rei: The set data structure is used to store the nodes of interest. This can be replaced by a boolean array which will be more space efficient and will have constant time for insertion and lookup.

5. Use compiler optimizations: Certain compiler flags like -O2 or -O3 can be used to enable the compiler to make optimizations.

6. Avoid unnecessary use of macros: Macros like `#define r(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)` which are used for loops can be avoided. They may increase the readability of the code but they don't offer any performance benefits.

Trade-offs:
1. Using an adjacency list and suitable shortest path algorithm will make the code more complex.
2. The optimized code will have better performance for large and sparse graphs but may have worse performance for small and dense graphs.
3. The use of compiler flags can make the code less portable.
