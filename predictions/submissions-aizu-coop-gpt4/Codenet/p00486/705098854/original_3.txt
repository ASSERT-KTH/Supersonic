This C++ program appears to compute the sum of Manhattan distances from a series of points to a central point, then reports the minimum such sum and the corresponding central point.

1. Analysis:
    - The program uses dynamic memory allocation with the "new" keyword, which is slower than stack allocation.
    - The nested for loops (f2 and f3) can introduce unnecessary computations.
    - The condition checking in the loop for calculating the sum and max can be avoided.
    - The use of vectors and arrays can be simplified.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - Replace dynamic memory allocation with stack-based memory allocation.
    - Minimize redundant or unnecessary computations by restructuring the nested for loops.
    - Avoid condition checking inside the loop for maximum efficiency.
    - Simplify the use of vectors and arrays.

3. Step-by-step Explanation:

    1. Dynamic to Stack Memory Allocation: The use of the "new" keyword for dynamic memory allocation can be replaced with stack-based memory allocation. This will likely result in faster execution as dynamic memory allocation involves system calls and is generally slower than stack allocation.
    
    2. Restructure Nested Loops: The nested loops for f2 and f3 can be simplified by directly assigning the values they iterate over, as they only take on two values: 0 and 1.
    
    3. Avoid Inside-Loop Condition Checking: The if condition inside the loop for calculating sum and max can be avoided by initializing osum to the maximum possible value for a long long type. This way, the condition will always be true for the first iteration, and we don't need a separate case for osum == 0.
    
    4. Simplify Array and Vector Usage: The 2D array `oxy` and the double pointers `LXY` is overcomplicated for the task at hand. We can simplify this by using just a single array to store the x and y coordinates. The vectors XY can be replaced by arrays, which avoids the overhead of dynamic size management.

4. Optimized Code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  long long L, w, h, HL, temp, sum, max, osum=LLONG_MAX, f1, f2, f3, ox, oy, dx, dy;
  long long LXY[2][5000], oxy[2][2];

  scanf("%lld %lld", &w, &h);
  scanf("%lld", &L);
  
  for (f1 = 0; f1 < L; f1++)
    scanf("%lld %lld", &LXY[0][f1], &LXY[1][f1]);
  
  stable_sort(LXY[0], LXY[0] + L);
  stable_sort(LXY[1], LXY[1] + L);
  
  HL = (L + 1) / 2;
  if (L == 1) {
    printf("0\n");
    printf("%lld %lld\n", LXY[0][0], LXY[1][0]);
  } else {
    for (f1 = 0; f1 < 2; f1++) {
      oxy[0][f1] = LXY[f1][HL - 1];
      oxy[1][f1] = LXY[f1][HL];
    }
    dx = (oxy[0][0] == oxy[1][0]) ? 1 : 2;
    dy = (oxy[0][1] == oxy[1][1]) ? 1 : 2;
    
    for (f2 = 0; f2 < dx; f2++) {
      for (f3 = 0; f3 < dy; f3++) {
        sum = 0LL;
        max = 0LL;
        for (f1 = 0; f1 < L; f1++) {
          temp = (long long)abs(LXY[0][f1] - oxy[f2][0]) +
                 (long long)abs(LXY[1][f1] - oxy[f3][1]);
          sum += temp;
          if (max < temp)
            max = temp;
        }
        sum *= 2;
        sum -= max;
        if (osum > sum) {
          osum = sum;
          ox = oxy[f2][0];
          oy = oxy[f3][1];
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%lld\n", osum);
    printf("%lld %lld\n", ox, oy);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version reduces memory usage and eliminates unnecessary computations, resulting in a more efficient program.
