Code Analysis:

The code provided above takes width (w), height (h), and a number (L) as input, along with L pairs of long long integers. The pairs are stored in a 2D array and two vectors. The vectors are then sorted, and some computations are performed based on the middle elements of the sorted vectors. The result of these computations is printed out.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Unnecessary Memory Allocation: The code allocates memory for LXY (a 2D array) and also stores the same values in two vectors (XY[0] and XY[1]). This is unnecessary and a waste of memory. We can avoid creating the array LXY and directly store the inputs in the vectors.

2. Unnecessary Sorting: The code sorts the vectors but only uses the middle elements. Instead of sorting, we can use nth_element function to find the middle elements. This will improve the time complexity from O(n log n) to O(n).

3. Redundant Computations: The code calculates the sum and max in a nested loop. This involves redundant computation of the absolute difference between the elements and the middle elements. We can store these differences in a vector to avoid redundant computations.

Optimization Steps:

1. Remove the memory allocation for LXY and directly push the inputs into vectors XY[0] and XY[1].

```c++
for (f1 = 0; f1 < L; f1++) {
  scanf("%lld %lld", &ox, &oy);
  XY[0].push_back(ox);
  XY[1].push_back(oy);
}
```

2. Use nth_element to find the middle elements in the vectors.

```c++
nth_element(XY[0].begin(), XY[0].begin() + HL - 1, XY[0].end());
nth_element(XY[1].begin(), XY[1].begin() + HL - 1, XY[1].end());
oxy[0][0] = XY[0][HL - 1];
oxy[1][0] = XY[1][HL - 1];
if(HL < L){
  nth_element(XY[0].begin(), XY[0].begin() + HL, XY[0].end());
  nth_element(XY[1].begin(), XY[1].begin() + HL, XY[1].end());
  oxy[0][1] = XY[0][HL];
  oxy[1][1] = XY[1][HL];
}
```

3. Compute the absolute differences between the elements and the middle elements, and store these in a vector.

```c++
vector<long long> diff(L);
for (f1 = 0; f1 < L; f1++) {
  diff[f1] = (long long)abs(XY[0][f1] - oxy[f2][0]) + abs(XY[1][f1] - oxy[f3][1]);
}
```

4. Compute sum and max using the differences stored in the vector.

```c++
for (f1 = 0; f1 < L; f1++) {
  sum += diff[f1];
  if (max < diff[f1])
    max = diff[f1];
}
```

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all possible combinations of middle elements.
