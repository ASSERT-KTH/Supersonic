**Code Analysis:**
This program appears to calculate a kind of "sum of distances" from certain points to a central point in a two-dimensional grid. The code is generally clean and has no immediately apparent performance issues, but there are some potential sources of inefficiency.

1. The code uses dynamic allocation to create arrays for storing coordinates. This is slow and can lead to memory fragmentation. It also creates unnecessary complexity when managing the memory.

2. The code makes use of the `std::vector` container for storing coordinates, which is then sorted. However, the sorting of the coordinates might not be necessary and can be a costly operation.

3. The use of `long long` data types might be excessive, depending on the range of the values that will be processed.

4. The code contains redundant computations in the nested loops where it calculates the sum of distances.

**Optimization Strategy:**

A1. Replace dynamic allocation of arrays with static allocation, if possible. This will save time and avoid potential memory leakage.

A2. It is not clear why the coordinates are being sorted. If we can eliminate the need for sorting, we can improve performance. If sorting is necessary, we should verify whether `std::stable_sort` is needed or if the faster `std::sort` will suffice.

A3. Replace `long long` with `int` if the range of the values allows it.

A4. Avoid redundant computations by calculating the sum of distances in a more efficient way.

**Optimization Explanation:**

Step 1: Replace dynamic allocation with static allocation. This is straightforward and reduces the complexity of the code. However, if L can be very large, we should keep the dynamic allocation to avoid stack overflow.

Step 2: Investigate the need for sorting. Sorting is an O(n log n) operation and should be avoided if possible. If sorting is needed, check if we can use `std::sort` instead of `std::stable_sort`, as the former is usually faster.

Step 3: If the values of coordinates and L are within the range of `int`, we can replace `long long` with `int` to save memory and potentially improve performance.

Step 4: The nested loops where the sum of distances is calculated contain redundant computations. We can replace them with a single loop and calculate the sum and maximum distance in one pass. This will reduce the number of operations from 2n to n, which can significantly improve performance if L is large.

**Trade-offs:**

These optimizations should improve the performance of the code without any significant drawbacks. However, if L can be very large, we should not replace dynamic allocation with static allocation to avoid stack overflow. Also, if the order of the coordinates in the output matters, we should not replace `std::stable_sort` with `std::sort`.

**Optimized Code Block:**

Please note that without knowing the exact requirements of the program, some of the proposed optimizations might not be applicable. The following code assumes that L is not very large and that the order of the coordinates in the output does not matter.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  long long sum = 0LL, osum = 0LL;
  long long f1, f2, f3, w, h, L, HL, temp, oxy[2][2], ox, oy, max = 0, dx, dy;
  long long LXY[2][1000];  // assuming L is not very large
  scanf("%lld %lld", &w, &h);
  scanf("%lld", &L);
  for (f1 = 0; f1 < L; f1++)
    scanf("%lld %lld", &LXY[0][f1], &LXY[1][f1]);
  HL = (L + 1) / 2;
  if (L == 1) {
    printf("0\n");
    printf("%lld %lld\n", LXY[0][0], LXY[1][0]);
  } else {
    for (f1 = 0; f1 < 2; f1++) {
      nth_element(LXY[f1], LXY[f1] + HL, LXY[f1] + L);
      oxy[0][f1] = LXY[f1][HL - 1];
      oxy[1][f1] = LXY[f1][HL];
    }
    dx = (oxy[0][0] == oxy[1][0]) ? 1 : 2;
    dy = (oxy[0][1] == oxy[1][1]) ? 1 : 2;
    for (f2 = 0; f2 < dx; f2++) {
      for (f3 = 0; f3 < dy; f3++) {
        sum = 0LL;
        max = 0LL;
        for (f1 = 0; f1 < L; f1++) {
          temp = (long long)abs(LXY[0][f1] - oxy[f2][0]) + abs(LXY[1][f1] - oxy[f3][1]);
          sum += temp;
          if (max < temp)
            max = temp;
        }
        sum *= 2;
        sum -= max;
        if (osum == 0 || osum > sum) {
          osum = sum;
          ox = oxy[f2][0];
          oy = oxy[f3][1];
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%lld\n", osum);
    printf("%lld %lld\n", ox, oy);
  }
  return 0;
}
