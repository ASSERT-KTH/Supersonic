## Code Analysis

The code given seems to be a C++ solution for a competitive programming problem. It reads a list of coordinates, sorts them, and then finds a point that minimizes the sum of distances from this point to all other points. The distance is calculated using the Manhattan distance.

1. Firstly, the code is creating a dynamic 2D array `LXY` and two vectors `XY[0]` and `XY[1]`.
2. It reads the coordinates into `LXY` and copies them into `XY`.
3. It sorts `XY` using `stable_sort`.
4. Then, it calculates the sum of distances from all the points to the middle points of the sorted lists. The middle points are stored in the `oxy` array.
5. This sum is updated if a smaller one is found. After all calculations, it prints out the smallest sum and the coordinates that lead to this sum.

## Optimization Strategy

1. **Remove Redundancy and Improve Data Structures:** The `LXY` dynamic 2D array and `XY` vector arrays contain the same elements. This is a redundancy and we can remove the `XY` vectors and perform sorting directly on the `LXY` array. This can save memory and reduce the time complexity of copying elements from `LXY` to `XY`.

2. **Improve Sorting:** `stable_sort` function is used which has a worst-case complexity of O(n log^2 n). Using `std::sort` can improve performance as it has a worst-case complexity of O(n log n). Since the order of equal elements does not seem to be important in this case, `std::sort` can be used.

3. **Compiler Optimizations:** Use compiler flags like `-O2` which turns on all optimization flags.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Remove Redundancy and Improve Data Structures:** We'll start by removing the `XY` vectors and use the `LXY` array for sorting. This will improve the memory usage as we're reducing the redundancy. Additionally, it will reduce the time complexity because we're avoiding the unnecessary copying of elements.

2. **Improve Sorting:** Next, we'll replace `stable_sort` with `std::sort`. Stable sort maintains the relative order of equal elements, which is not necessary for our case. `std::sort` has better performance compared to `stable_sort` and since relative order does not matter here, we can use `std::sort`.

3. **Compiler Optimizations:** Finally, we'll suggest using the `-O2` compiler flag. This flag enables all optimization flags, which can further improve the performance of the program.

## Optimized Code Block

After applying the above optimization strategies, we get the following optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  long long sum = 0LL, osum = 0LL;
  long long f1, f2, f3, w, h, L, HL, temp, oxy[2][2], *LXY[2], ox, oy, max = 0,
                                                                       dx, dy;
  scanf("%lld %lld", &w, &h);
  scanf("%lld", &L);
  for (f1 = 0; f1 < 2; f1++)
    LXY[f1] = new long long[L];
  for (f1 = 0; f1 < L; f1++) {
    scanf("%lld %lld", &LXY[0][f1], &LXY[1][f1]);
  }
  sort(LXY[0], LXY[0] + L);
  sort(LXY[1], LXY[1] + L);
  HL = (L + 1) / 2;
  if (L == 1) {
    printf("0\n");
    printf("%lld %lld\n", LXY[0][0], LXY[1][0]);
  } else {
    for (f1 = 0; f1 < 2; f1++) {
      oxy[0][f1] = LXY[f1][HL - 1];
      oxy[1][f1] = LXY[f1][HL];
    }
    dx = (oxy[0][0] == oxy[1][0]) ? 1 : 2;
    dy = (oxy[0][1] == oxy[1][1]) ? 1 : 2;
    for (f2 = 0; f2 < dx; f2++) {
      for (f3 = 0; f3 < dy; f3++) {
        sum = 0LL;
        max = 0LL;
        for (f1 = 0; f1 < L; f1++) {
          temp = (long long)abs(LXY[0][f1] - oxy[f2][0]) +
                 abs(LXY[1][f1] - oxy[f3][1]);
          sum += temp;
          if (max < temp)
            max = temp;
        }
        sum *= 2;
        sum -= max;
        if (osum == 0 || osum > sum) {
          osum = sum;
          ox = oxy[f2][0];
          oy = oxy[f3][1];
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%lld\n", osum);
    printf("%lld %lld\n", ox, oy);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
