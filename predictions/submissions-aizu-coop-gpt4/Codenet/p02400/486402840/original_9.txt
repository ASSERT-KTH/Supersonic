1. Code Analysis:
This is a simple program that calculates the area (s) and circumference (l) of a circle given its radius (r). The computational complexity is O(1), meaning this program runs in constant time, regardless of the input size. It also uses a constant amount of memory. Therefore, there are no significant performance bottlenecks or memory inefficiencies. However, the code does have room for minor improvements.

2. Optimization Strategy:
A. The variable `x` is used to store the value of pi. This is a constant value that could be defined as a constant variable, which would make the code more readable and slightly more efficient.
B. The calculation of the circumference `l` adds `r` to itself, which is unnecessary and can be replaced by multiplying `r` by 2.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
A. Defining `x` as a constant: Defining `x` as a constant enables the compiler to optimize memory usage and performance. It will also improve code readability by providing a descriptive name for the value it represents. The trade-off is negligible in this case; it doesn't increase code complexity, and it slightly improves performance.
B. Optimizing the calculation of `l`: Rather than adding `r` to itself, we can multiply `r` by 2. This is a micro-optimization that might improve performance slightly on some systems, and it makes the code slightly more readable.

4. Optimized Code Block:
Here is the optimized code based on the optimizations explained above.

```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const double PI = 3.141592653589; // PI is more descriptive than x and defined as constant

int main() {
  double r, s, l;
  cin >> r;
  
  s = r * r * PI; // calculate area
  l = 2 * r * PI; // calculate circumference
  
  printf("%.8lf %.8lf\n", s, l);
}
```
This code preserves the functionality and output of the original code, but it is slightly more efficient and easier to understand.
