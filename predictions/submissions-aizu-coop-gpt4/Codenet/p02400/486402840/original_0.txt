The given program is a simple C++ program which calculates the area (s) and circumference (l) of a circle given its radius (r). The value of π (pi) is approximated as 3.141592653589 in variable x. 

The program seems to be quite efficient already. However, here are some points where we can further optimize it:

1. Redundant Computations: The computation r + r for calculating circumference can be replaced with 2 * r which might be slightly faster because addition operations are slower than multiplication operations in most processors.

2. Use of Constants: The value of π is a constant and it can be declared as such. This might give a hint to the compiler to optimize the code further.

3. I/O Operations: The iostream library is slower compared to cstdio. We can replace the cin operation with scanf for faster input.

4. Magic Numbers: The value of π is currently a magic number in the code. It is a good practice to define such numbers as named constants to increase code readability.

5. Precision of π: The precision of π can be increased to improve the accuracy of the calculations.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#define PI 3.141592653589793238

int main() {
  double r, s, l;
  scanf("%lf", &r);
  s = r * r * PI;
  l = 2 * PI * r;
  printf("%.8lf %.8lf\n", s, l);
  return 0;
}
```

Changes Made:

1. Replaced r + r with 2 * r.
2. Declared PI as a constant macro with a more accurate value.
3. Replaced cin with scanf for faster input.
4. Removed the unnecessary variable x.

The proposed changes are minimal, preserve the functionality of the original code, and enhance the performance slightly. Note that due to the already efficient nature of the original program, the performance improvement might not be significant.
