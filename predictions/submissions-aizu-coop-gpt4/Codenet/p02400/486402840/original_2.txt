The provided code seems to be a simple C++ program that takes a radius of a circle from the user and calculates the area (s) and circumference (l) of the circle. Given the simplicity of the program, there's not much to optimize in terms of performance or memory usage. However, small improvements can be made both in terms of code readability and precision of calculation.

1. Code Analysis:
   The code reads a double value from the input, calculates the area and circumference of a circle with that radius, and prints the results. The code is simple and there are no apparent performance bottlenecks nor inefficient memory usage.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   Although the code is simple, we can make a few adjustments to improve it:
   A. `3.141592653589` is a manually written approximation of pi, which might lead to precision errors. We can use `M_PI` from the `cmath` library instead, which is a more precise representation of pi.
   B. Redundant operations can be minimized. For example, `r+r` can be replaced by `2*r`. 
   C. Use `std::cout` instead of `printf` for consistency as we are using `std::cin` for taking the input. This isn't a performance optimization, but it improves consistency in the style of the code.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   A. Using `M_PI` from the `cmath` library: The `cmath` library in C++ provides a predefined constant `M_PI` which is the value of pi up to greater precision than what is manually written in the code.
   B. Minimizing redundant operations: The expression `r+r` can be simplified to `2*r`. This reduces the number of addition operations.
   C. Using `std::cout` instead of `printf`: We are using `std::cin` for input. For consistency, we should use `std::cout` for output. This is more of a style preference rather than a performance optimization.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  double r, s, l;
  cin >> r;

  s = r * r * M_PI;
  l = 2 * r * M_PI;

  cout.precision(9);
  cout << fixed << s << " " << l << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```
This code preserves the functionality of the original code, while improving the precision of the calculations and the consistency of the code style.
