1. Code Analysis: 
The provided code is a simple C++ program that calculates the area and circumference of a circle given its radius. The code reads the radius from the standard input, computes the area and circumference using the formulae `area = π*r²` and `circumference = 2*π*r` respectively, and then prints the results. The code is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious performance bottlenecks. However, there are a few minor areas that could be optimized, mainly for the sake of code readability and maintainability.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. There is no need to store the value of π in the variable `x`. It can be used directly in the calculations.
    2. Similarly, the variables `s` and `l` are used only once. Their usage can be eliminated by directly printing the results of calculations.
    3. The C++ `std::cout` can be used for printing, which is more idiomatic than `printf` and does not require format specifiers.
    4. The code could benefit from better variable names and comments to improve readability and maintainability.
    5. The constant value of π could be declared as a constant.
  
3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Remove the variable `x` and use the π value directly in the calculations. This simplifies the code and eliminates the need to store the π value in a separate variable. 
    2. Remove the variables `s` and `l` and print the results of calculations directly. This saves memory by eliminating the need for extra variables. 
    3. Replace `printf` with `std::cout` for printing the results. This makes the code more idiomatic and easier to read and maintain.
    4. Rename the variable `r` to `radius` to improve code readability.
    5. Declare the π value as a constant.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Define constant for pi
    const double PI = 3.141592653589;

    // Input the radius
    double radius;
    cin >> radius;

    // Calculate and print the area
    cout << setprecision(8) << fixed << PI * radius * radius << " ";

    // Calculate and print the circumference
    cout << 2 * PI * radius << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
This optimized code performs the same task as the original code but is more readable and maintainable. It also does not use extra variables, which saves a small amount of memory. Please note that the performance improvement is minimal because the original code was simple and did not have any major performance bottlenecks.
