1. Code Analysis:

   The given code is a simple program that calculates the area (s) and circumference (l) of a circle given the radius (r). The code is almost as efficient as it can be already. However, there are small performance improvements that can be made.

2. Optimization Strategy:

   A. The value of 'x' or PI is a constant and it is advisable to define it as such for clarity and potential optimization by the compiler.
   
   B. The operation 'r + r' can be replaced by '2 * r' which should be slightly faster.
   
   C. The 'printf' function is slower than 'cout'. Since we already have the 'iostream' library included, we can use 'cout' instead.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   A. Defining PI as a constant: The constant value PI is used in multiple calculations. Defining it as a constant can enable the compiler to perform certain optimizations and it makes the code more readable and maintainable.

   B. Replace 'r + r' with '2 * r': The operation of multiplication by 2 is generally faster than addition. 

   C. Replace 'printf' with 'cout': The 'printf' function is slower and more complex than 'cout'. It is also safer to use 'cout' as it is type-safe.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// PI is a constant, define it as such for clarity and potential compiler optimization
const double PI = 3.141592653589;

int main() {
  double r, s, l;
  cin >> r;

  s = r * r * PI;
  l = 2 * PI * r;

  // Use 'cout' instead of 'printf' for output. It is type-safe and generally faster.
  cout.precision(8);
  cout << fixed << s << " " << l << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version does exactly the same thing as the original code, but it should run slightly faster and be more readable and maintainable. The potential downside is that these micro-optimizations may not make a noticeable difference in running time for this simple program, but they are good practices to follow in general.
