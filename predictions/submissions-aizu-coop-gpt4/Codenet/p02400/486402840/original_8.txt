This is a simple program that calculates the area and circumference of a circle with radius r. It doesn't contain any significant performance bottlenecks, as the computational complexity is O(1). However, there are a few minor improvements that can be made:

1. **Avoid using namespace std**: By default, the global namespace std is used throughout the program. This could lead to name clashes, which may result in unexpected behavior or compilation errors. It's a good practice to specify the namespace for specific objects.

2. **Use const for fixed values**: The value of Pi (x) is a constant and shouldn't be reassigned. Therefore, designating it as a constant will ensure that it's not accidentally changed. Also, the compiler can optimize code around constant values better.

3. **Minimize the use of intermediate variables**: The variables s and l are unnecessary and can be eliminated. The calculations can be directly used in the printf statement. This reduces memory usage.

4. **Use more precise Pi value**: The standard library has a constant M_PI for Ï€ in the cmath library which is more precise than the one used in the program.

5. **Use cin and cout consistently**: The code uses both cin/cout (from iostream) and printf (from cstdio) for input/output. It's better to be consistent and use one or the other, but not both. 

6. **Use std::endl for line breaks**: It's better to use std::endl instead of "\n" to ensure that the output is flushed and visible immediately.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    double r;
    std::cin >> r;
    const double pi = M_PI;
    std::cout << std::fixed;
    std::cout.precision(8);
    std::cout << r * r * pi << std::endl << pi * (r + r) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code does exactly the same as the original but with slightly better practices and minor performance improvements.
