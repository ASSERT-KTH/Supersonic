1. Code Analysis:

The given C++ program calculates the area (s) and circumference (l) of a circle given the radius (r) as input. The program uses the value of pi (x) in the calculations.

Upon analyzing the code, it is observed that the code is already quite efficient. There are no memory leaks or unnecessary computations. However, there are a few minor improvements that can be made in terms of code readability and efficiency.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Use of Preprocessor Directive - The value of pi is a constant and can be defined using a preprocessor directive.

B. Direct Calculation - Instead of calculating the circumference using x * (r + r), we can use 2 * x * r directly.

C. Use of C++ Standard Library - Instead of using printf, we can use cout with setprecision to print the result. This makes the code more consistent as we're already using cin for input.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Use of Preprocessor Directive - By defining pi as a constant using a preprocessor directive, we ensure that the value is not modified during the execution of the program. This is a good programming practice and also makes the code more readable.

B. Direct Calculation - By using 2 * x * r to calculate the circumference, we decrease the number of operations from three (addition, multiplication, and multiplication) to two (multiplication and multiplication). This might give a tiny boost in terms of performance.

C. Use of C++ Standard Library - The use of cout with setprecision makes the code more consistent and readable, and it doesn't affect the performance of our program.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

#define PI 3.141592653589

using namespace std;

int main() {
  double r, s, l;
  cin >> r;
  s = r * r * PI;
  l = 2 * PI * r;
  cout << fixed << setprecision(8) << s << " " << l << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
