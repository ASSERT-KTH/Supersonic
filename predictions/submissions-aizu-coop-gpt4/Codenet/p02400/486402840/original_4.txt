Code Analysis: 
The provided code is a simple program that calculates and prints the area (s) and circumference (l) of a circle given its radius (r). The code is quite straightforward and doesn't seem to have any obvious performance bottlenecks. However, there are still a few areas that can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory usage: The variable `x` is used to store the value of pi, which is then used to calculate the area and circumference. This could be avoided by using the built-in constant `M_PI` from the cmath library.

2. Use constants where possible: The value of pi, which is used for calculation, is a constant. Defining it as a const will hint the compiler that its value will not change, which can allow for further optimizations.

3. Use iostream consistently: The code uses both `cin`/`cout` (from `iostream`) and `printf` (from `cstdio`) for input/output. It's best to use one consistently. Here, we can replace `printf` with `cout` for consistent use of `iostream`.

Step by Step Explanation:

1. Remove the variable `x` and use the constant `M_PI` from the cmath library: This reduces unnecessary memory usage and the need for an additional multiplication operation.

2. Define pi as a const: This tells the compiler that the value of pi is not going to change, which could allow the compiler to perform further optimizations.

3. Replace `printf` with `cout`: This is more of a code consistency issue than a performance optimization. Using `printf` requires including another library (`cstdio`), which can increase the binary size slightly.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const double PI = M_PI;
  double r, area, circumference;
  cin >> r;
  area = r * r * PI;
  circumference = 2 * PI * r;
  cout.precision(8);
  cout << fixed << area << " " << circumference << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code still performs the same functionality as the original code but with slightly better performance and code consistency. The memory footprint has been reduced by eliminating the unnecessary variable `x`. Also, the code follows a consistent style of input/output using only `iostream`, and the use of `const` for PI could potentially allow the compiler to make further optimizations.
