1. Code Analysis:
This is a simple C++ program that takes a radius (r) from the user, calculates the area (s) and circumference (l) of a circle with that radius, and prints out the results. There are no major performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usage in this code because it only involves basic arithmetic operations and I/O operations, and it does not use complex data structures or algorithms. However, there are a few small improvements that can be made.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Use a constant for pi instead of a variable: The value of pi is a constant, so it can be defined as a constant, which can slightly optimize the performance because the compiler can optimize code involving constants better than code involving variables.
    2. Use the standard library constant for pi: The C++ standard library provides a constant for pi (`M_PI`), which is more precise and standard than manually defining it.
    3. Combine the calculation and output: The area and circumference can be calculated and output in one line, which can reduce the use of temporary variables and make the code clearer.
    4. Use cout instead of printf: Although printf is not inherently bad, using cout is more C++ styled and can be more type-safe and flexible.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Define pi as a constant: Defining pi as a constant can slightly optimize the performance. This is because the compiler can optimize code involving constants better than code involving variables because it knows that their value will not change.
    2. Use the standard library constant for pi: The C++ standard library provides a constant for pi (`M_PI`), which is more precise and standard than manually defining it.
    3. Combine the calculation and output: By calculating and outputting the area and circumference in one line, we can reduce the use of temporary variables and make the code clearer.
    4. Use cout instead of printf: Although printf is not inherently bad, using cout can be safer and more flexible in C++.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  double r;
  std::cin >> r;
  std::cout.precision(8);
  std::cout << std::fixed << r * r * M_PI << " " << 2 * r * M_PI << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code does the same thing as the original code but in a more efficient and C++ styled way. It defines pi as a constant using the standard library, combines the calculation and output, and uses cout instead of printf.
