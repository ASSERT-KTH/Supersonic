The given code is a simple program that calculates and prints the area and circumference of a circle given its radius. While the program is already quite simple and efficient, we can still make some minor optimizations:

1. The value of PI is a constant. It's better practice to define it as a compile time constant using the `const` keyword or `#define` directive. This ensures that the value of PI cannot be accidentally modified in the code.

2. The use of `printf` for output is not consistent with the use of `cin` for input. Although `printf` is slightly faster, for consistency and to take advantage of C++ features like type safety, it is better to use `cout`.

3. `std::endl` can be used instead of `\n` to flush the output stream, but in this case, it is not necessary and can cause a performance hit. So, we'll keep using `\n`.

4. The program is using `double` data type which occupies more memory compared to `float`. In this scenario, using `float` would be more memory efficient as the precision offered by `double` is not required.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define PI 3.141592653589f

int main() {
    float r;
    cin >> r;
    cout << PI * r * r << " " << 2 * PI * r << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

With these changes, the program is slightly more efficient and consistent, while still maintaining its original functionality. 

Please note that the efficiency gains in this case are minimal due to the simplicity of the original program. However, these practices can lead to significant performance improvements in more complex programs.
