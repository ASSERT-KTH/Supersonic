This code is quite simple and already efficient due to its simplicity. It takes a radius input from the user and calculates the area and the circumference of a circle with that radius. However, there are a few optimization techniques we could use to further improve the code:

1. **Use of Constants**: The value of PI is a mathematical constant. In C++, we can define it using the `const` keyword. This will prevent any accidental modification to the value.

2. **Input/Output Optimization**: The use of `cin` and `cout` can be slower than printf and scanf due to synchronization with stdio, so we can stick with printf and scanf for input/output operations.

3. **Avoiding Unnecessary Computations**: The value of "PI * r" is used twice in the code. We can compute it once and reuse it to avoid duplication of computation.

4. **Use of `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`**: This statement can be used to turn off synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. By default, all standard streams are synchronized, which means they can be safely interchanged. When you turn off synchronization, you can gain some speed, but you lose the ability to interchange standard C and C++ streams.

5. **Use of `'\n'` instead of `endl`**: `endl` causes a flush operation, which can be slower compared to simply printing a newline character (`'\n'`).

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // turn off synchronization
  const double PI = 3.141592653589; // define PI as a constant
  double r, PI_r;
  scanf("%lf", &r); // use scanf for input
  PI_r = PI * r;    // calculate PI*r once
  printf("%lf %lf\n", PI_r * r, 2 * PI_r); // use printf for output
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code still performs the same functionality as the original code but potentially faster due to the optimizations implemented. It should be noted that the improvements in speed may be negligible due to the simple nature of the program.
