The provided code block is a simple C++ program that takes a radius as input and calculates the area and circumference of a circle. It doesn't appear to have any obvious performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies, and given its simplicity, there's limited scope for optimization. 

However, here are a couple of minor optimizations that can be applied:

1. **Optimization Strategy**

     1. **Inefficient use of the `printf` function**: Since we're using C++, `std::cout` should be used instead of `printf` for output operations. This is because `std::cout` is type safe, whereas `printf` is not. Although `printf` might be slightly faster, the difference is negligible and doesn't justify the potential type safety issues.
     2. **Calculate the circumference first**: By calculating the circumference first, we can reuse its value when calculating the area, which may reduce the number of multiplications.

2. **Step-by-Step Explanation**

     1. Replace `printf` with `std::cout` for outputting the area and circumference. This is a safer approach in C++. The improvement here is more about code safety than performance.
     2. Calculate the circumference first and store it in a variable. Then divide by `r` to get `2*PI`, which can be reused for area calculation. This removes one multiplication operation, so it could be slightly faster, although the difference might not be noticeable given the simplicity of the operations.

3. **Trade-offs**: The trade-off here is the extra memory space required to store the circumference. However, this is negligible for a single `double` value.

4. **Optimized Code Block**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const double PI = 3.141592653589;
  double r;
  cin >> r;
  
  double circumference = 2 * PI * r;  // calculate circumference first
  double area = circumference * r / 2; // reuse 2*PI from circumference calculation
  
  cout << area << " " << circumference << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The constant `PI` is now declared as `const` to indicate that its value should not be modified.
