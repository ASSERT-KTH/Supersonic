The provided code block is a simple program that reads a value `r` from standard input and then calculates and prints the area (`PI * r * r`) and circumference (`2 * PI * r`) of a circle of radius `r`. The code is pretty optimized as it is. 

However, one potential optimization could be to declare `PI` as a `const`. This tells the compiler that the value of `PI` will not change, allowing the compiler to make specific optimizations.

Another minor optimization could be to avoid the usage of `printf` and `cin`, and use `cout` instead. `printf` is a function from the C library that has more overhead compared to `cout`. Similarly, `cin` is slower than `scanf`, but to keep consistency in using C++ style, we will stick with `cout`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const double PI = 3.141592653589;
  double r;
  cin >> r;
  cout << PI * r * r << " " << 2 * PI * r << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

The optimizations performed here are minimal but they can slightly improve the performance of the code. There are not any significant trade-offs to speak of in this case, as the code complexity remains the same. The functionality and output of the original code are also preserved.
