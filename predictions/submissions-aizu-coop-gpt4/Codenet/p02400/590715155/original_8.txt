The provided C++ code calculates the area and circumference of a circle, given a radius `r` input by the user. The code is already quite efficient, but there are a few minor optimizations we can make:

1. Inline variable computation: The code currently computes `PI * r * r` and `2 * PI * r` separately. We can slightly optimize this by computing `PI * r` first and storing it in a variable, then multiplying by `r` for the area and by `2` for the circumference. This reduces the number of multiplication operations from 4 to 3.

2. Use of `printf` and `cin`: For consistency, it's better to stick to either C-style or C++-style I/O throughout the program. Since `cin` is already used, we can replace `printf` with `cout` and `endl`, which might be faster due to less overhead.

Here's the optimized code with these modifications:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  double PI = 3.141592653589;
  double r;
  cin >> r;
  double pi_r = PI * r;
  cout << pi_r * r << " " << 2 * pi_r << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimization reduces the number of operations and maintains consistency in the code style. However, the changes are very minor and unlikely to have a significant impact on runtime performance for this simple program. The trade-off is a slightly increased code complexity due to the addition of a new variable `pi_r`.
