The given code is quite efficient and well-written as it is, but there are a few minor adjustments that can be made to improve it:

1. Code Analysis:
   The code is simply calculating the area and circumference of a circle given its radius. It doesn't have any obvious performance bottlenecks, inefficient memory usage, or areas that would significantly benefit from optimization. 

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. Using `const` for PI: Since the value of PI doesn't change, it can be declared as a `const` to ensure it's not accidentally modified in the code. This also gives a hint to the compiler that this value will not change, which might lead to minor optimizations.
   2. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`: This can be used to untie C++'s standard streams from the C-style streams. This can lead to faster I/O operations.
   3. Use `cin.tie(NULL);`: This unties `cin` from `cout`, leading to faster I/O operations.
   4. Use `cout` instead of `printf`: It's better to use `cout` instead of `printf` to avoid switching between C and C++ style I/O, which can lead to a performance penalty.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Declare PI as a `const`: This ensures that PI's value cannot be changed, which can prevent bugs and possibly lead to minor optimizations.
   2. Untie C++'s standard streams from the C-style streams: This can lead to faster I/O operations. This is done by calling `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`.
   3. Untie `cin` from `cout`: This can lead to faster I/O when both `cin` and `cout` are used in the code. This is done by calling `cin.tie(NULL);`.
   4. Switch from `printf` to `cout`: This avoids the performance penalty that can occur when switching between C and C++ style I/O.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  const double PI = 3.141592653589;
  double r;
  cin >> r;
  cout << PI * r * r << " " << 2 * PI * r << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The optimizations proposed are relatively minor and may not lead to a noticeable performance increase for this specific code, given its simplicity. However, these practices can be beneficial in larger and more complex programs.
