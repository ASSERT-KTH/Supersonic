Code Analysis:
The given code calculates the area and circumference of a circle by taking the radius as input. The code is simple and efficient but there are few practices that can be improved:

1. The usage of `cin` and `printf` for IO operations is inconsistent and may not be the best for performance.

2. The PI value is a constant and could be defined as a constant.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use cin and cout for IO operations consistently for better IO operations performance.

2. Define PI as a constant.

Step-by-step Explanation:

1. The `cin` and `cout` operations are generally faster and safer than `printf` and `scanf` in C++. Using `cin` and `cout` consistently can improve IO performance.

2. The value of PI is a constant and should be defined as such. This doesn't necessarily improve performance, but it's a good programming practice. 

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const double PI = 3.141592653589;

int main() {
  double r;
  cin >> r;
  cout << PI * r * r << " " << 2 * PI * r << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code aligns with good programming practices and might show improved performance in IO operations. It also maintains the functionality and output of the original code.
