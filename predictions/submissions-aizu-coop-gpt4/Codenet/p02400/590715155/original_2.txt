The given code is a simple C++ program that calculates the area and circumference of a circle. The main performance optimization for this code revolves around the I/O operations and the numerical computations. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Changing the I/O operations: C++ standard I/O (cin and cout) are usually slower than C-style I/O (scanf and printf). Switching to C-style I/O can enhance the performance.

2. Minimizing numerical computations: The code computes "PI * r" twice. This repeated computation can be avoided by storing the result in a variable and reusing it.

3. Compiler optimizations: As a final point, we can suggest some compiler flags that can help the compiler optimize the code. For this program, the -O2 or -O3 flags can be used to instruct the compiler to focus on code optimization.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Change I/O operations: Replace cin with scanf for faster input.

2. Minimize numerical computations: Store the value of "PI * r" in a variable and use it to calculate area and circumference.

3. Compiler optimizations: When compiling the program, use the -O2 or -O3 flags for optimization.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const double PI = 3.141592653589;
  double r;
  scanf("%lf", &r);
  double pi_r = PI * r; // Store the value of PI*r
  printf("%lf %lf\n", pi_r * r, 2 * pi_r);
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs: 

There aren't many trade-offs in this case. The code remains as readable and maintainable as before. The only change is the usage of scanf in place of cin, which might be unfamiliar to programmers who only use C++ I/O. However, this is a minor trade-off considering the potential performance gain.
