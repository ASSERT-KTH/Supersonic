# Code Analysis

The code seems to be implementing a QuickFind data structure to solve a problem. It reads an array of integers, sorts it, maps the original and sorted arrays to their indices, and then unifies the indices of the sorted array's elements in the QuickFind structure. It then computes a result based on the values and the size of each disjoint set in the QuickFind structure.

# Optimization Strategy

1. **Inefficient Data Structures**: The current data structure seems to be efficient for this problem. However, the map data structure could be replaced with an unordered_map for faster average access times.

2. **Redundant or Unnecessary Computations**: The `unite` function in the QuickFind structure performs a `v[y].clear()`, this seems unnecessary as this vector is not used after this operation. Also, the condition `if (qf.p[i] != i || k == 1)` in the main function may cause unnecessary loop iterations.

3. **Loops or Recursive Calls**: The loops in this program are necessary for its operation. However, the loop within the `unite` function could be replaced with a `vector::insert` operation, which can be more efficient.

4. **Compiler Optimizations or Pragma Directives**: The compiler can be instructed to optimize the program for speed using the `-O2` or `-O3` compiler flags. 

# Step-by-step Explanation

1. **Replace map with unordered_map**: This will improve the average access times from O(log n) to O(1). This is especially beneficial in the second half of the main function, where the maps are accessed multiple times.

2. **Remove unnecessary vector clear**: The `v[y].clear()` operation in the `unite` function can be removed, as the vector `v[y]` is not used after this operation.

3. **Replace loop with vector::insert**: The loop in the `unite` function can be replaced with a `vector::insert` operation, which can be more efficient as it avoids the overhead of multiple `push_back` operations.

4. **Optimize loop condition**: The condition `if (qf.p[i] != i || k == 1)` in the main function can be replaced with `if (qf.p[i] == i && k > 1)`, which is equivalent but avoids unnecessary loop iterations.

5. **Use compiler optimization flags**: The `-O2` or `-O3` compiler flags can be used to instruct the compiler to optimize the program for speed.

# Optimized Code Block

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
struct QuickFind {
  vector<int> r, p;
  vector<vector<int>> v;
  QuickFind() {}
  QuickFind(int size) { init(size); }
  void init(int size) {
    r.resize(size, 0);
    p.resize(size, 0);
    v.resize(size);
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      r[i] = 1, p[i] = i;
      v[i].resize(1, i);
    }
  }
  bool same(int x, int y) { return p[x] == p[y]; }
  void unite(int x, int y) {
    x = p[x];
    y = p[y];
    if (x == y)
      return;
    if (r[x] < r[y])
      swap(x, y);
    r[x] += r[y];
    v[x].insert(v[x].end(), v[y].begin(), v[y].end());
  }
};
signed main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  vector<int> b(a);
  sort(b.begin(), b.end());
  unordered_map<int, int> p, q;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    p[a[i]] = i;
    q[b[i]] = i;
  }
  QuickFind qf(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    qf.unite(i, p[b[i]]);
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int k = qf.v[i].size();
    if (qf.p[i] == i && k > 1) {
      int m = a[qf.v[i][0]];
      int tmp = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
        tmp += a[qf.v[i][j]];
        m = min(m, a[qf.v[i][j]]);
      }
      ans += min(tmp + m * (k - 2), tmp + m + b[0] * (k + 1));
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Compile this program with the `-O2` flag for better performance.
