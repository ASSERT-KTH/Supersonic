## Code Analysis

This code implements a QuickFind algorithm, which is a variant of the union-find data structure. It is used to perform efficient "find" and "union" operations on a set.

The code reads from the input a list of `n` integers and sorts them. Then, it creates a mapping of each element in the original and sorted lists to their respective indices. It initializes a QuickFind structure and unites indices of the original list that correspond to the same element in the sorted list.

The code then calculates and outputs the minimum possible sum of the elements in each disjoint subset, where the minimum sum is either the sum of the elements plus the minimum element multiplied by the size of the subset minus two, or the sum of the elements plus the minimum element and the smallest element in the sorted list multiplied by the size of the subset plus one.

## Optimization Strategy

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation. The vectors `r` and `p` are resized and then immediately assigned values. It would be more efficient to initialize these vectors with their final values.
2. Use more efficient data structures. The code uses a `map` to store the elements of the lists `a` and `b` with their respective indices. However, if the elements of the list are non-negative integers and not too large, a `vector` can be used instead, which has constant time complexity for access and insertion.
3. Minimize operations within loops. There's a loop that calculates the sum of the elements in each disjoint subset and finds the minimum element. These operations can be done in the `unite` function and stored in the QuickFind structure, reducing the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).
4. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` to speed up `cin` and `cout` operations.

## Optimized Code Block

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long

struct QuickFind {
  vector<int> r, p, s, m;
  QuickFind() {}
  QuickFind(int size) { init(size); }
  void init(int size) {
    r = vector<int>(size, 1);
    p = vector<int>(size);
    s = vector<int>(size, 0);
    m = vector<int>(size, INT_MAX);
    iota(p.begin(), p.end(), 0);
  }
  bool same(int x, int y) { return p[x] == p[y]; }
  void unite(int x, int y, int val) {
    x = p[x];
    y = p[y];
    if (x == y)
      return;
    if (r[x] < r[y])
      swap(x, y);
    r[x] += r[y];
    s[x] += s[y] + val;
    m[x] = min(m[x], min(m[y], val));
    p[y] = x;
  }
  int getMinSum(int minVal) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < p.size(); i++) {
      if (p[i] == i) {
        int k = r[i];
        sum += min(s[i] + m[i] * (k - 2), s[i] + m[i] + minVal * (k + 1));
      }
    }
    return sum;
  }
};

signed main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n), b(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  b = a;
  sort(b.begin(), b.end());
  
  vector<int> p(n), q(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    p[a[i]] = i;
    q[b[i]] = i;
  }

  QuickFind qf(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    qf.s[p[b[i]]] = a[p[b[i]]];
    qf.m[p[b[i]]] = a[p[b[i]]];
    qf.unite(i, p[b[i]], a[p[b[i]]]);
  }

  cout << qf.getMinSum(b[0]) << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, the vectors `r` and `p` are initialized with their final values, a `vector` is used instead of a `map` to store the elements of the lists `a` and `b` with their respective indices, the sum of the elements and the minimum element in each disjoint subset are calculated in the `unite` function and stored in the QuickFind structure, and `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` are used to speed up `cin` and `cout` operations.
