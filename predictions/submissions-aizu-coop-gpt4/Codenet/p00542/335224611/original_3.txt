Code Analysis:
The provided C++ code takes six integers as input, calculates the sum of the first four integers subtracted by the minimum of the them, and adds the maximum of the last two integers. It then prints the result. The code is quite simple and does not contain any complex data structures or algorithms. However, the calculation of the minimum and maximum values can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: No data structures are used in the code, so no changes are needed in this respect.
2. Redundant Computations: The code uses the min and max functions twice each. This is redundant and can be optimized.
3. Loops/Recursive Calls: The code does not contain any loops or recursive calls, so we don't need to optimize anything in this regard.
4. Compiler Optimizations or Pragma Directives: No specific compiler optimizations or pragma directives are necessary for this code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The code currently uses the min function twice to find the minimum of the first four integers. Instead, we can use a single call to the min function with four arguments. Similarly, the max function can be used once instead of twice.
2. This change reduces the amount of function calls, which can slightly improve the performance of the code. The trade-off is that the code becomes less readable, but this should not be a problem in this case because the operation is simple.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b, c, d, e, f;
  cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e >> f;
  int ans = a + b + c + d - min({a, b, c, d}) + max(e, f);
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we use a single call to the min function with an initializer list. This reduces the number of function calls from two to one. Similarly, we could do this with the max function if there were more than two values to compare.
