1. Code Analysis:

This program is relatively simple. It takes six integer inputs, finds the sum of the first four, subtracts the smallest of the first four, and adds the largest of the last two, then displays the result. There are no major performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usage due to its simplicity.

2. Optimization Strategy:

Given the simplicity of the code, there are minimal opportunities for optimization. However, a few improvements can be made to make the code more efficient and readable.

A. Remove the usage of #include <bits/stdc++.h>. This header file includes almost all of C++ libraries, which increases the compilation time. Replace it with the specific libraries needed.

B. Utilize an array data structure to store the input numbers. This can streamline the calculation and improve readability.

C. Use std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL) to speed up the cin and cout operations.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Removing #include <bits/stdc++.h> and including only the necessary libraries reduces the compile time as the compiler doesn't need to load unnecessary libraries.

B. Using an array to store the input numbers allows us to easily iterate through our numbers, improving the readability of the code.

C. Using std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL) can speed up the I/O operations by unsyncing the I/O of C and C++ and untie the cin and cout operations.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int numbers[6];
  
  for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    cin >> numbers[i];
  }

  int min_val = min({numbers[0], numbers[1], numbers[2], numbers[3]});
  int max_val = max(numbers[4], numbers[5]);
  
  int sum = numbers[0] + numbers[1] + numbers[2] + numbers[3] - min_val + max_val;

  cout << sum << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```
The optimized code maintains the original functionality while improving readability and potentially reducing compile time and speeding up I/O operations.
