### 1. Code Analysis:
The given code reads six integers from standard input, computes the sum of all except the smallest of the first four, and adds the maximum of the last two. The final result is printed to standard output. 

The performance of this program is already quite good - it reads six numbers, performs a few mathematical operations, and prints the result. The complexity is O(1), meaning it doesn't grow with the size of the input. 

However, there is still some minor optimization possible. In terms of time complexity, the current code is already optimal. However, we can make a small adjustment to reduce the number of calls to `min` and `max` functions, which might be a minor performance gain in terms of CPU cycles.

### 2. Optimization Strategy:

1. Instead of calling `min` function twice on `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, we can store the minimum value of `a` and `b` in one variable and the minimum value of `c` and `d` in another variable. Then we can call `min` function only once on these two variables. This reduces the number of calls to `min` function from two to one.

2. Similarly, we can reduce the number of calls to `max` function from one to zero by using a simple `if-else` statement to find the maximum of `e` and `f`.

3. We are including `bits/stdc++.h` which is a header file that includes every standard library. In terms of compilation time, this is not efficient. We should only include the libraries that we are using in our program. 

### 3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Declare two variables `min1` and `min2` and assign them the minimum of `a,b` and `c,d` respectively. Then find the minimum of these two variables and subtract it from the total sum. This reduces the number of calls to `min` function from two to one.

2. Use an `if-else` statement to find the maximum of `e` and `f` and add it to the total sum. This eliminates the need to call `max` function.

3. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the specific standard libraries that we are using: `#include <iostream>` and `#include <algorithm>`.

### 4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b, c, d, e, f;
  cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e >> f;
  
  // Find minimum of a,b and c,d and then find minimum of these two
  int min1 = min(a, b);
  int min2 = min(c, d);
  int ans = a + b + c + d - min(min1, min2);
  
  // Find maximum of e and f
  if(e>f)
    ans += e;
  else
    ans += f;
    
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations may not have a significant impact on the performance of this program, as the original code was already quite optimized. However, the given optimizations do slightly reduce the number of function calls, which could be beneficial in a scenario where this code is part of a larger, more complex program.
