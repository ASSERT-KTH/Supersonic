Analyzing the code, we can see that the main computation is pretty straightforward and doesn't have many performance issues. The code reads in six integers, calculates the sum of four of them by excluding the smallest one, adds the maximum of the last two, and prints the result.

However, we can make some minor improvements to make the code cleaner and potentially more efficient:

1. **Inclusion of the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library**: This library is quite large and can slow down the compilation time. It's better to include only the specific libraries needed for the program.

2. **Usage of `std::min` and `std::max` repeatedly**: We are calling `std::min` and `std::max` functions repeatedly which might be unnecessary. We can streamline this process by using an array to hold our input numbers and sort it. We can then directly access the smallest and the largest numbers.

3. **I/O stream optimization**: The input and output operations in C++ can be a bottleneck if not handled correctly. We can speed this up by disabling synchronization with C's standard streams and untie `cin` and `cout`.

Here's the optimized code with the above improvements:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int numbers[6];
    for(int i=0; i<6; i++)
        cin >> numbers[i];

    sort(numbers, numbers+6);

    int ans = numbers[1] + numbers[2] + numbers[3] + numbers[4] + max(numbers[5],numbers[0]);
    cout << ans << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code:

1. We include only `iostream` and `algorithm` libraries which are necessary for this program.

2. We use an array `numbers[]` to store the input numbers. We then sort this array. This way, we don't need to call `min` and `max` functions repeatedly. Instead, we directly access the sorted array to get the smallest and largest numbers.

3. We disable synchronization of C++ and C streams and untie `cin` and `cout` which can speed up I/O operations.

4. We also replace `endl` with `"\n"` for output. `endl` causes an unnecessary flush operation which can slow down the program.

5. The logic of the program remains the same. The minimum of the first four numbers is `numbers[0]` after sorting and the maximum of the last two numbers is `numbers[5]`. We exclude `numbers[0]` from the sum and include `numbers[5]`. Since we are not sure if `numbers[5]` or `numbers[0]` is the true maximum of the last two input numbers, we include the maximum of them in the sum.

Note: Although the improvements may not significantly speed up this particular program due to its simplicity, they are good practices to follow in a larger, more complex program.
