The given code doesn't seem to have any significant performance issue, as it's just adding some integers and finding minimum and maximum values among them. However, there are still a few things we could optimize for better performance:

1. The "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" header file includes a lot of unnecessary header files which can slow down the compile time. We can replace it with the specific header files we need.

2. Multiple calls to the 'min' function can be reduced to one call by using an array and the 'min_element' function. This will improve readability and slightly decrease computation time.

3. Similar to 'min', we can use 'max_element' function to find the maximum element in an array, thereby reducing computation time.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int a[4], e, f;

  for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      std::cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  std::cin >> e >> f;
  
  int ans = std::accumulate(a, a+4, 0);
  ans = ans - *std::min_element(a, a+4);
  ans = ans + std::max(e, f);
  
  std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the changes:

1. Included only the necessary header files.
2. Used an array to collect all four numbers.
3. Used 'std::accumulate' to add all numbers in the array.
4. Used 'std::min_element' to find the smallest number among the array elements.
5. Used 'std::max' to find the maximum between two numbers.

Though the performance gain in this case will be negligible because the problem size is trivial, these changes will improve the code's readability and make it easier to maintain and extend in the future. Also, replacing `bits/stdc++.h` with specific includes will reduce the compilation time significantly in larger projects.
