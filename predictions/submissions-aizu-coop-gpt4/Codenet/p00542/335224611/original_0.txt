Upon analyzing the given C++ code, it is clear that this simple program is already optimized and efficient. Here's why:

1. **Code Analysis**: The program reads six integer variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f` from the standard input, calculates a certain expression, and writes the result to the standard output. 

2. **Optimization Strategy**: The expression `a + b + c + d - min(min(a, b), min(c, d)) + max(e, f)` is already efficient. It finds the minimum of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, subtracts it from the sum of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and adds the maximum of `e` and `f`. Both `min` and `max` functions are O(1) operations, and the other arithmetic operations are also O(1). 

3. **Potential Bottlenecks**: There are no loops, no recursive calls, and no data structures used in this program. Hence, there are no evident bottlenecks or inefficient memory usages. 

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: The program is so simple that there isn't much to gain from compiler optimization flags. 

Therefore, given the simplicity and efficiency of the initial program, no optimizations are necessary. The provided code is already optimal in terms of both space and time complexity. The program has a constant time complexity O(1) and a constant space complexity O(1), which are the best achievable complexities.

Optimized Code Block:

The optimized code block is the same as the provided code, as no modifications are required.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b, c, d, e, f;
  cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e >> f;
  int ans = a + b + c + d - min(min(a, b), min(c, d)) + max(e, f);
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This code is simple, efficient, and readable, which are the main goals of any optimization process.
