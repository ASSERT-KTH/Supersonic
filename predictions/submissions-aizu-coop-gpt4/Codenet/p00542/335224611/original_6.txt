This is a simple C++ program that reads six input numbers, calculates the sum of all numbers except the smallest of the first four, and adds the maximum of the last two. As the code is straightforward and does not involve any complex data structures or algorithms, there is not much room for performance optimization.

However, a few minor improvements can be made:

1. **Avoid the use of `<bits/stdc++.h>`:** The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file is quite large and includes a lot of libraries, which can slow down the compilation time. It's generally better to include only the libraries that you need.

2. **Avoid multiple `min` and `max` calls:** The current code calls `min` and `max` functions multiple times. Although these are not expensive operations, we can still reduce the number of calls by storing the results in temporary variables.

3. **Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(NULL);`:** These statements can help speed up the I/O operations in C++.

The optimized code is as follows:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int a, b, c, d, e, f;
  cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e >> f;

  int min_ab = min(a, b);
  int min_cd = min(c, d);
  int max_ef = max(e, f);

  int ans = a + b + c + d - min(min_ab, min_cd) + max_ef;

  cout << ans << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we've removed the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header in favor of `iostream` and `algorithm` which are the only headers we actually need. We've also reduced the number of function calls by storing the results of `min` and `max` functions in temporary variables. And we have added `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to make I/O operations faster.

Note: The use of `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(NULL);` can speed up the I/O operations significantly, but they should be used with caution, as they disable the synchronization between C and C++ streams. This can cause problems if the program also uses C-style I/O or multi-threading.
