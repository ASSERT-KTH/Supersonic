Code Analysis:
The given code appears to be solving a problem where it reads in a set of pairs of integers, sorts them, and then performs an operation that involves looping through each sorted pair, incrementing a sum and a count, and checking certain conditions. The overall complexity of the code is O(n log n) due to the sorting operations, and then O(n) in the main loop. 

Potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies could include:
1. The use of a boolean array `use` to track the indices that have been used. This array is accessed multiple times within the main loop.
2. The repeated calculation of the product `num * b[i].fs` within the loop.
3. There are multiple increments of `id` and checks for `id < n` inside the main loop. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. For the boolean array `use`, we can make use of a bitset instead of a boolean array. A bitset is an array that compactly stores bits. It can be more efficient in terms of space and potentially faster due to better cache utilization.
2. We can avoid the repeated calculation of `num * b[i].fs` by storing the result in a variable and updating it only when `num` changes. 
3. We can merge the two inner while loops into a single loop. The condition `id < n && p[id].fs <= b[i].fs` is common to both loops and can be checked once.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `use` array with a `std::bitset`, which will save space and potentially improve performance due to better cache utilization.
2. Store the result of `num * b[i].fs` in a variable `product` and update it only when `num` changes. This reduces unnecessary computations.
3. Merge the two inner while loops into a single loop, reducing redundancy in code and improving readability.

Here is the optimized code block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#define fs first
#define sc second
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
int n;
pair<ll, int> p[300010], b[300010];
ll a[300010];
bitset<300010> use;
int main() {
  cin.tie(0);
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i] >> b[i].fs;
    p[i] = make_pair(a[i], i);
    b[i].sc = i;
    use[i] = false;
  }
  sort(p, p + n);
  sort(b, b + n);
  int ans = 0;
  ll sum = 0;
  int id = 0, num = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (!use[b[i].sc]) {
      sum += a[b[i].sc];
      use[b[i].sc] = true;
      num++;
    }
    ll product = num * b[i].fs;
    while (id < n && (p[id].fs <= b[i].fs || (sum + p[id].fs <= (num + 1) * b[i].fs))) {
      if (!use[p[id].sc]) {
        sum += p[id].fs;
        use[p[id].sc] = true;
        num++;
        product = num * b[i].fs;
      }
      id++;
    }
    if (sum <= product)
      ans = max(ans, num);
    sum -= a[b[i].sc];
    num--;
    product = num * b[i].fs;
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}
```
This optimized code should perform the same operations as the original, but with potential performance improvements due to the use of a `std::bitset`, the reduction of repeated computations, and the merging of the two inner while loops into one.
