Code Analysis:
The code is a C++ program that takes an input of `n` pairs of numbers, sorts them and performs some computations using these sorted data structures. The major performance bottlenecks are the sorting operations and the nested while loops.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The data structures being used are efficient for the task at hand. However, the `use` array could be replaced with a `std::unordered_set` to improve the lookup time from O(n) to O(1) on average.

2. Redundant Computations: The program repeatedly checks whether a number has been used inside the while loops. This check can be avoided by using more efficient data structures.

3. Loop Optimization: The nested while loop structure can be optimized. The first while loop inside the for loop and the one outside the for loop are performing the same task and can be merged. We can add a condition to check `(sum + p[id].fs) > (num + 1) * b[i].fs` inside the first while loop itself and break the loop if it holds true.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler flags such as `-O2` or `-O3` could be used for general optimizations. Also, use of `#pragma omp parallel for` can be considered for parallel execution of independent loop iterations, but be aware of possible overheads of creating and managing multiple threads.

Optimized Code:

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

#define fs first
#define sc second

using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int n;
pair<ll, int> p[300010], b[300010];
ll a[300010];
unordered_set<int> used;

int main() {
  cin.tie(0);
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i] >> b[i].fs;
    p[i] = make_pair(a[i], i);
    b[i].sc = i;
  }
  sort(p, p + n);
  sort(b, b + n);
  int ans = 0;
  ll sum = 0;
  int id = 0, num = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (used.find(b[i].sc) == used.end()) {
      sum += a[b[i].sc];
      used.insert(b[i].sc);
      num++;
    }
    while (id < n && (p[id].fs <= b[i].fs || 
                      (used.find(p[id].sc) == used.end() && sum + p[id].fs <= (num + 1) * b[i].fs))) {
      if (used.find(p[id].sc) == used.end()) {
        sum += p[id].fs;
        used.insert(p[id].sc);
        num++;
      }
      id++;
    }
    if (sum <= num * b[i].fs)
      ans = max(ans, num);
    sum -= a[b[i].sc];
    num--;
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}
```

This code optimizes the redundant computation by using an `unordered_set` for `used` elements and simplifies the while loop structure. The functionality and output remain the same as the original code.
