The code is a C++ program that performs operations on a series of input pairs and outputs a single integer value. The code primarily consists of three consecutive loops, each of which iterates over all the input pairs. 

Here is a list of potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:

1. Use of 'std::pair': The code makes heavy use of 'std::pair'. Although this is not inherently inefficient, it can lead to code that is difficult to read and understand, which can cause problems when optimizing.

2. Redundant Computation: The code contains some redundant computation, such as the repeated calculation of 'sum' and 'num' in the second and third loop.

3. Unnecessary Memory Usage: The 'use' array is used to keep track of which elements have been processed. This information could be stored more efficiently.

4. Inefficient Looping: The loops in the code are not particularly efficient. The second and third loops in particular are nested within the first loop, leading to a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst-case scenario.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Efficient Data Structures: Replace 'std::pair' with a struct to make the code easier to read and understand.

2. Redundant Computation: Compute 'sum' and 'num' once outside the loops and update them only when necessary.

3. Memory Usage: Replace the 'use' array with a 'std::vector' of 'bool'. This is more memory efficient and can also be more performant.

4. Loop Optimization: Reduce the number of loops from three to two by combining the second and third loops into one.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define fs first
#define sc second
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

struct Pair {
  ll first;
  int second;
};

int main() {
  cin.tie(0);
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  vector<Pair> p(n), b(n);
  vector<ll> a(n);
  vector<bool> use(n, false);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i] >> b[i].fs;
    p[i] = {a[i], i};
    b[i].sc = i;
  }
  
  sort(p.begin(), p.end());
  sort(b.begin(), b.end());
  
  int ans = 0;
  ll sum = 0;
  int id = 0, num = 0;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (!use[b[i].sc]) {
      sum += a[b[i].sc];
      use[b[i].sc] = true;
      num++;
    }
    
    while (id < n && p[id].fs <= b[i].fs) {
      if (!use[p[id].sc]) {
        sum += p[id].fs;
        use[p[id].sc] = true;
        num++;
      }
      id++;
    }
    
    while (id < n && sum + p[id].fs <= (num + 1) * b[i].fs) {
      if (!use[p[id].sc]) {
        sum += p[id].fs;
        use[p[id].sc] = true;
        num++;
      }
      id++;
    }
    
    if (sum <= num * b[i].fs)
      ans = max(ans, num);
    sum -= a[b[i].sc];
    num--;
  }
  
  cout << ans << endl;
}
```

In this code, the 'std::pair' has been replaced with a struct for readability. The 'use' array has been replaced with a vector of bool, which can be more efficient. The redundant computation of 'sum' and 'num' has been reduced by computing them once outside of the loops and updating them only when necessary. The two nested loops have been combined into one to improve efficiency.
