Code Analysis:

This code reads in a number of pairs of integers and sorts them. Then it processes the sorted pairs in a specific way to compute a maximum value, which is then printed out. The performance bottlenecks and areas of potential optimization could be:

1. Memory usage: The code uses three arrays of size 300010. This can be a significant amount of memory, especially if the actual size required is much less.

2. Redundant computations: The code repeatedly checks if an element is used or not, which can be avoided by a different approach.

3. Loop optimization: There are three nested loops which could be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Memory usage: Since the actual size required is 'n', we can dynamically allocate memory for the arrays. This will save memory when 'n' is much less than 300010.

2. Redundant computations: Instead of checking the 'use' array repeatedly, we can maintain two sets of used and unused pairs. This will provide constant time complexity for checking if a pair is used or not and for finding the next unused pair.

3. Loop optimization: We can combine the two inner loops into one by using conditions in a single loop.

Optimization Steps:

1. Replace arrays with vectors to save memory.
2. Replace 'use' array with two sets to avoid redundant computations.
3. Combine the two inner loops into one to optimize the loop.

Trade-offs:

1. While vectors and sets provide dynamic memory allocation and efficient operations, they may have more overhead compared to arrays. However, the trade-off is acceptable for large 'n' values.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
#define fs first
#define sc second
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
int n;
vector<pair<ll, int>> p, b;
vector<ll> a;
set<int> used, unused;
int main() {
  cin.tie(0);
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin >> n;
  p.resize(n);
  b.resize(n);
  a.resize(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i] >> b[i].fs;
    p[i] = make_pair(a[i], i);
    b[i].sc = i;
    unused.insert(i);
  }
  sort(p.begin(), p.end());
  sort(b.begin(), b.end());
  int ans = 0;
  ll sum = 0;
  int id = 0, num = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (unused.find(b[i].sc) != unused.end()) {
      sum += a[b[i].sc];
      unused.erase(b[i].sc);
      used.insert(b[i].sc);
      num++;
    }
    while (id < n && p[id].fs <= b[i].fs) {
      if (unused.find(p[id].sc) != unused.end()) {
        sum += p[id].fs;
        unused.erase(p[id].sc);
        used.insert(p[id].sc);
        num++;
      }
      id++;
    }
    if (sum <= num * b[i].fs)
      ans = max(ans, num);
    if (used.find(b[i].sc) != used.end()) {
      sum -= a[b[i].sc];
      used.erase(b[i].sc);
      num--;
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}
```

This optimized code preserves the functionality of the original code and improves the performance by optimizing memory usage and reducing redundant computations.
