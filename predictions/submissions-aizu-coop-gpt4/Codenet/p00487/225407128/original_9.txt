**Code Analysis**

The code given here sorts two arrays, `p` and `b`, based on different criteria. It then goes through the sorted arrays, adding elements from the `p` array to a sum until certain conditions are met, and keeping track of the number of elements added. The main performance bottlenecks are the sorting operations and the loops that follow.

**Optimization Strategy**

1. **Efficient Data Structures:** The code uses a pair of arrays to store related data (`p` and `b`). A more efficient approach would be to use a data structure that allows for efficient sorting and searching, such as a priority queue or a set.

2. **Redundant Computations:** The condition `(num + 1) * b[i].fs` is calculated twice in the loops, which can be avoided by storing the result in a variable.

3. **Loop Optimization:** The loops iterate over the entire array `p`, even though it's guaranteed that the inner loop will break once the condition is met. This can be optimized using a priority queue to only check the smallest elements.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** Compiler options such as `-O2` or `-O3` could be used to allow the compiler to automatically optimize the code.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **Efficient Data Structures:** Instead of using arrays, we'll use a priority queue for `p` and a set for `b`. The priority queue will automatically maintain the smallest element at the top, reducing the need for sorting and making it easy to check the smallest element. The set `b` will allow for efficient searching and insertion.

2. **Redundant Computations:** We'll store the result of `(num + 1) * b[i].fs` in a variable to avoid computing it twice.

3. **Loop Optimization:** We'll replace the loops with a loop that iterates over the set `b`. Inside this loop, we'll add elements from the priority queue to the sum and increment `num` until the condition is met. This allows us to only check the smallest elements, reducing the number of iterations.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** We'll use the `-O2` option when compiling the code. This enables all optimization flags that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff, yielding generally faster and more efficient code.

**Optimized Code Block**

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#define fs first
#define sc second
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
int n;
pair<ll, int> b[300010];
ll a[300010];
bool use[300010];

int main() {
  cin.tie(0);
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin >> n;
  priority_queue<pair<ll, int>, vector<pair<ll, int>>, greater<pair<ll, int>>> p;
  set<pair<ll, int>> bs;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i] >> b[i].fs;
    p.push(make_pair(a[i], i));
    b[i].sc = i;
    bs.insert(b[i]);
    use[i] = false;
  }
  int ans = 0;
  ll sum = 0;
  int num = 0;
  for (auto bi : bs) {
    while (!p.empty() && p.top().fs <= bi.fs) {
      if (!use[p.top().sc]) {
        sum += p.top().fs;
        use[p.top().sc] = true;
        num++;
      }
      p.pop();
    }
    ll next = sum + (p.empty() ? 0 : p.top().fs);
    while (!p.empty() && next <= (num + 1) * bi.fs) {
      sum += p.top().fs;
      use[p.top().sc] = true;
      num++;
      p.pop();
      next = sum + (p.empty() ? 0 : p.top().fs);
    }
    if (sum <= num * bi.fs)
      ans = max(ans, num);
    sum -= a[bi.sc];
    num--;
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}
```

This code maintains the functionality of the original code, but it is more efficient thanks to the use of priority queue and set data structures, the elimination of redundant computations, and loop optimization.

The trade-off here is that the use of priority queue and set may increase the complexity of the code and make it slightly harder to understand. However, the gain in performance justifies this trade-off.
