The main performance issues with this program are:

1. Dynamic memory allocation: The program uses dynamic memory allocation (`new`) in a loop, which is much slower than stack allocation and can cause memory fragmentation.

2. Redundant computations: The program is doing redundant computations in the inner loop for values of `j` where `S[j]` has already become negative.

3. Unnecessary use of tertiary operator: The program uses a tertiary operator in a case where a simple if statement would suffice.

Here's the optimization strategy:

1. Replace dynamic memory allocation with stack allocation: We can replace the dynamic array `S` with a static array, which will be faster due to avoiding dynamic memory allocation.

2. Break from inner loop when `S[j]` becomes negative: We can add a break statement in the inner loop to stop further iterations once `S[j]` becomes negative. This will save CPU cycles.

3. Use if statement instead of tertiary operator: Using an if statement instead of a tertiary operator will make the code more readable and efficient.

Here are the step-by-step explanations for each optimization:

1. Replace dynamic memory allocation with stack allocation: Dynamic memory allocation is slower than stack allocation because it involves system calls and can cause memory fragmentation. By replacing the dynamic array with a static array, we can avoid these issues and improve performance.

2. Break from inner loop when `S[j]` becomes negative: In the current code, even after `S[j]` becomes negative, the program continues to subtract `B` from it in further iterations. This is unnecessary and wasteful. By adding a break statement in the inner loop, we can stop these unnecessary computations and improve performance.

3. Use if statement instead of tertiary operator: The tertiary operator is meant to be a shorthand for simple conditional assignments. Using it to carry out an operation (i.e., `a = 0`) in a conditional clause is not only inefficient but also less readable. Replacing it with an if statement improves both performance and readability.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, K, i, j, B, a;
  int S[100];  // Assume the maximum value of K is 100

  while (true) {
    a = 1;
    cin >> N >> K;

    if (N == 0 && K == 0)
      break;

    for (i = K; i--;)
      cin >> S[i];

    for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      for (j = K; j--;) {
        cin >> B;
        S[j] -= B;

        if (S[j] < 0) {
          a = 0;
          break;
        }
      }
      
      // Skip remaining iterations if a is 0
      if (a == 0)
        break;
    }

    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
Please adjust the size of the static array `S` based on the maximum possible value of `K` in your use case. Also, note that the optimized code assumes that the input stream `cin` does not encounter any errors. If this assumption is not valid, you should add error checking code accordingly.
