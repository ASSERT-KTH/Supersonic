This code is a program that reads two integers, N and K, from standard input. It then reads K integers into an array, and subtracts N sets of K integers from the array. If any of the elements in the array become negative, it sets a flag variable `a` to `0`. If `a` is `0`, it outputs "No", otherwise it outputs "Yes". This continues until `N` and `K` are both `0`.

The program has a few areas that can be improved for performance:

1. Dynamic memory allocation: This program repeatedly allocates and deallocates memory for the array `S` using `new` and `delete`. This dynamic memory allocation is slower than static allocation.

2. Redundant computations: The check `S[j] < 0 ? a = 0 : 0` is executed for every element in the array, but once `a` is set to `0`, it won't be changed back to `1`. So, we can break the loop early once `a` is set to `0`, and this will save some unnecessary computations.

3. Loop optimization: The inner loop can be optimized by using loop unrolling, a technique that increases the number of operations per loop iteration, which can reduce the overhead of loop control instructions.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, K, B;
  bool a;
  int S[1000];  // Assume the maximum value of K is 1000
  
  while (cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    a = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < K; ++i)
      cin >> S[i];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      for (int j = 0; j < K; ++j) {
        cin >> B;
        S[j] -= B;
        if (S[j] < 0) {
          a = false;
          break;
        }
      }
      if (!a)
        break;
    }
    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this version:

1. We use an array with a reasonable size (1000) to avoid dynamic memory allocation. The size can be adjusted based on the expected maximum value of `K`.

2. We replace `int` flag `a` with `bool` flag `a` for more readability and semantic correctness.

3. Once `a` is set to `false`, we break the inner loop immediately using `break`, which saves us from doing unnecessary computations.

4. We also change the structure of the loop to a more readable and conventional form.

The trade-off here is that we have a fixed-size array that may use more memory than needed in some cases. However, this is generally a reasonable trade-off for improved performance, as dynamic memory allocation is expensive. Also, the maximum size of the array can be adjusted according to the problem constraints.
