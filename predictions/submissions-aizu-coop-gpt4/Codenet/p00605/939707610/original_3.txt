1. Code Analysis:

This program reads from the input two integers N and K, and then K integers as an array. It then reads N sets of K integers and subtracts every set from the original array. If any of the elements in the array becomes negative, it prints "No", otherwise it prints "Yes". 

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage in the code:

   - The code uses a dynamically allocated array "S" which is not deallocated after use, leading to potential memory leaks.
   - The inner loop that subtracts B from each element of S can be optimized.

2. Optimization Strategy:

   - Use a std::vector instead of a dynamically allocated array to automatically manage memory.
   - Use std::min_element to find if any element of the array is negative, instead of checking in every iteration of the loop.
   - Use std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) to disable synchronization with C's stdio, which can speed up cin and cout.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   - Replace the dynamically allocated array "S" with a std::vector. This will manage the memory automatically, preventing memory leaks.
   - Instead of checking if any element of S is negative in every iteration of the inner loop, use std::min_element after the loop. This function returns an iterator pointing to the smallest element in the range [first, last). If the smallest element is negative, it means that at least one subtraction resulted in a negative number.
   - Call std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) at the beginning of main(). This will disable synchronization with C's stdio, which can make cin and cout faster. However, this means that you cannot mix calls to cin/cout with calls to scanf/printf or read/write to/from stdin/stdout reliably.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int N, K, B;
  while (cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    vector<int> S(K);
    for (int i = K; i--;)
      cin >> S[i];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
      for (int j = K; j--;)
        cin >> B, S[j] -= B;
    cout << (*min_element(S.begin(), S.end()) < 0 ? "No" : "Yes") << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The functionality and output of the optimized code remains the same as the original. The memory usage is improved by using a std::vector instead of a dynamically allocated array, and the running time is potentially improved by using std::min_element and by disabling synchronization with C's stdio. The code is also more readable and safer, as there is no risk of memory leaks.
