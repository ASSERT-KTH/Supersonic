Code Analysis:
This code reads two inputs, N and K, and allocates a dynamic array of size K. It then repeatedly reads in N*K inputs, subtracting each from the respective element in the array. If any of these subtractions result in a negative value, a flag variable "a" is set to zero. The process continues until N and K both equal zero. 

The output "Yes" or "No" depends on whether all subtractions result in non-negative numbers. If one is negative, the output will be "No".

Potential areas of optimization:

1. Dynamic array: The code dynamically allocates an array for every iteration of the outer while loop. This incurs overhead for memory allocation and deallocation, and it could potentially be avoided.

2. Nested loops: There are nested for-loops in this code, which contribute to its time complexity. Optimizing these could improve performance.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a static array: If the maximum possible value for K is known, we can declare a static array with that size. This will avoid the need for dynamic memory allocation.

2. Utilize break statement: As soon as "a" is set to 0, we can break out of the inner loop. This will avoid unnecessary iterations and computations.

Step-by-step Explanation:

1. Replacing dynamic array with static array: Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation are expensive operations. If we know that K will not exceed a certain value, say MAX, we can declare a static array of size MAX. This will avoid the overhead of repeated memory allocation and deallocation.

2. Adding a break statement: As soon as we find that a subtraction results in a negative number, we know that the output will be "No". Therefore, we can break out of the inner loop as soon as "a" is set to 0. This will avoid unnecessary calculations.

Trade-offs: The optimized code assumes a maximum limit for K, which may not be applicable in all scenarios. However, if such a limit exists, this optimization will provide a significant performance boost.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define MAX 1000 // Assuming K will not exceed this value

int main() {
  int N, K, i, j, S[MAX], B, a;

  while (cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    a = 1;
    for (i = 0; i < K; ++i) // Read in initial values
      cin >> S[i];
    for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      for (j = 0; j < K; ++j) {
        cin >> B;
        S[j] -= B;
        if (S[j] < 0) {
          a = 0;
          break; // Break out of loop as soon as a negative number is found
        }
      }
      if (a == 0) break; // If a is 0, break out of outer loop as well
    }
    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code reduces memory allocation overhead and avoids unnecessary computations, potentially offering significant performance improvements.
