The provided C++ code reads two integers from the input, N and K. It then initializes an array S of size K with values from the input. The program continues to read N blocks of K integers each, subtracting each block from the S array. If any of the elements in array S becomes negative, it sets a flag 'a' to 0. Finally, it prints "Yes" if 'a' is still 1 (i.e., all elements in S are non-negative) and "No" otherwise.

Here are some performance issues in the code:
1. Unnecessary use of dynamic memory allocation: The size of array S depends on the value of K which is read from the input. However, there is no check for the maximum value of K. If K is too large, it can cause memory allocation problems. Also, dynamic memory allocation and deallocation is slower than using automatic storage. 
2. Lack of memory deallocation: The code allocates memory for the array S, but it never deallocates this memory, leading to a memory leak.

### Optimization Strategy:
1. Use stack allocation instead of dynamic memory allocation: If the maximum value of K is known and reasonable, we can allocate the memory for array S on the stack instead of using `new`. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
2. Add memory deallocation: If the maximum value of K is not known or too large, we need to continue using `new` to allocate memory for S. In this case, we should add `delete[]` to deallocate the memory after its use to prevent memory leaks.

### Optimized Code Block:

Here's the optimized code assuming a maximum value of K equal to 1000:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_K = 1000;

int main() {
  int N, K, i, j, S[MAX_K], B, a;

  while (a = 1, cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    for (i = K; i--;)
      cin >> S[i];
    for (i = 0; i < N; ++i)
      for (j = K; j--;)
        cin >> B, S[j] -= B, S[j] < 0 ? a = 0 : 0;
    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this version of the code, the array S is allocated on the stack with a maximum size of 1000. The actual number of elements used is determined by the value of K read from the input. This eliminates the need for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, making the code run faster and eliminating the risk of memory leaks. Note that the optimization assumes that K will not exceed 1000. If it could, you'd need to continue using `new` and add `delete[] S` before the end of the loop.
