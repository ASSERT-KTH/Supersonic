Code Analysis:
The code reads two numbers from the input, N and K. If either N or K is non-zero, it continues executing the while loop. Inside the loop, it first initializes an integer array S of size K and reads K values into the array. Then it reads N*K values from the input, subtracts each value from an element of array S, and checks if the result is less than 0. If it is, it sets a to 0. Finally, it outputs "Yes" if a is equal to 1 or "No" if it is not.

Optimization Strategy:

1. It seems like the integer array S is dynamically allocated for each iteration. Since the maximum size K is known, it would be more efficient to allocate the array once outside the loop and then just reset the values inside the loop.

2. The program unnecessarily checks S[j] < 0 every time it reads a number. This could be avoided by adding a break statement when a becomes 0, because at that point the result will always be "No".

3. Using cin and cout for input and output is slower than using scanf and printf. Therefore, replace cin and cout with scanf and printf for faster I/O.

4. The variable a is set to 1 at the beginning of every iteration of the while loop. This can be moved to the inside of the loop, right before the second for loop.

Optimized Code:

```c++
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int N, K, i, j, S[100], B, a;
  while (scanf("%d %d", &N, &K) != EOF, N || K) {
    for (i = K; i--;)
      scanf("%d", &S[i]);
    a = 1;
    for (i = 0; i < N && a; ++i)
      for (j = K; j--;)
        scanf("%d", &B), S[j] -= B, a = S[j] >= 0;
    printf(a ? "Yes\n" : "No\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The dynamic allocation of the array S has been replaced with static allocation. This way, the array is allocated only once, reducing memory usage.

2. The variable a is now set to 1 right before the second for loop. This is more efficient because it avoids setting a to 1 in every iteration of the while loop when it's not necessary.

3. A check has been added to the second for loop to break the loop as soon as a becomes 0. This avoids unnecessary iterations and checks.

4. The I/O operations have been replaced with scanf and printf, which are faster than cin and cout.

Trade-offs:

The main trade-off with these optimizations is that the code becomes less readable. Using scanf and printf instead of cin and cout, and adding a break condition to the for loop makes the code more complex and harder to understand for someone not familiar with these practices. However, the performance gain from these changes is significant, making them a worthwhile trade-off.
