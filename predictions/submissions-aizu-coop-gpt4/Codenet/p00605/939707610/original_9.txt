1. Code Analysis:
    The given code takes two integers 'N' and 'K' as input where 'N' is the number of iterations and 'K' is the size of the array 'S'. The code then inputs 'K' integers and stores them in the array 'S'. In each iteration, it subtracts 'K' integers from the array 'S'. If any of the elements in 'S' become negative, it sets the flag 'a' to 0. After completing all the iterations, if the flag 'a' is still 1, it prints "Yes", otherwise, it prints "No".

    Potential performance bottleneck and inefficient memory usage:
    1. The code uses dynamic memory allocation which is slower than static memory allocation. 
    2. The code does not deallocate the memory after using it, which can cause a memory leak.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Replace dynamic memory allocation with static memory allocation.
    2. Remove redundant or unnecessary computations.
    3. Optimize loops and recursive calls.
    4. Utilize compiler optimizations or pragma directives.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Instead of dynamic memory allocation, use static memory allocation for the array 'S'. This is because static memory allocation is faster than dynamic memory allocation. It also prevents memory leaks as we don't need to manually deallocate the memory.
    2. There is no need to subtract 'B' from 'S[j]' if the flag 'a' is 0. We can add a condition to skip the subtraction if 'a' is 0.
    3. We can use a break statement to exit the inner loop when 'S[j]' becomes negative. This will avoid unnecessary iterations.
    4. We can use the -O3 flag during compilation to enable all optimization options.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int N, K, i, j, S[100], B, a;
  while (a = 1, cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    for (i = 0; i < K; ++i)
      cin >> S[i];
    for (i = 0; i < N && a; ++i)
      for (j = 0; j < K; ++j) {
        cin >> B;
        if(a) {
          S[j] -= B;
          if(S[j] < 0) {
            a = 0;
            break;
          }
        }
      }
    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The size of the array 'S' is set to 100. Please adjust the size according to your needs.
