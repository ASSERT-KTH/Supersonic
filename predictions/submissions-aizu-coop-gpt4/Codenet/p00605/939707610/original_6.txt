### Code Analysis
This is a simple C++ program that reads two integers `N` and `K` from the input. It then reads `K` numbers into an array `S`, and `N` times `K` numbers into `B` one at a time, subtracting each from the corresponding element in `S`. If any element of `S` becomes negative, the program will output "No", otherwise it outputs "Yes".

### Optimization Strategy
1. Inefficient Data Structures: This program uses an array allocated with `new` to store the `K` numbers. This is not necessarily inefficient, but it can be replaced with a `std::vector<int>` to manage memory more automatically and safely.

2. Redundant Computations: The program checks if each element of `S` is negative within the inner loop. This is not necessary. We can push this check outside of the inner loop, as we only need to check this condition once per iteration of the outer loop.

3. Loops Optimization: The inner loop reads `K` numbers and subtracts each from the corresponding element in `S`. This could be optimized by reading all `K` numbers at once and then subtracting them from `S` in a single pass.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations are always a good idea when performance is a concern. We can use `-O3` to enable all optimizations available in GCC. This includes optimizations like loop unrolling and function inlining.

### Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Replace the dynamic array `S` with a `std::vector<int>`. This automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation, reducing the risk of memory leaks.

2. Move the check for negative elements of `S` outside of the inner loop. This reduces the number of comparisons and conditional branches, which can be expensive in terms of CPU cycles.

3. Read all `K` numbers at once into a temporary `std::vector<int>`, then subtract these from `S` in a single pass. This reduces the number of iterations over the input data.

4. Compile with `-O3` to enable all compiler optimizations. This can lead to significant performance improvements, although the exact impact will depend on the specific code and hardware.

### Optimized Code Block
Here is the optimized code block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, K, B;
  while (cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    vector<int> S(K);
    for (int i = K; i--;)
      cin >> S[i];

    bool a = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      vector<int> temp(K);
      for (int j = K; j--;)
        cin >> temp[j], S[j] -= temp[j];
      for (int j : S) {
        if (j < 0) {
          a = false;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Remember to compile this code with the `-O3` flag to enable all compiler optimizations.
