**1. Code Analysis**

This C++ program accepts two integers, `N` and `K`, from the user until they are both zero. It then creates a dynamic array, `S`, of size `K` and populates it with user input. Afterwards, it accepts `N` inputs `K` times, subtracting each from the corresponding element in `S`. If any element of `S` is less than zero, a flag variable `a` is set to zero. Finally, it prints "Yes" if `a` is still 1, and "No" otherwise.

There are a few potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage in this program:

- Dynamic allocation and deallocation: The program continuously allocates and deallocates memory for the dynamic array `S` in each iteration of the outermost while loop. This constant allocation and deallocation of memory can be a performance bottleneck.

- Redundant computations and unnecessary code: The program uses the comma operator and the ternary operator in a way that is not efficient and makes the code harder to read. For example, `S[j] < 0 ? a = 0 : 0;` is less clear than an if statement and does the same thing.

**2. Optimization Strategy**

- Use vector instead of dynamic allocation: To avoid the constant allocation and deallocation of memory, we can use a `std::vector<int>` instead of a dynamically allocated array. The vector will automatically handle memory management for us, improving performance and reducing the chance of memory leaks.

- Make the program more readable: Replace the comma operator and ternary operator with more standard constructs like if statements. This will make the program easier to understand and maintain.

- Remove redundant variables: The variable `a` is not necessary and can be removed. We can break out of the nested for loops as soon as `S[j]` is less than zero.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation**

- Replace the dynamic array with a vector: This will automatically manage the memory for us, reducing the chance of memory leaks and improving performance.

- Replace the comma operator and ternary operator with if statements: This will make the code easier to read and maintain.

- Remove the variable `a`: Instead of setting `a` to zero if `S[j]` is less than zero, we can simply break out of the loops. This will make the code simpler and easier to understand.

**4. Optimized Code Block**

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N, K, B;
    while (cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
        vector<int> S(K);
        for (int i = K; i--;)
            cin >> S[i];
        bool isPossible = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            for (int j = K; j--;) {
                cin >> B;
                S[j] -= B;
                if (S[j] < 0) {
                    isPossible = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!isPossible) break;
        }
        cout << (isPossible ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code is more efficient and easier to understand than the original code. The use of `std::vector<int>` instead of a dynamically allocated array improves performance and reduces the chance of memory leaks. The code is also more readable due to the removal of the comma operator and the ternary operator, and the replacement of these constructs with more standard constructs like if statements and boolean variables. The removal of the unnecessary variable `a` also simplifies the code.
