The provided C code is an implementation of the Matrix Chain Multiplication problem using Dynamic Programming. The Matrix Chain Multiplication problem is a classic computer science optimization problem, where we aim to find the most efficient way to multiply a given sequence of matrices. The order in which the matrices are multiplied can significantly affect the number of simple arithmetic operations needed to compute the product.

Code Analysis:

1. The code uses a 2D array `m[101][101]` to store intermediate results of the matrix chain multiplication, which is a common practice in dynamic programming solutions.
2. The function `matrixChainOrder()` implements the main algorithm. It firstly initializes the diagonal of `m` to zero, then it calculates the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply a chain of matrices, storing the results in `m`.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The 2D array `m` is of size 101x101, which may be larger than necessary. We can dynamically allocate memory to the 2D array `m` based on the actual input size `n`, which can save memory when `n` is significantly less than 101.
2. Redundant Computations: There are no noticeable redundant computations in the code.
3. Loops: The loops are necessary for the dynamic programming algorithm and cannot be meaningfully optimized.
4. Compiler optimizations: We can enable compiler optimizations such as `-O3` which enables all `-O2` optimizations and further boosts performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Dynamically allocate memory to `m`: Instead of always allocating 101x101 integers, we can allocate only `n+1`x`n+1` integers which can save memory in cases where `n` is significantly less than 101. The trade-off here is that dynamic memory allocation can be slower than static allocation, and we also need to remember to free the memory after using it to avoid memory leaks.
2. Enable compiler optimizations: By passing `-O3` to the gcc compiler, we can enable all `-O2` optimizations and further boost performance. The trade-off here is that the code may become harder to debug.

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define INF 100000000

int *p;
int **m;

int matrixChainOrder(int pl) {
  int n, i, j, l, k, q;
  n = pl - 1;
  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    m[i][i] = 0;
  }
  for (l = 2; l <= n; l++) {
    for (i = 1; i <= n - l + 1; i++) {
      j = i + l - 1;
      m[i][j] = INF;
      for (k = i; k < j; k++) {
        q = m[i][k] + m[k + 1][j] + p[i - 1] * p[k] * p[j];
        if (m[i][j] > q)
          m[i][j] = q;
      }
    }
  }
  return m[1][n];
}

int main() {
  int n, i, x, k;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  p = malloc((n+1) * sizeof(int));
  m = malloc((n+1) * sizeof(int*));
  for (i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    m[i] = malloc((n+1) * sizeof(int));
  }
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &p[i]);
    if (i < n - 1)
      scanf("%d", &k);
  }
  scanf("%d", &p[n]);
  x = matrixChainOrder(n + 1);
  printf("%d\n", x);
  for (i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    free(m[i]);
  }
  free(m);
  free(p);
  return 0;
}
```
To compile with optimizations, use `gcc -O3 -o main main.c`.
