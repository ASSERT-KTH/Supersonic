The provided code implements the Matrix Chain Multiplication problem. This is a well-studied problem in computer science where the goal is to find the most efficient way to multiply a chain of matrices. The naive way of multiplying a chain of matrices is quite inefficient, as it can lead to a large number of unnecessary operations. This problem can be solved optimally using dynamic programming.

Here are a few potential optimizations for the above code:

1. **Avoiding Global Variables:** Global variables are generally considered bad practice in C/C++ as they can lead to hard-to-debug code. In this case, the two-dimensional array `m` and the one-dimensional array `p` are global. We can avoid this by passing them as parameters to the relevant functions.

2. **Avoiding Macros for Constants:** Using `#define` to declare constants is also generally bad practice in C/C++. Instead, we can use `const` to declare constants. In this case, `INF` can be declared as a constant integer.

3. **Efficient IO Operations:** The standard input/output functions in C/C++ (`scanf` and `printf`) are quite slow. We can speed up these operations by using faster alternatives.

4. **Better Loop Structures:** The current loop structures can be optimized for better cache utilization. In some cases, loop unrolling can also help to improve performance.

5. **Compiler Optimizations:** Depending on the specific compiler being used, there may be various compiler flags that can be used to further optimize the code. For example, the `-O2` or `-O3` flags with `gcc` can often lead to significant performance improvements.

Let's begin by addressing these issues, one by one.
