The given code is a C program that solves the Matrix Chain Multiplication problem using dynamic programming. The main potential performance bottlenecks in this code are the nested loops in the `matrixChainOrder` function, which have a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the length of the input array p. 

Here is an optimization strategy:

1. Use more efficient data structures: The code uses two-dimensional arrays for storing intermediate results. The array `m` is used to store the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply a chain of matrices, while the array `p` is used to store the dimensions of the matrices. Since the program is not multi-threaded, we will keep them as it is.

2. Redundant or unnecessary computations: The code checks whether `m[i][j] > q` in every iteration of the innermost loop and updates `m[i][j]` only when `m[i][j] > q`. This check is unnecessary because `m[i][j]` is always INF at the start of the loop. We can remove this check and directly assign `m[i][j] = q`.

3. Optimize loops or recursive calls: Here, loops are already optimized as much as possible. There is no much scope for loop unrolling as the loop variables are dependent on previous iterations.

4. Compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations can be turned on using flags during compilation. For example, the `-O3` flag can be used with gcc to enable all optimization.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary check `m[i][j] > q`. Directly assign `m[i][j] = q`.

Trade-offs: The changes made are minimal and do not increase the complexity of the code. The optimization may result in a slight performance improvement, but it will not change the overall time complexity of the algorithm. 

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define INF 100000000
int m[101][101];
int p[101];

int matrixChainOrder(int pl) {
  int n, i, j, l, k, q;
  n = pl - 1;
  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    m[i][i] = 0;
  }
  for (l = 2; l <= n; l++) {
    for (i = 1; i <= n - l + 1; i++) {
      j = i + l - 1;
      m[i][j] = INF;
      for (k = i; k < j; k++) {
        q = m[i][k] + m[k + 1][j] + p[i - 1] * p[k] * p[j];
        m[i][j] = q;  // directly assign q to m[i][j]
      }
    }
  }
  return m[1][n];
}

int main() {
  int n, i, x, k;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &p[i]);
    if (i < n - 1)
      scanf("%d", &k);
  }
  scanf("%d", &p[n]);
  x = matrixChainOrder(n + 1);
  printf("%d\n", x);
  return 0;
}
```
This code can be compiled with the `-O3` flag to enable all compiler optimizations. For example:

```bash
gcc -O3 -o matrix matrix.c
```
