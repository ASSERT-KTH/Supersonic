The provided code implements the Matrix Chain Multiplication problem, which is a classic dynamic programming problem. The problem involves finding the most efficient way to multiply a given sequence of matrices. The order of multiplication can significantly affect the number of simple arithmetic operations needed to compute the product, or the efficiency.

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the current implementation and optimization strategies:

1. Code Analysis:
    - The matrix 'm' and the array 'p' are declared as global variables. This can be avoided to prevent potential memory access conflicts.
    - The dynamic programming table 'm' is being filled in a bottom-up manner.
    - The cost of multiplication of each possible chain of matrices is calculated repeatedly, which leads to a high number of redundant computations.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - Move the global variables 'm' and 'p' inside the function scope to limit their lifetimes and prevent potential memory access conflicts. 
    - Use memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computations. This can be achieved by initializing the matrix 'm' with -1, and only compute the cost if it's not calculated before (i.e., if m[i][j] == -1). 
    - Use fast input/output methods to speed up the reading and writing process. You can use "ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);" to make input/output faster.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    - Move global variables 'm' and 'p' inside the function scope: This limits the scope and lifetime of these variables. It is a good practice to limit the scope of variables as much as possible. This makes your code cleaner, easier to debug, and reduces the risk of unexpected side effects.
    - Use memoization: By storing the results of subproblems, you can avoid calculating the same result multiple times. This can significantly reduce the time complexity of your code. However, it requires additional memory to store the results.
    - Use fast I/O methods: Reading and writing data can be a bottleneck in your program. By using faster I/O methods, you can significantly reduce the time spent on these operations.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define INF 100000000
using namespace std;

int matrixChainOrder(vector<int>& p) {
  int n = p.size() - 1;
  vector<vector<int>> m(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, -1));

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    m[i][i] = 0;
  }

  for (int l = 2; l <= n; l++) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n - l + 1; i++) {
      int j = i + l - 1;
      m[i][j] = INF;
      for (int k = i; k < j; k++) {
        int q = (m[i][k] == -1 ? matrixChainOrder(p, i, k) : m[i][k]) +
                (m[k + 1][j] == -1 ? matrixChainOrder(p, k + 1, j) : m[k + 1][j]) +
                p[i - 1] * p[k] * p[j];
        if (m[i][j] > q)
          m[i][j] = q;
      }
    }
  }
  return m[1][n];
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, k;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> p(n + 1);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> p[i];
    if (i < n - 1)
      cin >> k;
  }
  
  cin >> p[n];
  int x = matrixChainOrder(p);
  cout << x << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Keep in mind that this code still has a time complexity of O(n^3) due to the nature of the problem. Depending on the size of your inputs, it might still run slowly.
