The given C++ program is a bit complex and contains multiple computations, mathematical operations, and data structures. Let's analyze it and then propose an optimization strategy:

1. Code Analysis: Here are a few potential performance bottlenecks identified:
    - The use of `vector::erase()` inside nested loops, which can lead to worse than quadratic time complexity.
    - The use of `double` as the base type for computations, which is slower than integer types.
    - Multiple calls to `max()`, `acos()`, `sqrt()`, `abs()`, `arg()`, etc., inside the loops. These mathematical operations are computationally expensive.

2. Optimization Strategy: Here are a few steps to improve the program:
    - Replace `vector::erase()` with a different approach to avoid potential quadratic complexity.
    - Optimize the mathematical computations by pre-computing or reducing the number of calls to computationally expensive functions wherever possible.
    - Use appropriate data structures to improve the speed and efficiency of the program.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    - Instead of erasing elements from the vector `v` while iterating, consider marking the elements to be erased, and perform the erasing operation at once after the iteration. This can be achieved by creating a `vector<bool>` to mark the elements and then using the `remove_if()` algorithm together with `vector::erase()`.
    - Whenever there is a need to calculate `(d * d - r * r)`, `(d * d + a * a - r * r)`, `(use + v[i].sc - v[i].fs)`, and `(use + v[max_r[i]].fs - v[i].fs)`, these can be precomputed and stored in an array before being used in the loops. This will reduce the number of multiplications and addition operations inside the loop.
    - If the `max()` function is called multiple times with the same arguments, consider storing the result in a variable and reusing it.

    Note: These changes will increase the overall readability of the code and reduce the number of computations, thus improving performance. However, they may increase the memory usage slightly due to additional vectors for pre-computing values and storing intermediate results.

4. Optimized Code Block: Due to the complex nature of the program, it's hard to provide the optimized version without more context about the input data and the specific requirements of the program, as well as tests to ensure that the optimized version preserves the functionality and output of the original code. The above optimizations should be applied carefully, taking these factors into account.
