### Code Analysis:

This code reads hours, minutes, and seconds, calculates the remaining time until two hours from now, and prints it twice, once in normal time and once tripled.

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient usage:

1. Loop Unrolling: There are two nested loops. The inner loop only executes twice. This is a prime candidate for loop unrolling to reduce the overhead of loop control.

2. Redundant Computations: The time computations occur within the loops, causing the same computation to be repeated unnecessarily. These computations could be moved outside the loops.

### Optimization Strategy:

1. Loop Unrolling: Completely unroll the inner loop.

2. Redundant Computations: Compute the time once and store the result in a variable. Use this variable within the loop.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Loop Unrolling: Loop unrolling is a technique used to reduce the overhead of loop control. It involves replacing the loop with an equivalent sequence of statements, effectively eliminating the looping mechanism. This can offer significant performance benefits, especially in cases where the loop body is small and the number of iterations is small and known, as is the case here.

2. Redundant Computations: The time computations are repeated twice due to the inner loop. By moving these computations outside the loop, we can reduce the number of computations and therefore increase the efficiency of the program. 

### Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main(h, m, s, t) {
  for (; scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) * -~h;) {
    t = (120 - h * 60 - m) * 60 - s;
    printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t / 3600, t / 60 % 60, t % 60);
    t *= 3;
    printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t / 3600, t / 60 % 60, t % 60);
  }
}
```

In this optimized code, we have eliminated the inner loop and moved the time computations outside the loop. This reduces the number of computations and the overhead of loop control, making the code more efficient. The functionality and output of the original code are preserved.
