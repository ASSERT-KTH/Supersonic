The provided code reads hours, minutes, and seconds from the console, calculates the time remaining until two hours have passed, and prints this time twice. Let's analyze the code to identify optimization opportunities.

1. Code Analysis:
   The code is relatively compact and efficient. However, there are a few points that we can optimize:
   - The use of scanf inside the loop condition can be confusing and may impact performance.
   - The multiplication by 3 for the variable t in the second loop seems unnecessary since it doesn't change the result. 
   - The use of magic numbers can make the code hard to read and maintain.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Move the scanf call into the loop body to improve readability.
   - Remove the unnecessary multiplication by 3 for the variable t.
   - Replace magic numbers with descriptive constants to improve readability.

3. Step-by-step Explanation:

   Step 1: Move scanf call into the loop body: 
   This step improves readability and performance. It is better to have the scanf call inside the loop body rather than in its condition to avoid confusion and potential performance issues.

   Step 2: Remove unnecessary multiplication:
   The multiplication by 3 for the variable t in the second loop doesn't change the output and can be removed to improve performance.

   Step 3: Replace magic numbers with constants:
   Using constants instead of magic numbers can make the code more readable and maintainable.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```c
#include<stdio.h>

#define TWO_HOURS_IN_SECONDS 7200
#define SECONDS_IN_HOUR 3600
#define SECONDS_IN_MINUTE 60

main() {
  int h, m, s, t;
  while (1) {
    if (scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) != 3) {
      break;
    }
    t = TWO_HOURS_IN_SECONDS - (h * SECONDS_IN_HOUR + m * SECONDS_IN_MINUTE + s);
    
    for (h = 0; h < 2; h++) {
      printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t / SECONDS_IN_HOUR, 
                                (t / SECONDS_IN_MINUTE) % SECONDS_IN_MINUTE, 
                                t % SECONDS_IN_MINUTE);
    }
  }
}
```
This version of the code is more readable and maintainable. It also has a minor performance improvement by removing the unnecessary multiplication. The functionality and output of the original code are preserved.
