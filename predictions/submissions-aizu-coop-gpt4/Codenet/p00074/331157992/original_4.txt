The provided C code is a small program that reads hours, minutes, and seconds from the input, performs some calculations, and prints the result in a time format. The code is quite cryptic and uses a few C language tricks to save space, but this leads to poor readability and maintainability. Also, it can have potential performance issues.

Here are the optimization strategies:

1. Code Readability: The code is written in an obfuscated way, which makes it hard to read, debug, and optimize. Improving readability is the first step towards optimization.

2. Avoiding Unnecessary Computations: The computations in the printf function are executed multiple times. These computations can be stored in variables to avoid redundant calculations.

3. Use of Data Types: The main function parameters are not well defined. It is better to use int data type to improve code clarity and avoid potential issues.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Use compiler optimization flags when compiling the program. This will instruct the compiler to optimize the code for better performance.

Optimized Code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int h, m, s;
    while(scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) != EOF) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
            int t = (120 - h * 60 - m) * 60 - s;
            int hours = t / 3600;
            int minutes = (t / 60) % 60;
            int seconds = t % 60;
            printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", hours, minutes, seconds);
            t *= 3;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The function signature is changed to `int main()` for better readability and standard conformance.

2. The while loop is used instead of the first for loop for better readability. The condition checks for end of file (EOF) which is standard way to check for input stream end.

3. The calculation of `t`, `hours`, `minutes`, and `seconds` is moved outside the printf function to avoid unnecessary computations.

4. The variables `h`, `m`, `s` are defined inside the `main` function to be more clear about their data types.

Compiler optimization can be enabled by using `-O2` or `-O3` flag while compiling. For example: `gcc -O3 file.c`. This would typically enable loop unrolling, function inlining, and many other optimizations. However, this is outside the scope of the code itself, and is more about how the code is compiled.

Please note that this optimization improves code readability and maintainability, but the performance gain might be negligible for this small program. However, the concept is important for larger programs where unnecessary computations could lead to significant performance loss.
