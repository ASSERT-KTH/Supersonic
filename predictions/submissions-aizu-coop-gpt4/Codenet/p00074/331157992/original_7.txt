1. Code Analysis:

   The provided code is a C program that reads hours, minutes, and seconds from the input, calculates some transformation of these times, and then prints the transformed time. The code is compact and cryptic, which makes understanding and maintaining it difficult.

2. Optimization Strategy:

   1. Improve code readability: The current code is very compact and uses a few tricks that make it hard to read. Improving the readability will not directly affect performance, but it will make the code easier to analyze and maintain.
   
   2. Use appropriate data types: The function arguments are not typed, which is allowed in C but is not a good practice because it can lead to unexpected behavior. The function main should return an int, and the arguments h, m, s, and t should be int as well.
   
   3. Minimize computations: The time transformations and printing are computed twice due to the second for loop. If there is no specific reason for this, these computations should be done only once.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   1. Improve code readability: The code uses the multiplication of scanf result and "-~h" as the condition of the first for loop. This is equivalent to "while(scanf(...) != EOF && h != -1)". The "-~h" part is a cryptic way of checking if h is not -1. The time transformation in the second for loop is also cryptic and can be rewritten in a more understandable way.
   
   2. Use appropriate data types: The main function should be defined as "int main(void)" and the variables h, m, s, and t should be declared as int inside the function.
   
   3. Minimize computations: The second for loop seems unnecessary, as it just repeats the same operations twice. We can remove this loop to minimize computations.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int h, m, s, t;
    
    // Continue reading input until EOF or h is -1
    while(scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) != EOF && h != -1) {
        // Calculate transformed time
        t = (120 - h * 60 - m) * 60 - s;
        
        // Print transformed time
        printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t / 3600, t / 60 % 60, t % 60);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code is easier to read and understand, and it performs fewer computations by removing the second for loop. The main function now returns an int, and the variables are properly declared, reducing the chance of unexpected behavior.
