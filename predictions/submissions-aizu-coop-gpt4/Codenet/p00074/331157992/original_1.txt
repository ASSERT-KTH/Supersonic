Code Analysis:
The given code reads hours, minutes, and seconds from the input, calculates time remaining until 2 hours (or 120 minutes) are reached, and prints this remaining time twice. The remaining time is initially calculated in seconds, and then it is tripled for the second printout.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient data structures: The current code uses primitive data types, which are the most efficient for this purpose. So, there is no need for change here.

2. Redundant computations: The remaining time is calculated twice. This can be optimized by storing it in a separate variable.

3. Optimizing loops: The second loop can be unrolled as it only iterates twice. This avoids the overhead of loop control.

4. Compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations can be applied by using flags at compile-time, but they are out of scope in the current context.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Store the remaining time in a separate variable: Instead of calculating the remaining time twice, we can calculate it once and store it in a separate variable. This saves one multiplication operation for each iteration of the outer loop.

2. Unroll the second loop: The second loop only iterates twice. By unrolling it, we can eliminate the overhead of loop control. Loop unrolling can improve performance by reducing the number of branch instructions, but it might lead to longer code.

Trade-offs: The proposed optimizations may result in slightly longer code, but the performance gain outweighs this downside.

Optimized Code Block:

```
main(h, m, s, t) {
  int t1, t2;  // Declare variables to store the remaining time
  for (; scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) * -~h;) {
    t1 = (120 - h * 60 - m) * 60 - s;  // Calculate the remaining time once
    t2 = t1 * 3;  // Calculate the tripled time once
    
    // Unroll the loop by replacing it with two print statements
    printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t1 / 3600, t1 / 60 % 60, t1 % 60);
    printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t2 / 3600, t2 / 60 % 60, t2 % 60);
  }
}
```
