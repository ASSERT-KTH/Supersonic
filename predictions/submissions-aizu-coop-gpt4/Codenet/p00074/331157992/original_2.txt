## Code Analysis

The existing code reads hours, minutes, and seconds from the input and calculates the remaining time until 2 hours past from that time. It prints this remaining time twice, first in real-time and then in triple speed.

The main performance bottlenecks in this code are:

1. The nested loop: this is a potential area for optimization.
2. The repeated calculation of time in seconds.
3. The division operations in the printf statement: these are more expensive than multiplication or addition operations.

## Optimization Strategy

1. Minimize the number of division operations.
2. Avoid recalculating values that remain constant within a loop.
3. Use shift operations for multiplying or dividing by powers of 2.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. The first optimization is to calculate `t / 3600`, `t / 60 % 60`, and `t % 60` only once and store the results in variables. This will avoid unnecessary recalculations in the printf statement. However, this will slightly increase memory usage.

2. The second optimization is to replace the division by 60 (when converting hours and minutes into seconds) with a shift operation. This is because division is more expensive than shift operations. However, this only works when dividing by powers of 2.

3. The third optimization is to replace the `t *= 3` operation. Since 3 is a power of 2 plus 1, we can use shift and addition operations instead of multiplication. This will reduce the computational cost.

## Optimized Code Block

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

main(h, m, s, t) {
  int h_div, m_div, s_mod;
  for (; scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) * -~h;) {
    t = ((120 << 6) - (h << 6) - m) - s; // convert 120 hours to seconds and subtract input time
    for (h = 2; h--; t = (t << 1) + t) { // multiply time by 3 using shift and addition
      h_div = t >> 6; // divide by 60 using shift
      m_div = (t >> 1) % 60; // divide by 60 using shift and modulo
      s_mod = t % 60;
      printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", h_div, m_div, s_mod);
    }
  }
}
```

Note: This optimization might not have a significant impact on performance, and the optimization could be different based on the architecture and compiler. Also, readability is reduced due to bit manipulation. It is often recommended to prioritize readability and maintainability over performance unless performance is a critical requirement.
