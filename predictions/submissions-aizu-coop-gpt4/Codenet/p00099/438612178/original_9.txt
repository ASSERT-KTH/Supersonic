1. Code Analysis:
The given code is implementing a priority queue data structure where each entry is a custom "data" structure that contains a number and a score. The priority queue is sorted based on score and then by num.

The code is reading "n" and "m" from standard input. It then enters a loop that runs "m" times. In each iteration, it reads two integers "a" and "b", adds "b" to an array "S" at index "a", and then adds a new "data" object to the priority queue.

Finally, it enters a loop where it checks the top of the priority queue with the score in the "S" array. If they match, it outputs the num and score and breaks out of the loop. If they don't match, it removes the top of the priority queue and continues the loop.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    A. Inefficient data structures: The priority queue and the data structure used seem to be efficient for the task. No changes needed here.
    B. Redundant computations: The while loop where it checks the top of the queue with the S array seems to be redundant since we have just pushed the element into the queue.
    C. Optimization of loops: The inner while loop can be optimized as it is unnecessary. Also, the usage of std::endl can be replaced with '\n' to avoid unnecessary flushing of the buffer which can slow down I/O operations.
    D. Compiler optimizations: No specific compiler directives are needed for this code.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    A. Remove the inner while loop: Since we just pushed the element into the queue, it is unnecessary to check if the top element of the queue is the same as the one we just pushed. This will save computational time.
    B. Replace std::endl with '\n': std::endl causes the output buffer to be flushed which can slow down I/O operations. Replacing it with '\n' will avoid this unnecessary operation.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;
const int MAX = 1000001;
int S[MAX];
struct data {
  int num, score;
  data() {}
  data(int n, int s) : num(n), score(s) {}
  bool operator<(const data &d) const {
    if (score != d.score)
      return score < d.score;
    return num > d.num;
  }
};
int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  priority_queue<data> Q;
  Q.push(data(0, 0));
  while (m--) {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    S[a] += b;
    Q.push(data(a, S[a]));
    data now = Q.top();
    cout << now.num << " " << now.score << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code has the same functionality as the original but is more efficient in terms of running time. The trade-off is a slight increase in complexity as the code is less explicit about checking the top of the queue with the S array.
