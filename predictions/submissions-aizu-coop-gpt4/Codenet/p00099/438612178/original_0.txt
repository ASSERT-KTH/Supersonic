Upon initial inspection, the given code appears to be efficiently written with the use of priority queue. However, some sections can be optimized for better performance and memory usage.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Efficient usage of standard I/O operations: The code uses both scanf and cout for input/output operations. We can stick to either scanf/printf or cin/cout for consistency and efficiency. Also, using std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL) can speed up cin/cout operations.

2. Redundant Queue Operations: In the while loop, there are multiple invocations of Q.top() and Q.pop() methods. We can optimize this by avoiding redundant queue operations.

3. Avoiding unnecessary object creation: The code creates a new data object every time it needs to push an element onto the queue. This can be optimized by creating a single data object and re-using it.

4. Efficient use of comparison operator: The comparison operator can be optimized to perform fewer comparisons in certain cases.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. I/O Operations: Use std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL) to speed up cin/cout operations. This disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams which can speed up input/output operations.

2. Queue Operations: Instead of calling Q.top() function twice, call it once and store the result in a local variable. Also, instead of checking the condition and then popping the element, pop the element first and then check the condition.

3. Object Creation: Instead of creating a new data object every time, create one object and modify its values each time before pushing onto the queue.

4. Comparison Operator: In the comparison operator, we can check for the condition that will be true more often first. Since most of the times the scores will be different, we should check this condition first.

Optimized Code Block:

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;
const int MAX = 1000001;
int S[MAX];
struct data {
  int num, score;
  data() {}
  data(int n, int s) : num(n), score(s) {}
  bool operator<(const data &d) const {
    if (score != d.score)
      return score < d.score;
    return num > d.num;
  }
};
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false); // For faster I/O
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  priority_queue<data> Q;
  data d(0, 0);
  Q.push(d);
  while (m--) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    S[a] += b;
    d.num = a; d.score = S[a];
    Q.push(d);
    while (1) {
      d = Q.top(); Q.pop();
      if (d.score == S[d.num]) {
        cout << d.num << " " << d.score << "\n";
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code maintains the functionality of the original code while improving the performance by reducing redundant queue operations, avoiding unnecessary object creation, and streamlining I/O operations. The trade-off is that the code becomes slightly more complex due to the addition of some performance-enhancing lines and changes in operation order.
