Code Analysis: 

This C++ program reads pairs of integers, and for each pair (a, b) it adds 'b' to the previous total for 'a', and it keeps track of which 'a' has the highest total 'b'. It does this using a priority queue of a custom structure data. The program is using a priority queue to maintain the highest score and the corresponding number. However, the code seems to have a potential performance bottleneck as it is continuously pushing and popping elements from the priority queue.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Data Structures: The priority queue is used correctly here, as the purpose is to maintain the highest total 'b' for 'a'. However, the continuous pushing and popping of elements can be optimized.

2. Redundant Computations: The code is checking and popping the top element of the priority queue in a while loop until it finds an element whose score is equal to the score in the array S. This can result in multiple redundant computations and can be optimized.

3. Loops: The while loop used for popping elements from the priority queue until the top element's score and the score in array S are equal can be optimized.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations or pragma directives do not seem necessary for this code as the focus here is on optimizing the algorithm and data structures.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. The primary optimization is to avoid the continuous pushing and popping of elements from the priority queue. This can be achieved by maintaining a separate variable to keep track of the maximum score and the corresponding number. After updating the score in the array S, check if the new score is greater than the current maximum score. If it is, update the maximum score and the corresponding number.

2. The second optimization is to avoid the redundant computations caused by the while loop. By keeping track of the maximum score separately, the need for the while loop is eliminated, thus reducing the number of computations.

3. The third optimization is to replace the 'cout' statement with 'printf'. 'printf' is generally faster than 'cout', so this can lead to a slight performance improvement.

4. The trade-off here is a slight increase in code complexity due to the introduction of additional variables to keep track of the maximum score and the corresponding number.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
const int MAX = 1000001;
int S[MAX];

int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  int maxScore = 0;
  int maxNum = 0;
  while (m--) {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    S[a] += b;
    // Check if the new score is greater than the current maximum score
    if (S[a] > maxScore) {
      maxScore = S[a];
      maxNum = a;
    }
    printf("%d %d\n", maxNum, maxScore);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimized code still maintains all the functionalities of the original code and is expected to run faster due to the reduced number of operations.
