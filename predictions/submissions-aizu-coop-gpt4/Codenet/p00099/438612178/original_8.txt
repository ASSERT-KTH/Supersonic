Code Analysis:

The given program reads a sequence of pairs (a, b) from the user input and increments the score of 'a' by 'b'. The pairs are stored in a priority queue as per their scores. It then pops out the pair from the queue with the highest score and prints it. The code uses a priority queue data structure to find the element with the maximum score efficiently. 

However, the program has a few potential bottlenecks:

1. The 'while' loop inside the 'm--' loop pops elements from the queue until it finds the pair with the maximum score. This could be inefficient if there are a lot of elements in the queue.

2. The use of 'scanf' and 'cout' for input and output can be slower compared to other methods.

Optimization Strategy:

1. We can replace the 'while' loop inside the 'm--' loop with a 'do-while' loop. The 'do-while' loop ensures that the condition is checked after executing the loop. This makes the loop more efficient as it reduces the number of unnecessary iterations.

2. Instead of using 'scanf' and 'cout', we can use 'cin' and 'cout' with ios::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL). These are faster input/output methods in C++.

3. We can use 'make_pair' to create a pair instead of using a constructor. This is a more efficient way to create a pair.

Step-by-step Explanation:

1. Change the 'while' loop inside the 'm--' loop to a 'do-while' loop. In a 'do-while' loop, the condition is checked after executing the loop. So, the loop will be executed at least once which means we don't need to check the condition before entering the loop.

2. Use 'cin' and 'cout' with ios::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL). This will make input/output operations faster.

3. Use 'make_pair' to create a pair instead of using a constructor. This is a more efficient way to create a pair.

Trade-offs:

The above optimizations will make the code run faster. However, using 'cin' and 'cout' with ios::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL) can cause issues if we need to use 'printf' or 'scanf' in the same program.

Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;
const int MAX = 1000001;
int S[MAX];
typedef pair<int, int> pii;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  priority_queue<pii> Q;
  Q.push(make_pair(0, 0));
  while (m--) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    S[a] += b;
    Q.push(make_pair(a, S[a]));
    pii now;
    do {
      now = Q.top();
      Q.pop();
    } while (now.second != S[now.first]);
    cout << now.first << " " << now.second << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
