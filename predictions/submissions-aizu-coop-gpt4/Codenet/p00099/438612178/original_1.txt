1. Code Analysis:
The given code is a C++ program that uses a priority queue data structure to store and retrieve data based on the score and number. It reads input from the user and performs some operations. One potential performance bottleneck in this code is the usage of the priority queue. Priority queues are typically implemented as binary heaps and have a time complexity of O(log n) for both insertion and deletion. In this code, the while loop is continuously inserting and deleting elements from the queue, which could be inefficient for large datasets.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Using a more efficient data structure: In this case, we can use a max heap instead of a priority queue. A max heap can be used to maintain the highest score at the top with a time complexity of O(1) for retrieval and O(log n) for insertion and deletion.
    2. Reducing unnecessary computations: The while loop is unnecessarily popping elements from the queue even if it doesn't satisfy the condition. This can be improved.
    3. Avoiding unnecessary object creation: The code is creating a new data object for each iteration, which can be avoided.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Using a max heap instead of a priority queue: A max heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. It can be used to efficiently retrieve the maximum element. In this code, we are always interested in the maximum score, so a max heap is an ideal data structure. This will reduce the time complexity of retrieval from O(log n) to O(1).
    2. Reducing unnecessary computations: Instead of popping elements from the queue in the while loop, we can add a condition to check if the top element satisfies the condition before popping it. This will reduce unnecessary popping operations.
    3. Avoiding unnecessary object creation: Instead of creating a new data object for each iteration, we can create one object and reuse it. This will reduce the overhead of object creation and destruction.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int MAX = 1000001;
int S[MAX];

struct data {
  int num, score;
  data() {}
  data(int n, int s) : num(n), score(s) {}
  bool operator<(const data &d) const {
    if (score != d.score)
      return score < d.score;
    return num > d.num;
  }
};

int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  
  // Use vector to implement max heap
  vector<data> Q;
  Q.push_back(data(0, 0));
  make_heap(Q.begin(), Q.end());
  
  data temp;  // Reusable temp data object
  while (m--) {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    S[a] += b;
    
    temp.num = a;
    temp.score = S[a];
    Q.push_back(temp);
    push_heap(Q.begin(), Q.end());
    
    while (1) {
      temp = Q.front();  // Get the top element
      if (temp.score == S[temp.num]) {
        cout << temp.num << " " << temp.score << endl;
        break;
      }
      pop_heap(Q.begin(), Q.end());  // Only pop if condition is not satisfied
      Q.pop_back();
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
