## Code Analysis

The given C++ code seems to be a competitive programming problem solution that uses a priority queue data structure to handle queries of type "Add a score to a person and tell who has the highest score now." It does this for 'm' queries.

Potential performance bottlenecks in this code are:
1. Repeatedly pushing every query into the priority queue.
2. The while loop inside each query that pops off outdated results until a valid result is found.

## Optimization Strategy

1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The priority queue data structure itself is suitable for this kind of problem. However, we need to change how we use it, especially the while loop that pops off all outdated results.

2. **Redundant or unnecessary computations:** The code pushes all intermediate results into the queue and later pops off all outdated ones. This is unnecessary and can be optimized.

3. **Loops or recursive calls:** The while loop inside each query can be avoided by checking if the current query is related to the person who currently has the highest score.

4. **Compiler optimizations:** Using fast IO operations instead of traditional scanf and cout for input and output can improve performance.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Optimization for unnecessary computations:** Rather than pushing every intermediate result into the queue, we can check if the current query is related to the person who currently has the highest score. If the current query is updating the score of the person with the highest score or if the current score has become higher than the highest score, we update the highest score and the person associated with it. This eliminates the need for the while loop to pop off outdated results.

2. **Fast IO operations:** Replace `scanf` and `cout` with faster IO operations. `cin` and `cout` are slower because they are synchronized with the C standard streams (`stdin` and `stdout`). We can disable this synchronization at the start of the main function to make them faster.

## Optimized Code Block

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
const int MAX = 1000001;
int S[MAX];

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  int maxScore = 0;
  int maxPerson = 0;
  
  while (m--) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    S[a] += b;
    
    if (a == maxPerson || S[a] > maxScore) {
      maxScore = S[a];
      maxPerson = a;
    }
    
    cout << maxPerson << " " << maxScore << "\n";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we are avoiding the use of the priority queue and the while loop inside each query. The functionality remains the same, but the code is significantly faster. The trade-off we made here is that we are assuming the scores are non-negative. If there are queries that can decrease the score, we need a different approach.
