After analyzing the code, it seems that the program maintains a priority queue of `data` objects. Each `data` object holds a number and a score. The priority queue is ordered such that the `data` object with the highest score is on top. In case of a tie, the `data` object with the smaller number is on top.

There are a few areas in this code that can be optimized:

1. The main loop reads `m` pairs of values, increments the score of the appropriate `data` object, and then pushes the updated `data` into the priority queue. After this, it enters an inner loop where it checks if the `data` object on top of the queue has the most recent score. If it does, it prints the number and score and breaks from the loop. If it doesn't, it removes the `data` object from the queue and continues with the next one. This can lead to a lot of unnecessary operations if the `data` object with the most recent score is not at the top of the queue.

2. The input is read using `scanf`, and the output is printed using `cout`. It would be more efficient to use the same method for both input and output. 

Here are the steps to optimize the code:

1. Since the objective is to print the `data` object with the highest score and smallest number, we can just update the score and check if it's larger than the current maximum. If it is, we update the maximum and its associated number. This way, we avoid the need to maintain the priority queue and the while loop to find the current maximum. 

2. We can use `cin` and `cout` for both input and output to maintain consistency.

After implementing these optimizations, the code would look something like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
const int MAX = 1000001;
int S[MAX];

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;

  int maxNum = 0;
  int maxScore = 0;

  while (m--) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    S[a] += b;
    if (S[a] > maxScore || (S[a] == maxScore && a < maxNum)) {
      maxScore = S[a];
      maxNum = a;
    }
    cout << maxNum << " " << maxScore << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version has a linear time complexity instead of the logarithmic complexity of the original version due to the removal of the priority queue. The trade-off is that the code is now less flexible: it assumes that the highest score will always be the latest one, which might not be the case in a different context.
