1. Code Analysis:

   The code is reading a set of arrays `mp` from the input and trying to make some calculations based on these arrays. It uses the `memset` function to clear the `dp` array, then it uses nested loops to fill up the `dp` array according to some conditions, and finally, it calls the `saiki` function which uses recursion to print some results. 

   The potential performance bottlenecks are:
   - The use of recursion in the `saiki` function. Recursion can lead to unnecessary function calls and can consume extra stack memory.
   - The use of nested loops to fill up the `dp` array. This results in a high time complexity of O(h*w).
   - The use of `memset` function to clear the `dp` array. This results in an extra loop over the array.

2. Optimization Strategy:

   A. Use iterative approach instead of recursion in the `saiki` function. This can save stack memory and improve performance.
   
   B. Use pragma directive to parallelize the nested loops, which can reduce the time complexity.
   
   C. Instead of using `memset` to clear the `dp` array, initialize it directly with 0s when declaring it.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   A. The `saiki` function is called recursively to print some results. However, recursion can consume extra stack memory and can lead to unnecessary function calls. Instead, we can convert it to an iterative approach which will save stack memory and improve performance. This change will increase code complexity slightly.

   B. The nested loops can be parallelized with the help of pragma directives. This can significantly reduce the time complexity and improve performance. However, it requires a multi-core processor to take advantage of this optimization.

   C. The `memset` function is used to clear the `dp` array. This results in an extra loop over the array. Instead, we can initialize the `dp` array directly with 0s when declaring it. This change will not affect the code complexity.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int mp[1001][1001], dp[1001][1001] = {0};
;
int h, w, n;

void saiki(int x, int y) {
  int dx[] = {0, 1}, dy[] = {1, 0};
  while (y != h && x != w)
  {
    x += dx[mp[y][x]];
    y += dy[mp[y][x]];
  }
  cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << endl;
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    cin >> h >> w >> n;
    if (!h && !w && !n)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++)
        cin >> mp[i][j];

    dp[0][0] = n - 1;

    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        dp[i][j + 1] += dp[i][j] / 2 + mp[i][j] * dp[i][j] % 2;
        dp[i + 1][j] += dp[i][j] / 2 + !mp[i][j] * dp[i][j] % 2;
        if (dp[i][j] % 2)
          mp[i][j] = !mp[i][j];
      }
    saiki(0, 0);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Remember that using OpenMP directives for parallel computation depends greatly on your system's capabilities. If you don't have a multi-core processor, this directive won't give you any performance benefits.
