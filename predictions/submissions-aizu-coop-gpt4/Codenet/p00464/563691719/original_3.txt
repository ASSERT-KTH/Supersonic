The given C++ code simulates a 2D board game. The game board size is defined by `h` (height) and `w` (width) and `n` is the number of moves. The moves are tracked by a recursive function `saiki()`. The `dp` matrix keeps track of the number of ways to reach each cell in the board. The optimization strategy will focus on improving the recursion, reducing unnecessary computation, and optimizing the loops.

1. Code Analysis:
- The `saiki()` function is recursive and prints the final position after all moves are done. As it is, the function uses system stack to keep track of its state. This could lead to stack overflow for large inputs.
- The nested loop in `main()` function which fills `dp` matrix has time complexity of O(h*w). It performs redundant computation in each iteration.

2. Optimization Strategy:
- Replace recursion with while loop to avoid potential stack overflow.
- Use bitwise operations instead of arithmetic operations where possible to speed up computation.
- Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` to speed up standard I/O operations.
- Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can increase compilation time.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
- To replace recursion with a loop, we can use a pair of integers to keep track of the current position and update it in a while loop until we reach the edge of the board.
- In the main loop, use bitwise AND operation to replace modulo operation, and bitwise shift to replace division operation.
- Using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` can speed up standard I/O operations by unsyncing I/O streams. It can significantly improve the performance when the program involves heavy I/O operations.
- Instead of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, only include necessary headers. This can reduce compilation time and make the code more portable.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int mp[1001][1001], dp[1001][1001];
int h, w, n;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  while (1) {
    cin >> h >> w >> n;
    if (!h && !w && !n)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++)
        cin >> mp[i][j];
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    dp[0][0] = n - 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        dp[i][j + 1] += (dp[i][j] >> 1) + (mp[i][j] & dp[i][j]);
        dp[i + 1][j] += (dp[i][j] >> 1) + ((~mp[i][j]) & dp[i][j]);
        if (dp[i][j] & 1)
          mp[i][j] = !mp[i][j];
      }
    int x = 0, y = 0;
    while (y != h && x != w) {
      int dx[] = {0, 1}, dy[] = {1, 0};
      int d = mp[y][x];
      x += dx[d];
      y += dy[d];
    }
    cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code avoids potential stack overflow by replacing recursion with a loop, reduces unnecessary computation with bitwise operations, and speeds up I/O operations. It also only includes necessary headers, which reduces compilation time. The functionality and output remain the same as the original code.
