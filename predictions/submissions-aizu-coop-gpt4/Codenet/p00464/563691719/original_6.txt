1. Code Analysis:
   The given code is a C++ program that uses a depth-first search algorithm to traverse a 2D map. The traversal path is determined by the value of mp[i][j] where i and j are the current coordinates. The code reads a map and the number of starting balls (n), then simulates the balls' movement and prints the final position where the last ball ended up. The map is stored in a 2D array `mp`, and the number of balls at a certain position is stored in `dp`.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   a. Inefficient Data Structures: The data structures used in the code are not inefficient, as 2D arrays are suitable for this type of problem.
   b. Redundant Computations: There are redundant computations in the loop where `dp[i][j] / 2` and `dp[i][j] % 2` are computed multiple times. We can compute these values once and store them for use in the loop, reducing the number of computations.
   c. Loops: The loops are efficiently written and don't seem to have room for optimization.
   d. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations can be used to gain some performance improvements. However, the effect might be minimal.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   a. Redundant Computations: We can compute `dp[i][j] / 2` and `dp[i][j] % 2` once and store them in variables `half` and `remainder` respectively. This will reduce the number of computations and thus improve performance.
   
   Trade-offs: There is a negligible increase in memory usage due to the additional variables, but this is outweighed by the performance gain from reducing the number of computations.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int mp[1001][1001], dp[1001][1001];
int h, w, n;

void saiki(int x, int y) {
  int dx[] = {0, 1}, dy[] = {1, 0};
  if (y == h || x == w)
    cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << endl;
  else
    saiki(x + dx[mp[y][x]], y + dy[mp[y][x]]);
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    cin >> h >> w >> n;
    if (!h && !w && !n)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++)
        cin >> mp[i][j];
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    dp[0][0] = n - 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        int half = dp[i][j] / 2;  // Compute half
        int remainder = dp[i][j] % 2;  // Compute remainder
        dp[i][j + 1] += half + mp[i][j] * remainder;
        dp[i + 1][j] += half + !mp[i][j] * remainder;
        if (remainder)
          mp[i][j] = !mp[i][j];
      }
    saiki(0, 0);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This code achieves the same functionality as the original code, but with fewer computations.
