Code Analysis:

This program is a short game simulation where the player moves through a 2D grid according to the rules outlined in the code. The `saiki` function is a recursive function that determines the path the player takes based on the current map configuration. The `main` function accepts user input for the game parameters and runs the simulation.

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:

1. Recursion in `saiki` function: This function uses recursion to determine the path, which can lead to stack overflow for large inputs.

2. Unnecessary memory usage: The program uses two 2D arrays `mp` and `dp` of size 1001x1001. This static allocation of memory is not efficient when the dimensions of the game are significantly less than 1001.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace recursive function with iterative approach: As recursion might lead to stack overflow and unnecessary function calls, it can be replaced with a while loop.

2. Dynamic memory allocation: Instead of statically allocating memory, dynamically allocate memory based on the actual dimensions of the game.

3. Remove unnecessary computations: The computation of `dp[i][j] % 2` is repeated. This can be calculated once and stored in a variable.

4. Inline small function: The `saiki` function is a small function and can be inlined.

Here is the optimized code with comments explaining the changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int h, w, n;
  while (1) {
    cin >> h >> w >> n;
    if (!h && !w && !n)
      break;

    // Dynamic memory allocation based on h, w
    vector<vector<int>> mp(h, vector<int>(w));
    vector<vector<int>> dp(h, vector<int>(w));

    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++)
        cin >> mp[i][j];

    dp[0][0] = n - 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        int mod_val = dp[i][j] % 2; // Remove redundant computation
        dp[i][j + 1] += dp[i][j] / 2 + mp[i][j] * mod_val;
        dp[i + 1][j] += dp[i][j] / 2 + !mp[i][j] * mod_val;
        if (mod_val)
          mp[i][j] = !mp[i][j];
      }

    // Inline saiki() function and replace recursion with while loop
    int x = 0, y = 0, dx[] = {0, 1}, dy[] = {1, 0};
    while (y != h && x != w) {
      int temp = x + dx[mp[y][x]];
      y = y + dy[mp[y][x]];
      x = temp;
    }
    cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:

The main trade-off in this optimization is the increased complexity of the code. The usage of dynamic memory allocation and vector can make the code slightly more difficult to understand for beginners. However, this trade-off is necessary as it reduces the memory usage and makes the code efficient.
