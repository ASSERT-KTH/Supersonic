The given C++ program has few areas of improvement to optimize its performance.

1. Code Analysis:
    - The main performance bottleneck of this program is the recursive function `saiki`. This function is recursively calling itself until it reaches the base case which can lead to stack overflow for large inputs.
    - The program uses a 2D array `dp` for dynamic programming but its usage seems to be inefficient because for every iteration of the nested loop in the main function, it's performing multiple repetitive calculations.
    - The use of `memset` to initialize the `dp` array is not efficient for large-sized arrays.
    - The use of `bits/stdc++.h` as an include file is not recommended because it includes all the standard library files which increase the compilation time.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - Optimize the recursive function `saiki` to an iterative function to prevent potential stack overflow.
    - Use optimized mathematical operations and avoid repetitive calculations in the nested loop.
    - Initialize the `dp` array using the fill function instead of `memset`.
    - Replace `bits/stdc++.h` with only the necessary include files.
  
3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    - Refactor the `saiki` function to an iterative function. The recursive function can cause stack overflow for large inputs.
    - To optimize the mathematical operations in the nested loop, we can calculate `dp[i][j] / 2` and `dp[i][j] % 2` only once and store them in variables.
    - Instead of using `memset`, we can use `std::fill` or `std::fill_n` which are more C++ idiomatic and they work with all types not just the ones with trivial copy constructors.
    - Instead of including `bits/stdc++.h`, include only the needed header files. This can significantly reduce the compilation time.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> mp(1001, vector<int>(1001));
vector<vector<int>> dp(1001, vector<int>(1001));

int h, w, n;

void saiki() {
  int x = 0, y = 0;
  int dx[] = {0, 1}, dy[] = {1, 0};
  while (y != h && x != w) {
    int new_x = x + dx[mp[y][x]];
    int new_y = y + dy[mp[y][x]];
    x = new_x;
    y = new_y;
  }
  cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << endl;
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    cin >> h >> w >> n;
    if (!h && !w && !n)
      break;

    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++)
        cin >> mp[i][j];

    fill(dp.begin(), dp.end(), vector<int>(1001, 0));
    dp[0][0] = n - 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        int half = dp[i][j] / 2;
        int mod = dp[i][j] % 2;
        dp[i][j + 1] += half + mp[i][j] * mod;
        dp[i + 1][j] += half + !mp[i][j] * mod;
        if (mod)
          mp[i][j] = !mp[i][j];
      }
    saiki();
  }
  return 0;
}
