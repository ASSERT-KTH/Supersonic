Code Analysis:
1. The given code is a C++ program that simulates a game. The game board is represented by a 2-dimensional array, `mp[][]`, where each cell represents a direction. The code also uses dynamic programming with the `dp[][]` array which keeps track of the total number of moves that can be made from each cell.
2. The function `saiki()` is a recursive function that starts from the top left cell (0, 0) and moves to the next cell based on the value of the current cell until it reaches the right or bottom edge of the board. Whenever it reaches the edge, it prints the coordinates of the last cell.
3. The code reads the game parameters from the standard input in a loop until it gets a zero for each parameter (height, width, and number of moves).

Optimization Strategy:
1. Optimize recursive calls: The recursive function `saiki()` can be replaced with an iterative version to prevent potential stack overflow and function call overhead.
2. Avoid frequent IO operations: The program writes the result to the standard output in each recursion, which can be replaced by storing the result in a variable and printing it once after the loop.
3. Use appropriate data types: Instead of using `int` for the `mp[][]` array, we can use `bool` data type to save memory space as the array only stores binary values.
4. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(NULL)` to speed up cin/cout operations.

Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
bool mp[1001][1001];
int dp[1001][1001];

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int h, w, n;
  while (1) {
    cin >> h >> w >> n;
    if (!h && !w && !n)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        int temp;
        cin >> temp;
        mp[i][j] = temp;
      }
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    dp[0][0] = n - 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        dp[i][j + 1] += dp[i][j] / 2 + mp[i][j] * dp[i][j] % 2;
        dp[i + 1][j] += dp[i][j] / 2 + !mp[i][j] * dp[i][j] % 2;
        if (dp[i][j] % 2)
          mp[i][j] = !mp[i][j];
      }
    int x = 0, y = 0;
    while (x < w && y < h)
    {
      if (mp[y][x])
        x++;
      else
        y++;
    }
    cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, the recursive function `saiki()` is replaced with a while loop, and the result is printed only once after the loop. The `mp[][]` array is changed to `bool` type to save memory. The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` are used to speed up cin/cout operations.
