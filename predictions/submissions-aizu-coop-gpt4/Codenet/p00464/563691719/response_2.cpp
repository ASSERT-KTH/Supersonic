Code Analysis:

The provided code seems to be a game or puzzle solver. The primary focus of the program is to use a recursive function 'saiki' to move around a 2D array 'mp'. The movement is based on the current cell's value in 'mp', and the program uses dynamic programming to keep track of possible moves from each cell. The program uses a 2D array 'dp' to store the number of possible moves from each cell.

Potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies:

1. Recursive function 'saiki': Recursive functions can be inefficient and cause stack overflow if the depth of recursion is too high. In our case, the recursion depth can be up to h*w, which can be quite large (up to 1000*1000 in the worst case).

2. Usage of std::endl: Using 'std::endl' can unnecessarily flush the output buffer, which can be a performance hit if the output operation is frequent.

3. Use of 'memset': Using 'memset' to initialize array 'dp' might be inefficient, especially on large arrays.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Efficient data structures: The current data structures are suitable for this problem and we don't need to change them.

2. Redundant computations: No redundant computations were identified.

3. Optimizing loops or recursive calls: 
    - We can convert the recursive function 'saiki' to an iterative function to avoid potential stack overflow and reduce function call overhead.
    - We can replace 'std::endl' with '\n' to avoid flushing the output buffer too frequently.
    - Instead of using 'memset', we can initialize 'dp' in the for loop where it is used.

4. Compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations are usually enabled by compiler flags, such as -O2 or -O3 for g++. These optimizations can greatly improve the performance of the program. However, they are beyond the scope of this task as we are focusing on code optimizations.
