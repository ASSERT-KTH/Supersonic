Analyzing the given code, it appears to be a simple program that reads two sets of integers, S and T, and counts how many elements of T are present in S. The potential performance bottleneck in this code is the nested for-loop which checks for each element of T in the array S. This leads to a time complexity of O(n*q).

Optimization Strategy:
1. Data Structures: The current data structure being used is a simple array. Given that we are checking for the presence of values, a more efficient data structure could be a hash table (unordered_set in C++ STL), which has an average time complexity of O(1) for search operations.

2. Redundant Computations: In the current setup, we are iterating through the entire array S for each element in T. Using a hash table, we can eliminate this redundancy.

3. Loops and Recursion: The nested loop can be avoided using a hash table, as described above.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations or pragma directives might not be necessary for this code.

Step-by-step Explanation:
1. Switch to a more efficient data structure: Using a hash table instead of an array for storing the elements of S will significantly reduce the time complexity of search operations. Inserting elements into an unordered_set is a one-time operation with time complexity O(n).

2. Eliminate redundant computations: By using a hash table (unordered_set), we can directly check if an element of T is present in S in constant time (O(1)), eliminating the need for the inner loop.

Trade-off: The trade-off here is slightly increased memory usage due to the overhead of the hash table, but the performance gain in time complexity outweighs this cost.

Now, let's implement this in the optimized code block:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  int n, q, temp, i, cnt = 0;
  std::unordered_set<int> S;
  
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &temp);
    S.insert(temp);
  }

  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &temp);
    if (S.find(temp) != S.end()) {
      cnt++;
    }
  }

  printf("%d\n", cnt);
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, the unordered_set 'S' is used to store the elements of the array S. For every element in T, we simply check if it exists in 'S', thus reducing the time complexity to O(1) for each search operation.
