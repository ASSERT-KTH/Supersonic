Code Analysis:
The provided program is a simple code that reads two sets of numbers and counts how many numbers from the second set are present in the first set. The main performance issue here is that the program uses a brute-force approach to solve the problem, which results in a time complexity of O(n*q), where 'n' is the size of the first set and 'q' is the size of the second set. This is not efficient, especially when 'n' and 'q' are large.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Instead of using an array to store the first set of numbers, we can use a data structure with a faster lookup time, such as a hash set or a binary search tree. This will reduce the time complexity of checking if a number is in the set from O(n) to O(1) in the case of a hash set, or O(log(n)) in the case of a binary search tree.

2. We can also avoid redundant computations by breaking the inner loop as soon as we find a match. This is already done in the provided code, so no change is needed here.

3. As this program is not heavily recursive or loop-heavy (apart from the nested loop, which we are addressing), there's no particular need for loop unrolling or tail recursion.

4. Compiler optimizations and pragma directives are usually not necessary and should only be used when we're trying to squeeze out every last bit of performance. In this case, a change of data structure will provide a much bigger performance gain.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. We will replace the array 'S' with a hash set. Hash sets offer constant time complexity for insertion and lookup, making them a great choice for this kind of operation. We will use the 'unordered_set' from the C++ Standard Library.
2. We will then iterate over the first set of numbers and insert each number into the hash set.
3. When checking if the numbers from the second set are in the first set, we will simply check if the number is in the hash set.
4. The rest of the code remains the same.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, q, temp, cnt = 0;
  unordered_set<int> S;

  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &temp);
    S.insert(temp);
  }
  
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &temp);
    if (S.find(temp) != S.end()) cnt++;
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", cnt);
  return 0;
}
```
This code has a worst-case time complexity of O(n+q), which is a significant improvement over the original O(n*q). The trade-off is that hash sets use more memory than arrays, and the code is slightly more complex due to the use of a hash set instead of an array. However, these trade-offs are worth it for the improved performance.
