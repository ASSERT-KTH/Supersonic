Code Analysis:
This C program reads two arrays of integers from the standard input. The first array, S, has n elements, and the second array, T, has q elements. The program then counts the number of elements in T that also appear in S.

The main performance bottleneck in this program is the nested loop used to count the number of common elements. This results in a time complexity of O(n*q), which is not efficient, especially when both n and q are large.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The current implementation uses an array to store the elements of S. Searching for an element in an array takes linear time in the worst case. We can use a more efficient data structure, such as a hash set, which supports constant time search operations.

2. Redundant Computations: The current implementation checks for each element of T in the array S. If an element appears multiple times in T, it will be checked multiple times in S. We can avoid this by storing the elements of T in a hash set as well and then find the intersection of the two sets.

3. Loops or Recursive Calls: The nested loop in the program results in quadratic time complexity. We can avoid this by using hash sets as mentioned above.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Using the flag -O3 during compilation can instruct the compiler to perform optimizations like function inlining, loop unrolling, etc.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. We replace the array S with a hash set. This allows us to check whether an element is in S in constant time.

2. We also replace the array T with a hash set. This eliminates the need for checking the same element multiple times.

3. We then find the intersection of the two sets, which gives us the count of common elements. This is done in linear time.

4. We add the -O3 flag during compilation to enable compiler optimizations.

Trade-offs:
While using a hash set significantly reduces the time complexity, it increases the space complexity from O(n + q) to O(n + q), where n is the size of S and q is the size of T. However, in this case, the trade-off is acceptable given the significant reduction in time complexity.

Optimized Code Block:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  int n, q, temp, cnt = 0;
  std::unordered_set<int> S, T;

  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &temp);
    S.insert(temp);
  }

  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &temp);
    T.insert(temp);
  }

  for (const int& t : T)
    if (S.count(t) > 0)
      cnt++;

  printf("%d\n", cnt);
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that C++ Standard Library is used here. If you want to stick to pure C, you may need to implement a hash set using a linked list or a dynamic array. However, it's generally more efficient and less error-prone to use standard library data structures.
