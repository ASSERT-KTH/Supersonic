**Code Analysis**
This program is designed to read a list of numbers, and then it checks if another set of numbers (smaller list) exists in the first list. If a number from the second list is found in the first list, the count is incremented.

The main performance bottleneck in this code is in the nested for loop where the program checks for the existence of each number of the second list in the first list. This is an O(n*q) operation, which, for large n and q, can be quite expensive.

**Optimization Strategy**

1. **Inefficient Data Structure**: The existing code uses arrays to store the numbers. Searching in an array is an O(n) operation. We can use a more efficient data structure like a set (in C++ STL), which has O(1) search time complexity.

2. **Redundant Computations**: The existing code checks for each number in the second list in the first list, even if it has already been found. This is redundant and can be optimized.

3. **Compiler Optimizations**: We can use the -O3 flag which enables all optimization flags, including function inlining, loop unrolling, and vectorization.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **Using Efficient Data Structure**: We use the `unordered_set` data structure from C++ STL to store the numbers from the first list. This data structure provides O(1) search time complexity, which will significantly reduce our search time.

2. **Removing Redundant Computations**: We insert each number from the first list into the set. Then, for each number in the second list, we check if it exists in the set. If it does, we increment the count and move to the next number. This way, we don't perform redundant searches for numbers that have already been found.

3. **Compiler Optimizations**: We use the -O3 flag during compilation to enable all optimization flags, which can significantly improve the performance of the code.

**Optimized Code Block**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL); 
    
  int n, q, cnt = 0;
  unordered_set<int> S;

  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int temp;
    cin >> temp;
    S.insert(temp);
  }

  cin >> q;
  for (int j = 0; j < q; j++) {
    int temp;
    cin >> temp;
    if (S.find(temp) != S.end()) {
      cnt++;
    }
  }
  
  cout << cnt << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
To compile the code with the -O3 flag, use the following command:
```bash
g++ -O3 main.cpp -o main
```

Note: This optimization introduces a trade-off of increased memory usage as the set data structure uses more memory than an array to provide faster search times. However, this is acceptable in most cases as memory is relatively cheap compared to time.
