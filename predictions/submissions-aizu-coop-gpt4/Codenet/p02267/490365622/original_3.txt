This program reads 'n' numbers into an array S[], then reads 'q' numbers into an array T[]. It then checks how many numbers from T[] are present in S[] and increments the counter 'cnt' accordingly. Finally, it prints the value of 'cnt'. 

1. Code Analysis:
The major performance bottleneck in this code is the nested loop structure used to find the common elements between arrays S[] and T[]. The time complexity of this approach is O(n*q) because for each element in T[], we are searching in the entire array S[].

2. Optimization Strategy:
We can use a more efficient data structure to store the elements of S[] and check the presence of elements of T[] in S[]. A hash table (unordered_set in C++) would be an ideal choice here as it allows constant time complexity (O(1)) for search operations. This will bring down the overall time complexity to O(n + q) which will significantly improve the performance for large inputs.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. We will replace array S[] with an unordered_set. Unordered_set in C++ is a container that stores unique elements in no particular order. It uses hashing mechanism to store elements and provides fast access to elements based on their value.
   2. We will insert all elements of array S[] into the unordered_set.
   3. While reading elements into array T[], we will check if the current element exists in the unordered_set. If it exists, we increment the counter 'cnt'.
   4. There are no compiler optimizations or pragma directives needed for this code.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unordered_set>
int main() {
  int n, q, T[500], i, j, cnt = 0;
  std::unordered_set<int> S;
  
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int temp;
    scanf("%d", &temp);
    S.insert(temp);
  }
  
  scanf("%d", &q);
  
  for (j = 0; j < q; j++) {
    scanf("%d", &T[j]);
    if(S.find(T[j]) != S.end()){
        cnt++;
    }
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", cnt);
  
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code will produce the same output as the original code, but with better time complexity. The trade-off is that the unordered_set data structure uses slightly more memory than a simple array due to its internal implementation to provide faster search operations. However, this trade-off is usually acceptable for a significant gain in time efficiency.
