This program counts how many elements in array T[] can be found in array S[]. It uses a nested loop to compare each element in T[] with every element in S[], which results in a time complexity of O(n*q), where n is the size of S[] and q is the size of T[].

Here are the steps to optimize this code:

1. Code Analysis:
    - The code makes a linear search through S[] for each element in T[], which is inefficient.
    - The size of S[] and T[] are predefined and do not need to be this large if not required.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - Replace the linear search with binary search to reduce the time complexity to O(log n).
    - Dynamically allocate memory for S[] and T[] instead of predefining the size.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    - Binary Search: A binary search will drastically reduce the time complexity. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one. 
    - Dynamic Memory Allocation: By dynamically allocating memory for S[] and T[], we only use as much memory as we need for each array, reducing memory waste.

4. Trade-offs: While the binary search improves performance, it requires that the array be sorted beforehand. However, as this is a one-time cost and it significantly improves the search performance, it is a worthwhile trade-off.

Here's the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int compare(const void * a, const void * b) {
  return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);
}

int main() {
  int n, *S, q, *T, i, j, cnt = 0;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  S = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  qsort(S, n, sizeof(int), compare);
  scanf("%d", &q);
  T = (int*)malloc(q * sizeof(int));
  for (j = 0; j < q; j++)
    scanf("%d", &T[j]);
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++)
    if (bsearch(&T[i], S, n, sizeof(int), compare)) {
      cnt++;
    }
  printf("%d\n", cnt);
  free(S);
  free(T);
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we use `malloc()` to dynamically allocate memory for the arrays S[] and T[] and `free()` to deallocate it after use. We use `qsort()` to sort the array S[] and `bsearch()` to perform a binary search for each element of T[] in S[]. The `compare` function is used by `qsort()` and `bsearch()` to compare the elements of the array. This reduces the time complexity to O(log n) and utilizes memory more efficiently.
