Code Analysis:

The given code is a simple C program that reads two sets of integers from standard input. The first set, called S[], has 'n' elements, and the second set, called T[], has 'q' elements. Then it counts how many elements in T[] are also present in S[].

The potential performance bottleneck is in the nested loop where the program checks for the existence of each element of T[] in S[]. This operation is O(n*q), which can be quite expensive if both 'n' and 'q' are large.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Data Structures: The array S[] can be replaced by a more efficient data structure. A binary search tree or a hash table could be used for a faster search operation. However, considering the simplicity of the program, a fixed-size array can be used as a hash table, where the index is the integer and the value at that index is a boolean indicating whether the integer is present in S[].

2. Redundant Computations: There are no apparent redundant computations in the code.

3. Loops/Recursions: The nested loop is the main area of optimization. By using the fixed-size array as a hash table, we can eliminate the inner loop.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations like -O2 or -O3 might help but the main optimization would be algorithmic.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Instead of using an array S[] to store the input integers, we will use a fixed-size boolean array called exists[]. The index will represent the integer, and the value at that index will represent whether the integer is in the input set. Assuming the input integers are non-negative and less than 10001, we set the size of exists[] to be 10001. 

2. After reading each integer for S[], we will set the corresponding index in exists[] to be true.

3. Then, for each integer in T[], we will simply check if the corresponding index in exists[] is true. This operation is O(1), so the overall complexity is O(n+q), which is a significant improvement from O(n*q).

Trade-offs:
- One trade-off is that the maximum integer allowed is now limited by the size of exists[]. If larger integers need to be handled, a different data structure like a hash table or a tree should be used.
- Memory usage can be larger if the range of possible values is much larger than the number of values (n). This could be mitigated by using a dynamic data structure like a hash table.

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h> // for memset

int main() {
  int n, q, i, j, cnt = 0;
  int T[500];
  char exists[10001]; // Using char instead of int saves memory
  memset(exists, 0, sizeof(exists)); // Initialize all to false

  scanf("%d", &n);

  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int temp;
    scanf("%d", &temp);
    exists[temp] = 1; // Mark as present
  }

  scanf("%d", &q);

  for (j = 0; j < q; j++) {
    scanf("%d", &T[j]);
    if (exists[T[j]]) {
      cnt++;
    }
  }

  printf("%d\n", cnt);
  return 0;
}
```
Please remember to validate the input in your real-world programs. This code doesn't check if the input numbers are within the expected range (0-10000).
