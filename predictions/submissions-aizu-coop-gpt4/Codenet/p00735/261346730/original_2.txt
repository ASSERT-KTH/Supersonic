Code Analysis:
--------------
The given code takes a number as input and checks for factors that are either 1 more or less than a multiple of 7, up to the number 300000. It does this by creating a boolean array `checked` of size 300000+1, where true indicates that a number is known to be a multiple of 7 plus or minus one. It then iterates over numbers from 2 to 300000, and if a number `i` is not marked in `checked`, and `i` is a multiple of 7 plus or minus one, it marks all multiples of `i` in `checked` as true. It then reads numbers from the input and for each number, it iterates over all multiples of 7 plus or minus one up to 300000 and checks if they are factors of the input number. If they are, it adds them to the answer and finally prints the answer.

Optimization Strategy:
---------------------
1. The code includes a number of unnecessary headers, which do not affect the performance but do increase the compilation time. They should be removed.

2. The `checked` array is not needed. It is used to mark multiples of numbers that are multiples of 7 plus or minus one. However, all multiples of such a number are also multiples of 7 plus or minus one. So instead of using an array to keep track of these numbers, we can simply check the condition `i % 7 == 1 || i % 7 == 6` for each number from 2 to 300000.

3. The while-loop at the end of the code reads numbers from the input, computes their factors that are multiples of 7 plus or minus one, and prints them. This can be optimized by reading all numbers from the input first, computing the maximum of these numbers, and then precomputing all factors that are multiples of 7 plus or minus one up to this maximum.

4. The code uses a vector `ans` to store the factors of each input number. This vector is cleared for each input number, which requires time. Instead, we can use a single vector and overwrite the factors for each input number.

5. The code uses a for-each loop to iterate over the factors of each input number. This can be optimized by using a for-loop with an index, which avoids the need to create a copy of each factor.

Optimized Code Block:
--------------------
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (n); i++)
#define rep2(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  cin.tie(0);
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  
  // Read all numbers from the input
  vector<ll> numbers;
  ll n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 1) {
    numbers.push_back(n);
  }

  // Precompute all factors that are multiples of 7 plus or minus one up to the maximum input number
  ll max_num = *max_element(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());
  vector<ll> lists;
  rep2(i, 2, max_num) {
    if (i % 7 == 1 || i % 7 == 6) {
      lists.push_back(i);
    }
  }

  // For each input number, compute its factors and print them
  vector<ll> ans;
  for (ll num : numbers) {
    ans.clear();
    for (ll p : lists) {
      if (p > num) break;
      if (num % p == 0) {
        ans.push_back(p);
      }
    }
    cout << num << ':';
    rep(i, ans.size()) { cout << " " << ans[i]; }
    cout << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code is expected to run faster and use less memory than the original code. It avoids unnecessary computations and memory allocations, and uses more efficient data structures and control structures. The trade-off is that the code is less straightforward and may be harder to understand for someone who is not familiar with the problem or the optimization techniques.
