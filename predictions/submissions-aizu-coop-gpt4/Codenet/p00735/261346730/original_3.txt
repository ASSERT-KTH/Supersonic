Code Analysis:
This program appears to generate a list of integers, and for each input number, it prints out the input number followed by the list of integers that divide it. The integers are generated by checking numbers from 2 to 300000 to see if they are not already checked and if they are 1 or 6 modulo 7, then they are added to the list, and all their multiples are marked as checked.

Optimization Strategy: 
1. Inefficient Data Structures: The `checked` array is used to keep track of which numbers have already been processed. However, this array is much larger than necessary. A more efficient alternative would be to use a boolean vector of size 300001, so that only the required space is allocated. The `lists` vector is efficient for storing the integers.

2. Redundant Computations: The main redundancy is that the program checks every integer from 2 to 300000, even though it could skip over the multiples of numbers that it has already checked. Also, for each input number, the program checks every integer in the `lists` vector to see if it divides the input number, which could be very time-consuming for large input numbers.

3. Loops or Recursive Calls: The loop that checks every integer in the `lists` vector to see if it divides the input number could be optimized by breaking the loop as soon as a number that is larger than the input number is found.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The compiler optimizations `-O2` or `-O3` could be used to instruct the compiler to optimize the code for speed. Also, the `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")` directive could be added at the beginning of the code to enable all optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.

Optimization Steps:
1. Change the `checked` array to a boolean vector of size 300001.
2. In the loop that builds the `lists` vector, increase `i` by 7 at each iteration after the first iteration, so that only the numbers that are 1 or 6 modulo 7 are checked.
3. In the loop that checks every integer in the `lists` vector to see if it divides the input number, break the loop as soon as a number that is larger than the input number is found.
4. Use the compiler optimizations `-O2` or `-O3` and the `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")` directive.

Trade-offs: These optimizations will make the code faster, but they will also make it slightly more complex. The use of the compiler optimizations and the `#pragma` directive may not be portable to all compilers. The break in the loop that checks every integer in the `lists` vector for divisibility might lead to incorrect results if the `lists` vector is not sorted, but we know that it is sorted because of the way it is built.
