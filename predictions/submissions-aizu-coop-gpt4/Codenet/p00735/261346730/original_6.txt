The provided C++ code seems to be a part of a number theory-based program where it calculates some prime-related factors of a number. Here are the potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary Inclusion of Libraries: The code includes many libraries that are not used in the program. This can lead to increased compilation time.

2. Redundant Vector Operations: The vector 'ans' is used to store factors and then printed. Instead of storing the factors, they can be directly printed.

3. Excessive Use of Long Long Integers: The code uses long long integers (either directly or via the 'int' typedef). This can lead to inefficient memory usage when the range of the numbers being dealt with does not require this type.

4. Unnecessarily Complex Loop Control: The 'while (i * k <= 300000)' loop could be simplified to a for loop, which would be easier to read and potentially more efficient.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary libraries.
2. Use direct printing instead of storing factors in 'ans'.
3. Use the 'int' type where the range of numbers is small enough.
4. Simplify the 'while' loop to a 'for' loop.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    vector<int> lists;
    bool checked[300001] = {};
    for (int i = 2; i <= 300000; i++) {
        if (checked[i])
            continue;
        if (i % 7 == 1 || i % 7 == 6) {
            lists.push_back(i);
            for (int j = i; j <= 300000; j += i) {
                checked[j] = true;
            }
        }
    }

    while (true) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        if (n == 1)
            break;
        cout << n << ':';
        for (auto p : lists) {
            if (n % p == 0) {
                cout << " " << p;
            }
        }
        cout << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. Removed unnecessary libraries, reducing the number of included headers from 28 to only 2.
2. Instead of storing factors in 'ans' vector, now we print the factors directly.
3. Changed 'long long' type to 'int' for 'i', 'j', 'n', and 'p' as their values will not exceed 'int' limit.
4. Simplified the 'while' loop into a 'for' loop, making the code more readable and slightly more efficient.

This optimized code has the same functionality as the original code but uses less memory and is easier to read and understand. However, it also has the trade-off of needing to compute and print the factors in the same loop, which could potentially decrease performance if the number of factors is very large. This is unlikely to be a significant issue in this case, though, as the number of factors is typically small.
