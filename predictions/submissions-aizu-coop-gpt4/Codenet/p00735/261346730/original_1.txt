Analysis of the code:
The given code is finding all the prime numbers up to 300000 that are in the form of 7k+1 or 7k+6 (where k is an integer), storing them in a list, and then for each input number, it finds out which of those prime numbers divide the input number perfectly.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Redundant Computations: The code checks for every number i from 2 to 300000 if it is divisible by any prime number less than it. This is a costly operation and can be optimized.

2. Data Structures: The list 'lists' stores all the prime numbers of the form 7k+1 or 7k+6. This can be replaced with an array for faster access times.

3. Loop Optimization: The outer loop in the main function, which reads input numbers and finds their factors, can be optimized. The number of factors for a number n can be large, but the factors are being stored in a vector and then printed out. This can be optimized by printing the factors as they are found, eliminating the need for the vector.

Step-by-step Explanation:
1. Redundant Computations - For every number i from 2 to 300000, the code checks if it is divisible by any prime number less than it. Instead of this, we can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to 300000. Then, we only check for the primes of the form 7k+1 or 7k+6.
2. Data Structure - Instead of storing prime numbers in a vector, we can store them in an array. Arrays can have faster access times than vectors if the size is known beforehand, which it is in this case (300000).
3. Loop Optimization - Instead of finding all factors of a number and storing them in a vector before printing them, we can print the factors as we find them. This eliminates the need for the vector and reduces memory usage.

Trade-offs - The optimizations proposed here will result in a trade-off between time and space complexity. The time complexity will be reduced due to the use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm and array, but the space complexity will increase because we are storing all prime numbers up to 300000 in an array.

Optimized Code Block:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long

int isPrime[300000+1];

void sieve(){
    for(int i=0;i<=300000;i++)
        isPrime[i] = 1;
    isPrime[0] = 0;
    isPrime[1] = 0;
    for(int i=2;i*i<=300000;i++){
        if(isPrime[i] == 1){
            for(int j=i*i;j<=300000;j+=i)
                isPrime[j] = 0;
        }
    }
}

signed main() {
  cin.tie(0);
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  sieve();
  int primes[300000+1], k = 0;
  for(int i=2; i<=300000; i++){
    if((i%7 == 1 || i%7 == 6) && isPrime[i])
      primes[k++] = i;
  }
  while (true) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    if (n == 1)
      break;
    cout << n << ':';
    for(int i=0; i<k; i++){
      if(n % primes[i] == 0)
        cout << " " << primes[i];
    }
    cout << endl;
  }
}
```
