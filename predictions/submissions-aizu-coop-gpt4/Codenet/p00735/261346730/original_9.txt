1. Code Analysis:

The given code calculates all prime numbers up to 300000 that are either 1 or 6 modulo 7, stores them in a list, and for each input number, it prints the number and the prime factors of the number from the list.

The major performance bottleneck seems to be the way the code calculates the prime numbers. It uses a modified version of the Sieve of Eratosthenes for finding primes, but the implementation is not efficient. It could be improved by using a more standard Sieve algorithm.

Moreover, for each input number, it checks each number in the list of primes to see if it's a divisor. This could also be optimized.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Optimization of the prime number calculation:
    - Implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes in a more standard way.
    - Instead of checking each number to see if it's 1 or 6 modulo 7, we can generate the list of primes first, and then filter out the ones that meet the condition.

B. Optimization of the divisor calculation:
    - Instead of checking every number in the list of primes, we can use a binary search algorithm to find the largest prime number that is smaller than or equal to the square root of the input number. All divisors larger than this number would have a corresponding smaller divisor, so they don't need to be checked.

C. Compiler Optimization:
    - Use the `-O3` option for the highest level of optimization and the `-march=native` option for platform-specific optimization.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Prime number calculation:
    - Implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime, starting from 2. After marking, the remaining unmarked numbers in the list are primes. The sieve is one of the most efficient ways to find all primes smaller than n when n is smaller than 10 million or so.
    - Filter out the primes that are 1 or 6 modulo 7. This step is straight forward and efficient because the list of primes is much smaller than the list of all numbers.

B. Divisor calculation:
    - Use the binary search algorithm to find the largest prime number that is smaller than or equal to the square root of the input number. This prime number is the largest possible prime divisor of the input number.
    - Check each prime number in the list from 2 to the largest possible prime divisor to see if it's a divisor of the input number.

C. Compiler Optimization:
    - The `-O3` option enables all `-O2` optimizations and also enables optimizations that are not valid for all standard-compliant programs. It turns on inlining of functions and other optimizations that may make the program faster.
    - The `-march=native` option enables all instruction subsets supported by the local machine.
