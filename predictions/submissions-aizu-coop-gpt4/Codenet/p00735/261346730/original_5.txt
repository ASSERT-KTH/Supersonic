Here are the proposed optimizations for the given C++ code:

1. Code Analysis: The main performance bottlenecks in the code appear to be:

    - The section where the list is populated, which works in O(n) time complexity.
    - The nested loop where the 'checked' array is updated, which again has time complexity of O(n).
    - The section where the 'lists' vector is iterated over, to check for factors of the input number 'n'. This also works in O(n) time complexity.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    1. The 'lists' vector is being populated with numbers that are either 1 or 6 mod 7. This can be done more efficiently using a mathematical approach, rather than checking every number in the range.
    2. The 'checked' array can be updated more efficiently by using a sieve-like approach to mark multiples of each prime number.
    3. Instead of iterating over the 'lists' vector to find factors, use a mathematical approach to find all factors in one pass.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    1. To populate the 'lists' vector, start at the first number in the range that is 1 mod 7, then add 7 to get to the next number. Do the same for numbers that are 6 mod 7. This avoids having to check every number in the range.
    2. To update the 'checked' array, use a sieve-like approach: for each number in 'lists', mark its multiples in 'checked', starting from the square of the number. This avoids checking multiples of numbers that have already been checked.
    3. To find factors of 'n', first find all prime factors of 'n', then use these to find all factors. This can be done by iterating over the prime factors and for each one, adding it and all numbers that can be formed by multiplying it with previously found factors.

4. Optimized Code Block:

The optimized code is as follows:

```C++
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define MAX 300001

int main() {
    vector<int> lists;
    bool checked[MAX] = {};

    for (int i = 1; i < MAX; i += 7) {
        if (!checked[i]) {
            lists.push_back(i);
            for (int j = i * i; j < MAX; j += i) {
                checked[j] = true;
            }
        }
    }
    for (int i = 6; i < MAX; i += 7) {
        if (!checked[i]) {
            lists.push_back(i);
            for (int j = i * i; j < MAX; j += i) {
                checked[j] = true;
            }
        }
    }

    while (true) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        if (n == 1) break;
        vector<int> ans;
        for (auto p : lists) {
            if (n % p == 0) {
                ans.push_back(p);
                for (int i = 0; i < ans.size(); ++i) {
                    int factor = p * ans[i];
                    if (n % factor == 0 && !checked[factor]) {
                        ans.push_back(factor);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        cout << n << ':';
        for (auto a : ans) {
            cout << " " << a;
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should perform significantly faster than the original code, while still producing the same results. The main trade-off is slightly increased code complexity due to the mathematical approach used to find factors.
