**Code Analysis:**

The program is designed to find the factors of an input number. It is implemented as follows:

1. It first generates a list of numbers from 2 to 300000 (inclusive) which are not multiples of any number and are of the form 7k+1 or 7k+6.
2. It then enters an infinite loop where it accepts an input number, finds its factors from the generated list, and prints them.

**Optimization Strategy**: 

1. **Data structure optimization**: No need for changes. The data structures used are efficient.
   
2. **Redundant computations**: The code checks for all numbers between 2 and 300000 for being of the form 7k+1 or 7k+6. We can optimize this part by directly generating numbers of these forms.

3. **Loop and recursive call optimization**: The inner loop in the list generation part is checking multiples of a number up to 300000 to mark them as checked. This can be improved by starting the loop from the square of the number because all smaller multiples would have already been marked by smaller primes.
   
4. **Compiler optimizations**: No need for changes. The code does not have any parts that can be significantly improved with compiler directives.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Optimize the list generation part by directly generating numbers of the form 7k+1 and 7k+6. This reduces the number of iterations and hence the time complexity.
   
2. Improve the marking of multiples by starting from the square of the number. This eliminates unnecessary iterations and thus improves the performance.

**Trade-offs**: The optimizations proposed do not introduce any major trade-offs. The readability and maintainability of the code are preserved.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define int long long
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (n); i++)
using namespace std;

signed main() {
  cin.tie(0);
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  vector<int> lists;
  bool checked[300000 + 1] = {};
  rep(i, 300000 / 7 + 1) {
    for(int j = 1; j <= 6; j+=5) {
      int num = i * 7 + j;
      if (num > 300000) break;
      if (checked[num]) continue;
      lists.push_back(num);
      for(int k = num * num; k <= 300000; k += num) {
        checked[k] = true;
      }
    }
  }
  while (true) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    if (n == 1) break;
    vector<int> ans;
    for (auto p : lists) {
      if (n % p == 0) {
        ans.push_back(p);
      }
    }
    cout << n << ':';
    rep(i, ans.size()) { cout << " " << ans[i]; }
    cout << endl;
  }
}
```

The optimized code reduces the number of iterations in the list generation part by directly generating numbers of the form 7k+1 and 7k+6. It also improves the marking of multiples by starting from the square of the number, thus eliminating unnecessary iterations.
