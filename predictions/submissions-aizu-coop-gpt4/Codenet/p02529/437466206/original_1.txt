Code Analysis:
1. The program reads two arrays S and T from the standard input.
2. It then counts the number of elements in array S that are also present in T (or vice versa, as the code currently has S[k] == T[i], which seems like a mistake).

The main performance issue in this code is the nested loop, which compares each element of array S against each element of array T. This results in time complexity of O(n*q), where n and q are the sizes of S and T, respectively. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Data Structure Optimization: Using a hash table or a set for one of the arrays can significantly reduce the time complexity from O(n*q) to O(n+q).
   
2. Redundant Computation: There are no redundant computations in the current code.
   
3. Loop Optimization: The nested loop can be replaced by using efficient data structures.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  int i, n, q, C = 0, S[100], T[100];
  scanf("%d", &n);
  std::unordered_set<int> S_set;
  
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
    S_set.insert(S[i]); // Insert elements into set for efficient lookup
  }
  
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &T[i]);
    if (S_set.find(T[i]) != S_set.end()) { // Check if T[i] is in S_set
      C++;
    }
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", C);
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. An unordered_set data structure is used to store the elements of array S. This allows for constant time complexity (O(1)) when checking if an element is in the set.

2. While reading array T from the standard input, it checks if each element is in the set S_set. If it is, it increments the counter C.

3. The time complexity of this optimized code is O(n+q), which is significantly better than the original O(n*q), especially when n and q are large.

Trade-offs: 
1. The optimized code uses more memory to store the unordered_set. However, for modern systems, this additional memory usage is usually not a problem and is a reasonable trade-off for the significant reduction in time complexity.

2. The optimized code is slightly more complex due to the use of an unordered_set. However, the code is still relatively simple and easy to understand.
