Code Analysis:
The given code reads two arrays (S and T) from the user and counts how many elements in T are also in S. This is done by iterating over the array S and for each element in S, it checks if that element is present in T. If it is, the counter (C) is incremented.

Potential Bottlenecks:
1. The main potential performance bottleneck is the nested loop structure used for checking the existence of each element from array S in array T. The time complexity of this operation is O(n*q) which can be quite large for large n and q.
2. The arrays are statically allocated with a maximum size of 100. This can be a waste of memory if the actual number of elements is much less than 100. It can also be a problem if the user wants to input more than 100 elements.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a more efficient data structure to store the elements of S. A set data structure can be used to hold the elements in S. This will allow us to check the existence of an element in O(1) time complexity.
2. Dynamically allocate memory for the arrays based on user input. This will prevent wasting memory when the number of elements is less than 100 and also allows the user to input more than 100 elements.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the array S with a set. This allows us to check if an element exists in the set in O(1) time complexity. This reduces the time complexity of the code from O(n*q) to O(n+q).
2. Dynamically allocate memory for the arrays S and T. This will prevent wasting memory when the number of elements is less than 100 and also allows the user to input more than 100 elements.

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

// A simple hash function for integers
int hash(int key, int size) {
    return key % size;
}

// A simple set data structure for integers
typedef struct {
    int* data;
    int size;
    int capacity;
} Set;

// Initialize the set
Set* set_init(int capacity) {
    Set* set = (Set*)malloc(sizeof(Set));
    set->data = (int*)calloc(capacity, sizeof(int));
    set->size = 0;
    set->capacity = capacity;
    return set;
}

// Insert an element into the set
void set_insert(Set* set, int key) {
    int index = hash(key, set->capacity);
    set->data[index] = key;
    set->size++;
}

// Check if an element is in the set
bool set_contains(Set* set, int key) {
    int index = hash(key, set->capacity);
    return set->data[index] == key;
}

int main() {
    int i, n, q, C = 0;
    int* T;
    Set* S;

    // Read the size of S
    scanf("%d", &n);
    S = set_init(n);

    // Read the elements of S
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int element;
        scanf("%d", &element);
        set_insert(S, element);
    }

    // Read the size of T
    scanf("%d", &q);
    T = (int*)malloc(q * sizeof(int));

    // Read the elements of T
    for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &T[i]);
    }

    // Check if each element in T is in S
    for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        if (set_contains(S, T[i])) {
            C++;
        }
    }

    printf("%d\n", C);

    // Clean up
    free(S->data);
    free(S);
    free(T);
    return 0;
}
```
Trade-offs:
1. Increased code complexity: The optimized code is more complex than the original code due to the use of a set data structure.
2. Extra memory usage: The hash set data structure has some extra memory overhead due to the use of a hash function.
3. Potential hash collisions: The simple hash function used can lead to hash collisions, where two different elements are mapped to the same index in the hash table. This can lead to incorrect results. This can be mitigated by using a more complex hash function or by handling collisions, but this would further increase the code complexity.
