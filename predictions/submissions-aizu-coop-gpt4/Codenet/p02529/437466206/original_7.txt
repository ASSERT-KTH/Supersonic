Code Analysis:
The given code is a C program that reads two lists of integers and then counts the number of integers in the first list that are also present in the second list.

The main performance bottleneck in this code is the nested for loop that compares each element of the first list against each element of the second list. This results in a time complexity of O(n*q), where n is the size of the first list and q is the size of the second list.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structure: The current code uses an array to store the numbers, which is not efficient for membership tests as it requires scanning through the whole array. A more efficient alternative would be to use a data structure like a set or a hash table, which can perform membership tests in constant time on average. However, these data structures aren't available in C as they are in languages like Python or Java. We can use a sorted array and binary search as a workaround for this.

2. Redundant Computations: Currently, the program is comparing every element of the first array with every element of the second array, resulting in redundant comparisons. By sorting the arrays, we can significantly reduce the number of comparisons.

3. Loops: There are two nested loops in the program. By using binary search, we can optimize the inner loop.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use the -O3 switch with gcc to enable all optimization.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Sorting the Arrays: We can use a sorting function like qsort to sort the arrays. This will allow us to use binary search in the next step. The trade-off is that we are adding an extra step to the program, but the overall performance gain outweighs this cost.

2. Binary Search: Instead of the inner for loop, we can use a binary search function like bsearch to check if an element of the first array is in the second array. The binary search function has a time complexity of O(log q), which is significantly better than scanning through the whole array.

Optimized Code Block:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int compare(const void * a, const void * b) {
  return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);
}

int main() {
  int i, n, q, C = 0, S[100], T[100];
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  }
  qsort(S, n, sizeof(int), compare);
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &T[i]);
  }
  qsort(T, q, sizeof(int), compare);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (bsearch(&S[i], T, q, sizeof(int), compare)) {
      C++;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", C);
  return 0;
}
```
The above code sorts the two arrays and then uses binary search to check for common elements. This reduces the number of operations from n*q to n*log(q), which is a significant improvement for large inputs.
