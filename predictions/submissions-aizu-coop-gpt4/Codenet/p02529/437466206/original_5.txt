The given C program reads two sequences of integers from the input, counts the number of integers in the first sequence that also appear in the second sequence, and outputs this count. It does this using a naive approach that has a time complexity of O(n*q), which is not efficient for large inputs.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a more efficient data structure: The program currently uses arrays to store the numbers. This works fine for small inputs, but as the size of the input grows, the time it takes to search for a number in an array grows linearly. We can use a data structure that allows for faster search times, like a hash table.

2. Remove redundant computations: The program currently checks for each number in the first sequence if it appears in the second sequence. This leads to a lot of repeated comparisons, especially if the same numbers appear multiple times in the first sequence. We can avoid these redundant computations by keeping track of which numbers from the first sequence we have already counted.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int i, n, q, C = 0;
  int *S = (int*)calloc(1000, sizeof(int));  // Initialize all elements to 0
  int T[100];

  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int num;
    scanf("%d", &num);
    S[num]++;  // Increment the count of this number
  }

  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &T[i]);
  }

  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    if (S[T[i]] > 0) {  // If this number was found in the first sequence
      C++;
      S[T[i]] = 0;  // Mark this number as counted
    }
  }

  printf("%d\n", C);
  free(S);  // Free the allocated memory
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of changes:

1. We replace the array S with a dynamically allocated array that works as a hash table. Each index of this array corresponds to a number, and the value at this index is the count of this number in the first sequence. This allows us to quickly check if a number was in the first sequence, and how many times it appeared.

2. In the first loop, we read the numbers from the first sequence and increment the count of each number in the hash table.

3. In the second loop, we check for each number in the second sequence if it appears in the hash table. If it does, we increment the count C and set the count in the hash table to 0 to avoid counting the same number multiple times.

4. After we are done with the hash table, we free the allocated memory to avoid memory leaks.

These changes preserve the functionality of the original code and significantly improve its performance for large inputs. The trade-off is that the code is slightly more complex and uses more memory. However, as we are dealing with relatively small numbers (up to 1000), the memory usage is still manageable.
