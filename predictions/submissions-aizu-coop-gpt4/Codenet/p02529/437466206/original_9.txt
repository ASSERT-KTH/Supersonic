This code reads two arrays, `S` and `T`, each with `n` and `q` elements respectively, and then counts the number of elements in `S` that also exist in `T`.

Let's analyze the code:

1. **Code Analysis**: The inner loop in this code searches for each element of `S` in `T`. This is inefficient because the time complexity is O(n*q), where n and q are the lengths of `S` and `T` respectively. 

2. **Optimization Strategy**:
    1. **Inefficient Data Structure**: The code uses arrays to store the elements. A more efficient data structure would be a set which allows for O(1) lookup time, reducing the overall complexity.
    2. **Redundant Computations**: The current code checks all elements of `T` for every element of `S`. This can be avoided by using a set.
    3. **Loops or Recursive Calls**: The nested loops can be optimized by using a set for `T` to avoid the inner search loop.
    4. **Compiler Optimizations**: There are no specific compiler optimizations that can be implemented for this code.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    1. **Change to set data structure**: We can use a set data structure for the array `T`. Sets have an average time complexity of O(1) for the find operation compared to O(n) for arrays. Therefore, we can reduce the time complexity from O(n*q) to O(n + q) which is a significant improvement for large n and q. The trade-off here is that sets consume more memory than arrays. However, since the maximum size is 100, this trade-off is acceptable.
    2. **Eliminate inner loop**: Once `T` is stored in a set, we can eliminate the inner loop which iterates over `T` for each element of `S`. Instead, we can directly check if an element of `S` is in the set `T`.

4. **Optimized Code Block**:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  int i, n, q, C = 0;
  int S[100];
  std::unordered_set<int> T;

  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  }
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    int temp;
    scanf("%d", &temp);
    T.insert(temp);
  }
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (T.find(S[i]) != T.end()) {
      C++;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", C);
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code maintains the functionality of the original code while improving its time complexity from O(n*q) to O(n + q). The memory usage is slightly increased due to the use of an unordered set instead of an array for `T`, but this is a reasonable trade-off for the significant improvement in time complexity.
