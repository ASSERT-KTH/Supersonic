Analyzing the above code, it is clear that it is a simple application that takes two integer arrays as input and checks how many elements in the first array are present in the second array. However, it is also clear that the algorithm used to perform this check is not efficient. The nested for loop results in a time complexity of O(n*q). This is a performance bottleneck and can lead to significant slowdowns when n and/or q are large.

Optimization Strategy:

1. A more efficient data structure like a Hash Map can be used to store the elements of the first array. This will allow for constant time checks for the presence of an element in the array.

2. The nested loop can be eliminated. Instead, each element in the second array can be checked against the Hash Map.

3. Compiler optimizations can also be used. For example, -O3 can be used to enable all compiler optimizations at the cost of longer compilation time.

Step-by-step Explanation:

1. Use a Hash Map instead of an array to store elements of the first array: This will allow for constant time checks for the presence of an element. This will dramatically reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.

2. Eliminate the nested loop: By checking each element in the second array against the Hash Map, the need for a nested loop is eliminated. This will further reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.

3. Use compiler optimizations: Using the -O3 flag will enable all compiler optimizations. This can lead to further performance improvements at the cost of longer compilation time.

Trade-offs: The main trade-off here is the increased memory usage due to the use of a Hash Map. However, given the significant performance gains, this is a worthwhile trade-off. Additionally, the increased compilation time due to the use of the -O3 flag can be a concern for very large programs.

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
  int n, q, t, C = 0;
  std::unordered_map<int, bool> S;
  
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &t);
    S[t] = true;
  }
  
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &t);
    if (S[t]) {
      ++C;
    }
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", C);
  return 0;
}
```
In the above code, the use of nested loops is eliminated and an unordered_map is used to store the elements of the first array. This allows for constant time checks for the presence of an element in the array. The result is a dramatic reduction in the time complexity of the algorithm.
