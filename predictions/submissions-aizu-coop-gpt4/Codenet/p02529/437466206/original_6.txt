This code reads two arrays from the standard input and counts how many elements of the second array are found in the first one. The major bottleneck in this code is the nested loop that compares each element from the first array to each element of the second array. The time complexity of this approach is O(n*q), which could be very slow if both n and q are large.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the arrays with a data structure that allows faster search, such as a hash set or a binary search tree. However, since C does not have a built-in hash set, we can use a binary search tree instead. 
2. The arrays S and T are read from the input and stored entirely before processing. If these arrays are large, this could lead to high memory usage. Instead of storing the complete arrays, we can process each element as it is read, which reduces the memory usage.

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct node {
    int key;
    struct node *left, *right;
} node;

node* new_node(int item) {
    node* temp = (node*)malloc(sizeof(node));
    temp->key = item;
    temp->left = temp->right = NULL;
    return temp;
}

node* insert(node* node, int key) {
    if (node == NULL) return new_node(key);
    if (key < node->key) node->left = insert(node->left, key);
    else if (key > node->key) node->right = insert(node->right, key);
    return node;
}

int search(node* root, int key) {
    while (root != NULL) {
        if (key < root->key) root = root->left;
        else if (key > root->key) root = root->right;
        else return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    int i, n, q, t, C = 0;
    node *root = NULL;
    
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &t);
        root = insert(root, t);
    }
    
    scanf("%d", &q);
    for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &t);
        if (search(root, t)) {
            C++;
        }
    }
    printf("%d\n", C);
    return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, a binary search tree is used to store and search the elements of the first array. This reduces the time complexity of the search operation from O(n) to O(log n), which significantly improves the performance when n is large. The elements of the second array are processed as they are read, which reduces the memory usage.

However, this optimization comes with some trade-offs. The code is now more complex because it involves the creation and manipulation of a binary search tree. Also, the use of dynamic memory allocation for the tree nodes introduces a risk of memory leaks if not handled properly. Furthermore, while the average case time complexity is improved to O(log n), the worst-case time complexity is still O(n) if the first array is sorted, which results in an unbalanced tree.
