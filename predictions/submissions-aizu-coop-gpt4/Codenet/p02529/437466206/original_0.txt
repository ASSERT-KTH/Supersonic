This program reads two arrays of integers (S and T) and counts how many elements in T are present in S. The main performance bottleneck of this program is the double loop used to count the common elements, which has a time complexity of O(n*q). 

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. Use a data structure with efficient search operation: Instead of using an array to store the elements of S, use a data structure that supports efficient search operations, such as a hash set (unordered_set in C++). This reduces the search operation from O(n) to O(1) on average.

2. Remove redundant computations: The current code performs a lot of redundant comparisons. By using a hash set, we can eliminate these redundant comparisons.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  int i, n, q, t, C = 0;
  std::unordered_set<int> S;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &t);
    S.insert(t);
  }
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &t);
    if (S.find(t) != S.end()) {
      C++;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", C);
  return 0;
}
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Replaced the array S with an unordered_set. This changes the time complexity of the search operation from O(n) to O(1) on average.
2. Removed the second loop that was used to find common elements. Instead, for each element in T, we check if it is present in the set S. If it is, we increment the counter C.

**Trade-offs:**

The optimized code uses an unordered_set instead of an array to store the elements of S. While the unordered_set provides an efficient search operation, it uses more memory than an array. However, this trade-off is acceptable because the increased memory usage is not significant and the time complexity is significantly reduced from O(n*q) to O(n+q).
