This C program is reading two sequences of integers from standard input and counting the number of elements in the first sequence (S) that can be found in the second sequence (T).

1. Code Analysis:
    The main performance bottleneck is the nested loop where the program is checking for the existence of each element of S in T. This is a time complexity of O(n*q) which will be slow when n and q are large numbers.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    A. Use an efficient data structure: The current code uses arrays which are not ideal for this problem. A hash table would be more efficient for searching. In C++, you can use the unordered_set STL container which is implemented as a hash table. In C, you can use the uthash library.
    B. Minimize redundant computation: The current code checks for each number in S whether it is in T. Instead, you can avoid this redundancy by storing all numbers of T in a hash table first, and then checking for each number in S whether it is in the hash table.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    A. Using an unordered_set (hash table): By using a hash table, we can reduce the time complexity from O(n*q) to O(n+q). This is because searching for an element in a hash table takes constant time O(1) on average. The trade-off is that a hash table uses more memory than an array. However, this is usually an acceptable trade-off for a significant reduction in time complexity.
    B. Minimize redundant computation: By storing all numbers of T in a hash table first, we can avoid doing a linear search in T for each number in S. This reduces the number of operations from n*q to n+q.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, q, t, C = 0;
  unordered_set<int> T;
  cin >> n;
  int S[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> S[i];
  }
  cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    cin >> t;
    T.insert(t);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (T.find(S[i]) != T.end()) {
      C++;
    }
  }
  cout << C << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, we used an unordered_set from the STL which is a hash table. We read all numbers of T and store them in the hash table. Then, for each number in S, we check whether it is in the hash table. This reduces the time complexity from O(n*q) to O(n+q).
