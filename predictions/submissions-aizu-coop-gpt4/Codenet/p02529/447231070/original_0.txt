Code Analysis:
The provided C program reads a series of integers from the standard input and stores their presence in an array 'c'. Subsequently, it reads another series of integers and sums up a count 'd' of how many of these numbers were present in the first series. Here are some points that could be improved:
- The macro 's' is used for reading an integer from the standard input. This is not good practice as it obscures the program's logic.
- The size of array 'c' is fixed at 999. If the input numbers are greater than 998, the program will cause a buffer overflow. Moreover, if the maximum number is much less than 999, it wastes memory.
- The program assumes that all input numbers are non-negative. Negative numbers will cause undefined behavior.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the macro 's' with inline scanf calls to improve code readability.
2. Use dynamic memory allocation to create an array that is just large enough to hold the presence of the maximum number in the first series.
3. Add error checking for negative numbers.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replacing macro 's' with inline scanf calls: Macros can make the code harder to read and debug. By replacing the 's' macro with inline scanf calls, we can improve the readability and maintainability of the code.
2. Dynamic memory allocation: Currently, the code statically allocates an array of size 999. We can optimize this by reading the entire first series of numbers, finding the maximum, and then dynamically allocating an array of the required size. This saves memory when the maximum number is much less than 999, and it prevents buffer overflows when the maximum number is greater than 998.
3. Error checking for negative numbers: The current code behaves unpredictably with negative input numbers, because they are used as indices into the array 'c'. We can add a check after each scanf call to ensure that the number is non-negative.

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, d = 0, max = 0;
  int *c;

  scanf("%d", &a);
  int* firstSeries = (int*)malloc(a * sizeof(int));

  for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &firstSeries[i]);
    if (firstSeries[i] < 0) {
      printf("Negative numbers not allowed.\n");
      return 1;
    }
    if (firstSeries[i] > max) {
      max = firstSeries[i];
    }
  }

  c = (int*)calloc(max + 1, sizeof(int));

  for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {
    c[firstSeries[i]] = 1;
  }

  free(firstSeries);

  scanf("%d", &a);
  for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &b);
    if (b < 0) {
      printf("Negative numbers not allowed.\n");
      return 1;
    }
    if (b <= max) {
      d += c[b];
    }
  }

  printf("%d\n", d);
  free(c);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should have the same functionality as the original code, but with improved memory usage, better error checking, and more readable code.
