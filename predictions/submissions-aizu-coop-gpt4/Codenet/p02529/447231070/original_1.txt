1. Code Analysis:
The provided code takes a set of integers from the user, stores each integer as a flag in an array, then takes another set of integers and increments a sum for each integer present in the array. The code uses scanf() to read each integer from the user input. The use of scanf() in a loop can be a potential performance bottleneck. The array index is also based on the input value, which can lead to segmentation fault if the input is larger than the array size.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Instead of using scanf() multiple times in the loop, use fgets() to read a line of input at a time, then parse the integers from the line using sscanf() or strtol().
    2. Use a dynamic array or a data structure like hash map for storing the flags. A hash map allows for constant time access and can handle any integer input. 
    3. Replace the prefix decrement operator in the loop condition with a postfix decrement operator to eliminate extra computation.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Replace the scanf() calls in the loop with fgets() and sscanf(). This reduces the number of I/O operations, which are slower than memory operations. We read the entire input line at a time and parse the integers from the line, which is faster than reading integers one by one.
    2. Replace the static array with a hash map. The hash map allows for constant time access regardless of the size of the input. This prevents potential segmentation faults if the input is larger than the array size. Also, it only uses memory for the integers that are present in the input, reducing memory usage.
    3. Replace the prefix decrement operator (--a) with a postfix decrement operator (a--). The prefix decrement operator decrements the value before the loop body is executed, which can lead to unnecessary computation if the loop is ended prematurely. The postfix decrement operator decrements the value after the loop body is executed, which is more efficient.

4. Optimized Code Block:
Please note that C does not have built-in hash map, so we use a library for that. Also, error checking is omitted for simplicity.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <uthash.h>

typedef struct {
  int id;
  UT_hash_handle hh;
} MapItem;

int main() {
  char line[1000];
  int a, b, d = 0;
  MapItem *map = NULL;

  fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);
  sscanf(line, "%d", &a);
  for (; a--; ) {
    sscanf(line, "%d", &b);
    MapItem *item = (MapItem *)malloc(sizeof(MapItem));
    item->id = b;
    HASH_ADD_INT(map, id, item);
  }

  fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);
  sscanf(line, "%d", &a);
  for (; a--; ) {
    sscanf(line, "%d", &b);
    MapItem *item;
    HASH_FIND_INT(map, &b, item);
    if (item) d++;
  }

  printf("%d\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, we create a hash map to store the flags. The hash map uses the uthash library, which provides functions for adding items to the hash map and finding items in the hash map. The optimized code reads the user input line by line, which reduces the number of I/O operations, and increments the sum for each integer present in the hash map.
