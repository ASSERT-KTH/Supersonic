1. **Code Analysis**: 

The code is reading integer numbers from the standard input and is using these numbers as indices for an array `c`. It then counts the number of times each number appears in the second half of the input. 

The potential performance bottlenecks might be:
- The redundant `scanf` function calls inside the loops.
- The use of a static array `c` of size 999, which might be wasteful if the input numbers are small.

2. **Optimization Strategy**:

    A. **Inefficient Data Structures**: The array `c` is used as a makeshift hash table. We could replace it with a more efficient data structure, such as a `std::unordered_map` in C++ which provides O(1) complexity for insertion and lookup.

    B. **Redundant Computations**: The `scanf` function calls inside the loops are redundant and can be simplified.

    C. **Loops Optimization**: The two loops can be merged into one, to avoid unnecessary iterations.

    D. **Compiler Optimizations**: The compiler optimizations will largely depend on the specific compiler being used. However, using the `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flag can help the compiler optimize the code further.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:

    A. Replace the array `c` with an `std::unordered_map`. This will make the insertion and lookup operations faster and it will also remove the limitation of the array size.

    B. Instead of calling `scanf` inside the loops, we can read the numbers into a vector first, then process the vector. This will simplify the code and potentially make it faster.

    C. Merge the two loops into one. In the first iteration, insert the numbers into the map. In the second iteration, count the numbers.

    D. Use compiler optimization flags `-O2` or `-O3` when compiling the code. This will enable various compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling and function inlining.

4. **Optimized Code Block**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> numbers(n);
  for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> numbers[i];
  }

  std::unordered_map<int, int> count_map;
  for(int num : numbers) {
    count_map[num]++;
  }

  int d = 0;
  std::cin >> n;
  for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int b;
    std::cin >> b;
    d += count_map[b];
  }

  std::cout << d << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code is simpler and potentially faster than the original code. It properly uses the C++ STL to simplify the code and to make it more efficient. However, the trade-off is that it uses a bit more memory than the original code, due to the usage of the `std::unordered_map` and `std::vector`.
