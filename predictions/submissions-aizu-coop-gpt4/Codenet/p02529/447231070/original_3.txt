Code Analysis:
This program reads a number of integers from the standard input twice. The first time, it stores each read integer in an array, marking it as 1. The second time, it increments a counter for each integer that was read in the first round. The counter is then printed.

The code is hard to understand due to the use of the macro `s` and the absence of meaningful variable names. 

The array `c` is of size 999, which can be a problem if the input numbers exceed this. If an integer larger than 998 is supplied, it will result in a buffer overflow, which is a security risk. And if the maximum input number is less than 998, it wastes memory.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove the macro `s` and replace it with standard `scanf` calls for better readability.
2. Rename variables to improve code clarity.
3. Use dynamic memory allocation for the array based on the maximum number that we read from the input, which will prevent potential buffer overflows and reduce memory usage.
4. Check the return value of `scanf` to ensure the number was read correctly.

Optimized Code Block:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  int num1, num2, counter = 0;
  int maxNum = 0, inputNum;

  // Read first set of numbers and find the maximum number
  scanf("%d", &num1);
  int* checkArray = calloc(num1, sizeof(int)); // dynamically allocated to the maximum number
  for (int i = 0; i < num1; i++) {
    if(scanf("%d", &inputNum) != 1) {
      printf("Failed to read number\n");
      exit(1);
    }
    if(inputNum > maxNum) maxNum = inputNum;
    checkArray[inputNum] = 1;
  }

  // Resize the array to the maximum number
  checkArray = realloc(checkArray, (maxNum + 1) * sizeof(int));

  // Read second set of numbers and count matches
  scanf("%d", &num2);
  for (int i = 0; i < num2; i++) {
    if(scanf("%d", &inputNum) != 1) {
      printf("Failed to read number\n");
      exit(1);
    }
    counter += checkArray[inputNum];
  }

  printf("%d\n", counter);

  // Free dynamic memory
  free(checkArray);

  return 0;
}
```
With these changes, the code is more readable, safer (since it checks the return value of `scanf`), and more memory-efficient (since it only allocates as much memory as needed for the array).
