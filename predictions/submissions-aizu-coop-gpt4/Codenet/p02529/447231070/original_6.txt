This program performs a bitset operation where it marks the numbers in the first input set and then counts the marked numbers in the second input set.

1. Code Analysis:
This program has two main loops. The first loop reads the first set of numbers and marks them in the array `c`. The second loop reads the second set of numbers and counts the marked numbers. The time complexity of the program is O(n), and the space complexity is also O(n), where n is the maximum number in the input set.

2. Optimization Strategy:
The program can be optimized in the following ways:
    1. The array `c` which is used as a bitset is declared with a fixed size of 999. This may be inefficient if the maximum number in the input set is less than 999 or more than 999. A dynamic array could be used instead.
    2. The `scanf` function is called in the loop condition, which can cause inefficiencies. It's better to call `scanf` inside the loop body.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Replace the fixed-size array with a dynamic array.
        * This would allow the program to use memory more efficiently. Instead of always allocating space for 999 integers, we only allocate as much space as needed.
        * The trade-off is that dynamic memory allocation can be slower than static memory allocation. However, this is usually negligible unless the program is extremely performance-critical.
    2. Move `scanf` calls inside the loop body.
        * This would make the program more readable and potentially more efficient. While modern compilers can optimize calls to `scanf` in the loop condition, it's generally a good practice to keep side-effects out of the loop condition.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, d = 0;
  
  // read the size of the first set of numbers
  scanf("%d", &a);
  
  // dynamically allocate the bitset array
  int* c = (int*)calloc(a, sizeof(int));
  
  // read the first set of numbers and mark them in the bitset
  for (int i = 0; i < a; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &b);
    c[b - 1] = 1;
  }
  
  // read the size of the second set of numbers
  scanf("%d", &a);
  
  // read the second set of numbers and count the marked numbers
  for (int i = 0; i < a; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &b);
    d += c[b - 1];
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", d);
  
  // free the dynamically allocated memory
  free(c);
  
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that this optimized code assumes that the input numbers are 1-based. If the input numbers are 0-based, you should remove `-1` after `b` in the code.
