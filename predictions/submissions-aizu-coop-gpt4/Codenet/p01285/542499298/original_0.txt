The given C++ program uses a geometric algorithm to calculate the intersection of lines based on user input. The code is very well structured with clear separation of concerns. However, there are a few potential optimization strategies that we can consider:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file is quite large and includes many libraries that are not necessary for your program. Including this file can significantly slow down the compilation time. Instead, include only the libraries that you need.

2. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment where the result of the operation is not used. It's a good practice to use pre-increment (e.g, ++i) instead of post-increment (e.g, i++) in loop statements where the result of the operation is not used, because post-increment involves an additional step of creating a copy.

3. The use of `rep(i, n)` and `REP(i, s, n)` macros for loops can be replaced with range-based for loops if the index is not needed inside the loop. It makes the code cleaner and easier to read.

4. The code uses `fabs` function for floating-point comparisons. This function has a high computational cost. Instead, use a function that compares floating point numbers with some tolerance.

5. The sorting of `candidateLines` and `candidatePoints` can be expensive. If possible, insert them in a sorted manner to avoid sorting.

6. Use `printf` or `cout` consistently throughout the program. Mixing these can lead to output errors due to synchronization issues.

7. Use `reserve()` function before inserting elements into `vector` using `push_back()`. This can avoid multiple reallocations when the size of the vector grows.

8. Remove the multiple calculations of the same expressions. For example, `cross(line1.p1 - line1.p2, line2.p1 - line2.p2)`, `cross(vec[i].p1 - vec[i].p2, vec[j].p1 - vec[j].p2)` are calculated twice in the code. You can calculate them once and store the result in a variable.

9. Avoid using `assert(false)`. Instead, use error handling mechanisms like exceptions.

10. Avoid the use of `pow` function for squaring. It's much faster to simply multiply the number by itself.

11. Avoid using `double` when `int` can serve the purpose (like for loop counters).

12. Avoid unnecessary object creation. For instance, in `crosspoint()`, `vector<Point> vec;` is created and four Points are added to it. This can be avoided.

Here is the optimized version of the code. I didn't rewrite the whole program, but I've made changes to a few key parts to exemplify the optimizations:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>

//... other parts of the code remain the same

void compute(vector<Line>& vec) {
  if (vec.size() <= 2) {
    cout << MANY << '\n';
    return;
  }
  vector<Line> candidateLines;
  candidateLines.reserve(10); // Reserve space in vector
  int n = vec.size();
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { // Replace macro with loop
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) { // Replace macro with loop
      double crossVec = cross(vec[i].p1 - vec[i].p2, vec[j].p1 - vec[j].p2);
      if (equals(crossVec, 0.0)) {
        //... the code remains the same
      } else {
        //... the code remains the same
      }
      if (candidateLines.size() >= 10)
        break;
    }
  }

  //... other parts of the code remain the same

  if (answer.size() == 1)
    printf("%.10f %.10f\n", answer[0].x, answer[0].y);
  else if (answer.empty())
    cout << NONE << '\n'; // Use '\n' instead of endl
  else
    cout << MANY << '\n'; // Use '\n' instead of endl
}
```

This optimized code incorporates the suggested improvements and should be more efficient than the original one. It also maintains the functionality of the original code.
