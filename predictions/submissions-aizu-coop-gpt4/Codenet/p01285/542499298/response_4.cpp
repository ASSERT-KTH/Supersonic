The given code represents a complex geometric computation involving points, lines, and segments. It calculates cross points between lines, reflects points along lines, and checks whether lines intersect. To optimize this code, we can make a few changes that will improve the code's efficiency and readability.

1. Code Analysis:
    - The code is using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` which includes all standard libraries, but this could potentially slow down the compile time. It is better to include only the necessary libraries.
    - The code uses a lot of floating-point comparisons which can cause precision errors. 
    - The code uses the `vector` data structure which can be inefficient if its size is frequently changed.
    - There are several repetitive calculations, such as `cross(l.p2 - l.p1, m.p2 - m.p1)`, `abs(l.p2 - l.p1)`.
    - There are many methods that are not part of the class but could be.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with specific libraries.
    - Use `constexpr` with the `EPS` variable to improve floating point comparison.
    - Use `reserve()` for vectors when possible to avoid resizing.
    - Remove repetitive calculations by storing the results in variables.
    - Move methods that operate on `Point` and `Line` into the respective classes.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    1. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with specific libraries like `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`, `#include <algorithm>`, `#include <cmath>`, etc. This will improve compile time as only required libraries will be included.
    2. Declare `EPS` as `constexpr` to allow for better optimizations by the compiler.
    3. Use `reserve()` with vectors when their maximum size can be predicted in advance. This will prevent unnecessary resizing and copying of the vector.
    4. Store the results of repetitive calculations in variables and use them in subsequent computations. This will reduce the number of computations and can improve performance.
    5. Move methods that operate on `Point` and `Line` into the respective classes. This will make the code more object-oriented and easier to understand.
