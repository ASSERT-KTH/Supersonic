1. Code Analysis: 

This code performs complex geometric computation. It calculates intersections of lines, distances between points, and angles between vectors. The main computation is done in the `compute` function, which calculates intersection points of lines and checks if these points lie at equal distances from all lines.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. **Avoid unnecessary object creation**: Several operations in the code involve creating new `Point` and `Line` objects, which can be expensive in terms of time and memory. We can refactor the code to minimize such operations.

B. **Use const references**: When passing objects to functions, passing by const reference can be more efficient than passing by value, as it avoids copying the object.

C. **Optimize loop structure**: The code contains several nested loops. Some loops can be combined or restructured to minimize iterations.

D. **Use efficient data structures**: The code uses `std::vector` for storing points and lines. Depending on the operations performed, other data structures (such as `std::set` or `std::unordered_set`) might be more efficient.

E. **Compiler optimizations**: Compiler flags such as `-O2` or `-O3` can be used to automatically optimize the code.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. **Avoid unnecessary object creation**: In the `Point` and `Line` classes, the operator overloads return new objects. We can refactor these to modify the existing object instead.

B. **Use const references**: Functions such as `intersectSS`, `distanceSP`, and `distanceSS` take `Line` objects as parameters. We can change these to take const references instead.

C. **Optimize loop structure**: In the `compute` function, there are nested loops for calculating candidate lines and points. These can be optimized by breaking early when enough candidates are found.

D. **Use efficient data structures**: The `compute` function uses a `std::vector` to store candidate points, which are then sorted and deduplicated. We can use a `std::set` instead, which automatically maintains a sorted and unique collection of elements.

E. **Compiler optimizations**: Compiler flags `-O2` or `-O3` can be used when compiling the code to enable automatic optimizations.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Due to the complexity of the code and the nature of the optimizations, it's not feasible to provide an optimized version of the entire code. However, here are some examples of the proposed changes:

A. **Avoid unnecessary object creation**:

```cpp
Point& operator+=(const Point& p) {
  x += p.x;
  y += p.y;
  return *this;
}
```

B. **Use const references**:

```cpp
bool intersectSS(const Line& s, const Line& t) {
  // ...
}
```

C. **Optimize loop structure**:

```cpp
rep(i, n) {
  REP(j, i + 1, n) {
    // ...
    if (candidateLines.size() >= 10)
      break;
  }
  if (candidateLines.size() >= 10)
    break;
}
```

D. **Use efficient data structures**:

```cpp
std::set<Point> candidatePoints;
```

E. **Compiler optimizations**: Add `-O2` or `-O3` flag when compiling:

```shell
g++ -O3 main.cpp -o main
```
