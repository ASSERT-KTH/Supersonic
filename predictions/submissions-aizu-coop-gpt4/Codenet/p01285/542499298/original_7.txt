This program is designed to calculate and print the point (or points) of intersection for a set of lines. The program is quite complex and employs a number of mathematical computations. Here are some optimization strategies that could be employed:

1. **Reducing the number of computations:** Many of the functions in this program involve complex mathematical computations. These could be optimized by reducing the number of computations. For example, the `cross3p` function could be optimized by storing the result of `p.x - q.x` and `p.y - q.y` in variables and reusing these, rather than calculating them twice.

2. **Avoiding unnecessary checks:** The `equals` function checks for equality between two floating point numbers by comparing the absolute difference with a small epsilon value. This check is used extensively throughout the program and could be optimized by avoiding unnecessary calls. For example, in the `Point operator<(const Point &p) const` method, we check for equality between x coordinates and then again between y coordinates. If we know that the x coordinates are equal, we could avoid the second check.

3. **Optimizing data structures:** The program uses `std::vector` to store points and lines. This could be optimized by using a more efficient data structure, such as a hash table or a set, which offer constant time complexity for lookups and insertions.

4. **Using compiler optimizations:** Most modern C/C++ compilers provide options for optimizing the compiled code for speed or size. These optimizations can include things like loop unrolling, function inlining, and others. This could be used to improve the performance of the program.

5. **Parallelizing computations:** Some of the computations in this program could potentially be parallelized to take advantage of multi-core processors. For example, the process of calculating the crosspoint of all pairs of lines could be done in parallel.

Here is a simplified version of the code with some of the proposed optimizations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define EPS (1e-6)

// ...rest of the code...

double cross3p(Point p, Point q, Point r) {
  double px_qx = p.x - q.x;
  double py_qy = p.y - q.y;
  return (r.x - q.x) * py_qy - (r.y - q.y) * px_qx;
}

bool Point::operator<(const Point &p) const {
  if (fabs(x - p.x) < EPS)
    return y < p.y;
  return x < p.x;
}

// ...rest of the code...

int main() {
  int n;
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);  // disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams
  while (std::cin >> n, n) {
    std::vector<Line> vec(n);
    rep(i, n) std::cin >> vec[i].p1.x >> vec[i].p1.y >> vec[i].p2.x >> vec[i].p2.y;
    compute(vec);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that in real world applications, one should avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;`, as this could lead to slower compilation times and potential naming conflicts. Instead, include only the necessary standard library headers and use the `std::` prefix when necessary.
