The given program is a complex geometry-based program that performs calculations on lines, segments, and points in 2D space. It computes the intersection points of lines and checks for collinearity of points and lines, among other things. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: In the given code, vectors like candidateLines and candidatePoints are being frequently populated and cleared. Instead of using vectors, which involve dynamic memory allocation, we can use fixed-size arrays if the maximum size is known.

2. Reducing function calls: Functions like equals, abs, and cross are being called frequently, sometimes in tight loops. We can try to reduce the number of calls to these functions by using inline functions or directly substituting the function body in the calling code.

3. Use of Compiler Pragma Directives: Pragma directives can be used to give hints to the compiler to unroll certain loops or to perform other optimizations. However, care should be taken as this might make the code less portable.

4. Avoid repetitive computations: Any repetitive computations inside loops should be moved outside the loop where possible. For example, the calculation of the cross product of the points of two lines is being done inside a loop. If these values are not changing, they should be computed once and stored.

5. Use of faster I/O methods: The use of cin and cout is slower than scanf and printf. In performance-critical code, this can make a difference.

6. Early termination of loops: Whenever possible, loops should be terminated early if the desired condition has been met.

7. Optimizing the use of mathematical functions: Mathematical functions can often be optimized. For example, the use of the sqrt function can be minimized by comparing the squares of distances, rather than the distances themselves.

8. Efficient use of data structures: The use of appropriate data structures can greatly improve the efficiency of a program. For example, if a data structure is frequently being searched, a data structure with fast search operations like a set or a map should be used.

Trade-offs: The trade-offs involved in these optimizations include increased code complexity and reduced readability. Moreover, some of these optimizations might make the code less portable. Also, while using fixed-size arrays instead of vectors can improve performance, it can also potentially lead to array overflow errors if the size of the array is not properly computed.

Here is a sample optimized code block based on the above strategy. Not all optimizations may be possible or result in significant improvements, so the code below mainly focuses on reducing function calls and unnecessary computations:

(For brevity, only some sections of the code where significant optimizations are possible have been included):

```cpp
// A function like equals, which is called frequently, can be made inline to reduce function call overhead.
inline bool equals(double a, double b) {
    return fabs(a - b) < EPS;
}

// Similarly, the abs function can be made inline.
inline double abs(Point a) {
  return sqrt(a.x * a.x + a.y * a.y);
}

// Computation of cross product of points of two lines, which is done multiple times in the code, can be computed once and stored.
double crossProduct = cross(line1.p1 - line1.p2, line2.p1 - line2.p2);

// Use scanf and printf instead of cin and cout for faster I/O.
int main() {
  int n;
  while (scanf("%d", &n) != EOF && n) {
    Line vec[n];
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
      scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf", &vec[i].p1.x, &vec[i].p1.y, &vec[i].p2.x, &vec[i].p2.y);
    compute(vec, n);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code block reduces function call overhead by making frequently called functions inline. It also avoids repetitive computations of the cross product of the points of two lines by computing it once and storing the result. Finally, it uses scanf and printf instead of cin and cout for faster I/O operations.
