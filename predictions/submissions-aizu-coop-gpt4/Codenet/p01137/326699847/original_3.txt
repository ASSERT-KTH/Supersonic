Code Analysis:
The provided code appears to be a brute-force solution for a problem where it is trying to minimize the value of 'm' by iterating through possible values of 'y' and 'z' and calculating the difference from a given number 'e'. 
The two major performance bottlenecks in this code are:
1. The nested loops where the outer loop iterates 101 times and the inner loop iterates up to the square root of 'e'. This could lead to a significant number of iterations for larger values of 'e'.
2. The continuous recalculation of 'val' and 'val2' during each iteration.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: The code doesn't use any data structures, so no optimization is required on this front.

2. Redundant Computations: The variables 'val' and 'val2' are recalculated during each iteration. These calculations could be optimized.

3. Loop Optimization: The nested loops could be optimized to reduce the number of iterations. We can also apply loop unrolling to further optimize the loops.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations such as '-O2' or '-O3' can be used to automatically optimize the code during compilation.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Loop Optimization: The inner loop iterates from 'sqrt(e-val)' to 0. We could optimize this by calculating the square root before the loop and then decrementing the value during each iteration.
2. Redundant Computations: Instead of recalculating 'val' and 'val2' during each iteration, we could calculate these values once and then decrement them during each iteration.
3. Loop Unrolling: We could unroll the inner loop to reduce the overhead of loop control. This will involve duplicating the loop body a fixed number of times.
4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimization flags such as '-O2' or '-O3' can be used to automatically optimize the code during compilation. These flags instruct the compiler to perform optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and constant propagation.

Trade-offs:
The main trade-off of these optimizations is increased code complexity. However, this is outweighed by the significant performance gain.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#define debug(x) cout << #x << " : " << (x) << " --------------" << endl;
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int m = 1000000;
    for (int z = 100, val = z * z * z; z >= 0; --z, val -= 3 * z * z + 3 * z + 1) {
      if (val > e)
        continue;
      for (int y = sqrt(e - val), val2 = val + y * y; y >= 0; --y, val2 -= 2 * y + 1) {
        if (val2 > e)
          continue;
        m = min(m, e - val2 + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << m << endl;
  }
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
Compile the code with the '-O2' or '-O3' optimization flag. For example:
```sh
g++ -O2 main.cpp
```
