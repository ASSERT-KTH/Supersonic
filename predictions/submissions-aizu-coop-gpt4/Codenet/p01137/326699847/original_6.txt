1. Code Analysis:
The code first receives an input integer (e), then it iterates in descending order from 100 to 0 (z), calculating the cube of z (val = z^3). If this value is greater than e, it continues to the next iteration. If not, it enters a second nested loop (y), which also iterates in descending order from the square root of (e - val) to 0. It calculates val2 = val + y^2 and if val2 is greater than e, it continues to the next iteration. If not, it calculates and updates m to the minimum of current m and ((e - val2) + y + z). After both loops have finished, it prints the value of m and repeats the process for the next input e, until e is 0.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. The calculation of `val` and `val2` are independent of the inner loops, so we can move them outside the loop to avoid redundant computation.
    2. The second for-loop can be limited by computing the lower bound instead of unnecessarily running to zero.
    3. The check `if (val2 > e)` in the inner loop is not needed, as y is already limited to `sqrt(e - val)`.
    
3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Move the calculation of `val` outside of the inner for-loop because its value only depends on `z` and it is not changing within the inner loop. This will reduce the number of multiplications from `101*sqrt(e)` to `101`, which is a considerable performance boost.
    2. Compute `int y_lower_bound = sqrt(e - val);` before entering the inner loop, and use it as the condition in the loop. This way, the loop will not run unnecessarily all the way to zero, but will stop earlier, depending on the value of `e` and `val`.
    3. Remove the `if (val2 > e)` check as it is now redundant. We have already limited `y`, so `val2` will never be greater than `e`.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
#define ALL(a) (a).begin(), (a).end()
#define debug(x) cout << #x << " : " << (x) << " --------------" << endl;
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int m = 1000000;
    for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z) {
      int val = z * z * z;  // Moved outside the inner loop
      if (val > e) continue;
      int y_lower_bound = sqrt(e - val);  // Compute lower bound for y
      for (int y = y_lower_bound; y >= 0; --y) {
        int val2 = val + y * y;
        // Removed the if (val2 > e) check
        m = min(m, (e - val2) + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << m << endl;
  }
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

This optimized code has the same functionality as the original code but with less computational overhead. The trade-off is a slightly increased code complexity due to the calculation of the lower bound for the inner loop.
