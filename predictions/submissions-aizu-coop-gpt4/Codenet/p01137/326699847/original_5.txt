Let's start by analyzing the given code.

This code is trying to find the minimum value of `(e - val2) + y + z` for a given input `e`, where `val2` is a sum of cube of `z` and square of `y` and is less than or equal to `e`. The code tries every possible combination of `z` and `y` values and keeps track of the minimum result.

Now, let's move onto the optimization strategy:

1. **Inefficient Data Structures**: The current code doesn't use any complex data structures, so there's no room for improvement in this aspect.

2. **Redundant or Unnecessary Computations**: The calculations `z*z*z` and `y*y` are repeated in every iteration of the loop. We can avoid these by storing these values before the loops.

3. **Loops or Recursive Calls**: The outer loop `for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z)` can be optimized by breaking it when `z*z*z` is more than `e`. Similarly, the inner loop `for (int y = sqrt(e - val); y >= 0; --y)` can be optimized by breaking it when `y*y` is more than `e - val`. 

4. **Compiler Optimizations or Pragma Directives**: We can use the `-O3` flag for compiler level optimizations and the `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")` directive for further optimization.

Now, let's apply these optimizations:

```c++
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
#define ALL(a) (a).begin(), (a).end()
#define debug(x) cout << #x << " : " << (x) << " --------------" << endl;
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int m = 1000000;
    int val, val2;
    for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z) {
      val = z * z * z;
      if (val > e)
        break;  // Optimization 1: Break the loop when 'val' is more than 'e'
      for (int y = sqrt(e - val); y >= 0; --y) {
        val2 = val + y * y;
        if (val2 > e)
          break;  // Optimization 2: Break the loop when 'val2' is more than 'e'
        m = min(m, (e - val2) + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << m << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we have:

1. Stopped calculating `val` and `val2` repeatedly in every loop.
2. Added breaks in loops when calculated values exceed `e`.
3. Used `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` to speed up cin and cout.
4. Replaced `endl` with `'\n'` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the cout buffer.

The trade-off is that the code has become a bit more complex due to the additional conditions, but the gain in performance justifies this complexity.
