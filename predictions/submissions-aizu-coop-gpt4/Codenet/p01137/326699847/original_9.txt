Let's start with analyzing the code:

1. Code Analysis:
    - The code reads an integer from the console. It then performs a nested loop where the outer loop goes from 100 to 0 and the inner loop goes from sqrt(e - val) to 0. In each loop, it calculates val and val2 and updates the minimum value found so far (m).
    - The outer loop calculates the cube of z (val = z * z * z) and the inner loop calculates the square of y (val2 = val + y * y). This is done to find the minimum value of the expression (e - val2) + y + z.
    - The code does not seem to have any obvious performance bottlenecks, but it does contain some redundant calculations.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - A. Use more efficient data structures: The current program does not use any complex data structures, so no changes are needed in this area.
    - B. Remove redundant computations: The val and val2 computations are performed multiple times even when their values have not changed. We can store these values and reuse them to avoid unnecessary calculations.
    - C. Optimize loops or recursive calls: The outer loop can be optimized by starting from the cube root of e instead of always starting from 100.
    - D. Use compiler optimizations: We can use the -O2 or -O3 optimization flags when compiling the code to instruct the compiler to optimize the code further.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    - A. Remove redundant computations: We can store the value of val = z * z * z and val2 = val + y * y in the outer and inner loops respectively. This way, we only calculate these values once for each iteration of the loops.
    - B. Optimize loops: Instead of always starting the outer loop from 100, we can start from the cube root of e. This will significantly reduce the number of iterations in the outer loop when e is small.
    - C. Compiler optimizations: Adding the -O2 or -O3 flags when compiling the program will enable the compiler to perform additional optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and dead code elimination.

4. Optimized Code Block: 

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int m = 1000000;
    for (int z = cbrt(e); z >= 0; --z) { // Start from cube root of e
      int val = z * z * z;
      if (val > e)
        continue;
      for (int y = sqrt(e - val); y >= 0; --y) {
        int val2 = val + y * y;
        if (val2 > e)
          continue;
        m = min(m, (e - val2) + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << m << endl;
  }
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

Please note that the optimization level flags (-O2 or -O3) should be added during compilation, not in the code itself. The command to compile the code with optimization level 2 would be: g++ -O2 filename.cpp
