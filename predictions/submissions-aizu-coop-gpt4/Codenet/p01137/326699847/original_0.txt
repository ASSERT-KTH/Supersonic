Code Analysis:
The code is a simple program that reads an integer input `e` and computes the minimal possible value of `(e - val2) + y + z`, where `val2` is the sum of a cubic number `val` (cube of z) and a square number (square of y). The computation is done by brute force, iterating over all possible values of z (from 100 to 0) and y (from sqrt(e - z*z*z) to 0).

Potential bottlenecks and areas for improvement:

1. The computation of square and cube numbers is done inside the inner for loop, which might lead to redundant computations.
2. The use of `sqrt` function inside the loop could be a potential performance bottleneck as it is a costly operation.
3. The code doesn't make use of any compiler optimizations.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Computation of square and cube numbers: We can calculate and store all square and cube numbers up to 100 only once and store them in arrays. This helps to reduce redundant calculations.
2. Use of `sqrt` function: The use of the `sqrt` function inside the loop could be replaced by an equivalent code that avoids its usage.
3. Compiler optimizations: Use of compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` can significantly speed up the code. 

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Computation of square and cube numbers: 
   - Rationale: Calculating square and cube numbers inside the loop is redundant as the same values are computed multiple times. By computing these values once and storing them in an array, we can avoid these redundant computations.
   - Trade-offs: This optimization increases the memory usage slightly (two arrays of size 101) but offers a significant performance improvement.

2. Use of `sqrt` function: 
   - Rationale: The `sqrt` function is a costly operation and can slow down the code when used inside a loop. By replacing it with a loop that iterates from the maximum possible value of `y` down to zero, we can achieve the same result without the need for the `sqrt` function.
   - Trade-offs: This optimization can make the code slightly harder to read and understand, but it improves the performance significantly.

3. Compiler optimizations: 
   - Rationale: Compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` instruct the compiler to perform optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, etc., which can significantly speed up the code.
   - Trade-offs: There are no significant trade-offs in using compiler optimizations.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

// Store all square and cube numbers up to 100
int square[101], cube[101];

int main(void) {
  // Precompute square and cube numbers
  for (int i = 0; i <= 100; ++i) {
    square[i] = i * i;
    cube[i] = i * i * i;
  }

  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int m = 1000000;
    for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z) {
      if (cube[z] > e)
        continue;
      for (int y = 100; y >= 0; --y) {
        int val = cube[z] + square[y];
        if (val > e)
          break;
        m = min(m, (e - val) + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << m << endl;
  }
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

Note: Remember to compile this code with `-O2` or `-O3` flag for better performance.
