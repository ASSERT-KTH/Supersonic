After analyzing the provided code, here are the potential bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. The code involves two nested loops, which could be potential bottlenecks and should be optimized if possible.

2. The computations `z * z * z` and `val + y * y` are repeated in each iteration. These computations could be stored to avoid redundancy and reduce processing time.

3. The usage of `std::cin` and `std::cout` could be optimized through the usage of `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`, which can significantly increase the I/O performance in C++.

4. The usage of `bits/stdc++.h` is not recommended for production code as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which could increase compilation time. 

Now, let's move to the optimization strategy:

1. To avoid redundant computations, plan to store the results of computations `z * z * z` and `val + y * y` in separate variables and reuse these variables.

2. Plan to use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` to boost I/O performance.

3. Plan to replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header with only the necessary headers.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

#define ALL(a) (a).begin(), (a).end()

using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int m = 1000000;
    for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z) {
      int val = z * z * z;
      if (val > e)
        continue;
      for (int y = sqrt(e - val); y >= 0; --y) {
        int val2 = val + y * y;
        if (val2 > e)
          continue;
        m = min(m, (e - val2) + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << m << endl;
  }

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

In this optimized code:

1. I replaced the `bits/stdc++.h` header with only the necessary headers, which can reduce the compilation time.

2. I added `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up the I/O operations.

3. I stored the results of computations `z * z * z` and `val + y * y` in separate variables to avoid redundant computations and improve the performance.

Trade-offs: The code complexity remains the same with these optimizations. The most significant trade-off is the increased memory usage due to storage of computation results in separate variables. However, this trade-off is justified because it improves the program's performance by reducing redundant computations.
