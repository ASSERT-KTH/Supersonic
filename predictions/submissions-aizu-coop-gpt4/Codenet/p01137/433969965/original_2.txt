## Code Analysis
This code is a solution to a problem that finds the minimum sum of three numbers `x`, `y`, and `z`, where `x` is any integer, `y` is a perfect square, and `z` is a perfect cube, such that `x + y*y + z*z*z = e`. The program reads values of `e` from the standard input until `0` is encountered and for each `e`, it prints the minimum sum `x+y+z`.

There is a nested loop in the code that iterates over every possible `z` and `y` combination. For each combination, it calculates `x` and updates `ans` if the new sum `x+y+z` is smaller than the current `ans`. Although the code is correct, it is very inefficient for large `e` because it has to check every possible combination of `z` and `y`. 

## Optimization Strategy

1. **Use better looping strategy**: Currently, the code uses a brute force approach by trying all possible combinations of `z` and `y`. Since `z` and `y` are non-negative, we can use a better looping strategy where we start from the maximum possible `z` and `y` and go down to `0`. This way, we can stop as soon as we find a solution because any other solution with smaller `z` or `y` would have a larger sum `x+y+z`. 
2. **Break loops early**: With the new looping strategy, we can break the loops early when we find a solution, which can significantly reduce the running time.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Use better looping strategy**: Instead of starting `z` from `0`, we start from `cbrt(e)`, which is the maximum possible `z` because `z*z*z <= e`. Similarly, for each `z`, we start `y` from `sqrt(e - z*z*z)`, which is the maximum possible `y` because `y*y + z*z*z <= e`. We decrement `z` and `y` in the loops because `x+y+z` is a decreasing function of `z` and `y`. Thus, the first solution we find will have the minimum sum `x+y+z`.

2. **Break loops early**: With the new looping strategy, as soon as we find a solution, we can break the loops because any other solution with smaller `z` or `y` would have a larger sum `x+y+z`.

## Optimized Code Block

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int ans = e + 2;
    for (int z = cbrt(e); z >= 0; --z) {
      for (int y = sqrt(e - z * z * z); y >= 0; --y) {
        int x = e - (y * y + z * z * z);
        if (x + y + z < ans) {
          ans = x + y + z;
          // break the inner loop because any other y would result in a larger sum
          break;
        }
      }
      // break the outer loop because any other z would result in a larger sum
      if (ans < e + 2) break;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

## Trade-offs

The optimized code is slightly more complex because it has to calculate the starting values for `z` and `y` and control the early break of the loops. However, it is much more efficient because it significantly reduces the number of iterations of the loops.
