Code Analysis:

The given C++ program reads an integer from the input and tries to find the minimum value of `x + y + z`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that `x + y*y + z*z*z = e`, and `e` is the input integer. This process is repeated until a zero is read from the input.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The program doesn't use any data structures, so there is no optimization possible in this area.

2. Redundant Computation: The program calculates `z * z * z` and `y * y + z * z * z` multiple times. This is a redundant computation which can be minimized.

3. Loops optimization: The inner loop where `y` is calculated is independent of the outer loop where `z` is calculated. This nested loop can be parallelized to improve the performance.

4. Compiler optimizations: The code can be compiled with optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` for better performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Redundant Computation: 
   - The value of `z*z*z` is calculated in each iteration of the outer loop. We can avoid this by calculating it once at the start of each iteration and storing it in a variable.
   - Similarly, the value of `y*y + z*z*z` is calculated in each iteration of the inner loop. We can optimize this by using a variable to hold the value `y*y`, increment it by `2*y+1` in each iteration, and add it to `z*z*z`.

2. Loops optimization: 
   - The inner loop can be parallelized, as the iterations are independent. This can be done using OpenMP, a library for parallel programming in C/C++.

3. Compiler optimizations: 
   - Compile the code with `-O2` or `-O3` flags for better performance.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <omp.h> // Include OpenMP library
using namespace std;
const int inf = 1000000000;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // Improve IO performance
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int ans = inf;
    for (int z = 0; z * z * z <= e; ++z) {
      int z_cubed = z * z * z; // Compute once at the start of each iteration
      int y_squared = 0; // Initialize y_squared
      #pragma omp parallel for reduction(min : ans) // Parallelize the loop and use reduction for the min operation
      for (int y = 0; y_squared + z_cubed <= e; ++y) {
        int x = e - (y_squared + z_cubed);
        ans = min(ans, x + y + z);
        y_squared += 2 * y + 1; // Increment y_squared
      }
    }
    cout << ans << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that using OpenMP may increase the complexity of the code and may also introduce new bugs if not used carefully. It is also important to consider that not all systems support OpenMP, so the portability of the program might be compromised.
