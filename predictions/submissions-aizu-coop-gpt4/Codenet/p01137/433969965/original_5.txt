Code Analysis:

The given program reads an integer input `e` and computes the minimum possible value of `x + y + z` such that `x + y*y + z*z*z = e` where `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers. It uses a brute-force approach by trying all possible values of `y` and `z` and computes `x` directly. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: In this code, there are no data structures being used, so this point does not apply.

2. Redundant Computations: The program computes `y*y` and `z*z*z` inside the inner loop for every iteration. These computations can be considered redundant as they are being recalculated for every iteration of the loop. 

3. Loops or Recursive Calls: The current implementation uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible values of `y` and `z`. However, the loops are not independent and the range of inner loop depends on the current value of `z`. This dependence prevents us from using techniques like loop unrolling to optimize the code.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use the `-O2` or `-O3` flag to enable higher levels of optimization when compiling the program. 

Optimization Steps:

1. Precomputing `y*y` and `z*z*z`: Since `y*y` and `z*z*z` are being recalculated for each iteration of the inner loop, we can precompute these values before the start of the loop and reuse them, thereby saving computation time. 

2. Compiler Optimization: While compiling the code, we can use the `-O2` or `-O3` flags to enable higher levels of optimization by the compiler.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (int)n; ++i)
#define REP(i, a, b) for (int i = (int)a; i < (int)b; ++i)
#define rer(i, a, b) for (int i = (int)a; i <= (int)b; ++i)
#define each(i, c)                                                             \
  for (__typeof((c).begin()) i = (c).begin(); i != (c).end(); ++i)
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define mset(a, n) memset(a, n, sizeof(a))
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<string> vs;
typedef vector<vector<int>> vvi;
typedef vector<pair<int, int>> vpii;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<long long, long long> pll;
const int inf = 1000000000;
const int mod = 1000000007;
const double eps = 1e-9;
const int dx[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
const int dy[] = {0, -1, 0, 1};
int main() {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int ans = inf;
    for (int z = 0; z * z * z <= e; ++z) {
      int zz = z * z * z;
      for (int y = 0; y * y + zz <= e; ++y) {
        int yy = y * y;
        int x = e - (yy + zz);
        ans = min(ans, x + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Here, the optimized code has avoided the redundant computation of `y*y` and `z*z*z` by precomputing these values before the loop. This simple optimization can significantly reduce the running time of the program, especially for large inputs.
