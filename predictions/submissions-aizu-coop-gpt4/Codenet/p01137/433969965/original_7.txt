# Code Analysis

The code reads an integer `e` from input and finds the minimum sum of three non-negative integers `(x, y, z)` such that `x + y*y + z*z*z = e`.

# Optimization Strategy

1. Inefficient data structures: The code does not use any data structures, so we don't have to optimize them.

2. Redundant computations: The code computes `y * y + z * z * z` multiple times. We can compute it once and store it in a variable.

3. Loops: The inner loop for `y` can be optimized. As the value of `z` increases, the possible range for `y` decreases. We can calculate the upper limit for `y` at each iteration of `z` to reduce the number of iterations. 

4. Compiler optimizations: The code does not use any explicit compiler directives for optimization. We can enable `-O3` optimization flag during compilation for maximum optimizations.

# Step-by-step Explanation

1. Eliminate redundant computations: Compute `y*y + z*z*z` once in each iteration of `y` and store it in a variable `yyzzz`. This will reduce the number of multiplications.

2. Optimize inner loop: Instead of iterating `y` from 0 to `e`, we can iterate it from 0 to `sqrt(e - z*z*z)`. This will reduce the number of iterations.

3. Compiler optimizations: Compile the code with `-O3` flag to enable all compiler optimizations.

# Trade-offs

These optimizations should improve the performance of the code without any significant trade-offs. The code complexity will not increase significantly and readability will be maintained.

# Optimized Code

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int inf = 1000000000;
int main() {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int ans = inf;
    for (int z = 0; z * z * z <= e; ++z) {
      int max_y = sqrt(e - z * z * z);
      for (int y = 0; y <= max_y; ++y) {
        int yyzzz = y * y + z * z * z;
        int x = e - yyzzz;
        ans = min(ans, x + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

To compile the code with `-O3` flag, use the following command:

```
g++ -O3 main.cpp
```

This will produce an executable named `a.out`. To run the executable, use the command:

```
./a.out
```
