Code Analysis:
The given C++ program is trying to find the minimum sum of 'x', 'y', and 'z' such that the equation 'x + y^2 + z^3 = e' holds true for a given 'e'. The program uses a nested loop to iterate through all possible values of 'y' and 'z' and calculates the corresponding 'x'. The minimum sum of 'x', 'y', and 'z' is updated for each iteration.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: The code doesn't heavily rely on data structures, so there's no need for optimization in this regard. 

2. Redundant Computations: In the nested loop, the expression 'y * y + z * z * z' is computed twice. This can be optimized by storing the result in a temporary variable.

3. Loops Optimization: The inner loop of 'y' can be optimized by setting the starting point to 'z*z*z' since 'y' cannot be less than 'z' in the equation 'x + y^2 + z^3 = e'.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Using the flag '-O2' or '-O3' during compilation will enable the compiler to automatically apply various optimization techniques.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Store the result of 'y * y + z * z * z' in a temporary variable. This helps to avoid redundant multiplication and addition operations, thereby improving performance.

2. Change the starting point of 'y' loop to 'z*z*z'. This reduces the number of iterations, and hence the running time of the program.

3. Use compiler optimization flags like '-O2' or '-O3' during compilation. This will help the compiler to automatically optimize the code for better performance.

Trade-offs:
These optimizations will slightly increase the complexity of the code. However, this is a negligible trade-off considering the performance gain. The functionality and output of the original code will be preserved.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (int)n; ++i)
#define REP(i, a, b) for (int i = (int)a; i < (int)b; ++i)
#define rer(i, a, b) for (int i = (int)a; i <= (int)b; ++i)
#define each(i, c) for (__typeof((c).begin()) i = (c).begin(); i != (c).end(); ++i)
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define mset(a, n) memset(a, n, sizeof(a))
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<string> vs;
typedef vector<vector<int>> vvi;
typedef vector<pair<int, int>> vpii;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<long long, long long> pll;
const int inf = 1000000000;
const int mod = 1000000007;
const double eps = 1e-9;
const int dx[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
const int dy[] = {0, -1, 0, 1};
int main() {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int ans = inf;
    for (int z = 0; z * z * z <= e; ++z) {
      for (int y = z*z*z; y * y + z * z * z <= e; ++y) {
        int temp = y * y + z * z * z; // Store result in a temporary variable
        int x = e - temp;
        ans = min(ans, x + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Remember to compile the code with '-O2' or '-O3' flags for additional optimizations. For example:
```bash
g++ -O3 -o prog prog.cpp
```
