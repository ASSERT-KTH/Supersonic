Analysis:
The above code is finding the minimum value of `x + y + z` such that `x + y*y + z*z*z = e`. The outer loop is for `z` and iterates until `z * z * z` is less than or equal to `e`. The inner loop is for `y` and iterates until `y * y + z * z * z` is less than or equal to `e`. `x` is then calculated as `e - (y * y + z * z * z)`.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The code doesn't use any data structure that can be considered inefficient.

2. Redundant Computation: The same values of `y * y`, `z * z * z`, and `y * y + z * z * z` are computed multiple times. We can store these values to avoid redundant computation.

3. Loop Optimization: The code is already using a loop with a condition that stops the loop when it's impossible to find a better solution. The loop structure seems fine.

4. Compiler Optimization: There are no specific parts of the code that can be targeted for compiler optimization.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. We can calculate `z * z * z` once per iteration of the `z` loop and store it in a variable. This will be more efficient than calculating it multiple times.

2. Similarly, we can calculate `y * y` once per iteration of the `y` loop and store it in a variable.

3. We can also calculate `y * y + z_cubed` once per iteration of the `y` loop and store it in a variable.

Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (int)n; ++i)
#define REP(i, a, b) for (int i = (int)a; i < (int)b; ++i)
#define rer(i, a, b) for (int i = (int)a; i <= (int)b; ++i)
#define each(i, c)                                                             \
  for (__typeof((c).begin()) i = (c).begin(); i != (c).end(); ++i)
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define mset(a, n) memset(a, n, sizeof(a))
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<string> vs;
typedef vector<vector<int>> vvi;
typedef vector<pair<int, int>> vpii;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<long long, long long> pll;
const int inf = 1000000000;
const int mod = 1000000007;
const double eps = 1e-9;
const int dx[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
const int dy[] = {0, -1, 0, 1};
int main() {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int ans = inf;
    for (int z = 0; z * z * z <= e; ++z) {
      int z_cubed = z * z * z;  // calculate once per z loop
      for (int y = 0; y * y + z_cubed <= e; ++y) {
        int y_squared = y * y;  // calculate once per y loop
        int sum = y_squared + z_cubed;  // calculate once per y loop
        int x = e - sum;
        ans = min(ans, x + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized code should perform fewer computations and thus be faster. However, memory usage should be about the same as the original code.
