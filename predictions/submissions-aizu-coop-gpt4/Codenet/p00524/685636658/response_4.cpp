Code Analysis:

The given code is a complex graph-based problem solved using priority queues and graph traversal. The main bottlenecks can be the use of the map and set data structures for frequent lookup and insertions, which can be costly. The large number of loops and the usage of priority queues can also lead to performance issues.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The map, set, and vector data structures are being used extensively in the code. The map `v2id` is used for frequent lookup and insertion operations, which takes O(log(n)) time. If the number of elements is large, this can be costly. We can replace the map with an unordered_map, which has an average time complexity of O(1) for lookup and insertions. The set `height` is used for inserting elements and maintaining them in a sorted order. We can replace this with a vector and sort it once after all insertions are done.

2. Redundant Computations: The code uses the `v2id.count()` method to check if an element exists in the map. This operation is done multiple times for the same element. We can store the result of this operation in a variable and reuse it to eliminate redundant computations.

3. Loops and Recursive Calls: There are multiple loops in the code. Some loops are iterating over the graph edges and vertices. If the graph is dense, these operations can be costly. We can try to optimize these loops by minimizing the number of operations done inside the loop. 

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use the `-O3` flag to enable all compiler optimizations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace map with unordered_map: This will optimize the time complexity of lookup and insertions from O(log(n)) to O(1). This will speed up the operations with the `v2id` map. We just need to include the `unordered_map` header and replace the `map` declaration with `unordered_map`.

2. Replace set with vector: Instead of inserting elements to the set and maintaining them in sorted order, we can insert them into a vector and sort it once after all insertions are done. This will reduce the time complexity of insertions from O(log(n)) to O(1). We need to replace the `height` set declaration with a vector and sort it once all insertions are done.

3. Eliminate redundant computations: We can store the result of `v2id.count()` operation in a variable and reuse it to avoid redundant computations. This will reduce the number of map operations and speed up the execution time.

4. Optimize loops: We can minimize the number of operations done inside the loops to optimize the loop execution. For example, instead of checking the existence of an element in the map multiple times, we can check it once and store the result in a variable.

5. Enable compiler optimizations: We can use the `-O3` flag to enable all compiler optimizations. This will allow the compiler to make changes to the code to optimize its performance.

Note: These optimizations might increase the code complexity. The use of an unordered_map instead of a map can lead to a higher memory usage if the number of elements is large. The use of a vector instead of a set can lead to an unsorted order of elements.
