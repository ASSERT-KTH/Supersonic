This C++ program appears to be solving a graph problem using Dijkstra's algorithm. Given a graph with nodes and edges, it finds the shortest path from a starting node to a goal node. 

Here are some potential optimization strategies:

1. Code Analysis: The code contains several nested loops and large data structures that can potentially be the cause of slow runtime and excessive memory usage. The data structures used are not necessarily inefficient, but their size can be a problem if the input graph is large.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    1. Data Structures Optimization: The program uses multiple data structures like vector, set, and map which can be optimized depending on the usage. For instance, if the map `v2id` is not using the key sorting feature of map, it can be replaced with an unordered_map which has a better average-case complexity.
    
    2. Redundant computation: The code has several instances where a pair is created and used to access values in the map `v2id`. This operation is performed multiple times, which can be reduced by storing the result of the first operation and reusing it.
    
    3. Loop optimization: The code has several instances of loops iterating over the elements of a vector or set. These can be optimized using iterators or even better by using range-based for loops. 

    4. Compiler optimizations: Using compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` can speed up the performance by automatically applying various optimization techniques.

Now, let's apply these optimization steps:

1. Replace map with unordered_map: This will improve the average-case complexity from log(n) to O(1) for insertion and retrieval operations.

```cpp
unordered_map<pi, int> v2id;
```

2. Reducing redundant computations: Store the result of map operation and reuse it.

```cpp
auto v2idResult = v2id[pi(v, bh)];
if (!v2idResult) {
  v2idResult = ct++;
  height[v].insert(bh);
}
```

3. Using range-based for loop: Replace simple for loop with range-based for loop for better readability and performance.

```cpp
for (const auto &e : G[i]) {
  //...
}
```

4. Using compiler optimization flags: Use `-O2` or `-O3` while compiling the code.

The optimized code after applying these strategies will be as follows:

```cpp
// ... rest of the code
unordered_map<pi, int> v2id;
// ... rest of the code
while (!que.empty()) {
  pi p = que.top();
  que.pop();
  int v = p.se, h = p.fi;
  if (h < max_h[v])
    continue;
  for (const auto &e : G[v]) {
    //...
    auto v2idResult = v2id[pi(v, bh)];
    if (!v2idResult) {
      v2idResult = ct++;
      height[v].insert(bh);
    }
    //...
  }
}
// ... rest of the code
for (const auto &e : G[i]) {
  //...
}
// ... rest of the code
```

Compile the code with `-O2` or `-O3` flag for better performance.

Care must be taken while using unordered_map as it may increase the code complexity due to hash collisions in the worst case scenario. Similarly, range-based for loops are generally faster but can be slower if the compiler does not support them well. Compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` may lead to longer compilation times but faster execution times.
