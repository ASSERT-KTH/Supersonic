This program appears to be a solution to a graph theory problem where the nodes have some additional properties. The code first constructs the graph, then constructs a modified graph where each node is split into several nodes depending on the height, and finally performs Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm on the modified graph.

The code is already quite efficient, but some parts could be improved:

1. **Use of map for v2id:** The map `v2id` is used to map a pair of integers to an integer. This map is used quite frequently, and map operations are generally O(log N) complexity. An alternative could be to use a 2D array of integers, which would allow O(1) access time. However, this may not be practical if the range of the integers in the pair is too large. If the range of values is manageable, we can switch to a 2D array.

2. **Redundant map access:** In several places in the code, `v2id.count()` is used to check if a key exists, and if it does not, `v2id[]` is used to insert the key. This results in two map operations, which could be reduced to one by using `v2id.insert()` instead, which returns a pair with the second element being a boolean indicating whether the insertion was successful or not.

3. **Repeated computation of the same value:** In several places, the same pair (v, bh) or (e.to, nh) is recreated multiple times. It would be more efficient to store this pair in a variable and reuse it.

4. **Use of priority queue:** In the Dijkstra's algorithm part of the code, a priority queue is used to get the next node with the shortest distance. This can be optimized by using a Fibonacci heap, which can decrease the complexity of decreasing a key from O(log N) to O(1). However, the standard library does not have a Fibonacci heap, so this would require an external library or a custom implementation.

5. **Use of set for height:** The set `height` is used to store unique height values. As the elements in a set are sorted, this can cause unnecessary overhead when inserting elements. If the order of elements is not important, an unordered_set can be used for more efficient insertions.

6. **Use of #define:** The use of #define for rep and all is a bad practice in C++. It would be better to use a function or a lambda function for these.
