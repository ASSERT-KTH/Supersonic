The provided code is a C++ implementation of a modified Dijkstra's algorithm used to find the shortest path in a graph. As it's a competitive programming style of code, the main focus is on writing the algorithm as quickly as possible rather than considering the maintainability or performance of the code.

However, this code has several areas that could be optimized:

1. Data Structures: The code uses maps (`v2id`) and sets (`height`) which have constant time lookup and insertions but still can be slower than arrays due to their internal balancing mechanisms. Consider replacing these with arrays or vectors if possible.

2. Redundant Computations: The code checks for the existence of keys in `v2id` map multiple times in different parts of the code. This is a redundant operation and could be avoided with better structuring of the code.

3. Loop Optimization: The code has multiple loops iterating over the same set of data. This is inefficient and can be optimized either by merging the loops or by storing the results of computations for reuse.

4. Function Calls: The `push` and `pop` operations on priority_queue are performed multiple times. These operations could be expensive and hence should be minimized.

The following steps will be taken to optimize the code:

1. Replace `map<pi, int> v2id` with an array or vector. This will make the access time O(1) instead of O(log(n)).

2. Remove redundant checks for keys in `v2id` by restructuring the code.

3. Combine loops where possible to reduce the number of iterations.

4. Minimize the number of push and pop operations on `priority_queue`.

5. Instead of creating multiple `priority_queue`, reuse the existing ones.

6. Avoid creating temporary variables inside loops.

7. Use `reserve()` function to allocate memory in advance for vectors to avoid reallocation.

8. Use `emplace_back()` instead of `push_back()` to construct the object in-place and avoid extra copy or move operations.
