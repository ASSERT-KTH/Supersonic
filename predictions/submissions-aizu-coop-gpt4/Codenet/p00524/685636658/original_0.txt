This code is a bit complex, and it seems to be solving some sort of path finding problem, possibly a variant of the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm with some specific conditions. Optimization in this case should focus on improving algorithms used and reducing unnecessary memory usage. Here's a proposed optimization strategy:

1. **Algorithm Improvement**: The code uses nested loops and priority queues in several places. These sections can be optimized by using more efficient data structures or algorithms. For example, the use of `std::map` for `v2id` can be replaced with `std::unordered_map`, which provides average constant-time complexity.

2. **Avoiding Unnecessary Memory Usage**: The code creates a few large arrays, such as `G`, `gg`, `d`, and `H`. If the actual data is much smaller than the maximum size, a lot of memory is wasted. Depending on the actual data, these arrays can be replaced with dynamic data structures that grow as needed, such as `std::vector`.

3. **Redundant Computations**: The code performs the same computation multiple times in several places, such as `v2id[pi(i, *itr)]` and `v2id[pi(i, *nx)]`. These computations can be stored in temporary variables to avoid duplications.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: The `-O3` flag can be used during compilation to enable all optimization levels provided by the compiler.

5. **Code Refactoring**: There are several places in the code where the same logic is repeated. For example, the block of code that adds nodes to `v2id` and `height` is repeated multiple times. This logic can be moved into a separate function to reduce code duplication.

6. **Changing data structures**: The current code uses a set to store heights. This is unnecessary because a set is not needed if we store the heights in a sorted manner in the first place. We can replace this data structure to improve performance.

7. **Preallocate memory**: For data structures like vectors and maps, it's a good practice to preallocate memory if we have an idea about the number of elements it's going to hold. This reduces the overhead of memory reallocation.

8. **Inlining small functions**: Small functions that are called repeatedly can be inlined using the `inline` keyword. This can potentially improve performance by avoiding the function call overhead.

Here is the step-by-step explanation of the optimizations:

1. **Algorithm Improvement**: We will replace `std::map` with `std::unordered_map` for `v2id`. This changes the lookup time from O(log n) to O(1) on average.

2. **Avoiding Unnecessary Memory Usage**: We will change the static arrays `G`, `gg`, `d`, and `H` to dynamic data structures `std::vector`. This will ensure that only the required amount of memory is used.

3. **Redundant Computations**: We will store the results of computations like `v2id[pi(i, *itr)]` and `v2id[pi(i, *nx)]` in temporary variables to avoid duplications.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: We will compile the code with `-O3` flag to enable all optimization levels provided by the compiler.

5. **Code Refactoring**: We will move the logic of adding nodes to `v2id` and `height` into a separate function. This reduces code duplication.

6. **Changing data structures**: We will replace the set used for storing heights with a sorted vector. This avoids the overhead of maintaining a set and improves performance.

7. **Preallocate memory**: We will preallocate memory for vectors and maps based on the maximum number of elements they are expected to hold.

8. **Inlining small functions**: If there are small functions that are called repeatedly, we can inline them using the `inline` keyword. This can potentially improve performance by avoiding the function call overhead.

After making these changes, the optimized code would look something like the following. Since the original code is quite long and complex, I'll just show an example of how to apply some of these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
#define rep(i, n) for (int(i) = 0; (i) < (int)(n); ++(i))
#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()
#define pb push_back
#define fi first
#define se second
using pi = pair<int, int>;
using P = pair<ll, int>;
struct edge {
  int to;
  ll cost;
};
const int V = 100000;
const int VV = 1000000;
const ll INF = LLONG_MAX / 3;
vector<vector<edge>> G(V), gg(VV);
vector<set<int>> height(V);
int n, m;
ll X;
vector<int> H(V);
unordered_map<pi, int> v2id;
vector<int> max_h(V);
vector<ll> d(VV);
// other code here...
```

This code replaces the `std::map` with `std::unordered_map`, changes the static arrays to dynamic `std::vector`, and preallocates memory for vectors and maps.

This optimization strategy should help improve the performance of the code, but there might be some trade-offs. For example, using `std::unordered_map` might increase memory usage slightly because it needs to maintain a hash table. Also, the `-O3` compiler flag might make the compilation slower and the resulting binary larger.
