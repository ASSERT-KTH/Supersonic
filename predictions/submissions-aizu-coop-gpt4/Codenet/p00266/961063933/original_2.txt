1. Code Analysis:
    - This program uses dynamic memory allocation to create an array `factmodary` and `word`.
    - The program uses a map `bubblehist` to store and retrieve elements. Map operations usually have a time complexity of O(logN) which can be a bottleneck if the number of elements is large.
    - The program uses a nested loop in which the map's iterator is incremented in the inner loop. This can significantly increase the time complexity.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Replace the map with a vector. A vector provides constant time complexity O(1) for accessing elements compared to a map's O(logN).
    2. Instead of swapping elements in the `word` array, we can just store the swapped indexes in a separate array and use it for accessing elements. This avoids unnecessary swaps.
    3. Remove the inner loop by directly updating the vector's elements.

3. Step-By-Step Explanation:
    1. Replace the map `bubblehist` with a vector. This is because a vector provides constant time complexity for accessing elements, which is faster than a map's logarithmic time complexity.
    2. Instead of swapping elements in the `word` array using temporary variables, we store the swapped indexes in a separate array and use it for accessing elements. This avoids unnecessary swapping operations, thus saving computational time.
    3. We remove the inner loop which increments the map's iterator. Instead, we directly update the vector's elements. This reduces the time complexity by avoiding nested loops.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int divisor = 1000000007;
int main() {
  long long *factmodary = new long long[100001];
  long long fact = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 100000; i++) {
    fact *= i;
    fact %= divisor;
    factmodary[i] = fact;
  }
  int *word = new int[100000]{0};
  for (;;) {
    int N, R;
    cin >> N;
    if (N == 0)
      break;
    cin >> R;
    vector<int> index(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
      word[i] = index[i] = i + 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < R; i++) {
      int s, t;
      cin >> s >> t;
      swap(index[s - 1], index[t - 1]);
    }
    vector<int> bubblehist(N + 1, 0);
    long long ans = factmodary[N - 1] * (word[index[0] - 1] - 1);
    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
      int facttime = word[index[i] - 1] - 1;
      int bubblenum = bubblehist[word[index[i] - 1]];
      bubblehist[word[index[i] - 1]]++;
      facttime -= bubblenum;
      ans += factmodary[N - (i + 1)] * facttime;
      ans %= divisor;
    }
    cout << (int)ans << "\n";
  }
  delete[] word;
  delete[] factmodary;
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the code gets rid of the map, replacing it with a vector for faster element access. It also stores swapped indexes in a separate array to avoid unnecessary swapping operations. The inner loop has been removed, and the vector's elements are updated directly. This reduces the time complexity of the program, improving its efficiency.
