Code Analysis:
The program calculates a certain value for each permutation of the numbers 1 to N, based on the order of the permutation and the number of elements that are smaller than each element and appear later in the permutation. The computation of this value requires the use of factorials, which are calculated in advance and stored in an array. For each permutation, the program reads the permutation from input, computes the value, and prints it. The permutations are represented by arrays of integers. The computation of the number of smaller elements that appear later for each element of the permutation uses a self-balancing binary search tree (std::map in C++).

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use an array instead of a map for the computation of the number of smaller elements that appear later. This can be done by keeping a running count of the number of occurrences of each number. This should be faster than using a map because arrays have constant-time access and update, while for maps these operations take logarithmic time. Also, an array uses less memory than a map.

2. Use a more efficient input/output method. The cin and cout operations are slower than scanf and printf, and the difference can be significant when dealing with a large amount of data.

3. Remove unnecessary computations. There are some computations that are performed multiple times with the same result, like factmodary[N - (i + 1)], which can be calculated once and stored in a variable.

4. Use more efficient data structures. The code uses dynamic arrays allocated with new. It would be more efficient to use std::vector, which is a safer and more efficient alternative.

Optimization Steps:

1. Replace the map bubblehist with an array of integers. Initialize the array with zeros. For each element of the permutation, increment the count for that number and subtract from the count of all numbers greater than it. This will give the number of smaller elements that appear later.

2. Replace cin and cout with scanf and printf. This will make the input/output operations faster.

3. Calculate factmodary[N - (i + 1)] once for each i and store it in a variable. Use this variable instead of calculating the same value multiple times.

4. Replace the dynamic arrays with std::vector. This will make the code safer and more efficient.

Trade-offs:
The main trade-off is that the code may become slightly more complex because of the additional logic required to maintain the counts of the numbers in the permutation. Also, using scanf and printf instead of cin and cout may decrease code readability.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int divisor = 1000000007;
int main() {
  vector<long long> factmodary(100001);
  long long fact = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 100000; i++) {
    fact *= i;
    fact %= divisor;
    factmodary[i] = fact;
  }
  vector<int> word(100000);
  vector<int> counts(100001);
  for (;;) {
    int N, R;
    scanf("%d", &N);
    if (N == 0)
      break;
    scanf("%d", &R);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
      word[i] = i + 1;
    fill(counts.begin(), counts.end(), 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < R; i++) {
      int s, t;
      scanf("%d%d", &s, &t);
      swap(word[s - 1], word[t - 1]);
    }
    long long ans = 0;
    for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      for (int j = word[i] + 1; j <= N; j++)
        counts[j]--;
      ans += factmodary[i] * counts[word[i]];
      ans %= divisor;
      counts[word[i]]++;
    }
    printf("%d\n", (int)ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
