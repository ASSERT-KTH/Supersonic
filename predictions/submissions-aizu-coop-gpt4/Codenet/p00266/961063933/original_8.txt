### Code Analysis

The given program is a C++ implementation that seems to perform a specific kind of permutation-related operation. It involves creating a factorial mod array and an array of integers, taking some inputs, performing swaps, and finally doing some operations on a map data structure to calculate and print a result.

Potential performance bottlenecks can be:

1. Extensive use of dynamic memory allocation using `new` which is slower compared to static allocation.
2. Use of `map` data structure, which has O(log n) time complexity for insertions and access.
3. Redundant operations in the loop where map is updated.

### Optimization Strategy

1. Replace `map` with `unordered_map` if order of elements is not important, as `unordered_map` provides average constant-time complexity for access and insertions.
2. Reduce dynamic memory allocation by making use of automatic storage duration variables wherever possible.
3. Optimize the redundant operations in the loop where the map is updated.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Replace `map` with `unordered_map`**: The `unordered_map` data structure in C++ provides O(1) average time complexity for insertions and access. However, it does not maintain the order of elements. In this case, the order does not seem to matter, so we can replace `map` with `unordered_map` to improve performance.

2. **Reduce dynamic memory allocation**: Dynamic memory allocation is slower than automatic storage duration variables (i.e., local/stack variables). We can reduce the usage of dynamic memory allocation and make use of local variables wherever possible.

3. **Optimize the redundant operations in the loop**: There are redundant operations in the loop where the map is updated. For instance, the iterator `it` is decremented whether the `if` condition is true or not. This can be moved outside the `if` and `else` block.

### Optimized Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;
const int divisor = 1000000007;
int main() {
  long long factmodary[100001];
  long long fact = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 100000; i++) {
    fact *= i;
    fact %= divisor;
    factmodary[i] = fact;
  }
  int word[100000] = {0};
  for (;;) {
    int N, R;
    cin >> N;
    if (N == 0)
      break;
    cin >> R;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
      word[i] = i + 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < R; i++) {
      int s, t;
      cin >> s >> t;
      swap(word[s - 1], word[t - 1]);
    }
    unordered_map<int, int> bubblehist;
    bubblehist[word[0]] = 0;
    long long ans = factmodary[N - 1] * (word[0] - 1);
    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
      int facttime = word[i] - 1;
      int bubblenum;
      unordered_map<int, int>::iterator it = bubblehist.find(word[i]);
      if (it != bubblehist.end()) {
        bubblenum = it->second;
      }
      else {
        bubblenum = (++bubblehist.rbegin())->second + 1;
      }
      bubblehist[word[i]] = bubblenum;
      facttime -= bubblenum;
      ans += factmodary[N - (i + 1)] * facttime;
      ans %= divisor;
    }
    cout << ans << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

### Trade-offs

While these changes should generally improve the performance, it should be noted that `unordered_map` uses more memory than `map` to achieve faster access times. Also, the use of local/stack variables instead of dynamic allocation restricts the size of arrays that can be created, since stack size is generally much smaller than heap size.
