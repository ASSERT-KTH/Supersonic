1. **Code Analysis:**

This code is a console application that computes a sequence of calculations based on user input. Multiple areas in the code can be optimized:

- The program uses dynamic allocation for the `factmodary` and `word` arrays, which may be inefficient if the size of these arrays is known beforehand. 

- The program uses a `std::map` for `bubblehist` which can be slow for large inputs due to its log(n) complexity for insertions and lookups. 

- There are nested loops where the outer loop iterates over the input `N` and the inner loop iterates over the size of the `bubblehist` map. This might cause performance issues if the input `N` and the size of the `bubblehist` map are large. 

2. **Optimization Strategy:**

a. Replace dynamic allocation with static arrays when the size is known at compile time. 

b. Use a data structure with a faster lookup and insertion time for `bubblehist`. 

c. Use an algorithm to calculate the factorial mod divisor instead of using a loop. 

d. Use a faster sorting algorithm instead of bubble sort.

e. Use a faster method to swap elements in an array.

f. Use the modulo property of multiplication to reduce the number of modulo operations. 

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

a. The size of `factmodary` and `word` arrays is known at compile time, so it is more efficient to use static allocation instead of dynamic allocation. 

b. The `bubblehist` map is used to keep track of the number of times each number appears. A `std::unordered_map` can be used instead of a `std::map` as it has average constant-time complexity for insertions, deletions and lookups. 

c. The loop to calculate the factorial can be replaced with an algorithm that calculates the factorial mod divisor. 

d. The bubble sort algorithm is slow and can be replaced with a faster sorting algorithm like quicksort or heapsort. 

e. To swap two elements in an array, the `std::swap` function can be used instead of manually swapping the elements.

f. The modulo property of multiplication states that `(a * b) % c = ((a % c) * (b % c)) % c`. This can be used to reduce the number of modulo operations in the code.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;
const int divisor = 1000000007;

int main() {
  long long factmodary[100001];
  long long fact = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 100000; i++) {
    fact = (fact * i) % divisor;
    factmodary[i] = fact;
  }
  int word[100000]{0};
  for (;;) {
    int N, R;
    cin >> N;
    if (N == 0)
      break;
    cin >> R;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
      word[i] = i + 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < R; i++) {
      int s, t;
      cin >> s >> t;
      swap(word[s - 1], word[t - 1]);
    }
    unordered_map<int, int> bubblehist;
    bubblehist[word[0]] = 0;
    long long ans = (factmodary[N - 1] * (word[0] - 1)) % divisor;
    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
      int facttime = word[i] - 1;
      int bubblenum = bubblehist[word[i]];
      bubblehist[word[i]] = bubblenum;
      facttime -= bubblenum;
      ans = (ans + (factmodary[N - (i + 1)] * facttime) % divisor) % divisor;
    }
    cout << ans << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: These optimizations are based on the assumption that the input will be within the specified limits. It is always important to be aware of the constraints and limitations of the input when optimizing code.
