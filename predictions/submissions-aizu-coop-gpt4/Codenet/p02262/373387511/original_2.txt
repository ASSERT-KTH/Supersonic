Code Analysis:

The code is implementing a sorting algorithm known as Shell Sort. Shell Sort is a generalization of Insertion Sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart. This code calculates the intervals (gap sequence) using the formula 3*h+1 where h starts at 1. The gap sequence is then used in the insertion sort function to sort the elements. After all intervals have been processed, the array is sorted.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Instead of using a vector to store the gap sequence, we can use a deque or a stack. The reason being we are only using the vector like a stack: we append to the end and only remove from the end. Therefore, a stack or deque would be more appropriate.

2. We can avoid the use of the global variable 'cnt' by passing it as a reference parameter to the functions that modify it.

3. Replace 'break' statement in the loop with a more appropriate condition.

4. In the 'main' function, we are using a variable length array which is not standard in C++. It would be better to use a vector or a dynamically allocated array.

5. The swapping of elements in the 'insertionSort' function can be simplified by using the standard 'swap' function provided by C++ STL.

6. The printing of the gap sequence can be simplified by using the reverse iterator of the gap container.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace 'vector' with 'deque': We are using the vector only to append and remove elements from the end. A deque or stack is more appropriate for this use case.

2. Avoid using global variables: We can achieve this by passing 'cnt' as a reference parameter to the functions that modify it.

3. Replace 'break' statement with a condition: Instead of checking the condition inside the loop and breaking the loop, we can check the condition in the loop declaration itself.

4. Replace variable length array with vector: Variable length arrays are not standard in C++. We can replace it with a vector which is more flexible and safer.

5. Use 'swap' function: The swapping of elements can be simplified by using the 'swap' function provided by C++. This makes the code cleaner and easier to read.

6. Simplify printing of the gap sequence: The gap sequence can be printed more simply by using the reverse iterator of the deque.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>
using namespace std;

void insertionSort(int *a, int g, int n, int &cnt) {
  for (int i = g; i < n; i++) {
    int j = i;
    while (j - g >= 0 && a[j - g] > a[j]) {
      swap(a[j], a[j - g]);
      j = j - g;
      cnt++;
    }
  }
}

void selectionSort(int *a, int n, int &cnt) {
  cnt = 0;
  deque<int> G;
  for (int h = 1; h <= n; h = 3 * h + 1) {
    G.push_front(h);
  }
  for (auto g : G) {
    insertionSort(a, g, n, cnt);
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  int cnt;
  selectionSort(a.data(), n, cnt);
  cout << G.size() << endl;
  for (auto it = G.rbegin(); it != G.rend(); ++it) {
    cout << *it << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
  cout << cnt << endl;
  for (auto val : a) {
    cout << val << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
