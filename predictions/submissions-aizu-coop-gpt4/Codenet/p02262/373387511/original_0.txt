Code Analysis:
The provided code is a C++ program that implements a variation of the Insertion Sort algorithm known as Shell Sort. 

The Shell Sort algorithm works by first sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared. This is done using a sequence of gaps (G), in this case, defined by the formula `3*h + 1`.

The code is generally well-written, but there are a few potential performance bottlenecks and areas where memory usage could be improved.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: The vector `G` is globally defined and does not need to be a vector, since the size is not dynamically changing during runtime. It could be replaced by a dynamically allocated array to save memory overhead of vector.
2. Redundant Computations: In the `insertionSort` method, the swapping of two elements is done in three steps, which could be optimized to a single step using `std::swap`.
3. Loops and Recursive Calls: Currently, the Shell Sort algorithm is implemented with nested for-loops in the `insertionSort` and `selectionSort` methods. Loop unrolling can be applied to the inner loop of the `insertionSort` method to reduce the overhead of loop control.
4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler flags such as `-O3` can be used to enable all optimization levels, making the code run faster.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the global vector `G` with a dynamically allocated array: This will reduce the overhead of memory usage from the Vector data structure. We can calculate the size of the array by counting the number of times the loop in the `selectionSort` function is executed.
2. Use `std::swap` to reduce redundant computations: In the `insertionSort` method, we are swapping the values of `a[j]` and `a[j - g]` using a temporary variable. This can be optimized by using `std::swap` which does the swapping in one line, reducing cache misses.
3. Apply loop unrolling: The inner loop of the `insertionSort` method can be unrolled, reducing the overhead of loop control. However, the trade-off is that the code might become less readable.
4. Use compiler optimizations: Compiling the program with `-O3` flag will enable all compiler optimizations, leading to faster execution.

Optimized Code Block: 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>  // for std::swap
using namespace std;

int cnt;
int* G;

void insertionSort(int* a, int g, int n) {
  for (int i = g - 1; i < n; i++) {
    int j = i;
    while (j - g >= 0 && a[j - g] > a[j]) {
      std::swap(a[j], a[j - g]); // Optimized swapping
      j = j - g;
      cnt++;
    }
  }
}

void selectionSort(int* a, int n) {
  cnt = 0;
  // Calculate size of G
  int size = 0;
  for (int h = 1; h <= n; h = 3 * h + 1)
    size++;

  // Allocate memory for G
  G = new int[size];
  
  int index = 0;
  for (int h = 1;; h = 3 * h + 1) {
    if (h > n)
      break;
    G[index++] = h;
  }

  for (int i = size - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    insertionSort(a, G[i], n);
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int* a = new int[n];  // Dynamic allocation
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  selectionSort(a, n);
  cout << G[G.size() - 1];
  for (int i = G.size() - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    cout << " " << G[i];
  }
  cout << endl;
  cout << cnt << endl;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << a[i] << endl;
  }
  
  // Free the allocated memory
  delete[] a;
  delete[] G;
  
  return 0;
}
```

Remember to compile this optimized code with `-O3` flag for best performance.
