1. Code Analysis:
This program is implementing a shell sort algorithm. Shell sort is a generalization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart. The method starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared. The time complexity of shell sort is O(n (log n)^2), which is better than O(n^2) of simple comparison sorts like insertion sort if the gap sequence is chosen appropriately.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    A. Inefficient data structures: The vector G is used to store the gap sequence for shell sort. Since the size of G is known at the start of the sorting function (log3(n)), we can use an array instead of a vector to save the overhead of dynamic memory allocation.
    B. Redundant computations: The size of the vector G is repeatedly computed in the sorting loop. We can compute it once and store it in a variable.
    C. Loops or recursive calls: The inner loop in the insertion sort function can be optimized by eliminating the swap operation inside the loop.
    D. Compiler optimizations: We can use the -O3 optimization flag to enable all optimization flags in the GCC compiler.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    A. Replacing vector with an array: Vectors in C++ are dynamic arrays, which means they can grow and shrink at runtime. This flexibility comes with overheads in terms of memory usage and performance. Since we know the size of the gap sequence at the start of the sorting function, we can use a static array instead of a vector. This will reduce the overhead of dynamic memory allocation.
    B. Eliminate redundant computations: The size of the array G is repeatedly computed in the sorting loop. We can compute it once and store it in a variable. This will save CPU cycles.
    C. Optimizing the Inner loop: The swap operation inside the inner loop of the insertion sort function can be replaced with a more efficient operation. Instead of swapping elements every time a[j-g] > a[j], we can just move a[j-g] to a[j] and keep track of the 'j' index. After the loop, we can place the key element at the correct position. This will reduce the number of assignments in the loop.
    D. Compiler optimizations: The -O3 optimization flag can be used to enable all optimization flags in the GCC compiler. This will enable various compiler optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, constant propagation, etc.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int cnt;
int G[100];
void insertionSort(int *a, int g, int n) {
  for (int i = g; i < n; i++) {
    int key = a[i];
    int j = i - g;
    while (j >= 0 && a[j] > key) {
      a[j + g] = a[j];
      j -= g;
      cnt++;
    }
    a[j + g] = key;
  }
}
void shellSort(int *a, int n) {
  cnt = 0;
  int h, i;
  for (h = 1, i = 0;; i++) {
    if (h > n)
      break;
    G[i] = h;
    h = 3 * h + 1;
  }
  int m = i;
  for (i = m - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    insertionSort(a, G[i], n);
  }
}
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int a[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  shellSort(a, n);
  cout << cnt << endl;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << a[i] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The use of Variable Length Arrays (VLA), like 'int a[n];', is a non-standard C++ feature. It is supported by some compilers like GCC, but it is better to avoid it in portable code. You can use 'std::vector<int> a(n);' instead.
