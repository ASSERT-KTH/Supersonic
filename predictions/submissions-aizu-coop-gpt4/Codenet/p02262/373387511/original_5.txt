Code Analysis:

The provided code is implementing the Shell sort algorithm in C++. This algorithm sorts a list of elements by first sorting subarrays defined by a gap of 'h' (which gradually decreases), and finally sorts the entire array when h = 1.

Potential areas of optimization include:

1. The `insertionSort()` function involves swapping elements in the array. This operation can be optimized.

2. The use of the `vector<int> G` to store the sequence of gaps. This could potentially be made more efficient.

3. The dynamic array `int a[n]` is not a good practice in C++. It could be replaced with a `vector`.

4. The redundant break condition in the gap sequence generation loop `if (h > n) break;` can be moved to the loop condition itself.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use `std::swap()` to swap the elements in the `insertionSort()` function instead of manually swapping them.

2. Since we only need the size and elements of the gap sequence `G` in the `main()` function, we could eliminate the global `vector<int> G` and instead return a `vector<int>` directly from the `selectionSort()` function. This would avoid having to push_back the gaps into `G` during each iteration.

3. Replace the dynamic array `int a[n]` with a `vector<int>` for better practice and safety.

4. Move the break condition `if (h > n)` to the while loop condition.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the manual element swapping in `insertionSort()` with `std::swap()`. This function is more efficient and easier to understand.

2. Modify the `selectionSort()` function to return a `vector<int>` of gap sequence. This removes the need for the global `vector<int> G` and the associated push_back operations.

3. Replace the dynamic array `int a[n]` with a `vector<int> a(n)`. This is safer and more idiomatic C++.

4. Move the break condition `if (h > n)` to the while loop condition. This makes the code cleaner and potentially more efficient.

Trade-offs: There are no significant trade-offs with these optimizations. The code becomes cleaner and more efficient without sacrificing readability or introducing additional complexity.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int cnt;

void insertionSort(vector<int>& a, int g, int n) {
  for (int i = g; i < n; ++i) {
    int j = i;
    while (j - g >= 0 && a[j - g] > a[j]) {
      swap(a[j], a[j - g]);
      j = j - g;
      cnt++;
    }
  }
}

vector<int> shellSort(vector<int>& a, int n) {
  cnt = 0;
  vector<int> G;
  for (int h = 1; h <= n; h = 3 * h + 1) {
    G.push_back(h);
  }
  for (int i = G.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    insertionSort(a, G[i], n);
  }
  return G;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  vector<int> G = shellSort(a, n);
  cout << G.size() << endl;
  for (int i = G.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    cout << (i == G.size() - 1 ? "" : " ") << G[i];
  }
  cout << endl;
  cout << cnt << endl;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << a[i] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
