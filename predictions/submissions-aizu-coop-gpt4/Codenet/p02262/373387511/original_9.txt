This code is a variation of the insertion sort algorithm called Shell Sort. It optimizes the insertion sort by starting with larger gaps (G vector) and gradually reducing the gap size until it reaches 1, where it performs a standard insertion sort. This optimization speeds up the insertion sort by reducing the amount of shifting needed.

1. Code Analysis:
   The major performance bottlenecks include:
   - Use of the `vector::push_back` function, which might need to resize the array, thus increasing the execution time.
   - The swapping operation in the `insertionSort` function, which requires three assignments.
   
2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Use a `deque` instead of a `vector` for the `G` variable, as we're only inserting at the end and iterating from the end. A `deque` performs these operations more efficiently than a `vector`.
   - Replace the swapping operation in the `insertionSort` function with the `std::swap` function, which is more efficient and clearer.
   
3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   - Switching from `vector` to `deque` will reduce memory reallocation, as `deque` is designed to allow efficient insertion and removal of elements from both ends of the container.
   - `std::swap` is a built-in function that swaps the values of two variables. It is more efficient than manually swapping with a temporary variable, and it improves code readability.
   
4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int cnt;
deque<int> G;

void insertionSort(int *a, int g, int n) {
  for (int i = g; i < n; i++) {
    int j = i;
    while (j - g >= 0 && a[j - g] > a[j]) {
      swap(a[j], a[j - g]);  // Use std::swap function
      j -= g;
      cnt++;
    }
  }
}

void selectionSort(int *a, int n) {
  cnt = 0;
  for (int h = 1; h <= n; h = 3 * h + 1) {
    G.push_front(h);  // Insert at the beginning
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < G.size(); i++) {
    insertionSort(a, G[i], n);
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int a[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  selectionSort(a, n);
  cout << G.size() << endl;
  for (int i = G.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    cout << G[i] << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
  cout << cnt << endl;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << a[i] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code performs the same function as the original, but it should run faster and use memory more efficiently. Note that the optimizations are minimal and do not alter the logic of the original program.
