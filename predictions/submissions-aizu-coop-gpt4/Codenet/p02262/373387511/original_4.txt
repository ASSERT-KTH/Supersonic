Code Analysis:

This program implements the Shell sort algorithm, which is a generalized version of insertion sort. The global `vector<int> G` stores the gap sequence, and `cnt` keeps track of the number of swaps made in the whole process. In the `selectionSort` function, a sequence of gaps is generated first, and then the `insertionSort` function is called for each gap value in decreasing order. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The array `a` is inefficient for large data sizes due to the lack of dynamic resizing. It's better to use `std::vector<int>` which allows dynamic resizing and provides better performance for large datasets.

2. Redundant Computations: The condition checks `j - g >= 0` and `a[j - g] > a[j]` in the `while` loop of the `insertionSort` function are computed multiple times. We can reduce this by storing the result of `j - g` and `a[j - g]` in a variable.

3. Loop Optimization: The `for` loop in the `insertionSort` function can be optimized by using `std::swap` function which is more efficient than manual swapping using a temporary variable.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` for better optimization during the compilation process.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the array `a` with `std::vector<int>`. This will have better performance for larger datasets as `std::vector` provides dynamic resizing.

2. Store the result of `j - g` in a variable `prev` and `a[j - g]` in a variable `prev_val` to avoid redundant computations in the `while` loop of the `insertionSort` function.

3. Replace the manual swapping of `a[j]` and `a[j - g]` in the `insertionSort` function with `std::swap(a[j], a[prev])`. This is a more efficient way to swap two elements.

4. During compilation, use the `-O2` or `-O3` compiler flags for better optimization.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>  // For using std::swap
using namespace std;
int cnt;
vector<int> G;
void insertionSort(vector<int> &a, int g, int n) {
  for (int i = g; i < n; i++) {
    int j = i, prev = j - g;
    int prev_val = a[prev];
    while (prev >= 0 && prev_val > a[j]) {
      std::swap(a[j], a[prev]);
      j = prev;
      prev -= g;
      if(prev >= 0)
        prev_val = a[prev];
      cnt++;
    }
  }
}
void shellSort(vector<int> &a, int n) {
  cnt = 0;
  for (int h = 1; h <= n; h = 3 * h + 1) {
    G.push_back(h);
  }
  for (int i = G.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    insertionSort(a, G[i], n);
  }
}
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  shellSort(a, n);
  cout << G.size() << endl;
  for (int i = G.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    cout << (i == G.size() - 1 ? "" : " ") << G[i];
  }
  cout << endl << cnt << endl;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << a[i] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
