The given program is a C program that sorts an array of integers using the Shell Sort algorithm. There are several areas where this program could potentially be optimized:

1. **Global Variables**: The use of global variables `count`, `temp`, `temp_temp`, and `h` can result in potential issues with threading and is generally discouraged. They can be moved to the scope where they are used.

2. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: The program dynamically allocates memory for the array `arr` but does not free it later. This is a memory leak and can lead to unnecessary memory usage.

3. **Redundant Computations**: The program computes `h[i + 1]` and `j + (*h)` multiple times within loops. These calculations can be stored in variables to reduce redundant computations.

4. **Passing Arguments By Value**: The function `insertionSort` receives an integer pointer `h` as a parameter. Since `h` is an integer array, we can pass the array element directly instead of passing the address and then dereferencing it.

5. **Compiler Optimizations**: Use of compiler flags like `-O3` can lead to optimizations at the compiler level.

6. **Code Complexity**: The current code unnecessarily divides the ShellSort into two functions. We can merge the `insertionSort` into `ShellSort` for simplicity without compromising the performance.

## Optimized Code

Here's the optimized version of the given program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void ShellSort(int num, int *arr) {
  int count = 0;
  int h[20];
  h[0] = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < 19; i++) {
    h[i + 1] = 3 * h[i] + 1;
  }

  int temp = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
    if (num < h[i]) {
      temp = i - 1;
      break;
    }
  }

  for (int i = temp; i != -1; i--) {
    int h_val = h[i];
    for (int j = h_val; j < num; j++) {
      int v = arr[j];
      int k = j - h_val;
      while (k >= 0 && arr[k] > v) {
        arr[k + h_val] = arr[k];
        k = k - h_val;
        count++;
      }
      arr[k + h_val] = v;
    }
  }

  printf("%d\n", temp + 1);
  for (int i = temp; i != -1; i--)
    i == 0 ? printf("%d\n", h[i]) : printf("%d ", h[i]);
  printf("%d\n", count);
}

int main(void) {
  int num;
  scanf("%d", &num);

  int *arr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * num);
  for (int i = 0; i < num; i++)
    scanf("%d", &arr[i]);

  ShellSort(num, arr);

  for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", arr[i]);
  }

  free(arr);

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, global variables are removed, memory leaks are resolved, redundant computations are minimized, and code complexity is reduced. The functionality and output of the original program are preserved.
