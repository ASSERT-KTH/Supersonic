**Code Analysis:**

The given code is implementing Shell Sort, which is a variation of Insertion Sort. The performance of the original Insertion Sort algorithm can be substantially improved by allowing the algorithm to move out-of-place elements more than one position at a time. 

This given code can be optimized for performance by addressing the following issues:

1. **Global Variables:** The code uses global variables (count, temp, temp_temp, h) which can lead to issues like data inconsistency in multi-threaded programs and can make debugging difficult. It would be more efficient and safer to pass these as parameters to functions or make them local to the functions where they are used.

2. **Memory Allocation:** The code uses dynamic memory allocation for the array which is not necessary in this case. The size of the array can be determined at compile time, hence, stack allocation can be used instead of heap allocation.

3. **Unnecessary Computation:** The code unnecessarily computes the sequence h[i + 1] = 3 * h[i] + 1 for i up to 20, even if num is less than h[i]. This computation can be stopped once num is less than h[i].

4. **Redundant Code:** The variable temp_temp is redundant. The value of temp can be used directly.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Avoid Global Variables:** Make the global variables local to the functions where they are used or pass them as parameters.

2. **Memory Allocation:** Use stack allocation for the array instead of dynamic memory allocation.

3. **Avoid Unnecessary Computation:** Stop the computation of the sequence once num is less than h[i].

4. **Remove Redundant Code:** Remove the redundant variable temp_temp and use temp directly.

**Optimized Code:**

Below is the optimized code. The changes are commented in the code.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

void insertionSort(int *, int, int, int *);
void ShellSort(int, int *);

int main(void) {
    int num, arr[100], i, count = 0; // Stack allocation for arr and count made local
    int h[20]; // h made local

    scanf("%d", &num);
    for (i = 0; i < num; i++)
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);

    ShellSort(num, arr);

    printf("%d\n", count);
    for (i = 0; i < num; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", arr[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}

void ShellSort(int num, int *arr) {
    int i, j, n, m, temp = 0; // temp made local
    int h[20]; // h made local

    h[0] = 1;
    for (i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        h[i + 1] = 3 * h[i] + 1;
        if (num < h[i + 1]) { // Avoid unnecessary computation
            temp = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    for (i = temp; i >= 0; i--) {
        insertionSort(arr, num, h[i], &count);
    }
}

void insertionSort(int *arr, int num, int h, int *count) {
    int i, j, v;
    for (i = h; i < num; i++) {
        v = arr[i];
        j = i - h;
        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > v) {
            arr[j + h] = arr[j];
            j = j - h;
            (*count)++;
        }
        arr[j + h] = v;
    }
}
```

The optimized code avoids global variables, reduces unnecessary computation, and removes redundant code. It also uses stack allocation instead of heap allocation for the array. This should improve the performance of the program in terms of both running time and memory usage.
