## Code Analysis
The provided code is an implementation of the Shell Sort algorithm, a generalization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart. The algorithm uses a sequence of gap sizes, each of which is an increment 'h', to sort the array. These increments are calculated using the formula `3*h[i] + 1` and are stored in the array `h[20]`.

A few issues are immediately noticeable:
1. The array `h[20]` is a global variable and is larger than it needs to be for most inputs, wasting memory. 
2. The count variable is global and is used to count the number of comparisons in the insertion sort function.
3. The function insertionSort takes a pointer to an integer as its third argument when it could simply take an integer.
4. The variables `temp` and `temp_temp` are used to store the index of the maximum increment that is less than the size of the input array. These variables are global and could be local to the ShellSort function, and their naming could be improved for clarity.

## Optimization Strategy
1. Turn the global variables into local ones where possible and pass them as arguments to functions if necessary. This will make the code easier to understand and less prone to bugs.
2. Reduce the size of the array `h` to the required size based on the input size. This will save memory.
3. Change the third argument of the insertionSort function from a pointer to an integer. This will simplify the code and remove unnecessary indirection.
4. Improve variable naming for clarity and readability.

## Step-by-Step Explanation
1. First, we will remove the global variables `temp`, `temp_temp`, `count`, and `h`, and make them local to the main function or the ShellSort function as appropriate. We will pass `count` and `h` as arguments to the functions that need them. This will make the code easier to understand and less prone to bugs because it reduces the risk of unintended side effects.
2. Second, we will determine the size of the `h` array based on the input size before allocating it. This will save memory because the array will be only as large as it needs to be.
3. Third, we will change the third argument of the insertionSort function from a pointer to an integer. This will simplify the code and remove unnecessary indirection, potentially improving performance.
4. Fourth, we will rename the variables `temp` and `temp_temp` to `maxIncrementIndex` and `maxIncrement` for clarity.

## Optimized Code Block
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void insertionSort(int *, int, int, int *);
void ShellSort(int, int *);

int main(void) {
  int num, *arr, i, j, count = 0, maxIncrementIndex, maxIncrement;
  int *h;
  
  scanf("%d", &num);
  arr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * num);
  h = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * num);

  for (i = 0; i < num; i++)
    scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
  
  ShellSort(num, arr, h, &maxIncrementIndex, &maxIncrement, &count);
  
  printf("%d\n", maxIncrement + 1);
  for (i = maxIncrementIndex; i != -1; i--)
    i == 0 ? printf("%d\n", h[i]) : printf("%d ", h[i]);
  printf("%d\n", count);
  for (i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", arr[i]);
  }
  
  free(arr);
  free(h);
  
  return 0;
}

void ShellSort(int num, int *arr, int *h, int *maxIncrementIndex, int *maxIncrement, int *count) {
  int i, j, n, m;
  h[0] = 1;
  for (i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    h[i + 1] = 3 * h[i] + 1;
    if (num < h[i + 1]) {
      *maxIncrementIndex = i;
      *maxIncrement = h[i];
      break;
    }
  }
  for (i = *maxIncrementIndex; i != -1; i--) {
    insertionSort(arr, num, h[i], count);
  }
}

void insertionSort(int *arr, int num, int h, int *count) {
  int i, j, v;
  for (i = h; i < num; i++) {
    v = arr[i];
    j = i - h;
    while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > v) {
      arr[j + h] = arr[j];
      j = j - h;
      (*count)++;
    }
    arr[j + h] = v;
  }
}
