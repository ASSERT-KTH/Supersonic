1. Code Analysis

The given code is implementing a ternary search algorithm to find the minimum of an unimodal function. The `calc` function calculates a cost based on the input values and the program tries to find the minimum cost by adjusting the input in a ternary search manner. 

This code seems to be well-structured, and there are no apparent memory leaks. The main performance bottleneck in the code is the `calc` function, which is called multiple times throughout the program. Inside this function, there is a loop that iterates over all elements of four arrays (vw, pf, vf, and th). Thus, any optimization to this function or its usage will have a significant impact on the overall performance of the program.

2. Optimization Strategy

We can consider the following strategies for optimization:

A. Loop Unrolling: The loop inside the `calc` function can be manually unrolled to a certain extent to reduce the overhead of loop control and enhance instruction-level parallelism.

B. Memory Access Optimization: Right now, the access to the arrays vw, pf, vf, and th are not contiguous, which is not cache-friendly. We can change the arrays to an array of structures to make memory access more contiguous.

C. Compiler Optimization: We can use compiler optimization flags like -O3 during compilation to enhance the performance of the program.

D. Reduce Function Calls: Currently, the `calc` function is called an extra time after the ternary search. We can store the result of the last `calc` function call during the ternary search and use that instead of calling the function again.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation

A. Loop Unrolling: Loop unrolling is a technique that helps the CPU to execute instructions in parallel and reduce the overhead of loop control, thus improving the performance. We can unroll the loop in the `calc` function to a certain extent. However, this might increase the code size and complexity.

B. Memory Access Optimization: Accessing elements in an array in a non-contiguous manner can lead to cache misses, which can slow down the program. We can change the arrays to an array of structures, where each structure contains one element from each array. This will make the memory access more contiguous and cache-friendly, thus improving performance.

C. Compiler Optimization: We can use compiler optimization flags like -O3 during compilation, which enables all optimization flags including those that can increase performance.

D. Reduce Function Calls: The `calc` function is called one extra time after the ternary search. We can store the result of the last `calc` function call during the ternary search and use that instead of calling the function again. This will reduce the computation time by eliminating an unnecessary function call.

4. Optimized Code Block:

The optimized code block is as follows. The changes made are minimal and preserve the functionality of the original code. The code is also well-commented to highlight the changes made.

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long LL;
typedef pair<int, int> PII;
typedef double flt;
const int MAXN = 100000 + 10;
const flt eps = 1e-7;

// Change the arrays to an array of structures
struct Node {
  int vw;
  int pf;
  int vf;
  int th;
} node[MAXN];

int N, pw;

// Function to calculate cost
flt calc(flt W, flt &cost) {
  cost = W * pw;

  // Loop unrolling
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i += 4) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 4 && i + j < N; ++j) {
      flt need = node[i+j].th - W * node[i+j].vw;
      if (need <= 0)
        continue;
      flt f = need / node[i+j].vf;
      cost += f * node[i+j].pf;
    }
  }

  return cost;
}

int main() {
  while (scanf("%d", &N) == 1 && N) {
    scanf("%d", &pw);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      scanf("%d%d%d%d", &node[i].vw, &node[i].pf, &node[i].vf, &node[i].th);
    }

    flt left = 0, right = INT_MAX;
    flt lastC1, lastC2;
    for (int _ = 0; _ < 200; ++_) {
      flt m1 = (left + left + right) / 3.0;
      flt m2 = (left + right + right) / 3.0;
      flt c1 = calc(m1, lastC1), c2 = calc(m2, lastC2);
      if (c1 < c2)
        right = m2;
      else
        left = m1;
    }

    // Use the stored result of the last calc function call
    printf("%.10f\n", min(lastC1, lastC2));
  }

  return 0;
}
