Code Analysis:

The given code seems to implement a ternary search algorithm to find the minimum cost calculated by the `calc` function. The `calc` function computes the cost based on some input parameters and a given weight 'W'. The performance bottleneck in this code is mainly the repetitive calculation of the cost value inside the loop of the ternary search algorithm.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Memoization: The `calc` function is called multiple times with the same arguments. We can optimize this by storing the results of previous calls and reusing them when needed, instead of recalculating them. This technique is known as memoization. 

2. Efficient Data Structures: Arrays are used in this code. While they are efficient for access (O(1)), there might be alternative data structures (like std::vector) which can provide more flexibility and safety (like bounds checking). However, in this case, arrays seem to be optimal choice considering the nature of the problem.

3. Compiler Optimizations: We can hint the compiler to perform certain optimizations using flags like '-O2' or '-O3' that perform multiple passes over the code to optimize it. 

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Memoization: To implement memoization, we will need to create a hash table to store the previously calculated values of the `calc` function. Before performing the calculation, we will check if the result for the given 'W' is already available in the table. If it is, we will use it directly. If not, we will calculate the value and store it in the table for future use.

Trade-off: The optimization of memoization can significantly speed up the execution time because it avoids repetitive calculations. However, it might increase the memory usage because the results need to be stored for future use.

Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long LL;
typedef pair<int, int> PII;
typedef double flt;
const int MAXN = 100000 + 10;
const flt eps = 1e-7;
int vw[MAXN], pf[MAXN], vf[MAXN], th[MAXN];
int N, pw;
unordered_map<flt, flt> costCache; // Hash table for memoization
flt calc(flt W) {
  // Check if the cost for this W is already calculated
  if (costCache.find(W) != costCache.end()) {
    return costCache[W];
  }
  flt cost = W * pw;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    flt need = th[i] - W * vw[i];
    if (need <= 0)
      continue;
    flt f = need / vf[i];
    cost += f * pf[i];
  }
  // Save the calculated cost in the cache
  costCache[W] = cost;
  return cost;
}
int main() {
  while (scanf("%d", &N) == 1 && N) {
    scanf("%d", &pw);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      scanf("%d%d%d%d", vw + i, pf + i, vf + i, th + i);
    }
    flt left = 0, right = INT_MAX;
    for (int _ = 0; _ < 200; ++_) {
      flt m1 = (left + left + right) / 3.0;
      flt m2 = (left + right + right) / 3.0;
      flt c1 = calc(m1), c2 = calc(m2);
      if (c1 < c2)
        right = m2;
      else
        left = m1;
    }
    printf("%.10f\n", calc(left));
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should run faster than the original code because it avoids recalculating the cost for the same weight 'W' multiple times. However, the trade-off is that it uses more memory to store the previously calculated cost values.
