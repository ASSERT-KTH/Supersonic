Code Analysis:
The given C++ program appears to be dealing with a numerical optimization problem using the ternary search method. It reads a series of values from the standard input, performs calculations, and then prints a floating-point result. The number of iterations in the ternary search loop is fixed at 200.

Performance bottlenecks:
1. The function 'calc' is called multiple times with the same arguments within the ternary search loop. This redundant computation could be a potential performance bottleneck.
2. The usage of scanf and printf for input and output might slow down the program due to their comparatively high overhead.
3. The program does not make use of any compiler optimization flags which could potentially optimize the running time. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Save the results of the 'calc' function to avoid redundant computations: We can use a technique known as 'memoization', where we store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur.
2. Use faster input/output methods: Instead of scanf and printf, using cin and cout with synchronization turned off may improve performance.
3. Use compiler optimization flags: Many compilers have optimization flags which could potentially speed up the execution time.
4. Ensure adequate use of data structures: The arrays seem appropriate for the task, but we should verify that they are not exceeding their capacity or being resized frequently.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Memoization: We will create a map to store the computed results of the 'calc' function. Before performing the calculation, we will check if the result for the current input is already stored in the map. If it is, we will reuse the result instead of recalculating it. This will avoid redundant computations and enhance the performance. The trade-off is that it will increase the memory usage slightly due to the storage of previous results, but the performance gain outweighs this trade-off in most cases.
2. Faster input/output methods: We will replace scanf and printf with cin and cout, and turn off synchronization with the C standard libraries. This will make the input/output operations faster.
3. Compiler optimization: We will suggest using the '-O2' or '-O3' compiler optimization flags during compilation, which instructs the compiler to optimize the code for faster execution.
4. Adequate use of data structures: The arrays are used properly in this code, so no changes are necessary in this regard.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long LL;
typedef pair<int, int> PII;
typedef double flt;
const int MAXN = 100000 + 10;
const flt eps = 1e-7;
int vw[MAXN], pf[MAXN], vf[MAXN], th[MAXN];
unordered_map<flt, flt> memo;
int N, pw;

flt calc(flt W) {
  if (memo.count(W)) return memo[W];
  
  flt cost = W * pw;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    flt need = th[i] - W * vw[i];
    if (need <= 0)
      continue;
    flt f = need / vf[i];
    cost += f * pf[i];
  }
  
  memo[W] = cost;
  return cost;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); // Make input/output faster
  
  while (cin >> N && N) {
    cin >> pw;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      cin >> vw[i] >> pf[i] >> vf[i] >> th[i];
    }
    flt left = 0, right = INT_MAX;
    for (int _ = 0; _ < 200; ++_) {
      flt m1 = (left + left + right) / 3.0;
      flt m2 = (left + right + right) / 3.0;
      flt c1 = calc(m1), c2 = calc(m2);
      if (c1 < c2)
        right = m2;
      else
        left = m1;
    }
    cout << fixed << setprecision(10) << calc(left) << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: Remember to compile with optimization flags '-O2' or '-O3' for better performance.
