1. Code Analysis:
The given code appears to be a ternary search algorithm used to find the minimum value of a convex function. This function, f(), computes a cost based on a value W and a set of parameters (vw[i], pf[i], vf[i], th[i]). The main loop performs the search by successively narrowing the search space (l, r) based on the function's responses to two probe values (m1, m2). The overall performance of the code depends on the number of iterations (200 in this case) and the number of elements (n), which determines the complexity of the f() function.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    A. Inefficient Data Structures: The current data structures (arrays) are simple and efficient for this purpose, but we can consider using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions to perform the calculations in the f() function in parallel.
    B. Redundant Computations: The multiplication W * vw[i] can be computed once and reused.
    C. Loop Optimizations: The main loop does not seem to benefit from unrolling, but the loop in the f() function could be optimized through vectorization.
    D. Compiler Optimizations: The use of pragmas or specific compiler flags could improve the performance. For instance, enabling the fast math mode could speed up the floating point operations.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. SIMD: The modern CPUs have SIMD instructions (like SSE, AVX in x86 architecture) that can perform the same operation on multiple data simultaneously. For instance, instead of multiplying each pair of elements, W and vw[i], in a loop, we could load the vw array into a SIMD register and multiply it by W in one operation. This could significantly improve the performance if the number of elements is large. However, this would also require the arrays to be properly aligned in memory, which could increase the memory usage slightly.
    2. Redundant Computations: The product W * vw[i] is computed twice in the loop within the f() function. We can store this value in a variable and reuse it, reducing the number of multiplications.
    3. Vectorization: The loop inside the f() function could be vectorized using the #pragma omp simd directive, which instructs the compiler to generate SIMD instructions for the loop. This could further improve the performance by allowing the CPU to perform the computations in parallel.
    4. Fast Math: The fast math mode enables certain approximations and optimizations for floating point operations, which could speed up the computations. However, this could also affect the accuracy of the results, so it should be used with caution.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define MAX 100001
#define inf 1e9
using namespace std;

int n, pw;
double vw[MAX], pf[MAX], vf[MAX], th[MAX];

double f(double W) {
  double cost = W * pw;
  #pragma omp simd
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    double Wvw = W * vw[i];
    if (Wvw > th[i])
      continue;
    double sum1 = th[i] - Wvw;
    double sum2 = sum1 / vf[i];
    cost += sum2 * pf[i];
  }
  return cost;
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    cin >> n >> pw;
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> vw[i] >> pf[i] >> vf[i] >> th[i];
    double l = 0, r = inf;
    for (int i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
      double m1 = (l * 2.0 + r) / 3.0;
      double m2 = (l + r * 2.0) / 3.0;
      double res1 = f(m1);
      double res2 = f(m2);
      if (res1 < res2)
        r = m2;
      else
        l = m1;
    }
    printf("%.4f\n", f(l));
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The effectiveness of these optimizations depend on the hardware and compiler used. In particular, SIMD instructions are hardware-dependent, and the OpenMP simd directive requires a compiler that supports OpenMP 4.0 or later. The fast math mode can be enabled by passing the -ffast-math flag to the GCC compiler.
