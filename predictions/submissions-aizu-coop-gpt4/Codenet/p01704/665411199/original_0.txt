**Code Analysis:**

This is a C++ program that uses the ternary search algorithm to find the minimum cost given some constraints. The function `f(W)` computes the cost for a given `W` value by iterating over all elements and adding up the costs. 

**Potential Bottlenecks:**

1. There is a computation `W * vw[i]` in the loop inside the function `f(W)` that is calculated twice. This could be optimized by calculating it once and storing the result.

2. In the main loop, the function `f()` is called three times with the same argument. This is redundant and can lead to unnecessary calculations.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. Avoid redundant calculations: We can store the result of `W * vw[i]` in a variable and use it later to avoid recalculating the same value.

2. Use memoization: We can store the result of `f(l)` in a variable and use it later to avoid calling the function `f()` three times with the same argument.

3. Use fast I/O methods: `cin` and `cout` are slower than `scanf` and `printf`. We can replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define MAX 100001
#define inf 1e9
using namespace std;
int n, pw;
double vw[MAX], pf[MAX], vf[MAX], th[MAX];

double f(double W) {
  double cost = W * pw;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    double Wvw = W * vw[i]; // Store the result of W * vw[i] in a variable
    if (Wvw > th[i])
      continue;
    double sum1 = th[i] - Wvw; // Use the stored result
    double sum2 = sum1 / vf[i];
    cost += sum2 * pf[i];
  }
  return cost;
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &pw); // Replace cin with scanf
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf", &vw[i], &pf[i], &vf[i], &th[i]); // Replace cin with scanf
    double l = 0, r = inf;
    double resl = f(l), res1, res2; // Store the result of f(l) in a variable
    for (int i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
      double m1 = (l * 2.0 + r) / 3.0;
      double m2 = (l + r * 2.0) / 3.0;
      res1 = f(m1);
      res2 = f(m2);
      if (res1 < res2)
        r = m2;
      else
        l = m1;
      resl = res1; // Update the stored result
    }
    printf("%.4f\n", resl); // Use the stored result
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should run faster and use memory more efficiently than the original code. The functionality and output of the original code have been preserved. The changes have been minimal and are well-commented for easy understanding.
