Code Analysis:

This C++ program appears to implement a ternary search algorithm to minimize a cost function `f`. The function `f` computes the cost of a given weight `W`, using a set of parameters provided as input. The main performance bottlenecks in this code are:

1. Redundant Computations: In the function `f`, the expression `W * vw[i]` is computed twice, once for comparison with `th[i]` and once to calculate `sum1`.

2. Inefficient Use of Data Structures: The program uses arrays to store input parameters. Although arrays are efficient for accessing elements, they are not suitable for dynamic data handling.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Eliminate Redundant Computations: Calculate `W * vw[i]` once and store the result in a variable for future use.

2. Efficient Use of Data Structures: Use vector instead of arrays. Vectors in C++ are dynamic arrays with more functionality, like automatic handling of its storage capacity when elements are inserted or deleted.

3. Compiler Optimization: Use `-O2` or `-O3` flags during compilation to enable compiler level optimization which can help in further optimizing the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Eliminate Redundant Computations: In the function `f`, `W * vw[i]` is calculated twice. This is an unnecessary computation which can be avoided by storing the result in a variable and using it for the next calculations. This change will reduce the computation time.

2. Efficient Use of Data Structures: The code uses arrays to store the input parameters. A vector can be a better option as it can handle dynamic data and it also has inbuilt functions which can make the code cleaner and easier to read.

3. Compiler Optimization: Using compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` can allow the compiler to make optimizations on the code. These optimizations include function inlining, loop unrolling, and other optimizations that can significantly improve the performance of the code.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define MAX 100001
#define inf 1e9
using namespace std;
int n, pw;
vector<double> vw(MAX), pf(MAX), vf(MAX), th(MAX);

double f(double W) {
  double cost = W * pw;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    double W_vw = W * vw[i];
    if (W_vw > th[i])
      continue;
    double sum1 = th[i] - W_vw;
    double sum2 = sum1 / vf[i];
    cost += sum2 * pf[i];
  }
  return cost;
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    cin >> n >> pw;
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> vw[i] >> pf[i] >> vf[i] >> th[i];
    double l = 0, r = inf;
    for (int i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
      double m1 = (l * 2.0 + r) / 3.0;
      double m2 = (l + r * 2.0) / 3.0;
      double res1 = f(m1);
      double res2 = f(m2);
      if (res1 < res2)
        r = m2;
      else
        l = m1;
    }
    printf("%.4f\n", f(l));
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that even though arrays were replaced with vectors, the memory usage remains the same because the size of the vectors is predefined. However, vectors provide greater flexibility for future modifications and improvements in the code.
