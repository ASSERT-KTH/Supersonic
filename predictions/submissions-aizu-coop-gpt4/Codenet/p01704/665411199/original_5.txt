The provided code is a C++ program that reads an array of data and calculates a cost using ternary search. The cost calculation is performed using a function `f()`, which is repeatedly called within the main loop.

Let's break down the optimization process:

1. Code Analysis:
   - The most computation-intensive part of this code is the `f()` function which is called multiple times within a loop.
   - `f()` itself contains a loop which iterates `n` times.
   - Thus, the overall complexity is about O(200 * n), assuming 200 iterations for the ternary search.
   - Memory usage is O(n) for the arrays vw, pf, vf, and th.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Optimize the `f()` function: Precompute the product `W * vw[i]` once instead of twice inside the loop.
   - Avoid using `#define` for constants. Using `const` is a better practice in C++ as it provides type safety.
   - Use `std::vector` instead of raw arrays for better memory management and safety.
   - Use `std::cout` instead of `printf` for uniformity in the code (since `std::cin` is being used).
   - Use `std::fixed` and `std::setprecision` for output formatting instead of `printf`.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   - Pre-computing `W * vw[i]` once at the beginning of the loop in `f()` function avoids redundant computation, thus improving the running time.
   - Using `const` instead of `#define` makes the code safer as `const` variables are type-checked by the compiler.
   - Using `std::vector` instead of raw arrays allows for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, which could potentially reduce memory usage.
   - Uniform usage of standard stream objects (`std::cin` and `std::cout`) makes the code more readable and consistent.
   - `std::fixed` and `std::setprecision` provide a more C++-ish way to control the precision of floating-point output.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
const int MAX = 100001;
const double inf = 1e9;
using namespace std;

int n, pw;
vector<double> vw(MAX), pf(MAX), vf(MAX), th(MAX);

double f(double W) {
  double cost = W * pw;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    double W_vw = W * vw[i];
    if (W_vw > th[i])
      continue;
    double sum1 = th[i] - W_vw;
    double sum2 = sum1 / vf[i];
    cost += sum2 * pf[i];
  }
  return cost;
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    cin >> n >> pw;
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> vw[i] >> pf[i] >> vf[i] >> th[i];
    double l = 0, r = inf;
    for (int i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
      double m1 = (l * 2.0 + r) / 3.0;
      double m2 = (l + r * 2.0) / 3.0;
      double res1 = f(m1);
      double res2 = f(m2);
      if (res1 < res2)
        r = m2;
      else
        l = m1;
    }
    cout << fixed << setprecision(4) << f(l) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code block maintains the original functionality while improving performance and readability. It also follows better C++ practices by using `std::vector` and `const` variables.
