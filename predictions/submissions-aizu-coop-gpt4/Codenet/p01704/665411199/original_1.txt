First, let's analyze the code:

The code is a C++ program that uses Ternary Search to find the minimum value of a function `f`. The function `f` calculates a cost based on a weight `W` and several other parameters (vw, pf, vf, th). 

Optimization strategy:

1. **Avoid redundant computations:** The calculation `W * vw[i]` is performed twice for some iterations in the function `f`. We can calculate it once and store it in a variable.

2. **Efficient I/O operations:** `cin` and `cout` are slower compared to scanf and printf. If the input-output operations are large, it can slow down the program. We can use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up cin and cout. However, in this case, the I/O operations are not significant, hence we will stick with scanf and printf for faster operations.

3. **Efficient use of memory:** The use of the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header is discouraged as it includes all standard libraries, which can increase the compilation time. It's better to include only the libraries we need.

4. **Compiler optimizations:** We can suggest using compiler optimization flags such as `-O2` or `-O3` during compilation to optimize the code further.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio> // for printf and scanf
#include <cmath>  // for INFINITY
#define MAX 100001

int n, pw;
double vw[MAX], pf[MAX], vf[MAX], th[MAX];

double f(double W) {
  double cost = W * pw;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    double Wvw = W * vw[i]; // Compute it once
    if (Wvw > th[i])
      continue;
    double sum1 = th[i] - Wvw;
    double sum2 = sum1 / vf[i];
    cost += sum2 * pf[i];
  }
  return cost;
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &pw); // Use scanf instead of cin
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf", &vw[i], &pf[i], &vf[i], &th[i]); // Use scanf instead of cin
    double l = 0, r = INFINITY; // Use INFINITY from cmath
    for (int i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
      double m1 = (l * 2.0 + r) / 3.0;
      double m2 = (l + r * 2.0) / 3.0;
      double res1 = f(m1);
      double res2 = f(m2);
      if (res1 < res2)
        r = m2;
      else
        l = m1;
    }
    printf("%.4f\n", f(l));
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Remember to compile with optimization flags (`-O2`, `-O3`). These flags instruct the compiler to perform further optimizations that may include function inlining, loop unrolling, and more.
