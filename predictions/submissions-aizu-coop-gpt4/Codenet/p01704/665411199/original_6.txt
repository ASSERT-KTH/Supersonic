1. Code Analysis:

The given program uses an algorithm for solving a minimum cost optimization problem. It uses a ternary search to find the minimum cost. The function `f(W)` computes the cost for a given W and is called multiple times in the ternary search loop. The main potential performance bottlenecks are:

- Repeated computation: The function `f(W)` is called multiple times with the same argument which leads to repeated computation.
- Use of `double` instead of `float`: Using `double` instead of `float` may lead to extra memory usage if the extra precision is not needed.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    1. Memoization: To avoid repeated computation, we can use memoization - a technique where we store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again.
    2. Use of `float` instead of `double`: If the extra precision provided by `double` is not necessary, we can use `float` instead to save memory.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    1. Memoization: Whenever `f(W)` is called, we first check if its result has already been computed and stored. If it is, we simply return the stored result, avoiding the computation. If it's not, we perform the computation and store the result before returning it.
    2. Use of `float` instead of `double`: We simply replace all `double` types with `float`. This will use less memory at the expense of precision.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define MAX 100001
#define inf 1e9
using namespace std;
int n, pw;
float vw[MAX], pf[MAX], vf[MAX], th[MAX];
unordered_map<float, float> memo;

float f(float W) {
  if (memo.count(W)) return memo[W];  // check if result for W has been computed
  float cost = W * pw;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (W * vw[i] > th[i])
      continue;
    float sum1 = th[i] - W * vw[i];
    float sum2 = sum1 / vf[i];
    cost += sum2 * pf[i];
  }
  memo[W] = cost;  // store the computed result for W
  return cost;
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    cin >> n >> pw;
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> vw[i] >> pf[i] >> vf[i] >> th[i];
    float l = 0, r = inf;
    for (int i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
      float m1 = (l * 2.0f + r) / 3.0f;
      float m2 = (l + r * 2.0f) / 3.0f;
      float res1 = f(m1);
      float res2 = f(m2);
      if (res1 < res2)
        r = m2;
      else
        l = m1;
    }
    printf("%.4f\n", f(l));
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, the function `f(W)` is memoized to avoid repeated computation, and `float` is used instead of `double` to save memory. However, memoization can lead to increased memory usage and using `float` instead of `double` can lead to loss of precision.
