The provided code seems to be solving the problem of finding the minimum spanning tree between a set of weighted nodes. It's using Kruskalâ€™s algorithm to find this minimum spanning tree. However, there are a few areas where the code can be optimized in terms of memory usage and performance:

1. Code Analysis:
    - The code is using `vector<vector<double>>` to store the nodes, which is expensive both in terms of memory usage and access time.
    - The code is computing the distance between each pair of nodes multiple times, which is inefficient.
    - The `unite` function is called even when it's not necessary, which can slow down the execution.
    - The program uses a lot of global variables which can be encapsulated inside a class or struct to improve readability and maintainability.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Use a struct/class to encapsulate the node properties instead of `vector<vector<double>>`. This could be more efficient in terms of memory usage and access time.
    2. Precompute the distance between each pair of nodes and store it in a separate data structure, so that it can be accessed in constant time when needed.
    3. Call the `unite` function only when the distance between two nodes is greater than zero.
    4. Encapsulate the global variables inside a class or struct. This can make the code more readable and easier to maintain.

3. Step-by-step Explanation:
    1. Instead of using a `vector<vector<double>>` to store the nodes, we can define a struct or class `Node` that encapsulates the properties of a node. This can lead to better memory usage and faster access time, as accessing properties of a struct/class is generally faster than accessing elements of a vector.
    2. We can precompute the distance between each pair of nodes and store it in a data structure like a `vector<pair<int, pair<int, double>>>`. The first element of the pair is the distance, and the second element is a pair of the indices of the two nodes. This way, we can access the distance in constant time when needed, rather than computing it every time.
    3. We should call the `unite` function only when the distance between two nodes is greater than zero. This can avoid unnecessary calls to the `unite` function, speeding up the execution.
    4. We can encapsulate the global variables inside a class or struct. This can make the code more readable and easier to maintain. 

Now let's implement these optimizations in the code.
