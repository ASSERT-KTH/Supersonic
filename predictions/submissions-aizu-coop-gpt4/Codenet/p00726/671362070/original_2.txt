This program reads a string and a number from input until "0" and "0" are entered. It appears to recursively expand the string based on the integer values in the string and the global variable 'n'. It seems to be attempting to find the nth character after all expansions are completed.

Here are the points of optimization:

1. Code Analysis:

   - Recursive calls to expand function.
   - String slicing operation str.substr(s, e) in every recursive call.
   - String size() method called multiple times.
   - atoi() function call on every digit.

2. Optimization Strategy:

   - Pass the string as constant reference rather than by value to avoid creation of copy.
   - Replace atoi() with manual conversion to avoid costly function calls.
   - Store the size of the string to a variable instead of calling size() method multiple times.
   - Reduce recursive calls by using a loop where possible.
   - Instead of slicing the string, pass the start and end indices.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   1. Recursion Vs Iteration: The expand() function is called recursively. Generally, recursion consumes more memory than iteration as it needs to store the state of all recursive calls. We can convert recursion to iteration where possible.
   2. Avoiding string slicing: String slicing (str.substr(s, e)) is a costly operation as it creates a new string. Instead of slicing, we can pass starting and ending indices to the function.
   3. Replacing atoi() with manual conversion: The atoi() function is used to convert string to integer. We can replace this with a manual conversion which loops through the string and converts it to integer. This would reduce the overhead of function call.
   4. Reducing size() calls: The size() function is called multiple times. We can store the size in a variable once and use this variable instead.
   5. Passing string by reference: The string str is passed as value to expand() function which creates a copy of the string in every function call. We can pass it by reference to avoid creation of copy.

4. Optimized Code Block:

   Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int cket(const std::string &str, int i) {
    int n = 1;
    int size = str.size();
    while (i < size) {
        if (str[i] == '(') ++n;
        if (str[i] == ')') --n;
        if (n == 0) break;
        ++i;
    }
    return i;
}

int n;

char expand(const std::string &str, int s, int e) {
    int size = e;
    for (int i = s; i < size; ++i) {
        if (isdigit(str[i])) {
            int j = 1;
            while (isdigit(str[i + j])) ++j;
            int num = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < j; ++k) {
                num = num * 10 + (str[i + k] - '0');
            }
            if (str[i + j] == '(') {
                int k = cket(str, i + j + 1);
                i = expand(str, i + j + 1, k);
            } else {
                i += j;
                for (int l = 0; l < num; ++l) {
                    if (n == 0) {
                        return str[i];
                    }
                    --n;
                }
            }
        } else {
            if (n == 0) {
                return str[i];
            }
            --n;
        }
    }
    return '0';
}

int main() {
    while (true) {
        std::string str;
        int size;
        std::cin >> str >> n;
        if (str == "0" && n == 0)
            break;
        size = str.size();
        std::cout << expand(str, 0, size) << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code does the same thing as the previous code but with better efficiency and less memory consumption. The trade-off is that it is slightly more complex than the previous version due to the manual conversion of string to integer and handling of string indices manually. However, the performance gain outweighs the slight increase in complexity.
