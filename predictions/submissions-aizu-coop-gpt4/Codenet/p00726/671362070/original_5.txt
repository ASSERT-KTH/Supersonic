Firstly, let's analyze the provided code to understand its functionality and identify potential areas for optimization.

The program seems to read an encoded string and an integer from standard input. The encoding appears to be a run-length encoding with nested encodings possible. It then expands the encoding and outputs the nth character in the expanded string. If the expanded string has fewer than n characters, it outputs '0'. The encoding expansion is done recursively.

Here are some areas of potential optimization:

1. The code calls `std::atoi(str.substr(i, j).c_str());` to convert a substring into a number. This is inefficient because it creates a temporary substring and then another temporary C-style string. 

2. The code also calls `expand(str.substr(s, e));` recursively, which creates a new temporary string each time. 

3. The `cket` function is used to find the matching closed parenthesis for a given open parenthesis, which is done in linear time.

4. The code uses the variable `n` both as a global variable and as a local variable in `main()`. This is not a performance issue, but it can lead to bugs and code that is difficult to understand and maintain.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the conversion of substrings to integers with a function that directly converts a portion of the string to an integer without creating temporary strings.

2. Replace the recursive call to `expand()` with an iterative approach to avoid creating temporary strings.

3. Use a stack to match parentheses in constant time.

4. Eliminate the global variable `n` and pass it as a parameter where necessary.

Now let's implement these optimizations in the code. Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <stack>

int str_to_int(const std::string &str, int start, int length) {
  int result = 0;
  for (int i = start; i < start + length; ++i) {
    result = result * 10 + (str[i] - '0');
  }
  return result;
}

char expand(const std::string &str, int &n, std::stack<int> &brackets) {
  for (int i = 0; i < str.size(); ++i) {
    if (isdigit(str[i])) {
      int j = 1;
      while (isdigit(str[i + j]))
        j++;
      int num = str_to_int(str, i, j);

      if (str[i + j] == '(') {
        brackets.push(i + j);
        i += j;
      } else {
        for (int l = 0; l < num; ++l) {
          if (n == 0) {
            return str[i + j];
          }
          n--;
        }
        i += j;
      }
    } else if (str[i] == ')') {
      if (!brackets.empty()) {
        int start = brackets.top();
        brackets.pop();
        i = start;
      }
    } else {
      if (n == 0) {
        return str[i];
      }
      n--;
    }
  }
  return '0';
}

int main(void) {
  while (true) {
    std::string str;
    int n;
    std::cin >> str >> n;
    if (str == "0" && n == 0)
      break;
    std::stack<int> brackets;
    std::cout << expand(str, n, brackets) << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this code, `str_to_int` function is used to directly convert a portion of a string into an integer, without creating temporary strings. The recursion in the `expand` function is replaced by an iterative approach, using a stack to remember the start of each bracketed section. The global variable `n` is eliminated, and it is instead passed as a parameter to the `expand` function.
