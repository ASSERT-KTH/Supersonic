The given code appears to be a parser for a simple domain-specific language. The `expand` function is a recursive function which processes input strings, expanding based on the number preceding a character or a set of characters enclosed in brackets.

This code can be optimized in several ways:

1. Avoid unnecessary string copies: The `expand` function currently takes a `std::string` by value, which means a copy is created every time the function is called. Since the input string can potentially be large, this can significantly slow down the program and use excessive memory. We should change this to pass by reference instead.
2. Avoid unnecessary string substrings: The `expand` function is also creating substrings for recursive calls and conversion to integer. This can be avoided by passing the start and end index along with the original string.
3. Avoid computing string size in each iteration: The size of the string is constant and doesn't need to be computed in each loop iteration.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int cket(const std::string &str, int i) {
    int n = 1;
    for (; i < str.size(); ++i) {
        if (str[i] == '(')
            n++;
        if (str[i] == ')')
            n--;
        if (n == 0)
            break;
    }
    return i;
}

int expand(const std::string &str, int s, int e, int &n) {
    for (int i = s; i < e; ++i) {
        if (isdigit(str[i])) {
            int num = 0;
            while (isdigit(str[i])) {
                num = num * 10 + (str[i] - '0');
                i++;
            }
            int s1, e1;
            if (str[i] == '(') {
                int k = cket(str, i + 1);
                s1 = i + 1;
                e1 = k;
                i = k;
            } else {
                s1 = i;
                e1 = i + 1;
            }
            for (int l = 0; l < num; ++l) {
                char a = expand(str, s1, e1, n);
                if (a != '0')
                    return a;
            }
        } else {
            if (n == 0) {
                return str[i];
            }
            n--;
        }
    }
    return '0';
}

int main(void) {
    while (true) {
        std::string str;
        int n;
        std::cin >> str >> n;
        if (str == "0" && n == 0)
            break;
        std::cout << expand(str, 0, str.size(), n) << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This version of the code avoids unnecessary string copies and substrings, thus improving the performance and reducing the memory usage.
