The provided code appears to be a recursive function that expands a string based on numbers and brackets. In the process, it aims to find the nth character in the expanded string. However, there are several efficiency issues with this code that can be optimized.

1. **Code Analysis**:

    - The function `expand()` is called recursively, which can be expensive, especially for large inputs.
    - Inefficient use of strings. The use of `str.substr()` to generate substrings is inefficient as it creates a new string every time.
    - The function `cket()` scans the string to find matching brackets, which is done in a linear scan manner. This could be optimized.
    - The string `str` is passed by value to the `expand()` function, which results in a copy of the string being created each time the function is called.

2. **Optimization Strategy**:

    - Avoid the use of `str.substr()`, instead use pointer or reference to the original string.
    - Reduce the number of string scans. The `expand()` function currently scans the string twice, once in the function itself and once in the `cket()` function. This can be optimized to a single scan.
    - Use a stack-based approach instead of recursion for processing the string.
    - Use pass-by-reference for the string to avoid unnecessary copies.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:

    - **Change string passing by value to reference**: This avoids unnecessary string copy each time the function is called. This reduces memory usage and improves performance because copying a string is an O(n) operation where n is the string's size.
    - **Avoid use of `str.substr()`**: Each use of `str.substr()` creates a new string, which is inefficient. Instead, we can pass the indexes to the original string to the recursive function.
    - **Reduce the number of string scans**: Instead of scanning the string twice (in `expand()` and `cket()`), we can find matching brackets in a single scan.
    - **Use a stack-based approach**: Instead of recursion, we can use a stack-based approach to process the string. This avoids the overhead of function call stack and can improve performance.

4. **Optimized Code Block**:

    ```cpp
    #include <cstdlib>
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>
    #include <stack>

    int expand(const std::string &str, int &i, int n) {
        for (; i < str.size() && n > 0; ++i) {
            if (isdigit(str[i])) {
                int num = 0;
                while (isdigit(str[i])) {
                    num = num * 10 + (str[i] - '0');
                    ++i;
                }

                if (str[i] == '(') {
                    int j = i;
                    std::stack<char> stk;
                    do {
                        if (str[j] == '(') {
                            stk.push('(');
                        } else if (str[j] == ')') {
                            stk.pop();
                        }
                        ++j;
                    } while (!stk.empty());

                    while (num-- > 0 && n > 0) {
                        n = expand(str, i, n);
                        if (n == 0) {
                            return str[i];
                        }
                    }
                    i = j;
                } else {
                    n -= num;
                    if (n <= 0) {
                        return str[i];
                    }
                }
            } else {
                --n;
                if (n == 0) {
                    return str[i];
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    int main(void) {
        while (true) {
            std::string str;
            int n;
            std::cin >> str >> n;
            if (str == "0" && n == 0)
                break;
            int i = 0;
            char res = expand(str, i, n);
            if (res != -1) {
                std::cout << res << std::endl;
            } else {
                std::cout << "0" << std::endl;
            }
        }
        return 0;
