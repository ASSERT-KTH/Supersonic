Code Analysis:
1. The dfs function parses the string and builds another string based on the rules defined in the function. It uses string concatenation heavily, which can be a performance bottleneck because every concatenation requires the allocation of a new string and the copying of the contents of the old strings. 

2. The function also calls substr method in a loop, which creates a lot of temporary strings and can be expensive in terms of memory usage. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace string concatenation with a more efficient data structure for building strings, such as stringstream or a custom resizable array of characters (similar to StringBuilder in Java).

2. Avoid creating unnecessary temporary strings, for example by replacing substr with a version of dfs that works with indices instead of substrings. 

3. Use a lookup table to check if a character is a digit instead of comparing it with '0' and '9'. This can improve performance because table lookups are generally faster than comparisons. 

4. Use compiler optimizations such as -O2 or -O3 to enable various performance optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining and constant propagation. 

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replacing string concatenation with stringstream: Stringstream provides a more efficient way to build strings than concatenation. It avoids the overhead of memory allocation and copying associated with concatenation. 

2. Avoid creating unnecessary temporary strings: The substr method creates a new string, which can be expensive in terms of memory usage. Instead, we can modify dfs to work with indices, so that it operates directly on the original string instead of creating new strings. 

3. Using a lookup table to check if a character is a digit: This optimization improves performance by replacing comparisons with table lookups, which are generally faster. 

4. Using compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations such as -O2 or -O3 can enable various performance optimizations that can significantly improve the performance of the code. 

Trade-offs: The main trade-off with these optimizations is increased code complexity. For example, working with indices instead of substrings can make the code harder to understand. However, the performance gain can be significant, especially for large inputs. 

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Lookup table to check if a character is a digit
bool isDigit[256];
for (int i = '0'; i <= '9'; i++) isDigit[i] = true;

int N;
string dfs(const string& s, int& i) {
  stringstream r;
  long long n = -1;
  for (; i < s.size();) {
    if (isDigit[s[i]]) {
      n = (n < 0 ? 0 : n * 10) + s[i] - '0';
      i++;
    } else if (s[i] == '(') {
      n = (n < 0 ? 1 : n);
      int cnt = 1, j = i + 1;
      for (; cnt;) {
        if (s[j] == '(')
          cnt++;
        else if (s[j] == ')')
          cnt--;
        j++;
      }
      int k = i + 1;
      string r0 = dfs(s, k);
      for (int _ = 0; _ < n; _++) {
        r << r0;
        if (r.str().size() > N)
          return r.str();
      }
      n = -1;
      i = j;
    } else {
      n = (n < 0 ? 1 : n);
      r << string(n, s[i]);
      n = -1;
      i++;
    }
  }
  return r.str();
}

int main() {
  for (;;) {
    string s;
    cin >> s >> N;
    if (s == "0")
      break;
    int i = 0;
    string r = dfs(s, i);
    printf("%c\n", r.size() > N ? r[N] : '0');
  }
}
```
Note: The optimized code uses stringstream for building strings, operates directly on the original string instead of creating new strings, uses a lookup table to check if a character is a digit, and has been adjusted to be compatible with compiler optimizations.
