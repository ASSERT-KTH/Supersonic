Code Analysis:

The given C++ code is a recursive program that seems to be performing string parsing and operations. It reads two inputs from the user, a string `s` and an integer `N`. If `s` equals "0", it breaks the loop. It then calls the function `dfs(s)` and prints the character at the `N`th index of the returned string, or '0' if `N` is more than the size of the returned string.

The `dfs` function appears to parse the string `s`, expanding sections of the string based on the numbers and parentheses in `s`. It keeps track of the parsed string in `r` and returns it at the end.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Avoid creating multiple temporary string objects: The code currently creates several temporary string objects, which can be expensive in terms of memory allocation and deallocation. 

2. Avoid unnecessary string concatenation: In the current implementation, the code concatenates the same string multiple times with the `+=` operator. String concatenation can be an expensive operation, especially when done numerous times in a loop. 

3. Avoid using substrings: The `dfs` function is called with a substring of `s`. This operation creates a new string which can add to the processing time. We can instead pass the indices to the function, avoiding the need for substring creation.

Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int N;

string dfs(const string& s, int& i) {
  string r;
  long long n = -1;
  for (; i < s.size();) {
    if ('0' <= s[i] && s[i] <= '9') {
      if (n < 0)
        n = s[i] - '0';
      else
        n = n * 10 + s[i] - '0';
      i++;
    } else if (s[i] == '(') {
      if (n < 0)
        n = 1;
      int cnt = 1, j = i + 1;
      for (; cnt;) {
        if (s[j] == '(')
          cnt++;
        else if (s[j] == ')')
          cnt--;
        j++;
      }
      int start = i + 1;
      string r0 = dfs(s, start);
      r.reserve(r.size() + r0.size() * n); // Preallocate memory
      for (int _ = 0; _ < n; _++) {
        r += r0;
        if (r.size() > N)
          return r;
      }
      n = -1;
      i = j;
    } else {
      if (n < 0)
        n = 1;
      r.reserve(r.size() + n); // Preallocate memory
      r += string(n, s[i]);
      n = -1;
      i++;
    }
  }
  return r;
}

int main() {
  for (;;) {
    string s;
    cin >> s >> N;
    if (s == "0")
      break;
    int i = 0;
    string r = dfs(s, i);
    printf("%c\n", r.size() > N ? r[N] : '0');
  }
}
```

Changes Made:

1. Changed the `dfs` function to take a reference to the string `s` and an integer `i` which is the starting index of the string. This allows us to avoid creating a new string every time we call `dfs`.

2. Added `reserve` calls before concatenating strings to preallocate memory. This can significantly speed up the string concatenation by reducing the number of memory reallocations.

3. Passed the start index of the string to the `dfs` function instead of creating a new substring. 

These optimizations aim to reduce memory usage and improve the running time of the program by avoiding unnecessary string operations. The functionality and output of the original code are preserved.
