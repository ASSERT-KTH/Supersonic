Code Analysis:

The given C++ program takes a string as input, which can contain numbers, parentheses, and characters. The string is parsed, and the numbers represent repetitions for the next character or a set of characters enclosed in parentheses. The program then prints the Nth character of the expanded string.

The potential bottlenecks and inefficient parts of this code include:

1. The use of string concatenation in a loop, especially in the `dfs(string s)` function. Concatenating strings in a loop can be very inefficient because each concatenation can potentially involve creating a new string and copying the old contents over.

2. String substrings are used in the dfs function. This creates a new string and can significantly increase the memory usage, especially if the input string is large.

3. The code is not easy to read or maintain due to the lack of function and variable names that accurately describe what they are doing.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a string builder or similar structure to build the string instead of concatenating strings in a loop.
2. Avoid creating new strings with `substr`.
3. Use more descriptive function and variable names to make the code easier to read and maintain.
4. Take advantage of short-circuiting to avoid unnecessary calculations.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int N;

void appendChar(vector<char>& result, char c, long long n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n && result.size() <= N; ++i) {
        result.push_back(c);
    }
}

void parseString(const string& s, int start, int end, vector<char>& result) {
    long long n = -1;
    for (int i = start; i < end && result.size() <= N;) {
        if ('0' <= s[i] && s[i] <= '9') {
            n = (n < 0 ? 0 : n * 10) + (s[i] - '0');
            ++i;
        } else if (s[i] == '(') {
            if (n < 0)
                n = 1;
            int cnt = 1, j = i + 1;
            for (; cnt;) {
                if (s[j] == '(')
                    ++cnt;
                else if (s[j] == ')')
                    --cnt;
                ++j;
            }
            for (int _ = 0; _ < n && result.size() <= N; _++) {
                parseString(s, i + 1, j - 1, result);
            }
            n = -1;
            i = j;
        } else {
            if (n < 0)
                n = 1;
            appendChar(result, s[i], n);
            n = -1;
            ++i;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    for (;;) {
        string s;
        cin >> s >> N;
        if (s == "0")
            break;
        vector<char> result;
        parseString(s, 0, s.size(), result);
        cout << ((result.size() > N) ? result[N] : '0') << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version of the program, the following changes were made:

1. The `dfs` function is renamed to `parseString`, and it now takes the start and end indices of the string to parse, as well as a reference to a vector of characters where the result will be stored. This avoids creating new strings with `substr`.

2. A new function `appendChar` is added to append a character multiple times to the result. This function stops appending characters as soon as the result is large enough.

3. The result is stored in a `vector<char>` instead of a string. This makes it easier to stop building the result as soon as it is large enough.

4. The `parseString` function stops parsing the string as soon as the result is large enough. This takes advantage of short-circuiting to avoid unnecessary work.
