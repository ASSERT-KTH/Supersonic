The primary optimization for this code focuses on improving memory usage and reducing time complexity. The code mainly does a depth-first search over a string, repeatedly creating copies of substrings and concatenating them. This is inefficient in both time and memory. Here are the major optimization steps:

1. **Avoid unnecessary string copy and concatenation:** The dfs function takes a string as input and creates a substring for each recursive call. String concatenation is also costly in terms of time complexity. We can avoid this by passing the start and end indices for the dfs function, instead of the actual substring.

2. **Avoid unnecessary string creation:** In the code, new strings are created using the string(n, s[i]) constructor. This can be replaced by appending the character n times in the result string.

3. **Avoid repeated computation in loops:** The for loop that checks for matching parentheses computes the substring size multiple times. This can be avoided by calculating it once and reusing it.

4. **Take advantage of short-circuit logic:** The function continues concatenating strings even after the result string size exceeds N, which is unnecessary. We can stop as soon as the result string size exceeds N.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int N;

string dfs(const string &s, int start, int end) {
    string r;
    long long n = -1;
    for (int i = start; i < end;) {
        if ('0' <= s[i] && s[i] <= '9') {
            if (n < 0)
                n = s[i] - '0';
            else
                n = n * 10 + s[i] - '0';
            i++;
        } else if (s[i] == '(') {
            if (n < 0)
                n = 1;
            int cnt = 1, j = i + 1;
            for (; cnt; j++) {
                if (s[j] == '(')
                    cnt++;
                else if (s[j] == ')')
                    cnt--;
            }
            string r0 = dfs(s, i + 1, j - 1);
            for (int _ = 0; _ < n && r.size() <= N; _++) {
                r += r0;
            }
            n = -1;
            i = j;
        } else {
            if (n < 0)
                n = 1;
            for (int _ = 0; _ < n && r.size() <= N; _++) {
                r += s[i];
            }
            n = -1;
            i++;
        }
        if (r.size() > N)
            break;
    }
    return r;
}

int main() {
    for (;;) {
        string s;
        cin >> s >> N;
        if (s == "0")
            break;
        string r = dfs(s, 0, s.size());
        printf("%c\n", r.size() > N ? r[N] : '0');
    }
}
```

In this optimized code, we improved the code's efficiency by reducing the number of string copy and concatenation operations, avoiding unnecessary string creation, and using short-circuit logic to speed up the process.
