This code defines a binary search tree (BST) and implements some basic operations on it, namely insertion, search (find), and two types of traversal (inorder and preorder). The main function reads commands from the standard input and executes them. The commands can be "insert", "print", or "find". 

Although the code is generally well-structured and efficient, there are some improvements that can be made for better performance and memory usage.

Here are the optimization strategies:

1. **Avoid unnecessary memory allocation:** Currently, a new Node is created every time the 'insert' function is called, even if the node is not used. A better approach is to allocate memory only when it's required, i.e., when we are sure that the new node will be added to the tree.

2. **Improve cache efficiency:** Accessing memory is often a bottleneck in programs. We can reduce memory access times by improving the cache efficiency of the code. One way of doing this is by moving the variable declarations inside the loops where they are used.

3. **Replace printf with cout:** printf is a C function and can be slower than its C++ counterpart, cout. It's better to use cout for output in a C++ program.

4. **Use const where possible:** Using const for variables that shouldn't change can help the compiler optimize the code.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
  int key;
  Node *parent, *left, *right;
};

Node *root, *NIL;

void insert(int k) {
  Node *y = NIL;
  Node *x = root;

  while (x != NIL) {
    y = x;
    if (k < x->key) {
      x = x->left;
    } else {
      x = x->right;
    }
  }

  Node *z = new Node;
  z->key = k;
  z->left = NIL;
  z->right = NIL;
  z->parent = y;

  if (y == NIL) {
    root = z;
  } else {
    if (z->key < y->key)
      y->left = z;
    else
      y->right = z;
  }
}

bool find(int k) {
  Node *v = root;

  while (v != NIL) {
    if (k == v->key)
      return true;
    if (k < v->key) {
      v = v->left;
    } else {
      v = v->right;
    }
  }
  return false;
}

void inorder(const Node *u) {
  if (u == NIL)
    return;
  inorder(u->left);
  cout << " " << u->key;
  inorder(u->right);
}

void preorder(const Node *u) {
  if (u == NIL)
    return;
  cout << " " << u->key;
  preorder(u->left);
  preorder(u->right);
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string com;
    cin >> com;

    if (com == "insert") {
      int x;
      cin >> x;
      insert(x);
    } else if (com == "print") {
      inorder(root);
      cout << endl;
      preorder(root);
      cout << endl;
    } else if (com == "find") {
      int x;
      cin >> x;
      if (find(x))
        cout << "yes" << endl;
      else
        cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should function identically to the original version, but with better performance and efficiency.
