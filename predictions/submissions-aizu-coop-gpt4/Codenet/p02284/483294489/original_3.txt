The given code implements a binary search tree with insertion and search functionalities. It also provides functions for printing the tree in inorder and preorder traversals. The code is fairly efficient as it is, however, there are a few improvements that can be made to optimize memory usage and code clarity.

### Analysis

1. **Memory Management:** The code uses a dynamic memory allocation for the creation of each new node in the tree. However, it does not provide a mechanism to free the allocated memory, which can lead to memory leaks. 

2. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The code uses simple data structures for tree implementation. While these structures are suitable for the task at hand, they could be replaced with more advanced data structures like `std::map` or `std::set` in C++ STL for better performance and ease of use.

3. **Function Calls:** Recursive calls to `inorder()` and `preorder()` functions can be expensive in terms of time and space complexity. Iterative solutions can be used to improve performance.

### Optimization Strategy

1. **Memory Management:** Implement a destructor or a delete function to free the memory allocated to each node after it is no longer needed.

2. **Data Structures:** Use C++ STL's `std::map` or `std::set` for tree implementation. These structures offer logarithmic time complexity for insertions, deletions and searches, and automatically maintain a balanced binary search tree.

3. **Function Calls:** Replace recursive calls for inorder and preorder traversals with iterative solutions using stack.

Please note that the use of `std::map` or `std::set` will bring about a significant change in the code structure. The implementation will be simpler and more efficient, but it will also be a departure from the manual handling of nodes in the tree. For this optimization, we will focus on improving memory management and replacing recursive calls.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Memory Management:** Implement a destructor for the `Node` struct that deletes its left and right children. This ensures that the memory allocated to every node is eventually freed, preventing memory leaks. 

2. **Function Calls:** Replace the recursive calls in `inorder()` and `preorder()` functions with iterative solutions using stack. This will reduce the space complexity and improve the performance of the code.

### Optimized Code Block

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
  int key;
  Node *parent, *left, *right;

  // Destructor to free memory
  ~Node() {
    delete left;
    delete right;
  }
};

Node *root, *NIL;

void insert(int k) {
  // ... (Unchanged code)
}

bool find(int k) {
  // ... (Unchanged code)
}

void inorder(Node *root) {
  stack<Node*> nodes;
  Node *curr = root;

  while (!nodes.empty() || curr != NIL) {
    while (curr != NIL) {
      nodes.push(curr);
      curr = curr->left;
    }

    curr = nodes.top();
    nodes.pop();
    printf(" %d", curr->key);
    curr = curr->right;
  }
}

void preorder(Node *root) {
  if (root == NIL) return;

  stack<Node*> nodes;
  nodes.push(root);

  while (!nodes.empty()) {
    Node *curr = nodes.top();
    nodes.pop();
    printf(" %d", curr->key);

    if (curr->right != NIL)
      nodes.push(curr->right);
    
    if (curr->left != NIL)
      nodes.push(curr->left);
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (Unchanged code)

  // Delete the root node to free allocated memory
  delete root;
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code above, we introduced a destructor in the Node struct to free the memory allocated to the nodes. We also replaced the recursive calls in the inorder() and preorder() functions with iterative solutions using stack. Finally, we deleted the root node at the end of the main function to free up all the allocated memory.
