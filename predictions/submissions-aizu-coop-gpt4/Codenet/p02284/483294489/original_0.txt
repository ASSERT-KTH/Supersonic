Analysis:

This code is a simple implementation of a binary search tree (BST) in C++. It allows for insertion of keys, finding keys, and printing the tree using inorder and preorder traversals. The major performance issues which can be identified in this code are:

1. The dynamic allocation of new nodes during the insert operation can be expensive. It involves a system call which is quite slow as compared to other instructions.
2. The find operation performs a linear search on the BST which can be a performance bottleneck when dealing with large data sets. It has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case.
3. The print operation (both inorder and preorder) are recursive functions which could lead to stack overflow when dealing with large data sets.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Reduce the cost of dynamic memory allocation during insertion.
2. Optimize the find operation to reduce its time complexity.
3. Optimize the print operation to prevent potential stack overflow.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Reuse Nodes: One possible way to optimize the insert operation is by reusing nodes. If we have a pool of preallocated nodes, we could simply pick a node from this pool every time we need to insert a new key. This would eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation during runtime and hence speed up the insert operation. However, this approach would increase the memory footprint of the program as we would need to allocate memory for these nodes at the start of the program.

2. Balanced BST: The find operation can be optimized by using a balanced binary search tree (like an AVL tree or a Red-Black tree) instead of a regular BST. A balanced BST ensures that the tree remains approximately balanced at all times, which guarantees a time complexity of O(log(n)) for search operations. This approach would however increase the complexity of the insert operation as we would need to ensure that the tree remains balanced after every insertion.

3. Iterative print: The print operation can be optimized by using an iterative approach (using a stack data structure) instead of a recursive approach. This would prevent potential stack overflow issues when dealing with large data sets. However, this approach would increase the complexity of the print operation as we would need to manually manage the stack data structure.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;
struct Node {
  int key;
  Node *parent, *left, *right;
};
Node *root, *NIL;

void insert(int k) {
  // Insertion logic remains the same
}

bool find(int k) {
  // Find operation remains the same
}

void inorder(Node *u) {
  stack<Node*> s;
  Node *curr = u;
  
  while (curr != NIL || !s.empty()) {
    while (curr !=  NIL) {
      s.push(curr);
      curr = curr->left;
    }
    
    curr = s.top();
    s.pop();

    cout << " " << curr->key;

    curr = curr->right;
  }
}

void preorder(Node *u) {
  if (u == NIL)
    return;
    
  stack<Node*> s;
  s.push(u);
  
  while (!s.empty()) {
    Node *node = s.top();
    cout << " " << node->key;
    s.pop();

    if (node->right != NIL) {
      s.push(node->right);
    }
    if (node->left != NIL) {
      s.push(node->left);
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  // Main function remains the same
  return 0;
}
```
This optimization only covers the print operation. The other optimizations (reusing nodes and balanced BST) would require a significant rewrite of the code and are not covered in this answer.
