This program implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) with basic operations such as insert, find, inorder traversal, and preorder traversal. The main performance bottlenecks in this program are memory allocation and deallocation, which are costly operations. We can optimize the program by using a pool of pre-allocated memory.

### Optimization Strategy:

1. **Using Memory Pool:** We can use a memory pool to reduce the overhead of memory allocation and deallocation. A memory pool is a method for pre-allocating a pool of memory and managing it ourselves. This way, we can avoid the expensive system calls for allocating and deallocating memory in each insert operation. 

2. **Avoiding Redundancy:** We can avoid redundant 'new' and 'delete' operations by reusing nodes from the memory pool.

3. **Compiler Optimizations:** We can use compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to further improve the performance of the program.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how to implement these optimizations:

1. **Using Memory Pool:** We can create a pool of nodes at the beginning of the program. When a new node needs to be inserted, we can fetch a node from the pool instead of creating a new one. When a node is removed, it can be returned to the pool instead of being deleted. This will significantly speed up the insert operation, as it avoids costly new and delete operations.

2. **Avoiding Redundancy:** With the memory pool in place, we can avoid using the 'new' operator in the insert function. Instead, we will fetch a node from the memory pool. This will reduce the number of 'new' and 'delete' operations, further optimizing the code.

3. **Compiler Optimizations:** We can use the `-O2` or `-O3` compiler flags to enable additional performance optimizations. These flags tell the compiler to perform optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, and other optimizations that can improve performance.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
struct Node {
  int key;
  Node *parent, *left, *right;
};
Node *root, *NIL;
vector<Node> pool;
int pool_index = 0;
void insert(int k) {
  Node *y = NIL;
  Node *x = root;
  Node *z;
  if(pool_index < pool.size()) {
    z = &pool[pool_index++];
  } else {
    pool.push_back(Node());
    z = &pool.back();
  }
  z->key = k;
  z->left = NIL;
  z->right = NIL;
  while (x != NIL) {
    y = x;
    if (z->key < x->key) {
      x = x->left;
    } else {
      x = x->right;
    }
  }
  z->parent = y;
  if (y == NIL) {
    root = z;
  } else {
    if (z->key < y->key)
      y->left = z;
    else
      y->right = z;
  }
}
// The rest of the code remains the same
```

Compile the code with `-O2` or `-O3` flag for further optimization.

Please note that this optimization may increase memory usage if the memory pool size grows large. It is a trade-off between speed and memory usage.
