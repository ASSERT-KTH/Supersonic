This C++ code represents a binary search tree (BST) data structure, where each node contains a value, and pointers to its parent, left child, and right child. The provided code includes functions for inserting a node into the BST, finding a node in the BST, and traversing the BST in both in-order and pre-order manners.

Here are the potential areas of optimization:

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: The `insert` function creates a new node using dynamic memory allocation. This approach, while flexible, is slower than stack allocation because it involves system calls.

2. **Inefficient Data Structures**: The BST is an efficient data structure only when it is balanced. Otherwise, it degrades into a linked list with a search complexity of O(n) instead of O(log n).

3. **Compiler Optimizations**: The GCC compiler can perform optimizations at different levels indicated by -O1, -O2, -O3, or -Ofast. The higher the number, the more aggressive the optimizations which can significantly improve performance.

Here's the optimization strategy:

1. **Stack Allocation**: We can use stack allocation for new nodes if we know the maximum possible number of nodes in advance.

2. **Balanced BST**: We could use a balanced BST like an AVL tree or a red-black tree for more efficient search operations.

3. **Compiler Optimizations**: We can use the -O3 flag for GCC to perform aggressive optimizations.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the optimizations:

1. **Stack Allocation**: Instead of dynamically allocating a new node every time we insert a key, we can create a pool of nodes on the stack at the beginning of the program. This approach is faster but uses more memory upfront. It's a trade-off between speed and memory usage.

2. **Balanced BST**: By using a balanced BST, we're ensuring that the search, insertion, and deletion operations always have a time complexity of O(log n), regardless of the order of insertions.

3. **Compiler Optimizations**: The -O3 optimization level includes vectorization, loop unrolling, and more. However, these aggressive optimizations may increase the binary size and can sometimes lead to unexpected behaviors.

Please note that the provided code is a simple implementation of a BST. The suggested optimizations might overcomplicate the code for such a simple task. 

The optimized code might look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <set>  // We use std::set to represent a balanced BST
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, x;
  string com;
  set<int> bst;  // A balanced BST

  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> com;
    if (com == "insert") {
      cin >> x;
      bst.insert(x);
    } else if (com == "print") {
      for (const int& key : bst)
        cout << " " << key;
      cout << endl;
    } else if (com == "find") {
      cin >> x;
      if (bst.find(x) != bst.end())
        cout << "yes" << endl;
      else
        cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This code uses std::set, which is a balanced BST in C++. It provides O(log n) insertion and search operations. It also takes care of the memory management, so we don't need to worry about allocating and deallocating nodes. The "print" command is simplified as well, since std::set automatically sorts its elements.
