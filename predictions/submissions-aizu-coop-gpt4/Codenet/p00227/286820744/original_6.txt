### Code Analysis
This C++ program is used to read in a number of vegetables and their prices, then calculate the total cost after every cap-th vegetable is free. It uses `std::vector` to store the prices of the vegetables.

Some potential areas for optimization include:
1. The use of `std::vector::push_back` in a loop - this may cause multiple reallocations and copying of the vector.
2. Use of `std::vector::at` for accessing elements - this function performs range checking and may throw an exception if the accessed position is out of range, making it slower than the operator[].
3. The use of `std::sort` with `std::greater<int>` - this sorts the list in descending order, but ascending order could be more efficient in this case.
4. The while loop for calculating sum can be replaced with a for loop for better readability.

### Optimization Strategy
1. Use `std::vector::reserve` before the loop to allocate enough memory for the vector upfront.
2. Replace `std::vector::at` with operator[] for faster access.
3. Sort the list in ascending order and adjust the algorithm accordingly.
4. Replace the while loop with a for loop to make the code more readable and slightly more efficient.

### Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Using `std::vector::reserve` before the loop will allocate enough memory for all the prices at once, avoiding multiple reallocations and copying of the vector during the insertion of elements. This will improve the performance of the program.
2. Replacing `std::vector::at` with operator[] will eliminate the overhead of range checking, making the access faster. However, this optimization assumes that we always access valid indexes.
3. Sorting the list in ascending order and adjusting the algorithm accordingly can be more efficient because `std::sort` with `std::greater<int>` may require more comparisons. However, this change will make the code slightly more complex.
4. Replacing the while loop with a for loop will make the code more readable and slightly more efficient because the increment of the counter `i` and the end condition check will be done in a single line.

### Optimized Code Block
```C++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    int num, cap, price;
    while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
        if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
            break;
        }
        std::vector<int> vegetables;
        vegetables.reserve(num);  // Reserve memory upfront
        for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
            std::cin >> price;
            vegetables.push_back(price);
        }
        sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end());  // Sort in ascending order
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
            if ((i + 1) % cap != 0) {
                sum += vegetables[i];  // Use operator[] for faster access
            }
        }
        std::cout << sum << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
