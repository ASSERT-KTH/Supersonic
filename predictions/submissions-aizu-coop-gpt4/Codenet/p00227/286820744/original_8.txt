1. Code Analysis:
The given code reads in a number of vegetables and a capacity, then reads in prices for each vegetable. It sorts the vegetables in descending order of price and then sums up the prices of the vegetables that can be carried in a bag of the given capacity, excluding every `cap`-th vegetable, since it is assumed we cannot carry it. The sum is then output.

2. Optimization Strategy:

   A. Data Structures: 
   There is no issue with the data structure. The `std::vector` is a suitable structure for this purpose. 

   B. Redundant Computations:
   The condition `(i + 1) % cap != 0` is computed inside the while loop, which can be optimized by adding a separate counter for the capacity. When this counter equals `cap`, we can skip the addition operation and reset the counter. 

   C. Loops and Recursive Calls:
   The while loop can be changed into a for loop, which will be more readable and concise. 

   D. Compiler Optimizations:
   There is no need for specific compiler optimizations or pragma directives in this simple program.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   Step 1: Replace the while loop with a for loop for better readability. 

   Step 2: Instead of checking `(i + 1) % cap != 0` inside the loop, we maintain a separate counter for the capacity. When this counter equals `cap`, we skip the addition operation and reset the counter.

4. Optimized Code Block:
Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int num, cap, price;
  while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::vector<int> vegetables;
    for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      std::cin >> price;
      vegetables.push_back(price);
    }
    sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());
    int sum = 0;
    int counter = 0; // Counter for capacity
    for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      if (counter != cap - 1) { // If the counter has not reached the capacity
        sum += vegetables.at(i);
      } else { // If the counter has reached the capacity
        counter = -1; // Reset the counter
      }
      ++counter;
    }
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  }
}
```
This optimized code is more readable and slightly more efficient because we replaced the modulo operation with a simple comparison and assignment. The functionality and output are the same as the original code.
