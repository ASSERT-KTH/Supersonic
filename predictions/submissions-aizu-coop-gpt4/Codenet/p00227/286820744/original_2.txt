**Code Analysis:**

This code reads an unspecified number of pairs of integers from the standard input. Each pair of integers defines a set of vegetables (the first integer) and a capacity (the second integer). The program then reads a price for each vegetable, sorts the prices in descending order, accumulates the prices with a condition that every 'cap' element is skipped, and finally prints the sum. 

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Data Structure:** The vector is a good choice for dynamic data. No changes needed here.

2. **Redundant Computations:** The condition `(i + 1) % cap != 0` is checked for every element in the vector, but it only changes every 'cap' elements. We could iterate the vector in chunks of 'cap' elements to avoid unnecessary checks.

3. **Loops:** The loop where prices are added could be optimized using the strategy mentioned above. 

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** Compiler optimizations like `-O2` or `-O3` could be used to further optimize the code at the expense of longer compilation times and potentially larger binaries. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Reducing redundant computations:** Instead of iterating over each element and checking if it should be included in the sum, we can iterate over 'cap - 1' elements at a time. We know that every 'cap' element will be excluded from the sum, so we can just skip it. This reduces the number of iterations and conditional checks, leading to faster code. 

**Trade-offs:** The optimized code might be a bit harder to understand due to the less straightforward loop, but the performance gain is substantial, especially for large inputs.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int num, cap, price, i, j;
  while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::vector<int> vegetables;
    for (i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      std::cin >> price;
      vegetables.push_back(price);
    }
    sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());
    int sum = 0;
    i = 0;
    while (i < num) {
      // Loop over 'cap - 1' elements and add them to the sum
      for (j = 0; j < cap - 1 && i < num; ++j, ++i) {
        sum += vegetables.at(i);
      }
      // Skip the 'cap' element
      ++i;
    }
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  }
}
```

In this optimized version, the inner loop iterates 'cap - 1' times, adding the prices to the sum. After the inner loop, the 'cap' element is skipped by incrementing 'i'. The condition 'i < num' is checked to ensure we don't go beyond the vector's size.
