### Code Analysis 

This program reads a series of prices for vegetables, sorts them in descending order, and calculates the sum of the prices, excluding every `cap`-th price. The input is read from the standard input and includes two numbers, `num` and `cap`, followed by `num` prices. `num` and `cap` both equal to zero signal the end of the input.

The most significant performance bottleneck in this code might be the use of vector's `at` function, which performs range-checking and throws an exception if the index is out of range. Since we are sure that `i` is within range, we can replace `at` with the array subscript operator `[]`, which doesn't perform range-checking.

### Optimization Strategy 

1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The use of `std::vector` for storing prices is appropriate here. It provides dynamic size and constant time access. 

2. **Redundant Computation:** One minor optimization is to replace `at` with `[]` to avoid unnecessary range checking.

3. **Loops and Recursive Calls:** There is a while loop that can be replaced by a for loop for better readability. Also, instead of checking for `cap` with `if` statement inside the loop, we can skip `cap`-th elements directly in the loop control.

4. **Compiler Optimizations and Pragma Directives:** Modern compilers are very good at optimizing code. We could consider using compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` for more aggressive optimizations.

### Step-by-Step Explanation 

1. **Replacing `at` with `[]`:** The `at` function performs range checking and throws an exception if the index is out of range. Since we are sure that our index `i` is within range, we can safely use the array subscript operator `[]`, which doesn't perform range checking and hence is faster. 

Trade-off: There is no trade-off in this case. It's a clear win in terms of performance without any downside. 

2. **Replacing While Loop with For Loop:** The while loop in the code can be replaced by a for loop for better readability and conciseness. 

Trade-off: Again, there is no trade-off. It's purely a matter of style and readability.

3. **Skipping `cap`-th elements in loop control:** Instead of checking if `i` is a multiple of `cap` inside the loop, we can increment `i` by `cap` in the loop control itself. This way, we skip `cap`-th elements directly and simplify the code.

Trade-off: The trade-off is that the loop control becomes slightly more complex. However, this is outweighed by the performance gain and the simplification of the loop body.

### Optimized Code Block 

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int num, cap, price;
  while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::vector<int> vegetables;
    for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      std::cin >> price;
      vegetables.push_back(price);
    }
    sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num; i += (i % cap == cap - 1) ? cap : 1) {
      sum += vegetables[i];
    }
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  }
}
```

Changes:

1. Replaced `at` with `[]`.
2. Replaced the while loop with a for loop.
3. Incorporated the check for `cap`-th elements in the loop control itself.
4. Removed unnecessary variable `i` from global scope, introduced it in for loops where needed.
