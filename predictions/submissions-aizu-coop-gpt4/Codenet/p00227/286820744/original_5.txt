Here's what I've found and suggested:

1. Code Analysis:
    - The code reads a series of prices from the input, sorts them in descending order, and then skips every `cap`th item starting from the first one, and sums up the remaining prices.
    - The code uses `std::vector<int> vegetables` to store the input prices and `std::vector::push_back()` to append new prices to it. This could lead to unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations as the vector grows.
    - The code uses `std::vector::at()` to access elements in the vector. This function checks if the given index is within the valid range of the vector, which adds overhead in each call.
    - The code uses `std::sort()` to sort the vector in descending order. This operation has a time complexity of O(n log n).

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - We can use `std::vector::reserve()` to preallocate the required memory for the vector.
    - We can replace `std::vector::at()` with the subscript operator `[]`, which doesn't check the validity of the index and hence is faster.
    - We can eliminate the check `if ((i + 1) % cap != 0)` inside the loop by using a more efficient loop structure.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    - `std::vector::reserve()` allows us to avoid unnecessary memory reallocation. We know that we are going to insert `num` items into the vector, so we can reserve that amount of memory in advance.
    - Replacing `std::vector::at()` with `[]` eliminates the overhead of range checking. However, this also means we lose the safety of range checking. In this case, it's not a problem because we are controlling the index access within the bounds of the vector.
    - By restructuring the loop, we can increment `i` by `cap` instead of `1` each iteration. In this way, we don't need to calculate `(i + 1) % cap` in each iteration. This structure is faster but it makes the code slightly more complex.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```C++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int num, cap, price, i;
  while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::vector<int> vegetables;
    vegetables.reserve(num);  // preallocate memory
    for (i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      std::cin >> price;
      vegetables.push_back(price);
    }
    sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());

    int sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < num; i += cap) {
      for (int j = i; j < std::min(i + cap - 1, num); ++j) {  // skip every cap'th item
        sum += vegetables[j];  // use [] instead of at()
      }
    }
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  }
}
```
The optimized code should have the same functionality as the original one and provide better performance and less memory usage.
