This program reads a set of price values of vegetables, sorts them in descending order, and then sums up the prices, skipping every `cap`'th item. Here are some suggestions to optimize this program:

1. **Redundant Vector Initializations**: Each time the outer loop runs, a new vector `vegetables` is created. This can lead to inefficient memory usage if the vector is large. Instead, you can declare the vector once outside the loop and use the `clear` function to empty it at the start of each iteration.
   
2. **Use of inefficient data structures**: The `std::vector::at` function is used to access elements, which includes a range-check and thus is slower than the overloaded operator `[]`. Use the latter for better performance.

3. **Use of `push_back`**: The `push_back` function can cause unnecessary reallocations if the vector's capacity is exceeded. Since the number of elements is known beforehand, `reserve` can be used to allocate enough memory at once.

4. **Redundant checking of `cap`**: The code checks `(i + 1) % cap != 0` for every element. Instead, we can add `cap - 1` elements, skip one, and repeat.

5. **Use of `std::cin` and `std::cout`**: Using `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input/output can be slow. We can use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to speed up I/O operations.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int num, cap, price;
  std::vector<int> vegetables;

  while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }

    vegetables.clear();
    vegetables.reserve(num);

    for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      std::cin >> price;
      vegetables.push_back(price);
    }

    sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());

    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num; i += cap) {
      for (int j = i; j < std::min(num, i + cap - 1); ++j) {
        sum += vegetables[j];
      }
    }

    std::cout << sum << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code should run faster due to the optimizations described above. However, it is slightly more complex due to the nested loop. In most cases, the performance gain would outweigh this increase in complexity.
