Code Analysis:
1. The code reads `num` and `cap` values from the standard input. If both are zero, the program ends.
2. The code then reads `num` integer values, representing the prices of vegetables, and stores them in a vector.
3. The vector of prices is sorted in descending order using the `std::sort` function.
4. The sum of the prices is then calculated, skipping every `cap`th price.
5. The sum is printed to the standard output.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Using `std::vector::reserve`: The `std::vector::push_back` function can cause a reallocation of the vector's memory, which can be costly. Knowing the number of elements beforehand, we can avoid unnecessary reallocations by using the `std::vector::reserve` function.
2. Elimination of the `std::vector::at` function: The `std::vector::at` function performs a range check and throws an exception if the requested position is out of range. Since we control the loop and ensure that we don't go out of bounds, we can replace it with the `operator[]`, which does not perform a range check.
3. Using pre-increment instead of post-increment: In C++, post-increment involves creating a copy of the object, incrementing the value, and then returning the original copy, whereas pre-increment simply increments the value and returns the result, which is more efficient.

Optimized Code:
```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int num, cap, price;
  while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::vector<int> vegetables;
    vegetables.reserve(num); // Reserve memory to avoid reallocations
    for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      std::cin >> price;
      vegetables.push_back(price);
    }
    sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      if ((i + 1) % cap != 0) {
        sum += vegetables[i]; // Use operator[] instead of at
      }
    }
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  }
}
```
Note: These optimizations will likely have a minor effect on the program's performance, as the main computational effort lies in sorting the vector, which has a complexity of O(n log n). They essentially reduce the number of operations and memory reallocations, making the program more efficient in the use of resources.
