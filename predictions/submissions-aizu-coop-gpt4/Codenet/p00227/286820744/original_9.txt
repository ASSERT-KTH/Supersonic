This is a simple C++ program that reads in a number of vegetable prices, stores them in a `std::vector`, sorts them in descending order, and then adds up all the prices except for every nth price, where n is a given capacity `cap`. Here are the parts that we could optimize:

1. **Data Input:** The way the prices are read and stored in the `std::vector` could be improved. Instead of using `push_back` to add each price one by one, we can use `std::vector`'s range constructor to directly fill the vector from the input stream.

2. **Vector Access:** The `at` method is used to access vector elements, which is slower than direct indexing because it checks if the index is within the vector's bounds. This is not necessary in this case, since we already ensure that we only iterate up to `num`.

3. **Conditional Check:** The conditional check `(i + 1) % cap != 0` inside the loop can be costly if executed many times. We can avoid this by incrementing `i` by `cap` in each loop iteration and adding up the prices in a range.

4. **Variable Initialization:** The variable `i` is declared at the start of the program and then reused in different parts. By declaring variables in the tightest scope possible, we can make the program clearer and avoid potential issues in more complex programs.

5. **Sorting Algorithm:** The `sort` function is being used with `std::greater<int>()`, which sorts the array in descending order. However, since we're skipping every nth element starting from the highest, it would be more efficient to sort in ascending order and start summing from the start.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
int main() {
  int num, cap;
  while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::vector<int> vegetables(num);
    for (int &price : vegetables) {
      std::cin >> price;
    }
    sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end());
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num; i += cap) {
      for(int j = i; j < std::min(i + cap - 1, num); ++j) {
        sum += vegetables[j];
      }
    }
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should have the same output as the original code, but it should run faster and use memory more efficiently.
