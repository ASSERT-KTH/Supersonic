The given code is a complex dynamic programming problem. It reads the input for the number of notes, the number of beauty, and the force of repulsion. After that, it reads the notes and beauty arrays, and then it calculates the minimum force required to rearrange the notes in a way that maximizes the beauty.

Now let's move on to the optimization process.

1. **Code Analysis:**

The main performance bottlenecks are:

  - The compute function is called multiple times with the same parameters leading to redundant computation.
  
  - The use of dynamic arrays (`dp`, `sum`, `notes`, `beauty`) which may lead to inefficient memory usage.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**

   1. Use a memoization strategy to avoid recalculating the value of the compute function for previously encountered parameters.
   
   2. Instead of using dynamic arrays, use vectors which are more efficient in terms of memory usage and provide more utility functions.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

   1. **Memoization:**

The `compute` function is called multiple times with the same parameters. This results in redundant computation which can be avoided by storing the result of the function for a specific parameter combination, and reusing it whenever the function is called with the same parameters. This technique is known as memoization and it can significantly reduce the runtime complexity of the program.

   2. **Replacing Arrays with Vectors:**

Dynamic arrays in C++ are not as efficient as vectors. Vectors are dynamic arrays with more functionality. They are safer, and can grow or shrink their size dynamically. They also provide utility functions like `push_back()`, `pop_back()`, `size()`, etc. that make their manipulation easier. Also, when using vectors, the need for keeping track of the array length is eliminated as vectors store their own length.

Here is the optimized version of the given code:

    }
    sort(notes.begin(), notes.begin() + num_of_notes);
    reverse(notes.begin(), notes.begin() + num_of_notes);
    for (auto &v : dp) {
      fill(v.begin(), v.end(), INF);
    }
    dp[0][0] = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_of_notes; i++) {
      int next = i + 1;
      for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
        dp[next][j] = min(dp[next][j], dp[i][j] + compute(i, next));
        dp[next][i] = min(dp[next][i], dp[i][j] + compute(j, next));
      }
    }
    ll res = LINF;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_of_notes; i++) {
      res = min(dp[num_of_notes - 1][i] + compute(i, num_of_notes - 1), res);
    }
    printf("%lld\n", res);
  }
}
```
The optimized code should have the same functionality as the original code but with better performance due to the use of memoization and vectors.
