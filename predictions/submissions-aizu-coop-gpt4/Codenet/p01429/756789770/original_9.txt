1. Code Analysis:
The given code is solving a problem by dynamic programming. It reads the number of musical notes and their beauty from the input, then tries to compute the minimum cost to distribute these notes among the notes.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Use of Efficient Data Structures: The given code already uses efficient data structures such as arrays for storing values. But we can change the way of initialization of the 'dp' array to reduce redundancy.
    2. Redundant Computations: The compute function is called multiple times with the same parameters. We can store the result of these computations to avoid redundancy.
    3. Loops Optimization: The code runs two nested loops to fill the dynamic programming table dp[i][j]. We can't reduce the loops in this case as they are necessary for solving the problem.
    4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use the O3 optimization level for g++ compiler to increase the speed of the program. This level turns on all optimizations specified by -O2 and two more options: -finline-functions and -fweb.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. The 'dp' array is initialized with a large value. Instead of using memset, we can initialize the array with the large value at the time of declaration. This will avoid calling memset and will save time.
    2. The compute function is called multiple times with the same arguments. We can use a 2-dimensional array to save the results of the compute function. Before calling compute, we can check if the value is already computed. If it is, we return the saved value. If not, we compute the value, save it, and return it.
    3. By using the O3 optimization level for the g++ compiler, we can speed up the program. This level includes all optimizations from the O2 level and additional optimizations that may increase performance.

Trade-offs:
The trade-off in this optimization is increased space complexity due to the use of an additional 2-dimensional array to save the results of the compute function.
