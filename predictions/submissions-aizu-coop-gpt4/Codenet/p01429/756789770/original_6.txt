The given code appears to be a solution for a competitive programming problem, which involves beauty of musical notes and a force of repulsion. The main performance bottlenecks are primarily due to the nested loops and the compute function, which are all run multiple times. The compute function specifically is called inside the inner loop which can be a cause for performance degradation.

Optimization Strategy:

1. **Eliminate Redundant Recomputations**: The `compute` function is called multiple times with the same parameters. This redundancy can be eliminated by storing the results of previous computations in a lookup table (memoization). This approach trades off some memory usage for significant performance gains.

2. **Loop Unrolling**: Loop unrolling is a common optimization technique applied to reduce the overhead of loop control instructions. However, in this case, it may not be applicable due to the dynamic nature of the loops.

3. **Use Efficient Data Structures**: In this case, the data structures used (arrays) are already optimal for the task. More complex structures like trees or heaps would only complicate the code without providing any performance benefits.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: The GCC compiler, for instance, provides a variety of flags for optimization, such as -O1, -O2, -O3, -Os, etc. Using these flags can result in improved performance, however, the benefits vary depending on the specific code.

Detailed Explanation:

1. **Memoization**: The `compute` function is called multiple times during the execution of the program with the same parameters. This means that the same computations are being performed multiple times. We can optimize this by storing the result of a computation the first time it is performed. Then, when the same computation is needed again, we simply look up the result in our table rather than recomputing it. This can dramatically increase performance, especially for larger input sizes. However, it will also increase memory usage somewhat, as we need to store the results of each computation.

Optimized Code Block:
To implement this, we would change the `compute` function and the loop where it's called as follows:

```cpp
// lookup table for compute function results
ll compute_lookup[2001][2001];

// new compute function
ll compute(int i, int j) {
  // check if result is already in lookup table
  if (compute_lookup[i][j] != -1) {
    return compute_lookup[i][j];
  }

  ll lhs = sum[notes[i]];
  ll rhs = (notes[j] - 1 < 0 ? 0 : sum[notes[j] - 1]);
  ll result = (lhs - rhs) / force_of_repulsion;

  // store result in lookup table
  compute_lookup[i][j] = result;

  return result;
}

// initialize lookup table in main function
memset(compute_lookup, -1, sizeof(compute_lookup));

// change loop where compute is called
for (int i = 0; i < num_of_notes; i++) {
  int next = i + 1;
  for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
    dp[next][j] = min(dp[next][j], dp[i][j] + compute(i, next));
    dp[next][i] = min(dp[next][i], dp[i][j] + compute(j, next));
  }
}
```

This change will ensure that no computation is performed more than once, greatly increasing the efficiency of the program.
