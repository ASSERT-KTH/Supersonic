Code Analysis:

This code is a simple C program that checks for prime numbers and evaluates a pair of twin primes (two primes that differ by 2). It uses a simple brute force approach to determine if a number is prime or not. This is done by checking if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to n-1.

Potential performance bottlenecks, inefficient memory usage, or any sections of the code that might benefit from optimization:

1. The isprime1 function checks if a number is prime by iterating through all numbers from 2 to n-1 and checking if n is divisible by any of these numbers. This is highly inefficient, as it isn't necessary to check all numbers up to n-1. We need to check only up to sqrt(n), which is a significant performance improvement for large n.

2. In the main function, we are finding twin prime numbers by checking if a number and the number 2 less than it are primes. This has the issue that we're checking some numbers to be primes multiple times.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Optimize the isprime1 function to only check divisibility up to sqrt(n).
2. Instead of checking for primality of each number individually, we can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate all primes up to n and store them. This way, checking if a number is prime is a constant time operation.
3. Instead of checking for twin primes by checking each number and the number 2 less than it, we can iterate through the list of primes and check if the difference between consecutive primes is 2.

Optimized Code:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<bool> primes;

void sieve(int n) {
  primes = std::vector<bool>(n+1, true);
  primes[0] = primes[1] = false;
  for (int p=2; p*p<=n; p++) {
    if (primes[p] == true) {
      for (int i=p*p; i<=n; i += p)
        primes[i] = false;
    }
  }
}

bool isprime1(int n) {
  return primes[n];
}

int main() {
  int n, p, q;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  sieve(n);
  while (1) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = n; i >= 5; i--) {
      if (isprime1(i) && isprime1(i - 2)) {
        p = i - 2;
        q = i;
        break;
      }
    }
    printf("%d %d\n", p, q);
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n > primes.size()) {
      sieve(n);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we replaced the function isprime1 with a more efficient version that checks if a number is prime by checking if it's marked as prime in the 'primes' vector. We also added a sieve function that generates all primes up to n using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which is much more efficient than checking each number individually. In the main function, we added a check to see if n is larger than the current size of the 'primes' vector, and if it is, we generate all primes up to n again. This ensures that we always have the primes up to n available, which is necessary for the isprime1 function to work correctly.
