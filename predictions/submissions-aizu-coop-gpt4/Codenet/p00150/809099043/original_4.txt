The provided code reads an integer `n` from the user and then finds the largest pair of prime numbers `(p, q)` such that `q - p = 2` and `q <= n`. This process is repeated until the user enters `0`.

Let's begin by analyzing the code:

1. Code Analysis:

- In the function `isprime1()` a number `n` is checked whether it is prime or not. For this, the function checks each number from `2` to `n-1` whether it is a divisor of `n`. This is highly inefficient as it results in a time complexity of O(n).
- In the `main()` function, for each number from `n` to `5`, it checks whether the number and the number 2 units lesser than it are prime. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2) because for each number, it checks all the numbers lesser than it if they are prime or not.

2. Optimization Strategy:

- To optimize the `isprime1()` function, instead of checking up to `n`, we can check up to `sqrt(n)` because a larger factor of `n` must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.
- In the `main()` function, instead of checking whether each number is prime every time, we can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate all primes up to `n` in O(n log (log n)) time. Then we can simply check whether each number and the number 2 units lesser than it are prime by checking in the generated list of primes.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

- Optimize the `isprime1()` function: Checking up to `sqrt(n)` reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(sqrt(n)). This is an effective optimization technique for checking whether a number is prime or not.
- Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm: Generating all primes up to `n` in advance reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log (log n)). This is a well-known optimization technique for problems involving prime numbers.
- Trade-offs: The optimized code uses extra space to store the list of primes up to `n`. However, this extra space usage is worth it because it significantly reduces the time complexity.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <vector>

bool isprime1(int n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return false;
  }
  if (n == 2) {
    return true;
  }
  if (n % 2 == 0) {
    return false;
  }
  for (int i = 3; i <= sqrt(n); i += 2) {
    if (n % i == 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

std::vector<bool> generate_primes(int n) {
  std::vector<bool> primes(n + 1, true);
  primes[0] = primes[1] = false;
  for (int p = 2; p*p <= n; p++) {
    if (primes[p] == true) {
      for (int i = p*p; i <= n; i += p) {
        primes[i] = false;
      }
    }
  }
  return primes;
}

int main() {
  int n, p, q;
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::vector<bool> primes = generate_primes(n);
    for (int i = n; i >= 5; i--) {
      if (primes[i] == true && primes[i - 2] == true) {
        p = i - 2;
        q = i;
        break;
      }
    }
    printf("%d %d\n", p, q);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should perform significantly faster than the original code for large inputs.
