## Code Analysis

The given code is a C program which reads an integer from the input and finds two prime numbers p and q such that q - p = 2 and q <= n. If such a pair does not exist, it prints the last found pair. This continues until the input is zero.

The potential performance bottlenecks are:

1. The `isprime1` function checks for the primality of a number by checking divisibility with all numbers less than the number itself. This leads to a time complexity of O(n) for each call.

2. The main loop in `main` function is decrementing the number from n to 5 and checking for the primality of current and previous number. If both are prime, it breaks the loop. This also leads to a high time complexity.

3. The function `isprime1` is called twice in the loop, which is redundant for each iteration except the first one, because in the next iteration it checks the primality of the previous number again.

## Optimization Strategy

1. The `isprime1` function can be optimized by checking divisibility only up to the square root of the number. This is because a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked.

2. The primality check of a number can be cached in an array to avoid recomputation in subsequent calls. 

3. Instead of checking the primality of both i and i - 2 in each iteration, we can check only i in the first iteration, and in subsequent iterations check only i - 2 (since i was checked in the previous iteration).

4. The `while(1)` loop with a break condition can be converted to a `while(n)` loop for clarity.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Optimize the `isprime1` function to only check divisibility up to the square root of n. This reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(sqrt(n)).

2. Add a boolean array `is_prime` to cache the primality of numbers up to n. This avoids the recomputation of the primality of a number.

3. In the main loop, instead of checking the primality of both i and i - 2 in each iteration, check only i in the first iteration, and in subsequent iterations check only i - 2. This reduces the number of calls to `isprime1` by half.

4. Convert the `while(1)` loop with a break condition to a `while(n)` loop for clarity.

The trade-off for these optimizations is a slight increase in code complexity and requirement of extra space for the boolean array. However, the performance gain is significant.

## Optimized Code Block

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

bool is_prime[1000000];  // assuming n will not exceed 1000000

void calculate_prime(int n) {
    for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
        is_prime[i] = true;
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = false;
    for(int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
        if(is_prime[i]) {
            for(int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i)
                is_prime[j] = false;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, p, q, i;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    while (n) {
        calculate_prime(n);
        for (i = n; n >= 5; i--) {
            if (is_prime[i] && is_prime[i - 2]) {
                p = i - 2;
                q = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        printf("%d %d\n", p, q);
        scanf("%d", &n);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
