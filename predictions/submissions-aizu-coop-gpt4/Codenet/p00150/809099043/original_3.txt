Here is the optimized version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int isprime1(int n) {
  if(n <= 1)
    return 0;
  if(n == 2)
    return 1;
  if(n % 2 == 0)
    return 0;
  int sqrt_n = sqrt(n);
  for (int i = 3; i <= sqrt_n; i += 2) {
    if (n % i == 0)
      return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}

int main() {
  int n, p, q;
  while (scanf("%d", &n) != EOF && n != 0) {
    for (int i = n; i >= 5; i--) {
      if (isprime1(i) && isprime1(i - 2)) {
        p = i - 2;
        q = i;
        break;
      }
    }
    printf("%d %d\n", p, q);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

1. Code Analysis:
   - In the given code, potential performance bottlenecks are in the `isprime1` function. The function checks if a number is prime by checking divisibility for every number less than `n`. This can be optimized by only checking up to the square root of `n` because a larger factor of `n` must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.
   - The function also does not handle numbers less than or equal to 1, which are not prime by definition.
   - The function checks divisibility for every number less than `n`, even though it is known that no even number (except 2) can be prime.
   - The `main` function repeatedly reads `n` in a while loop until `n` is zero. The loop condition can be simplified by reading `n` as part of the loop condition, and breaking the loop if `n` is zero or EOF is reached.
2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Optimize the `isprime1` function to only check divisibility up to the square root of `n`.
   - Add checks in the `isprime1` function for numbers less than or equal to 1 and for even numbers.
   - Simplify the while loop in `main` to read `n` as part of the loop condition.
3. Explanation:
   - The `isprime1` function now first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns 0 because these numbers are not prime. It then checks if `n` is 2, in which case it returns 1 because 2 is the only even prime number. It then checks if `n` is even, in which case it returns 0 because no other even number can be prime.
   - Next, it calculates the square root of `n` and checks divisibility for odd numbers up to this limit. Checking divisibility only up to the square root of `n` and skipping even numbers greatly reduces the number of iterations in the loop, which improves performance.
   - The outer while loop in `main` now reads `n` as part of the loop condition and breaks the loop if `n` is zero or EOF is reached. This simplifies the loop logic and avoids unnecessary checks for `n` being zero inside the loop.
   - The trade-off is that the code is slightly more complex due to the additional checks in the `isprime1` function. However, this is justified by the significant performance improvement.
