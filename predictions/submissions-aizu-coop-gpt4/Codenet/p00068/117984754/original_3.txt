Let's analyze the code first:

The code looks like a geometric computation using C++. It's using a common strategy to solve computational geometry problems - it defines the basic geometric objects like points, lines, circles, and polygons, and then it implements basic geometric operations like dot product, cross product, distance calculation, intersection check, etc.

The main function invokes a function named `convex_hull`, which is a common algorithm in computational geometry to find the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points in a given set. The convex hull algorithm is implemented using the Graham scan, which is known to have a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of input points. Therefore, the convex hull function is likely not a performance bottleneck, given that it's already using an efficient algorithm.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use of Efficient Data Structures: The data structures used in the code seem appropriate for the task. The use of array (`ps`) for storing points and the vector for storing the result of the convex hull are efficient choices.

2. Redundant Computations: There doesn't seem to be any unnecessary computation in the code.

3. Loop Optimization: The loops in the code seem necessary for the geometric computations. There doesn't seem to be any opportunity for loop unrolling or other loop optimizations. The inner loop in the `isSimple` function is a bit concerning since it could potentially lead to a O(n^2) complexity, but it's not used in the main function, so it doesn't affect the overall performance.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The code could potentially benefit from compiler optimizations. Since the code is computation-heavy, it could benefit from enabling maximum optimization level (like `-O3` in GCC). This will allow the compiler to perform optimizations like function inlining, loop unrolling, vectorization, etc., which can improve the computation speed.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Compiler Optimization: Enable maximum optimization level in the compiler. This can be done by adding `-O3` flag when compiling with GCC. This will allow the compiler to perform various optimizations like function inlining, loop unrolling, etc., which can improve the computation speed.

Optimized Code Block:

Since there doesn't seem to be any obvious optimization opportunities in the code itself, the optimized code will be identical to the original code, but it should be compiled with maximum optimization level for best performance. 

```c++
g++ -O3 code.cpp -o optimized_program
```

This command will compile the code with `-O3` optimization level, and the output binary will be named `optimized_program`.
