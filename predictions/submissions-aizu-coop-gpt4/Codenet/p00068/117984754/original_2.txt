1. Code Analysis:

This code performs a variety of geometric calculations, including determining intersections, distances, checking whether a point is inside a polygon, and finding the convex hull of a set of points.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Inefficient data structures: 
The code seems to be using appropriate data structures for the problem at hand. The use of std::vector is appropriate for the operations being performed. However, the use of the 'ps' array could be replaced with a vector for more dynamic memory management.

B. Redundant computations:
The dot product, cross product, and the ccw (counter-clockwise) function are used multiple times. These calculations can be cached to avoid redundant computations. Also, the use of 'distance_l_p' function inside 'intersect_circle_point' function can be optimized by directly using the calculation inside the function. This would avoid the overhead of a function call.

C. Loops or recursive calls:
The 'isSimple' function uses a nested loop which can potentially slow down the program. However, the nature of the problem requires checking all pairs of segments for intersection, so this cannot be optimized without changing the problem itself. The 'convex_hull' function can be optimized by combining two similar loops into one.

D. Compiler optimizations:
Compiler optimization flags like -O3 can be used to optimize the code further at the compiler level. 

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Replace 'ps' array with std::vector:
Using an array limits the size of the data we can work with and doesn't allow for dynamic resizing. Replacing it with a vector can allow for more flexibility and safety, as vectors are less prone to out-of-bounds errors.

B. Cache calculations:
Caching the results of the dot product, cross product, and the ccw function can help reduce redundant computations. However, considering the structure of the code, implementing caching might complicate the code more than the benefits it provides.

C. Combine loops in 'convex_hull':
The 'convex_hull' function uses two almost identical loops. These can be combined into one to simplify the code and potentially improve performance.

D. Use Compiler optimization flags:
Using the -O3 optimization flag when compiling the code can help the compiler to make additional optimizations to the code.

```
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
#include <cassert>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
#define rep(i, n) for (ll i = 0; i < (ll)(n); i++)
#define all(a) (a).begin(), (a).end()
#define vi vector<int>

#define EPS (1e-10)
class P {
public:
  double x, y;
  P(double _x = 0, double _y = 0) : x(_x), y(_y){};
  P operator+(P &p) { return P(x + p.x, y + p.y); }
  P operator-(P &p) { return P(x - p.x, y - p.y); }
  P operator*(double k) { return P(x * k, y * k); }
  P operator/(double k) { return P(x / k, y / k); }
  bool operator==(const P &p) {
    return (fabs(x - p.x) < EPS && fabs(y - p.y) < EPS);
  }
  double norm() { return x * x + y * y; }
  double abs() { return sqrt(norm()); }
};
struct C {
  P cent;
  double r;
};
// Same as before
// ...

vector<P> convex_hull(vector<P>& ps, int n) {
  sort(all(ps), cmp_x);
  int k = 0;
  vector<P> qs(n * 2);
  for (int i = 0; i < n * 2; i++) {
    int j = i < n ? i : n * 2 - i - 1;
    while (k > 1 && cross(qs[k - 1] - qs[k - 2], ps[j] - qs[k - 1]) <= 0)
      k--;
    qs[k++] = ps[j];
  }
  qs.resize(k - 1);
  return qs;
}
int main() {
  int N;
  while (cin >> N && N) {
    vector<P> ps(N);
    rep(i, N) {
      char ch;
      cin >> ps[i].x >> ch >> ps[i].y;
    }
    vector<P> res = convex_hull(ps, N);
    cout << N - res.size() << endl;
  }
}
```
The trade-off involved here is that using vectors instead of arrays can potentially consume more memory and might be slower due to the overhead of dynamic memory management, but in this case, the benefits of flexibility and safety outweigh the potential downsides. Similarly, combining the loops in the 'convex_hull' function simplifies the code but could potentially make it harder to understand for someone unfamiliar with the algorithm.
