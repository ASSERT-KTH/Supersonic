Code Analysis:
The given code is a simulation of a train track where trains can move in either direction ('<' represents left and '>' represents right). It reads characters from the standard input and uses an array to simulate a train track. The characters are moved left or right in the array based on the input. A possible performance bottleneck is the repeated use of getchar() to read characters one by one from the input.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use buffered I/O instead of getchar(): The use of getchar() to read characters one by one can be slow because it involves system calls, which are expensive in terms of time. Using a buffer to read in a chunk of data at once can be faster.

2. Reduce variable assignments: There are several unnecessary variable assignments that could be eliminated to speed up the program.

3. Minimize the use of if-else statements: Reducing the number of if-else statements can help speed up the program by reducing branching.

4. Use compiler optimization flags: Compile the code with optimization flags like -O2 or -O3 to allow the compiler to optimize the code further.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace getchar() with fgets(): fgets() allows us to read a line of input at once into a buffer, reducing the number of system calls compared to getchar().

2. Minimize variable assignments: Instead of assigning a new value to 't' every time we move a train, we can directly increment or decrement 't' in the array index. Similarly, we can directly check if 't' is less than 's' without assigning a new value to 's'.

3. Simplify if-else statements: Instead of using separate if-else statements to check for '<' and '>', we can use one if-else statement with a nested if statement. This reduces the number of conditions checked and makes the code faster.

4. Use compiler optimization flags: When compiling the code, use the -O2 or -O3 flags to enable more advanced compiler optimizations.

Optimized Code Block:

```C
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

const char NUL = '\0';

bool ope_line() {
  char train[52], line[104];
  int t = 25, s = 25;

  for (int i = 0; i < 52; ++i)
    train[i] = NUL;

  fgets(line, 104, stdin);
  
  int i = 0;
  train[t] = line[i++];

  while (line[i] != '\n' && line[i] != EOF) {
    if (line[i] == '<' && line[i+1] == '-') {
      train[--t] = line[i+2]; 
      if (t < s)
        s = t;
    } else if (line[i] == '-' && line[i+1] == '>') {
      train[++t] = line[i+2];
    }
    i += 3;
  }

  printf("%s\n", &train[s]);
  if (line[i] == EOF)
    return false;
  return true;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int n;
  scanf("%d\n", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!ope_line())
      break;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Compile the code with the -O2 flag:

```bash
gcc -O2 train_track_simulator.c -o train_track_simulator
```

This optimized code reduces the number of system calls, unnecessary variable assignments, and if-else statements, which should significantly improve its performance. However, it may be slightly more complex due to the use of an additional buffer and direct array index manipulation.
