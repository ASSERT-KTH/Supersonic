Code Analysis:

The code reads a number of input strings from the console, each string represents a sequence of train carriages, where the train's direction is denoted by either '<-' or '->'. The code stores these strings in a character array (train) and moves the train position according to the direction. If the train is moving to the left '<-', it decrements the train position and if it's moving to the right '->', it increments the train position.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Reducing the number of getchar() calls: The getchar() function is a blocking function, i.e., it waits for the user to provide input. This could potentially be a performance bottleneck if the user input is large. We can reduce the number of getchar() calls by using fgets() function to read an entire line at once.

2. Avoiding repeated checks for EOF: The current code checks for EOF in every iteration of the while loop. This is redundant and can be avoided.

3. Using more efficient data structures: The current code uses a char array to store the train. Since the train can move in both directions, a more appropriate data structure would be a deque (double-ended queue) which allows insertion and deletion at both ends. But to keep changes minimal, we will stick with the array.

4. Elimination of redundant variable: The variable `s` seems redundant and can be removed.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replacing getchar() with fgets(): We can replace the multiple getchar() calls with a single fgets() call. This will allow us to read an entire line at once, reducing the number of blocking I/O operations and potentially improving performance. We will then parse this line inside the while loop.

2. Avoiding repeated EOF checks: Instead of checking for EOF in every iteration of the while loop, we can check it once after fgets() call. If fgets() returns NULL, it means that we've reached EOF.

3. Elimination of redundant variable: We can eliminate the variable `s` and directly use `t` for the printf statement.

Trade-offs: 

1. The use of fgets() instead of getchar() might increase memory usage slightly since we need to store the entire line. However, the performance gain from reducing the blocking I/O operations makes this trade-off worthwhile.

Optimized Code:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
const char NUL = '\0';
#define MAX_LINE 200
bool ope_line() {
  char train[52];
  char line[MAX_LINE];
  int t = 25;
  for (int i = 0; i < 52; ++i)
    train[i] = NUL;
  if(fgets(line, MAX_LINE, stdin) == NULL)
    return false;
  int i=0;
  train[t] = line[i++];
  while (line[i] != '\n' && line[i] != EOF) {
    if (line[i] == '<' && line[i+1] == '-')
      train[--t] = line[i+3];
    else if (line[i] == '-' && line[i+1] == '>')
      train[++t] = line[i+3];
    i+=4;
  }
  printf("%s\n", &train[t]);
  return true;
}
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int n;
  scanf("%d\n", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!ope_line())
      break;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: MAX_LINE is set to 200 assuming that the input will not exceed this limit. It can be adjusted according to the specific requirements.
