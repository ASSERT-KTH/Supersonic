This C program reads a sequence of commands from the input, processes them according to certain rules, and prints a result string. Each command consists of a two-character operator ('<-' or '->') followed by a character to be added to the string. The operator determines where the character will be added: at the beginning ('<-') or at the end ('->') of the string.

The main performance bottlenecks in this code are:

1. Array 'train' is being used as a string buffer, but it has a fixed size and all its elements are initialized at every invocation of 'ope_line()'. This is an inefficient use of memory and CPU time.

2. The function 'getchar()' is being used to read the input. This function has a high overhead because it performs several operations (like checking for end-of-file or errors) every time it's called.

3. The loop inside 'ope_line()' checks for end-of-file twice: once inside the loop and once after the loop. This is redundant and slows down the program.

Here's the proposed optimization strategy:

1. Use dynamic memory allocation for 'train'. This avoids initializing all its elements at every invocation of 'ope_line()' and allows 'train' to grow as needed. Also, move the initialization of 'train' outside 'ope_line()' to avoid allocating and freeing memory at every invocation.

2. Replace 'getchar()' with 'fread()' to read the input. This function reads large blocks of data at once, which is faster than calling 'getchar()' multiple times.

3. Remove the redundant check for end-of-file inside the loop in 'ope_line()'. The check after the loop is sufficient.

4. Use compiler optimization flags to further improve performance. For example, '-O3' enables all optimization flags including those that could increase code size and compilation time.

Here is the optimized code:

```C
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024

bool process_line(char* train, int* s, int* t) {
  char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
  size_t n = fread(buffer, 1, BUFFER_SIZE, stdin);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    char a = buffer[i++];
    char b = buffer[i++];
    char c = buffer[i];
    if (a == '<' && b == '-') {
      train[--(*t)] = c;
      if (*t < *s)
        *s = *t;
    } else if (a == '-' && b == '>')
      train[++(*t)] = c;
  }
  printf("%s\n", &train[*s]);
  return n == BUFFER_SIZE;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int n;
  scanf("%d\n", &n);
  char* train = malloc(52 * n * sizeof(char));
  int s = 25 * n, t = s;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!process_line(train, &s, &t))
      break;
  }
  free(train);
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code reduces the number of calls to 'getchar()' and 'printf()', avoids initializing all elements of 'train' at every invocation of 'process_line()', and removes the redundant check for end-of-file. These changes should significantly improve the performance of the program. The trade-off is that the code is slightly more complex due to the use of dynamic memory allocation and a buffer for reading the input.
