**Code Analysis:**

This C++ code reads two integers, h and w, from the input and prints a grid of '#' characters of size h*w. The code continues to do this until it reads a pair of zeroes. It uses a stringstream to build the grid string and then outputs the final result.

The primary performance bottleneck in this code is the repeated use of the stringstream::operator<< function to append each character to the stringstream object. This operation has a time complexity of O(1), but because it is nested within two loops, the overall time complexity becomes O(h * w), which can be quite large for large values of h and w.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. Using string::append instead of stringstream: Stringstreams are generally slower than strings due to the additional overhead of maintaining the stream state. We can use the string::append function to append a string of '#' characters of length w to the grid string. This function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the string to be appended, but since we are appending the same string in each iteration of the outer loop, we can reduce the time complexity to O(h).

2. Reserving memory for the string: The string::append function can cause reallocations if the size of the string exceeds its capacity. We can avoid this by reserving enough memory for the string before appending to it.

3. Using '\n' instead of std::endl: std::endl flushes the output buffer, which can be a costly operation. We can use '\n' instead to achieve the same result without flushing the buffer.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Replace the stringstream ss with a string grid. This reduces the overhead of maintaining the stream state.
   
   ```cpp
   std::string grid;
   ```

2. Reserve enough memory for the grid string to avoid reallocations. The size of the grid string is h * (w + 1), where w is the number of '#' characters and 1 is for the '\n' character.

   ```cpp
   grid.reserve(h * (w + 1));
   ```

3. Replace the inner loop with the string::append function. This function appends a string of '#' characters of length w to the grid string.

   ```cpp
   grid.append(w, '#');
   grid += '\n';
   ```

4. Replace std::endl with '\n' to avoid flushing the output buffer.

   ```cpp
   std::cout << grid << '\n';
   ```
   
**Optimized Code Block:**

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  int h, w;
  for (;;) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::string grid;
    grid.reserve(h * (w + 1));
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      grid.append(w, '#');
      grid += '\n';
    }
    std::cout << grid << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
