Code Analysis:
The provided C++ code reads pair of integers (h, w) from the standard input until it encounters a pair (0, 0). For each pair (h, w), it outputs a rectangle of height h and width w, made up of '#' characters. The rectangle is built using a stringstream, and then output to the standard output.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use of stringstream: The stringstream is used to build the rectangle before outputting it. This is inefficient because it requires extra memory to store the rectangle, and extra time to convert the rectangle to a string.

2. Nested loops: The two for loops are used to build the rectangle. This is inefficient because the inner loop is executed h * w times.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace stringstream with direct output: Instead of building the rectangle in a stringstream and then outputting it, we can output the rectangle directly. This reduces memory usage and running time.

2. Use string repetition instead of inner loop: The inner loop is used to output a line of the rectangle. This can be replaced with a single output statement that repeats the '#' character w times. This reduces the number of output operations from h * w to h, significantly reducing the running time.

3. Trade-offs: The optimized code is slightly more complex because it uses string repetition, which may be unfamiliar to some programmers. However, the performance gain is significant, making this a worthwhile trade-off.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  int h, w;
  while (true) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::string line(w, '#');
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      std::cout << line << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, the stringstream is replaced with a string line that is built once for each rectangle, and then output h times. This reduces the number of output operations and eliminates the need for the stringstream. The inner loop is also replaced with string repetition, further reducing the number of output operations.
