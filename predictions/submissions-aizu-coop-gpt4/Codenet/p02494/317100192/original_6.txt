Code Analysis:

The given code reads two integers from the input, `h` and `w`, until they are both `0`. Then it creates a string of `#` characters in the shape of a rectangle of height `h` and width `w` using a `std::stringstream`. Finally, it prints the resulting string to the standard output. The potential performance issues in this code are:

1. Usage of `std::stringstream` to construct the string: This can be costly in terms of time complexity as the memory needs to be reallocated every time the string grows beyond its current capacity.

2. Multiple calls to `std::cout`: Each call to `std::cout` can be expensive, especially if the output is flushed to the console after every call.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a `std::string` with pre-allocated memory instead of `std::stringstream`: This will avoid unnecessary memory reallocations, improving the time complexity of the code.

2. Buffer the output before printing: This can be done by using a single call to `std::cout`.

3. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This will disable the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, leading to faster input and output operations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace `std::stringstream` with `std::string`: `std::stringstream` is often slower than `std::string` due to the overhead of stream manipulations. We can preallocate the size of the string to be `h * (w + 1)` to account for the `w` `#` characters and the newline character for each row.

2. Buffer the output before printing: Currently, the code prints the output for every rectangle. By buffering the output in a string, we can make a single call to `std::cout` at the end of the program, which will be faster.

3. Disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams: Adding `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` at the beginning of the program can speed up input and output operations.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

auto main() -> int {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int h, w;
  std::string buffer;
  buffer.reserve(1000000); // Reserve large enough memory upfront
  for (;;) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::string s(h * (w + 1), '#');
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      s[y * (w + 1) + w] = '\n';
    }
    buffer += s + "\n";
  }
  std::cout << buffer;
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This code assumes that the buffer size is large enough to hold all outputs. If the buffer size is not large enough, we may need to adjust the reserve size or handle the case where the buffer becomes full.
