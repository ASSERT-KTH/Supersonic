This C++ program reads pairs of integers from the standard input. For each pair, it builds a rectangle of hash signs ('#') with the given height and width, and then outputs it. The program stops when it receives a pair of zeroes.

There are several areas in the given code where efficiency can be improved:

1. **Inefficient String Building:** The nested for-loops are used to build a string of hash signs ('#') using a stringstream. This is inefficient because for each '#' character appended, the program may need to reallocate memory and copy the existing string to the new location.

2. **Redundant Output:** The program uses `std::endl` to add a newline and flush the output buffer. However, the buffer is automatically flushed when the program terminates, so this explicit flush is unnecessary.

Here is the optimization strategy:

1. **Use String Resizing and Indexing Instead of Stringstream:** We can avoid the overhead of stringstream by using a std::string directly. We can preallocate memory for the entire rectangle of hash signs and then fill it using array indexing, thus avoiding the need for frequent memory reallocations.

2. **Replace std::endl with '\n':** Instead of using `std::endl` to add a new line, we can use the newline character ('\n'). This will still add a newline but won't flush the buffer, which can improve performance.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

auto main() -> int {
  int h, w;
  for (;;) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::string rectangle(h * (w + 1), '#');  // preallocate memory for the entire rectangle
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      rectangle[y * (w + 1) + w] = '\n';  // replace the last '#' in each row with '\n'
    }
    std::cout << rectangle << '\n';  // replace std::endl with '\n'
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the stringstream has been replaced with a std::string. This string is preallocated with enough memory for the entire rectangle of hash signs, including the newline characters at the end of each row. Then, a loop goes through each row and replaces the last '#' character with a '\n'. Finally, the rectangle is printed out, followed by a newline character. This version should run faster due to fewer memory allocations and lack of buffer flushing after every rectangle.
