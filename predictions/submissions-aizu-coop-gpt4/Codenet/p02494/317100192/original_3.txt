This program reads in pairs of integers (h, w) from the standard input, and for each pair, prints a rectangle of '#' characters of height h and width w. The program ends when it reads in a pair of zeros (0, 0).

The performance and memory usage of this program can be improved in the following ways:

1. Avoid using `std::stringstream`: `std::stringstream` is a heavy object which can affect the performance if used excessively. It is used here for string concatenation, which can be done more efficiently using other methods.

2. Directly write to `std::cout`: Instead of first creating the string using `std::stringstream` and then writing it to the output, you can directly write to `std::cout`. This will save memory as you won't need to store the string, and it will also be faster as you will avoid the overhead of creating and managing the `std::stringstream` object.

3. Use `std::string` with repeated character constructor: Instead of using a loop to create a string of '#' characters, you can use the constructor of `std::string` which creates a string with a specified number of repetitions of a given character. This will be faster as it can use memory more efficiently.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  int h, w;
  for (;;) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::string row(w, '#');  // create a string of '#' characters
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      std::cout << row << '\n';  // directly output the string
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program is simpler, uses less memory and should also be faster. The trade-off is that the code may be slightly less flexible, as it is now more specialized for this specific kind of output. However, for this specific task, this is a good trade-off to make.
