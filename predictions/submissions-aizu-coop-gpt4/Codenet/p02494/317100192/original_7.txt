This C++ program reads pairs of integers from the standard input, and for each pair of integers, it prints a rectangle of `'#'` characters with the given height and width. This continues until the pair of integers is `(0, 0)`.

Code Analysis:
The potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage in this program are:
1. The use of `std::stringstream` to build the string before printing.
2. The use of nested loops to build each row of the rectangle.

Optimization Strategy:
1. We can avoid using `std::stringstream` and directly print the character '#' to the standard output. This will save the cost of constructing the string beforehand, but at the expense of possibly making more system calls.
2. We can use `std::string`'s constructor that takes a count and a character to build each row of the rectangle, instead of using a loop.

Step-By-Step Explanation:
1. To print the character '#' to the standard output, we replace `ss << '#';` with `std::cout << '#';`. This avoids the need to construct a string in memory before printing, but may make more system calls if the standard output is unbuffered. The trade-off is between memory usage and system call overhead.
2. To build each row of the rectangle, we replace the inner loop with a single call to `std::string`'s constructor that takes a count and a character. This constructs a string of a given length filled with a given character. This avoids the need to repeatedly append to a string, which may cause multiple memory allocations if the string needs to grow. The trade-off is between memory usage and time complexity.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  int h, w;
  while (true) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::string row(w, '#');  // Create a row of '#' characters
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      std::cout << row << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
