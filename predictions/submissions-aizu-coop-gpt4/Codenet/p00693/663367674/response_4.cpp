Code Analysis:
The provided code seems to be a network message filtering system that accepts or rejects incoming messages based on certain rules. Each rule is either a "permit" or "deny" rule, and each message has a source and destination. The rules and messages can contain wildcard characters. The system processes the rules and the messages, and then outputs the messages which are permitted and not denied by any rule.

The code has several places that can be optimized:

1. String comparison and string copying functions are implemented manually, which might not be as efficient as built-in functions. 

2. The arrays OK and NOT are traversed multiple times in a nested loop fashion for comparison, resulting in O(N^2) complexity. 

3. Queue Q is being used to store the final messages. The size of Q is printed and then all its elements are dequeued one by one to print the messages. This can be optimized using a vector, reducing the complexity of dequeuing.

4. The code uses scanf and printf for input/output operations. These can be slower compared to cin and cout in C++.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use built-in functions like strcmp() and strcpy() instead of manually defined ones.

2. Use a map or unordered_map to store the OK and NOT rules. This would improve the time complexity of the lookup operations from O(N) to O(1).

3. Use a vector instead of queue Q to store the final messages. It will provide quick access to the size and elements.

4. Use cin and cout for input/output operations, as they are faster than scanf and printf in C++. Also, to make these operations even faster, we can use std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false).

5. Use string instead of char arrays for easier and more efficient manipulation.

6. The code includes <bits/stdc++.h>, which includes all the standard library headers. It's not recommended to use this header in production code as it increases compilation time. Instead, only include necessary headers.

7. The code uses global variables, which is not a good practice. We can pass them as arguments to functions or use them as local variables if possible.
