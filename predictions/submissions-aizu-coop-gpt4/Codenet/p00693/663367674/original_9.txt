### Code Analysis

The code is a message filtering system. It reads messages one by one and checks if they are allowed or not. Rules for allowing or disallowing messages are defined in the first part of the input.

The code seems to work correctly, but it has some inefficiencies that could be optimized.

1. The function `strCmp` is used to compare two strings. Instead of using this custom function, we can use the standard library function `strcmp` which is likely to be more optimized.
2. The function `ambiguousCmp` checks if two strings are equal, treating '?' as a wildcard. This function can be optimized by breaking the loop as soon as a non-matching character (other than '?') is found.
3. The `strcpy` function is also a reimplementation of a standard library function. We can use `strcpy` from the standard library.
4. Some loops in the `func` function are doing a lot of unnecessary work. For example, there are two nested loops that go through all pairs of `OK` and `NOT` rules, even if they have already been marked as `erased`. This can be optimized by using a more efficient data structure or algorithm.
5. The `queue` `Q` is used to store the allowed messages. However, the size of the queue is printed out before the messages are printed. This requires storing all the messages in the queue before they can be printed out. If there are many messages, this could consume a lot of memory. This can be optimized by counting and printing the messages as they are read.

### Optimization Strategy

1. Replace `strCmp` with `strcmp`.
2. Optimize `ambiguousCmp` by breaking the loop as soon as a non-matching character (other than '?') is found.
3. Replace the `strcpy` function with the standard library function.
4. Optimize the loops in the `func` function by avoiding unnecessary comparisons. This can be done by sorting the `OK` and `NOT` arrays by `rank`, and then using a two-pointer technique to compare them.
5. Optimize the printing of the allowed messages by counting and printing them as they are read, instead of storing them in a queue.

These optimizations should improve both the time complexity and the memory usage of the program.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. The function `strCmp` can be replaced with the standard library function `strcmp`. This is likely to be faster because it is highly optimized. It also reduces the size of the code, making it easier to understand and maintain.
2. The function `ambiguousCmp` can be optimized by adding a `break` statement as soon as a non-matching character (other than '?') is found. This reduces the number of iterations in the worst case from the length of the string to the position of the first non-matching character.
3. The `strcpy` function can be replaced with the standard library function. This is likely to be faster and more reliable, because it has been thoroughly tested and optimized.
4. The loops in the `func` function can be optimized by sorting the `OK` and `NOT` arrays by `rank`. This allows us to use a two-pointer technique to compare the arrays, instead of using nested loops. The two-pointer technique iterates through each array only once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), instead of O(n^2) for the nested loops.
5. The printing of the allowed messages can be optimized by counting and printing them as they are read, instead of storing them in a queue. This reduces the memory usage of the program, especially when there are many messages to be printed.

### Trade-offs

1. Using standard library functions instead of custom functions reduces the size of the code and makes it easier to understand and maintain. However, it also means that we are relying on the performance of the standard library functions, which we cannot control or optimize.
2. Optimizing the `ambiguousCmp` function and the loops in the `func` function reduces the time complexity of the program, making it faster. However, it also makes the code more complex, which could make it harder to understand and maintain.
3. Printing the messages as they are read, instead of storing them in a queue, reduces the memory usage of the program. However, it also means that we cannot change the order of the messages after they are read, which could be a problem if the order of the messages is important.
