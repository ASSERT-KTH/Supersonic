**Code Analysis:**

1. This code seems to be implementing a kind of filtering mechanism on certain data sets, which are represented by structures. The structures (`Info` and `Data`) are populated based on user input.

2. The program contains some inefficient memory usage. It uses arrays of structures (`OK[N]`, `NOT[N]`) which are allocated on stack and may lead to stack overflow for large inputs of N. 

3. String comparisons are done manually, which could be inefficient and prone to errors. Standard library functions like `strcmp` are optimized and should be used instead.

4. The code is using multiple nested loops, which may increase time complexity.

5. The usage of `queue` to store and print the final output can be avoided. This can save memory and avoid unnecessary operations of pushing and popping from the queue.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Data Structures:** Rather than using arrays of structures, we can use std::vector which manages its memory dynamically and efficiently.

2. **String Comparison:** We can replace the `strCmp` and `ambiguousCmp` functions with the optimized and error-free `strcmp` and `strncmp` functions from the standard library.

3. **Optimize Loops:** We can try to minimize nested loops where possible.

4. **Avoid Queue for Output:** Instead of using a queue to store and print the final output, we can print the output directly when it is ready. This will avoid the overhead of pushing and popping from the queue.

5. **Compiler Optimizations:** We can use some compiler flags for optimization, such as `-O3`, which tells the compiler to perform high-level optimizations such as inline function expansion, loop unrolling, and vectorization. We have to be careful with this, as it can sometimes make debugging more difficult.

**Optimized Code Block:**

Here's the optimized version:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

struct Info {
    char from[9];
    char to[9];
    int rank;
    bool erased;
};

struct Data {
    char from[9];
    char to[9];
    char message[51];
};

int main() {
    while (true) {
        int N, M;
        cin >> N >> M;
        if (N == 0 && M == 0)
            break;

        vector<Info> OK, NOT;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            char buf[10], from[9], to[9];
            cin >> buf >> from >> to;

            if (buf[0] == 'p') {
                OK.push_back({from, to, i, false});
            } else {
                NOT.push_back({from, to, i, false});
            }
        }

        for (int i = NOT.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int k = OK.size() - 1; k >= 0; k--) {
                if (NOT[i].rank < OK[k].rank || OK[k].erased)
                    continue;
                if (strcmp(NOT[i].from, OK[k].from) == 0 && strcmp(NOT[i].to, OK[k].to) == 0) {
                    OK[k].erased = true;
                }
            }
        }

        for (int i = OK.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int k = NOT.size() - 1; k >= 0; k--) {
                if (OK[i].rank < NOT[k].rank || NOT[k].erased)
                    continue;
                if (strcmp(OK[i].from, NOT[k].from) == 0 && strcmp(OK[i].to, NOT[k].to) == 0) {
                    NOT[k].erased = true;
                }
            }
        }

        int numMessages = 0;
        for (int loop = 0; loop < M; loop++) {
            Data data;
            cin >> data.from >> data.to >> data.message;
            bool FLG = false;
            for (const auto &i : OK) {
                if (i.erased)
                    continue;
                if (strncmp(i.from, data.from, strlen(i.from)) == 0 && strncmp(i.to, data.to, strlen(i.to)) == 0) {
                    FLG = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!FLG)
                continue;
            FLG = true;
            for (const auto &i : NOT) {
                if (i.erased)
                    continue;
                if (strncmp(i.from, data.from, strlen(i.from)) == 0 && strncmp(i.to, data.to, strlen(i.to)) == 0) {
                    FLG = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (FLG) {
                numMessages++;
                cout << data.from << " " << data.to << " " << data.message << "\n";
            }
        }
        cout << numMessages << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code incorporates the aforementioned strategies, which should lead to better performance in terms of both running time and memory usage.
