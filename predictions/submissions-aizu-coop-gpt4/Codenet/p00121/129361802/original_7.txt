The given C++ code appears to be solving a puzzle (possibly a sliding puzzle) using a breadth-first search. In such a puzzle, you are given an initial state, and your task is to find the shortest sequence of moves that reaches the goal state. 

In the given code, the initial state of the puzzle is read from the input, and the goal state appears to be hardcoded as the number 1234567. The puzzle states are internally represented as numbers, and the "moves" in the puzzle correspond to swapping the digits of the numbers.

Here's a strategy for optimizing this code:

1. **Avoid unnecessary memory allocations:** The `bitset<80000000> vis` is a very large bitset and is reset at the start of each `bfs()` call. Instead of using a bitset, a smaller, dynamic data structure like `unordered_set` can be used to keep track of visited states.

2. **Minimize use of expensive operations:** The `atoi` function is used to convert the input string to an integer. This conversion could be performed manually while reading the input, thus avoiding the need for a separate function call.

3. **Loop optimization:** The given code has several loops that could benefit from optimization. For instance, the conversion of an integer to an array of digits is performed inside a loop, and this conversion could be optimized.

4. **Compiler optimizations:** Use compiler flags for optimization such as `-O3` for GCC or `/O2` for MSVC. 

5. **Improve I/O performance:** The use of `scanf` and `printf` for I/O can be slower compared to C++ I/O functions. Replace them with `cin` and `cout` and use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to speed up I/O operations.

Let's optimize the code step by step:

1. **Avoid unnecessary memory allocations:** Replace `bitset<80000000> vis` with `unordered_set<int> vis`.

2. **Minimize use of expensive operations:** Replace `atoi(bj)` with manual conversion while reading the input.

3. **Loop optimization:** Optimize the conversion of an integer to an array of digits.

4. **Compiler optimizations:** Add compiler optimization flags.

5. **Improve I/O performance:** Replace `scanf`, `printf`, and `getchar` with their C++ counterparts.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int zzzt[8] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
int bj[8];
unordered_set<int> vis;
struct pt {
    int ztt;
    int lwz;
    int step;
};
int bs, front = 1, back = 1, tt;
pt dl[1 << 16];
int ddd[8] = {10000000, 1000000, 100000, 10000, 1000, 100, 10, 1};
void bfs() {
    tt = bs = 0;
    front = back = 1;
    vis.clear();
    int cs = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) cs = cs * 10 + bj[i];
    vis.insert(cs);
    pt lsss;
    lsss.ztt = cs;
    lsss.lwz = find(bj, bj + 8, 0) - bj;
    lsss.step = 0;
    dl[back++] = lsss;
    while (front < back) {
        pt ls1 = dl[front++];
        if (ls1.ztt == 1234567) {
            bs = ls1.step;
            tt = 1;
            return;
        }
        pt lsjr;
        int kkk[4] = {-1, 1, -4, 4};
        int sss[9];
        int tt = ls1.ztt;
        for (register int i = 7; i >= 0; --i) {
            sss[i] = tt % 10;
            tt /= 10;
        }
        for (register int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
            lsjr.lwz = ls1.lwz + kkk[i];
            if ((ls1.lwz == 3 && lsjr.lwz == 4) || (ls1.lwz == 4 && lsjr.lwz == 3))
                continue;
            if (lsjr.lwz >= 0 && lsjr.lwz <= 7) {
                swap(sss[lsjr.lwz], sss[ls1.lwz]);
                lsjr.ztt = 0;
                for (register int i = 0; i <= 7; ++i) {
                    lsjr.ztt *= 10;
                    lsjr.ztt += sss[i];
                }
                swap(sss[lsjr.lwz], sss[ls1.lwz]);
                if (!vis.count(lsjr.ztt)) {
                    lsjr.step = ls1.step + 1;
                    vis.insert(lsjr.ztt);
                    dl[back++] = lsjr;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    while (1) {
        for(int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
            if(!(cin >> bj[i])) return 0;
        }
        bfs();
        if (tt) cout << bs << "\n";
        else cout << "-1\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code should now perform better than the original one. The `unordered_set` will keep the memory usage under control, and the loops have been optimized for better performance. The use of C++ I/O functions should also speed up the I/O operations.
