Code Analysis:

The given code appears to implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to solve some sort of puzzle, likely a sliding tile puzzle. The most noticeable performance bottleneck is the BFS algorithm itself, which has a time complexity of O(V+E) and a space complexity of O(V). In this case, V is the number of vertices (or states in the puzzle), and E is the number of edges (or transitions between states). 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Data Structures: The BFS uses a queue and a bitset to track visited states. The queue implementation seems efficient enough, but the bitset is excessively large, which may lead to inefficient memory usage. A more memory-efficient alternative would be a hash set, which only stores the visited states. However, this may lead to a trade-off in time complexity.

2. Redundant Computations: The code converts the state to a string and back to an integer multiple times within the main loop of the BFS. This is highly inefficient and can be optimized.

3. Loop Optimization: The BFS loop cannot be unrolled or optimized using tail recursion because each iteration depends on the previous one. However, the loops that convert the state to a string and back can be optimized.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations such as -O2 or -O3 can be used to further optimize the code. However, these should be used with caution, as they can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the bitset with a hash set: This will reduce the memory usage significantly. The trade-off is that hash set operations are slightly slower than bitset operations, but this is unlikely to have a significant impact on performance in this case. 

2. Eliminate redundant computations: Instead of converting the state to a string and back to an integer in each iteration of the BFS loop, we can maintain the state as both an integer and a string. This will reduce the time complexity significantly at the cost of a slight increase in memory usage.

3. Optimize the loops that convert the state to a string and back: These loops can be optimized using bit manipulation techniques, which are typically faster than arithmetic operations.

4. Use compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations such as -O2 or -O3 can be used to further optimize the code. These can lead to significant performance improvements, but they should be used with caution, as they can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.
