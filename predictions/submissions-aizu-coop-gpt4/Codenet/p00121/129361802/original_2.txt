The provided code is a BFS (Breadth First Search) based solution to solve the 8-puzzle problem. The program reads 8 characters from the input, with each character representing a tile's number in the puzzle. The character '0' represents the blank tile. The goal state of the puzzle is to reach the arrangement '12345670'. The BFS approach is used to find the minimum number of steps to reach the goal state from the initial state.

## Code Analysis
The major performance bottleneck in this code is the use of BFS for solving the puzzle, which involves a lot of unnecessary computation and memory usage. The `bitset` `vis` is massive and may cause memory issues. A BFS solution checks all possible states of the puzzle, even if they are not on the optimal path to the goal state, which results in increased time complexity.

## Optimization Strategy

1. Use a more efficient algorithm: A* algorithm is a more efficient alternative for solving the 8-puzzle problem. This algorithm uses a heuristic to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a certain state, which reduces the number of states it has to check.

2. Efficient data structure: In the current code, a `bitset` is used to store whether a state has been visited or not. This requires a lot of memory. A `map` or `unordered_map` can be used instead, which only stores the states that have been visited.

## Step-by-step Explanation

1. Replace BFS with A* algorithm: A* algorithm is informed search algorithm, it uses a heuristic function that provides an estimate of the cost of the path from a state to the goal state. This allows the algorithm to prioritize states that are more likely to lead to an optimal solution. This reduces the number of states that the algorithm needs to check, and hence, reduces the time complexity.

2. Use `unordered_map` instead of `bitset`: An `unordered_map` only stores the states that have been visited, which reduces the memory usage. Also, as the states are hashed in an `unordered_map`, the time complexity for checking whether a state has been visited or not is O(1), which is the same as `bitset`.

## Optimized Code Block
It's challenging to optimize the existing code due to the complexity involved in changing the approach from BFS to A*. Hence, a rewrite is necessary. Note that the optimized code needs the external library `boost` for the `hash_combine` function. If you can't use `boost`, you need to implement a custom hash function.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <boost/functional/hash.hpp>
using namespace std;

struct State {
    vector<int> puzzle;
    int zero_pos;
    int g;
    int h;
    bool operator<(const State& rhs) const { return g + h > rhs.g + rhs.h; }
};

struct StateHasher {
    size_t operator()(const State& s) const {
        size_t seed = 0;
        boost::hash_combine(seed, boost::hash_range(s.puzzle.begin(), s.puzzle.end()));
        boost::hash_combine(seed, s.zero_pos);
        return seed;
    }
};

vector<int> goal_puzzle(8);

int heuristic(const vector<int>& puzzle) {
    int h = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
        if (puzzle[i] != 0)
            h += abs(puzzle[i] - goal_puzzle[i]);
    }
    return h;
}

unordered_map<State, int, StateHasher> dist;

void solve(State start) {
    priority_queue<State> q;
    start.g = 0;
    start.h = heuristic(start.puzzle);
    dist[start] = start.g;
    q.push(start);
    vector<int> dx = {-1, 1, -3, 3};
    while (!q.empty()) {
        State current = q.top();
        q.pop();
        if (current.puzzle == goal_puzzle) {
            return;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
            State next = current;
            next.zero_pos += dx[i];
            if (next.zero_pos < 0 || next.zero_pos >= 8 || (current.zero_pos == 2 && next.zero_pos == 3) || (current.zero_pos == 3 && next.zero_pos == 2))
                continue;
            swap(next.puzzle[next.zero_pos], next.puzzle[current.zero_pos]);
            next.g = current.g + 1;
            next.h = heuristic(next.puzzle);
            if (!dist.count(next) || next.g < dist[next]) {
                dist[next] = next.g;
                q.push(next);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Input and output handling...
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, the `solve` function implements the A* search algorithm to solve the 8-puzzle problem. The `State` struct represents each state of the puzzle, and the `StateHasher` struct is a custom hash function for the `State` struct. The `dist` unordered map stores the minimum cost to reach each state. The `heuristic` function calculates the heuristic value of a state.
