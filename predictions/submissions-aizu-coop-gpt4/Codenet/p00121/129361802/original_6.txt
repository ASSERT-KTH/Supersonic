First, let's analyze the code:

This C++ program appears to solve a kind of puzzle, possibly a sliding tile puzzle, where the goal is to reach a certain configuration (1234567) starting from an arbitrary configuration. It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path to the goal configuration.

1. Code Analysis:
   - Global variables are used extensively, which can be a source of errors and can make the code difficult to understand or modify.
   - The BFS function is not parameterized and relies on global state, making it less reusable.
   - The bitset 'vis' is very large, which could be a problem if memory is a concern. The size of the bitset is fixed and does not adapt to the problem size.
   - The BFS function uses a large amount of stack space due to the creation of numerous pt structs.
   - The code uses atoi and strchr functions, which can be slow compared to arithmetic operations.
   - The code has magic numbers (1234567, 4, 7, etc.), which makes it hard to understand and maintain.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Minimize the use of global variables and pass them as function parameters where necessary.
   - Use arithmetic operations instead of atoi and strchr for performance.
   - Use an std::queue for BFS instead of handling the queue manually.
   - Use std::unordered_set instead of a bitset to track visited states. This saves memory and adapts to the problem size.
   - Replace magic numbers with named constants to improve readability and maintainability.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   - Replace global variables with local variables and function parameters. This makes the code easier to understand and modify, and it allows the BFS function to be reused with different input parameters.
   - Replace atoi and strchr with arithmetic calculations. This should improve performance because atoi and strchr have to parse the entire string, while arithmetic operations can process one digit at a time.
   - Use std::queue to handle the BFS queue instead of managing the queue indices manually. This simplifies the code and reduces the chance of making mistakes.
   - Use std::unordered_set to track visited states instead of a bitset. This can save a lot of memory if the problem size is smaller than the size of the bitset. It also allows the size to adapt to the problem size, which the bitset does not do.
   - Replace magic numbers with named constants. This makes the code easier to read and understand, and it reduces the chance of making a mistake when changing the code.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <queue>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

const int GOAL = 1234567;
const int MAX_DIGITS = 8;
const int MAX_STATES = 1 << 16;
const int DIRECTIONS[4] = {-1, 1, -4, 4};

struct State {
  int number;
  int zeroPos;
  int steps;
};

int bfs(char* initial) {
  unordered_set<int> visited;
  queue<State> statesQueue;

  int initialNumber = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < MAX_DIGITS; ++i) {
    initialNumber = initialNumber * 10 + (initial[i] - '0');
  }

  State initialState = {initialNumber, strchr(initial, '0') - initial, 0};
  statesQueue.push(initialState);
  visited.insert(initialNumber);

  while (!statesQueue.empty()) {
    State state = statesQueue.front();
    statesQueue.pop();

    if (state.number == GOAL) {
      return state.steps;
    }

    for (int direction : DIRECTIONS) {
      State nextState = state;
      nextState.zeroPos += direction;

      if ((state.zeroPos == 3 && nextState.zeroPos == 4) || (state.zeroPos == 4 && nextState.zeroPos == 3)) {
        continue;
      }

      if (nextState.zeroPos >= 0 && nextState.zeroPos < MAX_DIGITS) {
        int digitPos = MAX_DIGITS - 1 - nextState.zeroPos;
        int mask = 1 << digitPos;
        nextState.number = (state.number & ~mask) | ((state.number >> 1) & mask);
        if (!visited.count(nextState.number)) {
          nextState.steps++;
          statesQueue.push(nextState);
          visited.insert(nextState.number);
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return -1;
}

int main() {
  char initial[MAX_DIGITS];
  while (scanf("%c", &initial[0]) != EOF) {
    scanf("%*c");
    for (int i = 1; i < MAX_DIGITS - 1; ++i) {
      scanf("%c%*c", &initial[i]);
    }
    scanf("%c", &initial[MAX_DIGITS - 1]);

    int steps = bfs(initial);
    printf("%d\n", steps);

    while (getchar() != '\n');
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should be much faster and use less memory than the original code. It also improves the readability and maintainability of the code.
