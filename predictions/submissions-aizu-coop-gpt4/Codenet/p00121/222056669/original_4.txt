This code implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to solve a puzzle. The puzzle is a number sequence with 8 digits, where the digit "0" acts as a blank space that can be swapped with adjacent digits. The goal is to reach the sequence "1234567". The number sequence is read from the standard input, and the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is written to the standard output.

The code has several potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. `memset` is used to clear the `vis` array in each iteration of the main loop. This operation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the array.

2. The `ck`, `sb`, and `cb` macros perform bit manipulation operations on the `vis` array. These operations could potentially be optimized.

3. The BFS implementation creates copies of the `pt` structure, which may be inefficient.

4. The usage of `scanf` and `printf` functions for input and output could be slowing down the program.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Instead of using `memset` to clear the `vis` array, we can use a versioning scheme. We keep a separate `vis_ver` array that stores the version of the last visit to each index. We also keep a global version counter that is incremented in each iteration of the main loop. When we want to check if an index has been visited, we check if the version of the last visit is the current version. This avoids the need to clear the `vis` array in each iteration.

2. We replace the `ck`, `sb`, and `cb` macros with inline functions. This makes the code easier to read and understand, and the compiler can still inline these functions for performance.

3. Instead of creating copies of the `pt` structure in the BFS implementation, we use a queue of pointers to `pt` structures. This avoids the need to copy the entire structure.

4. We replace the `scanf` and `printf` functions with faster I/O functions, such as `getchar_unlocked` and `putchar_unlocked`.

Following is the optimized C/C++ code. Note that the functionality and output of the code are preserved. The code has been commented to highlight the changes and optimizations made.
