1. Code Analysis:

The provided C++ code is a console application that reads a set of coordinates from standard input and performs calculations based on these coordinates. The code currently uses a vector of vectors to store the coordinates and then sorts each vector before performing calculations. The calculations involve square root operations and binary searches within each vector.

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies include:

- The use of vector of vectors to store the coordinates. Depending on the input, this could lead to inefficient memory usage.
- The repeated sorting of vectors. This is a costly operation that takes O(n log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the vector.
- The use of `sqrt` function inside a loop, which is a costly operation and repeated usage can slow down the code.
- The use of `upper_bound` and `lower_bound` functions inside a loop, which perform binary search and hence can slow down the code.
- The use of `scanf` and `cout` for input and output operations. These are slower compared to other I/O functions in C++.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    A. The data structure used for storing coordinates could be optimized. A possible alternative could be a two-dimensional array or a single-dimensional array if we can map two coordinates to a single index.
    
    B. Instead of sorting the vectors repeatedly, we could sort it once after all the coordinates have been added.
    
    C. We can calculate the square root outside the loop and then use that value inside the loop.
    
    D. Instead of using `upper_bound` and `lower_bound` functions, we could use a direct access data structure like array, which provides O(1) time complexity for access.
    
    E. For improving the I/O operations, we can use `fastio` method which is faster in comparison to `scanf` and `cout`.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    A. Instead of using vector of vectors, we can use a 2D array to store the coordinates. This would reduce the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation done by vectors. However, the trade-off is that arrays are of fixed size and hence they can consume more memory if the total number of coordinates is less.
    
    B. We can sort the array only once after all the coordinates have been added. This would reduce the time complexity from O(n log n) per vector to O(n log n) for the whole array. The trade-off is that we need to make sure all coordinates are added before we sort the array.
    
    C. Rather than calculating the square root in each iteration of the loop, we can calculate it once before the loop starts and use that value inside the loop. This would reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(1). The trade-off is that we need to ensure the value of `D` does not change inside the loop.
    
    D. Instead of using `upper_bound` and `lower_bound` functions, we can use a direct access data structure like array. This would reduce the time complexity from O(log n) to O(1). The trade-off is that arrays are of fixed size and hence they can consume more memory if the total number of coordinates is less.
    
    E. To improve the I/O operations, we can use `fastio` method which is faster in comparison to `scanf` and `cout`. The trade-off is that `fastio` is not standard C++ and might not be supported on all platforms or compilers.
