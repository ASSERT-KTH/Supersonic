Let's break down the code and see where we can potentially optimize it:

1. Code Analysis:

    - The first loop is used to clear the vector array. This is necessary as the previous data needs to be discarded before each new input.
    - The second loop is used to read the coordinates and store the x-values in the vector array indexed by y-values. This is a necessary step to store the data for further processing.
    - The third loop sorts each vector in the vector array. This is necessary for the binary search performed later using `lower_bound` and `upper_bound`.
    - The last loop is used to count the points that lie within a given distance from each of the bN points. This is the main computation step.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    A. Data Structures:
    
        - The given program uses a vector of vectors to store the x coordinates indexed by the y coordinates. This is an efficient data structure for this purpose as it allows fast access and insertion.

    B. Redundant Computations:
    
        - The calculation of `m` inside the innermost loop is redundant as `m` depends only on `p` which is not modified inside this loop. Thus, `m` can be calculated once for each `p`.

    C. Loops and Recursive Calls:
    
        - The sorting of each vector can be optimized by inserting the elements in sorted order. This can be achieved by using a `set` instead of a `vector`.

    D. Compiler Optimizations:
    
        - Compiler optimizations such as `-O2` or `-O3` can be used to further optimize the program.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    A. Redundant Computations:
    
        - Move the calculation of `m` outside the innermost loop. This will reduce the number of computations as `m` is calculated once for each `p` instead of for each point in `v[y + p]`.

    B. Loops and Recursive Calls:
    
        - Replace the `vector` with a `set` in the vector array. This will maintain the elements in sorted order, eliminating the need to sort the vectors. However, this may increase the insertion time from O(1) to O(log n). But as we are inserting only once and then performing multiple binary searches, this trade-off is justified.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
set<int> v[10000];
int main() {
  int aN, bN, R;
  while (cin >> aN >> bN >> R, aN) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
      v[i].clear();
    for (int i = 0; i < aN; i++) {
      int x, y;
      scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);
      v[y].insert(x);
    }
    int D = 4 * R, ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < bN; i++) {
      int x, y;
      scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);
      for (int p = -D; p <= D; p++) {
        if (y + p < 0 || y + p >= 10000)
          continue;
        int m = sqrt((D - p) * (D + p));
        ans += upper_bound(v[y + p].begin(), v[y + p].end(), x + m) -
               lower_bound(v[y + p].begin(), v[y + p].end(), x - m);
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
