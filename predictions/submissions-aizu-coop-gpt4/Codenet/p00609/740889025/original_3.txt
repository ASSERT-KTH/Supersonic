Code Analysis:
This code is performing a range search operation on a 2D plane. The primary data structure used is an array of vectors where the index represents the y-coordinate and the vector contains all x-coordinates for that y. For each search operation, it checks all y-coordinates within a given range, and for each y-coordinate, it finds the range of x-coordinates that are within the search radius. The primary potential performance bottlenecks include:

1. The sort operation in the loop that populates the vectors.
2. The binary search operations (upper_bound and lower_bound) inside the innermost loop.
3. The sqrt operation inside the innermost loop.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Data Structures: The current data structure (array of vectors) is efficient for this task. But instead of populating the vector and sorting it every time, we can keep it sorted as we insert elements using a balanced binary search tree. In C++, this can be done using a set or multiset.

2. Redundant Computations: The sqrt computation is done for every bN and for every y-coordinate in the range. We can precompute the values and store them in an array to avoid redundant computations.

3. Loops: The loop that inserts elements into the vectors and sorts them can be optimized by inserting elements in a sorted manner.

4. Other: We can use fast I/O operations to speed up the reading and writing process.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Instead of using a vector and sort operation, use a multiset. This data structure keeps the elements in a sorted manner as they are inserted, eliminating the need for sorting every time. 

2. Precompute sqrt values for (D - p) * (D + p) before the major loop starts. Store them in an array to avoid redundant computations.

3. Use fast I/O operations. In C++, this can be done by adding these lines at the start of the main function:

```c++
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
cin.tie(NULL);
```
This will significantly speed up cin and cout operations.

4. Remove the need for the first loop that clears the vectors by declaring the data structure inside the while loop.

Optimized Code Block:
```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int aN, bN, R;
  while (cin >> aN >> bN >> R, aN) {
    multiset<int> v[10000];
    vector<int> sqrt_values(4 * R + 1);
    for (int p = -4 * R; p <= 4 * R; p++)
      sqrt_values[p + 4 * R] = sqrt((4 * R - p) * (4 * R + p));
    for (int i = 0; i < aN; i++) {
      int x, y;
      cin >> x >> y;
      v[y].insert(x);
    }
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < bN; i++) {
      int x, y;
      cin >> x >> y;
      for (int p = -4 * R; p <= 4 * R; p++) {
        if (y + p < 0 || y + p >= 10000)
          continue;
        int m = sqrt_values[p + 4 * R];
        ans += upper_bound(v[y + p].begin(), v[y + p].end(), x + m) -
               lower_bound(v[y + p].begin(), v[y + p].end(), x - m);
      }
    }
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
}
```
This optimized code uses a multiset instead of a vector to keep x-coordinates sorted, and precomputes sqrt values to avoid redundant computations. It also uses fast I/O operations to speed up cin and cout. The functionality and output of the original code are preserved.
