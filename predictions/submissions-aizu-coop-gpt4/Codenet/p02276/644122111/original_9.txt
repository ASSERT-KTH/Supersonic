This code is an implementation of the partition step in the QuickSort algorithm. The partition function takes an array and two indices (first and last), and rearranges the elements such that all elements less than or equal to the pivot (last element in this case) appear before those greater than the pivot. Then, it returns the index of the pivot element in the rearranged array. 

Here are some potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. Dynamic array creation: The array is created on the stack using the variable size 'n'. This is not optimal for large 'n' and can cause stack overflow. An alternative would be to use a dynamically allocated array or a `std::vector`.

2. The function `print_partition_ints` uses `std::printf` inside a loop, which is costly. Buffering the output and writing it in one go could be faster.

3. The function `partition` swaps elements even when 'i' equals 'less'. Although this doesn't affect correctness, it wastes CPU cycles.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use `std::vector` instead of a dynamically sized array to avoid stack overflow.

2. In `print_partition_ints`, buffer the output and use a single `std::printf`.

3. In `partition`, only swap elements when 'i' doesn't equal 'less'.

4. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` to disable synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdio>
#include <sstream>
using uint = unsigned int;

static void print_partition_ints(const std::vector<int>& as, const uint q, const uint n) {
  std::ostringstream oss;
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    oss << (i != q ? " " : " [") << as[i] << (i != q ? "" : "]");
  }
  std::printf("%s\n", oss.str().c_str());
}

static uint partition(std::vector<int>& as, const uint first, const uint last) {
  auto less = first;
  for (auto i = first; i < last; ++i) {
    if (as[i] <= as[last]) {
      if (i != less) {
        std::swap(as[less], as[i]);
      }
      ++less;
    }
  }
  std::swap(as[less], as[last]);
  return less;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // Disable synchronization between C and C++ streams

  uint n;
  std::scanf("%u", &n);
  std::vector<int> as(n);
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    std::scanf("%d", &as[i]);
  }
  auto q = partition(as, 0, n - 1);
  print_partition_ints(as, q, n);
}
```

These optimizations should improve the performance of the code. However, they may make the code slightly more complex, and in the case of buffering the output, memory usage may increase.
