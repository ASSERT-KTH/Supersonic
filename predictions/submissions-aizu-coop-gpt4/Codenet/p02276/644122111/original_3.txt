Code Analysis:
This C++ code is implementing the partition operation of the QuickSort algorithm. It reads an array of integers from standard input, partitions the array around the last element, and then prints the partitioned array. The partition operation is a fundamental operation of the QuickSort algorithm. In this operation, an element called pivot is selected. All the elements smaller than the pivot are moved before it and all the elements greater than the pivot are moved after it. Hence, the pivot occupies its correct position in the sorted array.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The data structures used in this code are efficient for the task at hand. The array is the most efficient data structure for this purpose because it provides O(1) access to any element.

2. Redundant Computations: There are no redundant computations in this code. Each operation is necessary for the partitioning of the array.

3. Loops and Recursive Calls: There are no recursive calls in this code. The loops in the code are necessary for the partition operation and cannot be unrolled or optimized further without changing the semantics of the operation.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The compiler should automatically optimize this code for the target architecture. However, we can use the '#pragma GCC optimize' directive to hint the compiler to further optimize the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. The main optimization that can be applied to this code is to use compiler directives to hint the compiler to optimize the code. The '#pragma GCC optimize' directive can be used to enable specific optimization levels. The 'O3' level enables all optimization that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff. It turns on all optimizations specified by 'O2' and also enables optimizations that may increase the size of the generated code. The trade-off here is that the generated code may be larger, but it will run faster.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>

// Enable O3 level optimizations
#pragma GCC optimize ("O3")

using uint = unsigned int;

static void print_partition_ints(const int as[], const uint q, const uint n) {
  auto out_sep = "";
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    auto format = (i != q ? "%s%d" : "%s[%d]");
    std::printf(format, out_sep, as[i]);
    out_sep = " ";
  }
  std::printf("\n");
}

static uint partition(int as[], const uint first, const uint last) {
  auto less = first;
  for (auto i = first; i < last; ++i) {
    if (as[i] <= as[last]) {
      std::swap(as[less], as[i]);
      ++less;
    }
  }
  std::swap(as[less], as[last]);
  return less;
}

int main() {
  uint n;
  std::scanf("%u", &n);
  int as[n];
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    std::scanf("%d", &as[i]);
  }
  auto q = partition(as, 0, n - 1);
  print_partition_ints(as, q, n);
}
```

In this optimized version of the code, the '#pragma GCC optimize ("O3")' directive has been added to hint the compiler to optimize the code to the 'O3' level. This is the only significant change in this code. The functionality and output of the code remain the same as the original code.
