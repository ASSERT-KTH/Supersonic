Code Analysis:

The given C++ code is a simple implementation of the partitioning step in the QuickSort algorithm. Here's a summary of what the code does:

1. Reads size 'n' from the input.
2. Reads 'n' integers into an array 'as'.
3. Calls function 'partition' to partition the array 'as' around the last element.
4. Prints the partitioned array.

This code appears to be fairly optimized, but there are a few areas that may be improved.

Optimization Strategy:

A. Reducing the amount of I/O operations: The given code uses formatted I/O functions (std::scanf and std::printf) for reading and writing data. These functions are usually slower compared to their unformatted counterparts due to the overhead of parsing format strings.

B. Avoiding dynamic memory allocation: The given code uses a variable length array ('as') which is a non-standard C++ feature and it results in dynamic memory allocation, which is slower compared to static memory allocation.

C. Utilizing efficient data structures: While the use of an array in this case is relatively efficient, in some cases, it may be beneficial to consider other data structures depending on the specific requirements and constraints.

D. Making use of compiler optimizations: Modern C++ compilers come with a variety of flags that can be used to optimize the compiled code. However, it's important to note that such optimizations are highly dependent on the specific compiler being used.

Step-by-step Explanation:

1. Reducing I/O operations: We can replace std::scanf and std::printf with std::cin and std::cout to speed up I/O operations.

2. Avoiding dynamic memory allocation: We can replace the variable length array with a std::vector which allows for dynamic resizing while being a standard C++ feature.

3. Utilizing efficient data structures: In this case, an array or vector is the most efficient data structure for the job. There is no need for a change here.

4. Making use of compiler optimizations: While this is not a part of the code, it's worth mentioning that using compiler optimization flags like '-O2' or '-O3' can greatly improve the performance of the generated binary.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using uint = unsigned int;

static void print_partition_ints(const std::vector<int>& as, const uint q) {
    for (auto i = 0u; i < as.size(); ++i) {
        if (i != 0) std::cout << " ";
        if (i == q) std::cout << "[" << as[i] << "]";
        else std::cout << as[i];
    }
    std::cout << "\n";
}

static uint partition(std::vector<int>& as, const uint first, const uint last) {
    auto less = first;
    for (auto i = first; i < last; ++i) {
        if (as[i] <= as[last]) {
            std::swap(as[less], as[i]);
            ++less;
        }
    }
    std::swap(as[less], as[last]);
    return less;
}

int main() {
    uint n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<int> as(n);
    for (auto& a : as) {
        std::cin >> a;
    }
    auto q = partition(as, 0, n - 1);
    print_partition_ints(as, q);
}
```
