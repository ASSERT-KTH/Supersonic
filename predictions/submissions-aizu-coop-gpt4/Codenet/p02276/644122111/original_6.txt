Code Analysis:

The given code is a simple implementation of the partition routine in the QuickSort algorithm in C++. It reads an array of integers from the input, partitions the array around the last element (the pivot), and then prints the resulting partition.

Areas for optimization:

1. The use of std::swap and printf/scanf: These functions might not be the most efficient for this code. The std::swap function is used to swap elements in the array, and the printf/scanf functions are used for output/input respectively. The use of these functions can be optimized.

2. Dynamic array allocation: The array as[] is allocated on the stack which could lead to a stack overflow if the size of the array is very large.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace std::swap with a custom swap function: A custom swap function can be optimized for integers and this can be faster than std::swap which is a template function and has overhead for type checking.

2. Replace printf/scanf with std::cout and std::cin: The C++ way of input/output (cin/cout) is usually faster than the C-style printf/scanf because it is type safe and does not require format specifiers.

3. Replace dynamic array allocation on stack with std::vector: Using std::vector for dynamic array allocation would be safer as it allocates memory on the heap and there is less risk of stack overflow.

Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using uint = unsigned int;

void swap(int &a, int &b) {
  int temp = a;
  a = b;
  b = temp;
}

void print_partition_ints(const std::vector<int>& as, const uint q, const uint n) {
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    if (i == q) std::cout << "[" << as[i] << "]" << " ";
    else std::cout << as[i] << " ";
  }
  std::cout << "\n";
}

uint partition(std::vector<int>& as, const uint first, const uint last) {
  auto less = first;
  for (auto i = first; i < last; ++i) {
    if (as[i] <= as[last]) {
      swap(as[less], as[i]);
      ++less;
    }
  }
  swap(as[less], as[last]);
  return less;
}

int main() {
  uint n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> as(n);
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> as[i];
  }
  auto q = partition(as, 0, n - 1);
  print_partition_ints(as, q, n);
}
```

This optimized code should provide a performance improvement over the original code. However, it's always a good idea to benchmark and profile your code to ensure that the optimizations are having the desired effect.
