# Code Analysis

The code is a C++ implementation of the partition operation in quicksort. This operation rearranges the elements of the array such that all elements less than or equal to the pivot (the last element in this case) come before the pivot, while all elements greater than the pivot come after it.

The `print_partition_ints` function prints out the partitioned array with the pivot element enclosed in square brackets.

# Optimization Strategy

This code is already well-optimized. However, we can still perform a few minor optimizations:

1. Reduce Variable Scope: The variable `out_sep` is used only inside the loop in `print_partition_ints`. We can reduce its scope to the loop only.

2. Avoid Unnecessary Print Calls: In function `print_partition_ints`, we can reduce the number of `printf` calls by collecting the string to be printed first and then printing it all at once.

3. Use `std::vector` instead of C-style array: In the `main` function, we're using a C-style array, which does not check for bounds and could lead to a buffer overflow. We can replace it with `std::vector`, which provides dynamic sizing and safer access methods.

4. Use `iostream` instead of `cstdio`: The `cstdio` library is a C-style input/output library. We can use the `iostream` library instead, which is more idiomatic to C++.

# Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Reduce Variable Scope: We move the declaration of `out_sep` inside the loop in `print_partition_ints`, reducing its scope to just the loop.

2. Avoid Unnecessary Print Calls: Instead of printing each integer and space separately, we create a string (using `std::ostringstream`) and add the integers and spaces to the string, then print the string all at once using a single `printf` call.

3. Use `std::vector` instead of C-style array: We replace the C-style array `as` with `std::vector<int> as`.

4. Use `iostream` instead of `cstdio`: We replace `std::scanf` and `std::printf` with `std::cin` and `std::cout`, respectively.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <vector>
using uint = unsigned int;

static void print_partition_ints(const std::vector<int>& as, const uint q, const uint n) {
  std::ostringstream oss;
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    if (i != 0) {
      oss << " ";
    }
    if (i == q) {
      oss << "[" << as[i] << "]";
    } else {
      oss << as[i];
    }
  }
  std::cout << oss.str() << std::endl;
}

static uint partition(std::vector<int>& as, const uint first, const uint last) {
  auto less = first;
  for (auto i = first; i < last; ++i) {
    if (as[i] <= as[last]) {
      std::swap(as[less], as[i]);
      ++less;
    }
  }
  std::swap(as[less], as[last]);
  return less;
}

int main() {
  uint n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> as(n);
  for (auto& a : as) {
    std::cin >> a;
  }
  auto q = partition(as, 0, n - 1);
  print_partition_ints(as, q, n);
}
