The provided code is a C++ implementation of the partition operation in the QuickSort algorithm. It takes an array of integers as input, partitions it around a pivot (the last element in this case), and then prints the partitioned array.

Let's go through the optimization process:

1. Code Analysis:

   Looking at the code, there doesn't seem to be any apparent performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usage. The algorithm's time complexity is O(n), which is the best we can achieve for this problem. There are no nested loops or recursive calls that could cause performance issues.

2. Optimization Strategy:

   Although the core algorithm is optimized, there are a few areas in the code where some improvements can be made:

   - Reducing the use of std::swap: std::swap is a function that swaps the values of two variables, but it can be slow compared to manual swapping.
   - Reducing the number of print calls: Each call to std::printf requires a system call, which can be expensive. We can reduce the number of calls by concatenating the string and printing it once.
   - Using std::vector instead of a C-style array: The size of a C-style array needs to be known at compile-time, which is not the case here. Using a vector would be safer and more idiomatic in C++.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   - Replace std::swap with manual swapping: Instead of using std::swap, we can manually swap the elements by introducing a temporary variable. This could potentially speed up the execution time.
   - Accumulate the output string: Instead of making a system call for each element, we can concatenate the elements into a string and make a single call.
   - Use std::vector instead of a C-style array: This will allow for dynamic resizing and is safer and more idiomatic C++.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <cstdio>

using uint = unsigned int;

static void print_partition_ints(const std::vector<int>& as, const uint q) {
  std::string output;
  for (auto i = 0u; i < as.size(); ++i) {
    output += (i != q ? " " + std::to_string(as[i]) : " [" + std::to_string(as[i]) + "]");
  }
  output += "\n";
  std::printf("%s", output.c_str());
}

static uint partition(std::vector<int>& as, const uint first, const uint last) {
  auto less = first;
  for (auto i = first; i < last; ++i) {
    if (as[i] <= as[last]) {
      int temp = as[less];
      as[less] = as[i];
      as[i] = temp;
      ++less;
    }
  }
  int temp = as[less];
  as[less] = as[last];
  as[last] = temp;
  return less;
}

int main() {
  uint n;
  std::scanf("%u", &n);
  std::vector<int> as(n);
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    std::scanf("%d", &as[i]);
  }
  auto q = partition(as, 0, n - 1);
  print_partition_ints(as, q);
}
```
Please note, these optimizations might not significantly improve the performance of the code because the original code is already quite efficient. However, they do make the code more idiomatic and safer, especially the replacement of the C-style array with a std::vector.
