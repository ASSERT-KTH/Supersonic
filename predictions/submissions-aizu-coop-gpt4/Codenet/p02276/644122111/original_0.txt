The provided C++ code reads an array of integers, partitions it around a pivot (the last element), and then prints the partitioned array. The partitioning is done in such a way that all elements less than or equal to the pivot appear before the pivot and all elements greater appear after.

This code is already quite efficient, but here are a few points that can be optimized:

1. Dynamic allocation of the array: Variable length array is not a standard C++ feature. It is better to use `std::vector<int>` instead of raw arrays for dynamic allocation. This will also handle memory management automatically.

2. Using `std::scanf` and `std::printf` in C++: Although these functions are valid, it is more common to use C++ style I/O functions like `std::cin` and `std::cout` for better type safety and consistency with C++ style.

3. Avoiding unnecessary printing format: The code currently checks for each element if it is the pivot to adjust the printing format. This could be avoided by splitting the printing into three parts: elements before, the pivot, and elements after the pivot.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using uint = unsigned int;

static void print_partition_ints(const std::vector<int>& as, const uint q) {
  for (auto i = 0u; i < q; ++i) {
    std::cout << as[i] << " ";
  }
  std::cout << "[" << as[q] << "] ";
  for (auto i = q + 1; i < as.size(); ++i) {
    std::cout << as[i] << " ";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;
}

static uint partition(std::vector<int>& as, const uint first, const uint last) {
  auto less = first;
  for (auto i = first; i < last; ++i) {
    if (as[i] <= as[last]) {
      std::swap(as[less], as[i]);
      ++less;
    }
  }
  std::swap(as[less], as[last]);
  return less;
}

int main() {
  uint n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> as(n);
  for (auto& a : as) {
    std::cin >> a;
  }
  auto q = partition(as, 0, n - 1);
  print_partition_ints(as, q);
}
```

The above code preserves the functionality of the original code but is more idiomatic in terms of C++ style and usage. It uses C++ standard library containers and functions for better safety and readability. Note that the use of `std::vector` may introduce a slight overhead compared to raw arrays, but it is generally negligible for most applications.
