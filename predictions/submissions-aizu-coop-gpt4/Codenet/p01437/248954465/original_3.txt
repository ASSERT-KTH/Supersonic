1. Code Analysis

The provided code is a C++ program that performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a 2D grid. The grid is denoted by characters, and the program simulates a robot moving in four directions: North, East, South, West (NESW). The program keeps track of the robot's position, the direction it's facing, and the step it's on.

2. Optimization Strategy

Here are some potential optimizations to the code:

   A. Use of Efficient Data Structures:
   - Replace `string` with `char` for direction storage. The `tmp` string is only being used to store the four cardinal directions, and then the `find` function is being used to get the index of a particular direction. This is inefficient as 'find' operation on a string is O(n).

   B. Redundant Computations:
   - The program checks the boundary conditions in every DFS call. This is redundant and can be avoided by checking the conditions before calling DFS.

   C. Loop Optimization:
   - The DFS function is recursive and can be optimized using tail recursion or iterative DFS.

   D. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Use fast Input/Output operations to speed up the program.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation

   A. Replace `string` with `char` for direction storage:
   - The `tmp` string is being used to store the four cardinal directions, and then the `find` function is being used to get the index of a particular direction. This could be replaced with a simple switch case or if-else statements to directly assign the direction index, which would be faster.

   B. Avoid redundant boundary condition checks:
   - The boundary conditions are checked in every DFS function call. It would be more efficient to check these conditions before calling DFS. This would avoid unnecessary function calls.

   C. Convert recursive DFS to iterative DFS:
   - In general, an iterative DFS is faster than a recursive one because it doesn't have the overhead of function calls. This could be achieved by using a stack data structure. The main difference is that in the recursive version, the system stack is used, while in the iterative version, a user-defined stack is used.

   D. Use fast Input/Output operations:
   - The program can be sped up by using faster input/output operations. Instead of using `cin` and `cout`, the program can use `scanf` and `printf`, which are faster.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
const int vy[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0}, vx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int H, W;
int64 L;
char C[100][100];
int sx, sy, sv;
int64 nxt[100][100][4];

void dfs(int x, int y, int v, int64 step) {
  while(true) {
    int nx = x + vx[v], ny = y + vy[v], nv = (v + 1) % 4;
    if (step == 0) {
      printf("%d %d %c\n", y + 1, x + 1, "NESW"[v]);
      return;
    }
    if (0 <= nx && 0 <= ny && nx < W && ny < H && C[ny][nx] != '#') {
      int64 loop = ~nxt[nx][ny][v] ? nxt[x][y][v] - nxt[nx][ny][v] + 1 : step;
      nxt[nx][ny][v] = nxt[x][y][v] + 1;
      x = nx;
      y = ny;
      step = (step - 1) % loop;
    } else {
      nxt[x][y][nv] = nxt[x][y][v];
      v = nv;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  while (scanf("%d %d %lld", &H, &W, &L), H) {
    memset(nxt, -1, sizeof(nxt));
    for (int i = 0; i < H; i++) {
      scanf("%s", C[i]);
      for (int j = 0; j < W; j++) {
        char c = C[i][j];
        if (c == 'N' || c == 'E' || c == 'S' || c == 'W') {
          sx = j, sy = i;
          switch (c) {
            case 'N': sv = 0; break;
            case 'E': sv = 1; break;
            case 'S': sv = 2; break;
            case 'W': sv = 3; break;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    nxt[sx][sy][sv] = 0;
    dfs(sx, sy, sv, L);
  }
}
```
