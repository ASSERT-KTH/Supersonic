This code is a kind of simulation. Given a grid and a starting position, it simulates the movement of a certain object that moves in a specific pattern and reports the position of the object after L steps. The object moves in the NESW (North, East, South, and West) directions in a clockwise manner. If a cell is blocked (#), it changes direction.

Code Analysis:
The main performance bottleneck in this code is the recursive function dfs. This function is called recursively for each step of the simulation, which can lead to a large number of function calls and corresponding overhead. Furthermore, the recursive nature of dfs may cause a stack overflow for large input sizes.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use Iterative Methods Over Recursive: We can replace the recursive function dfs with an iterative loop. This will reduce the overhead of function calls and avoid potential stack overflow issues.

2. Use More Efficient Data Structures: The use of the C array, nxt, which is a three-dimensional array, can be costly in terms of memory usage. We can replace this with a more efficient data structure, such as a hash map.

3. Avoid Redundant Computations: The computation of the next position and direction (nx, ny, nv) is done in each call to dfs. We can avoid this redundant computation by calculating it only when necessary.

4. Compiler Optimization: We can make use of compiler optimization flags to make the program run faster. For example, we can use the -O2 or -O3 optimization flags with the g++ compiler.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
const string tmp = "NESW";
const int vy[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0}, vx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int H, W;
int64 L;
string C[100];
int sx, sy, sv;
unordered_map<int64, int64> nxt;

void simulate(int x, int y, int v, int64 step) {
  while(step > 0) {
    int nx = x + vx[v], ny = y + vy[v], nv = (v + 1) % 4;
    if (0 <= nx && 0 <= ny && nx < W && ny < H && C[ny][nx] != '#') {
      int64 key = nx * 10000 + ny * 100 + v;
      if(nxt.count(key)) {
        int64 loop = nxt[x*10000 + y*100 + v] - nxt[key] + 1;
        step = (step - 1) % loop;
      } else {
        nxt[key] = nxt[x*10000 + y*100 + v] + 1;
        step--;
      }
      x = nx; y = ny;
    } else {
      v = nv;
    }
  }
  cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << " " << tmp[v] << endl;
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> H >> W >> L, H) {
    nxt.clear();
    for (int i = 0; i < H; i++) {
      cin >> C[i];
      for (int j = 0; j < W; j++) {
        int p = tmp.find(C[i][j]);
        if (p != string::npos)
          sx = j, sy = i, sv = p;
      }
    }
    nxt[sx*10000 + sy*100 + sv] = 0;
    simulate(sx, sy, sv, L);
  }
}
```
In the optimized code, we have replaced the recursive dfs function with an iterative simulate function. The three-dimensional array nxt was replaced with a hash map. The key for the hash map is a combination of the coordinates x, y, and the direction v. This reduces the memory usage and also the computational overhead of accessing the elements in the array. We also avoided redundant computation of the next position and direction by calculating it only when necessary.
