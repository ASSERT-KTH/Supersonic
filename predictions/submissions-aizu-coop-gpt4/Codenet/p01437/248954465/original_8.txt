The given code is a C++ program that performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a grid represented by a 2D array. The DFS algorithm is being used to simulate the movement of a robot in a grid.

Based on its analysis, here are the potential performance bottlenecks and optimization strategies:

1. Inefficient data structures: The input grid, C, is stored as an array of strings. This is inefficient because access to individual elements requires two dereferences, one for the array index and one for the string index. It would be slightly more efficient to store the grid as a 2D char array, as this would only require one dereference.

2. Redundant computations: The next position and direction are computed and stored in variables at the start of the DFS function, even though they may not be used if the current cell is a wall or step is zero. These computations can be moved inside the relevant if-else branches.

3. Recursion overhead: The DFS function is implemented recursively, which can lead to significant overhead for deep recursion. This can be mitigated by using tail recursion, or by transforming the recursive DFS into an iterative one using a stack.

4. Compiler optimizations: The compiler can be instructed to perform optimizations such as function inlining, loop unrolling, etc. by using the appropriate compiler flags or pragma directives.

Now let's dive into the optimization process:

1. Change the data type of C from an array of strings to a 2D char array:

    Before:
    ```cpp
    string C[100];
    ```
    After:
    ```cpp
    char C[100][100];
    ```

2. Move the computation of the next position and direction inside the relevant if-else branches:

    Before:
    ```cpp
    int nx = x + vx[v], ny = y + vy[v], nv = (v + 1) % 4;
    ```
    After:
    ```cpp
    if (step == 0) {
        ...
    } else {
        int nx = x + vx[v], ny = y + vy[v];
        if (0 <= nx && 0 <= ny && nx < W && ny < H && C[ny][nx] != '#') {
            ...
        } else {
            int nv = (v + 1) % 4;
            ...
        }
    }
    ```

3. Change the DFS function to use tail recursion or transform it into an iterative form:

    This would require a substantial change to the code and may not be worth it unless the recursion depth is very large. Hence, this step is left out for now.

4. Use compiler optimizations:

    Depending on the compiler used, various flags or pragma directives can be used to instruct the compiler to perform optimizations. For example, with GCC, the `-O2` or `-O3` flags can be used to enable various optimization levels.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
const string tmp = "NESW";
const int vy[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0}, vx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int H, W;
int64 L;
char C[100][100];
int sx, sy, sv;
int64 nxt[100][100][4];

void dfs(int x, int y, int v, int64 step) {
  if (step == 0) {
    cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << " " << tmp[v] << endl;
    return;
  } else {
    int nx = x + vx[v], ny = y + vy[v];
    if (0 <= nx && 0 <= ny && nx < W && ny < H && C[ny][nx] != '#') {
      int64 loop = ~nxt[nx][ny][v] ? nxt[x][y][v] - nxt[nx][ny][v] + 1 : step;
      nxt[nx][ny][v] = nxt[x][y][v] + 1;
      return dfs(nx, ny, v, (step - 1) % loop);
    } else {
      int nv = (v + 1) % 4;
      nxt[x][y][nv] = nxt[x][y][v];
      return dfs(x, y, nv, step);
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // Disable synchronization with stdio for faster cin/cout
  while (cin >> H >> W >> L, H) {
    memset(nxt, -1, sizeof(nxt));
    for (int i = 0; i < H; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < W; j++) {
        cin >> C[i][j];
        int p = tmp.find(C[i][j]);
        if (p != string::npos)
            sx = j, sy = i, sv = p;
      }
    }
    nxt[sx][sy][sv] = 0;
    dfs(sx, sy, sv, L);
  }
}
```

Note: Always check if these optimizations have a positive impact on your program's performance by benchmarking before and after.
