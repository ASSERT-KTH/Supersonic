1. Code Analysis:
- This program is a maze solver. The maze is represented by a 2D grid and the program finds the path the maze will follow, given a certain number of steps.
- The main function reads the dimensions of the maze (HxW) and the number of steps (L) in the maze.
- The maze is then loaded into a string array (C[100]).
- The starting position (sx, sy) and the direction (sv) are determined based on the input.
- A depth-first search (DFS) is used to navigate the maze.
- The DFS function checks the next valid position in the maze and moves there if it's possible. If it's not, it changes direction. It also keeps track of the number of steps taken.
- In the DFS function, a 3D array (nxt[100][100][4]) is used to keep track of the number of steps taken at each position in each direction. This information is used to find loops in the maze and optimize the navigation.

2. Optimization Strategy:
- Use more efficient data structures: The 3D array (nxt[100][100][4]) takes up a lot of memory and is inefficient as it leaves a lot of unused space. Since the maze is sparse, a map would be more suitable.
- Avoid unnecessary computations: The DFS function is called recursively even when the next position is invalid (when it's a wall). This can be avoided by checking if the next position is valid before making the recursive call.
- Optimize loops and recursive calls: The DFS function can be optimized by avoiding cycles in the maze. If a cycle is detected, the number of steps can be reduced by the cycle length.
- Use compiler optimizations: The program can be compiled with optimization flags to improve performance.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
- Use more efficient data structures: Instead of using a 3D array, use a map to keep track of the number of steps taken at each position in each direction. This will save memory as it only stores the necessary information.
- Avoid unnecessary computations: Before making the recursive call in the DFS function, check if the next position is valid. If it's not, change direction and continue with the next step. This will reduce the number of recursive calls and hence improve performance.
- Optimize loops and recursive calls: In the DFS function, if a cycle is detected, reduce the number of steps by the cycle length. This will save time as it avoids unnecessary steps.
- Use compiler optimizations: Compile the program with optimization flags (-O2 or -O3) to improve performance.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
const string tmp = "NESW";
const int vy[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0}, vx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int H, W;
int64 L;
string C[100];
int sx, sy, sv;
map<tuple<int, int, int>, int64> nxt;

void dfs(int x, int y, int v, int64 step) {
  int nx = x + vx[v], ny = y + vy[v], nv = (v + 1) % 4;
  if (step == 0) {
    cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << " " << tmp[v] << endl;
    return;
  }
  if (0 <= nx && 0 <= ny && nx < W && ny < H && C[ny][nx] != '#') {
    int64 loop = nxt.count({nx, ny, v}) ? nxt[{x, y, v}] - nxt[{nx, ny, v}] + 1 : step;
    nxt[{nx, ny, v}] = nxt[{x, y, v}] + 1;
    dfs(nx, ny, v, (step - 1) % loop);
  } else {
    nxt[{x, y, nv}] = nxt[{x, y, v}];
    dfs(x, y, nv, step);
  }
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> H >> W >> L, H) {
    nxt.clear();
    for (int i = 0; i < H; i++) {
      cin >> C[i];
      for (int j = 0; j < W; j++) {
        int p = tmp.find(C[i][j]);
        if (p != string::npos)
          sx = j, sy = i, sv = p;
      }
    }
    nxt[{sx, sy, sv}] = 0;
    dfs(sx, sy, sv, L);
  }
}
```

Note: It is important to note that using the map data structure might increase the complexity of the operations (e.g., insertion and access) from constant time (O(1)) to logarithmic time (O(log n)). However, it is a necessary trade-off for saving memory in this case.
