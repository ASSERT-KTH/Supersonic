Code Analysis:
This code appears to be a simulation of a robot moving in a 2D grid with specific movement rules. The robot moves in a North-East-South-West (NESW) fashion and changes direction when it encounters an obstacle. Each move decreases the robot's remaining steps (L), and it stops when no steps are left.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: The data structure used to store the grid (string array C[100]) and the 3D array nxt[100][100][4] used for recording steps seem efficient for the task at hand.

2. Redundant Computations: The computation of 'nx' and 'ny' (next x and y) could be done once inside the DFS function instead of twice in both conditional branches.

3. Loops and Recursive Calls: The DFS function is recursive, but it doesn't seem like it can be optimized by unrolling or tail recursion. The main loop can't be optimize because it's dependent on user input.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations like -O3 option could be used to potentially improve the performance of the program.

Optimization Steps:
1. Minimize repeated computations: Currently, the next `x` and `y` are calculated twice. This can be optimized by computing them only once.

Trade-offs: The overall structure of the code remains the same, so the trade-off of increased code complexity is minimal.

Optimized Code Block:
```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
const string tmp = "NESW";
const int vy[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0}, vx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int H, W;
int64 L;
string C[100];
int sx, sy, sv;
int64 nxt[100][100][4];

void dfs(int x, int y, int v, int64 step) {
  int nx = x + vx[v], ny = y + vy[v], nv = (v + 1) % 4;  // Calculate next x and y only once
  if (step == 0) {
    cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << " " << tmp[v] << endl;
    return;
  } else if (0 <= nx && 0 <= ny && nx < W && ny < H && C[ny][nx] != '#') {
    int64 loop = ~nxt[nx][ny][v] ? nxt[x][y][v] - nxt[nx][ny][v] + 1 : step;
    nxt[nx][ny][v] = nxt[x][y][v] + 1;
    return (dfs(nx, ny, v, (step - 1) % loop));
  } else {
    nxt[x][y][nv] = nxt[x][y][v];
    return (dfs(x, y, nv, step));
  }
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> H >> W >> L, H) {
    memset(nxt, -1, sizeof(nxt));
    for (int i = 0; i < H; i++) {
      cin >> C[i];
      for (int j = 0; j < W; j++) {
        int p = tmp.find(C[i][j]);
        if (p != string::npos)
          sx = j, sy = i, sv = p;
      }
    }
    nxt[sx][sy][sv] = 0;
    dfs(sx, sy, sv, L);
  }
}
```
