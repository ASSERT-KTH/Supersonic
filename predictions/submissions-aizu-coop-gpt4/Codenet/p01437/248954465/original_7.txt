**Step 1: Code Analysis**

This C++ program is implementing a form of depth-first search (DFS) algorithm on a 2D grid. The grid cells can contain directions 'N', 'E', 'S', 'W' or obstacles '#'. The grid's dimensions are given by the integer variables 'H' (for height) and 'W' (for width). The DFS starts from a specific location and moves according to the direction in the current cell until it hits an obstacle, at which point it changes direction in a clockwise manner. The program repeats this process 'L' number of times.

**Step 2: Optimization Strategy**

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The grid is being represented as a 2D string array 'C'. This representation is not necessarily inefficient, but it's important to note that string operations are generally slower than integer or boolean operations. However, in this case, since the program doesn't perform any string concatenation or other heavy string operations, string representation seems reasonable.

2. Redundant Computations: The DFS function is implemented in a recursive manner, which can result in redundant computations especially when we encounter loops in the grid. This could be optimized by memoization, i.e., storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing the results when the same inputs occur again.

3. Recursive Calls: The DFS function is implemented in a recursive manner, which can be expensive in terms of memory usage and performance. Recursive calls can be replaced with a non-recursive (iterative) approach using a stack or a queue to improve memory usage, but this can make the code more complex.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations such as '-O2' or '-O3' flags can be used to automatically optimize the code.

**Step 3: Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. Memoization: To avoid redundant computations, we can store the 'step' value when we first visit a cell in a certain direction. Before moving to the next cell, we can check if it has been visited before in the same direction. If it has, we calculate the loop size and use modulo operation to skip the repeated steps.

2. Iterative DFS: An alternative approach could be to replace the recursive DFS with an iterative DFS. However, this would significantly increase the complexity of the code, as we would need to maintain a stack to keep track of the cells to visit next. Given that the maximum depth of recursion is limited by the size of the grid (100x100), it's unlikely that we'll hit stack overflow, so in this case, the recursive DFS is acceptable.

3. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimization flags such as '-O2' or '-O3' can be added when compiling the code. These flags tell the compiler to optimize the code for speed. However, care should be taken as these optimizations can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior. 

**Step 4: Optimized Code Block**

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
const string tmp = "NESW";
const int vy[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0}, vx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int H, W;
int64 L;
string C[100];
int sx, sy, sv;
int64 nxt[100][100][4];
void dfs(int x, int y, int v, int64 step) {
  if (step == 0) {
    cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << " " << tmp[v] << endl;
    return;
  }
  int nx = x + vx[v], ny = y + vy[v], nv = (v + 1) % 4;
  if (0 <= nx && 0 <= ny && nx < W && ny < H && C[ny][nx] != '#') {
    if (nxt[nx][ny][v] != -1) { // if the cell has been visited before in the same direction
      int64 loop = nxt[x][y][v] - nxt[nx][ny][v] + 1; // calculate the loop size
      step %= loop; // skip the repeated steps
    }
    nxt[nx][ny][v] = nxt[x][y][v] + 1;
    dfs(nx, ny, v, step);
  } else {
    nxt[x][y][nv] = nxt[x][y][v];
    dfs(x, y, nv, step);
  }
}
int main() {
  while (cin >> H >> W >> L, H) {
    memset(nxt, -1, sizeof(nxt));
    for (int i = 0; i < H; i++) {
      cin >> C[i];
      for (int j = 0; j < W; j++) {
        int p = tmp.find(C[i][j]);
        if (p != string::npos)
          sx = j, sy = i, sv = p;
      }
    }
    nxt[sx][sy][sv] = 0;
    dfs(sx, sy, sv, L);
  }
}
```
This optimized code includes memoization to avoid repeating the same steps in loops. The trade-off is that it requires additional memory to store the step values, but since the size of the grid is limited to 100x100, this increase in memory usage is acceptable.
