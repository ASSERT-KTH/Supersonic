1. Code Analysis: The code is a C++ program that uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse a 2D grid. The grid is made up of 'H' rows and 'W' columns. The program keeps track of the direction in which it is moving (NESW), and it also has a limit on the number of steps it can move, 'L'. If it encounters a '#' symbol, it changes direction. The program seems to be implementing some form of maze navigation algorithm.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. The program uses the string 'tmp' to find the direction. It would be more efficient to use a map with the directions as keys and the values as their corresponding indices. This would reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(1).
    2. The DFS function is recursive, which can lead to a stack overflow for large inputs. It can be converted to an iterative function using a stack, which would be more memory efficient.
    3. The use of 'bits/stdc++.h' header file includes many unnecessary libraries, which can slow down the compilation time. It's better to include only necessary libraries.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Replace the 'tmp' string with a map for faster access.
        * Rationale: Using a map instead of a string for storing the directions reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(1).
        * Trade-off: This will slightly increase the memory usage, but the overall performance gain is worth it.
    2. Convert the DFS function to an iterative function.
        * Rationale: This will prevent a potential stack overflow for large inputs. It will also provide a performance boost as we are eliminating the overhead caused by function calls.
        * Trade-off: The code might become a bit more complex, but it will be more efficient.
    3. Replace 'bits/stdc++.h' with only necessary libraries.
        * Rationale: Including unnecessary libraries can slow down the compilation time. It's better to include only what's needed.
        * Trade-off: We might have to include multiple libraries manually, but it will make the code more efficient.

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <map>

int H, W;
int64 L;
string C[100];
int sx, sy, sv;
int64 nxt[100][100][4];

void dfs(int x, int y, int v, int64 step) {
  stack<tuple<int, int, int, int64>> stk;
  stk.push(make_tuple(x, y, v, step));

  while (!stk.empty()) {
    tie(x, y, v, step) = stk.top();
    stk.pop();

    int nx = x + vx[v], ny = y + vy[v], nv = (v + 1) % 4;
    if (step == 0) {
      cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << " " << dirMap[v] << endl;
      return;
    } else if (0 <= nx && 0 <= ny && nx < W && ny < H && C[ny][nx] != '#') {
      int64 loop = ~nxt[nx][ny][v] ? nxt[x][y][v] - nxt[nx][ny][v] + 1 : step;
      nxt[nx][ny][v] = nxt[x][y][v] + 1;
      stk.push(make_tuple(nx, ny, v, (step - 1) % loop));
    } else {
      nxt[x][y][nv] = nxt[x][y][v];
      stk.push(make_tuple(x, y, nv, step));
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> H >> W >> L, H) {
    memset(nxt, -1, sizeof(nxt));
    for (int i = 0; i < H; i++) {
      cin >> C[i];
      for (int j = 0; j < W; j++) {
        int p = dirMap[C[i][j]];
        if (p != dirMap.end())
          sx = j, sy = i, sv = p;
      }
    }
    nxt[sx][sy][sv] = 0;
    dfs(sx, sy, sv, L);
