1. Code Analysis:

The code given is implementing a graph using an adjacency list. It represents the connections between the nodes of the graph. Then, it groups the connected nodes together. For this, it uses breadth-first search (BFS). Lastly, it checks if a pair of nodes belong to the same group or not.

The potential bottlenecks in the code are:

- The use of dynamic allocation (new operator) for arrays which can be slower than stack allocation.
- The use of an array (num_of_each) to keep track of the number of connections each node has, which is redundant because the size of each vector in the array V already gives this information.
- The repeated checking of whether a queue is empty or not in the makeGroup() function.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Use std::vector instead of dynamic arrays.
B. Remove the redundant array num_of_each.
C. Minimize the number of times we check if the queue is empty.
D. Use std::cin and std::cout instead of scanf and printf for better type safety and error checking.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Dynamic arrays (using new) are slower than stack-allocated arrays (like std::vector) because they involve a heap allocation. Replacing dynamic arrays with std::vector improves performance and makes the code cleaner and safer (no need to manually delete the memory).

B. The array num_of_each is used to store the number of connections each node has. This is redundant as the same information can be obtained by the size() function of the corresponding vector in the array V. Removing this array will reduce memory usage.

C. In the makeGroup() function, the condition of the while loop checks if the queue Q is empty. This condition is checked again inside the loop. This redundancy can be removed by restructuring the loop to check the condition only once per iteration, improving performance.

D. std::cin and std::cout are safer than scanf and printf as they provide type safety and are less prone to errors like buffer overflow. They might be slower, but the difference is negligible in most cases.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
class Relation {
public:
  Relation(int tmp_n, int tmp_m) : n(tmp_n), m(tmp_m), group_number(1), V(tmp_n), group(tmp_n, 0) {}

  void push(int s, int t) {
    V[s].push_back(t);
    V[t].push_back(s);
  }

  void makeGroup() {
    int node, i;
    queue<int> Q;
    Q.push(0);
    group[0] = 1;
    while (!Q.empty() || group_number < n) {
      while (!Q.empty()) {
        node = Q.front();
        Q.pop();
        for (auto k : V[node]) {
          if (group[k] == 0) {
            group[k] = group[node];
            Q.push(k);
          }
        }
      }
      group_number++;
      for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (group[i] == 0) {
          group[i] = group_number;
          Q.push(i);
          break;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  bool canAccess(int s, int t) { return group[s] == group[t]; }

private:
  vector<vector<int>> V;
  vector<int> group;
  int group_number;
  int n, m;
};

int main() {
  int n, m, s, t, q;
  cin >> n >> m;
  Relation relation(n, m);
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> s >> t;
    relation.push(s, t);
  }
  relation.makeGroup();
  cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    cin >> s >> t;
    if (relation.canAccess(s, t)) {
      cout << "yes\n";
    } else {
      cout << "no\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the optimized code maintains the functionality of the original code and is more efficient in terms of memory usage and performance.
