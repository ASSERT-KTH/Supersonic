This program seems to be implementing a graph and performing a breadth-first search (BFS) to create groups of connected nodes. It then checks if two nodes belong to the same group or not. 

There are few places where the code can be optimized:

1. **Redundant Data Structure**: The 'num_of_each' array keeps track of the number of connections each node has. This information is redundant because the same information can be obtained from the size of the vector at the corresponding index in the 'V' array.

2. **Inefficient Looping**: In the 'makeGroup' method, after emptying the queue, the code loops over all nodes to find one that has not been assigned a group yet. This is inefficient as it results in O(n) iterations for each group. Instead, we can maintain a set of nodes that haven't been assigned a group yet and pick from that set, which will only require O(1) operations.

3. **Memory Management**: The 'V', 'num_of_each', and 'group' arrays are allocated using 'new' but are never deleted, leading to memory leaks. We can avoid this by using standard containers such as std::vector, which handles memory management automatically.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class Relation {
public:
  Relation(int tmp_n, int tmp_m) : V(tmp_n), group(tmp_n, 0), group_number(1), n(tmp_n), m(tmp_m) {}

  void push(int s, int t) {
    V[s].push_back(t);
    V[t].push_back(s);
  }

  void makeGroup() {
    int node, i;
    queue<int> Q;
    unordered_set<int> ungrouped;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      ungrouped.insert(i);
    }
    while (!ungrouped.empty()) {
      Q.push(*ungrouped.begin());
      group[*ungrouped.begin()] = group_number;
      ungrouped.erase(ungrouped.begin());
      while (!Q.empty()) {
        node = Q.front();
        Q.pop();
        for (int k : V[node]) {
          if (group[k] == 0) {
            group[k] = group[node];
            Q.push(k);
            ungrouped.erase(k);
          }
        }
      }
      group_number++;
    }
  }

  bool canAccess(int s, int t) { return group[s] == group[t]; }

private:
  vector<vector<int>> V;
  vector<int> group;
  int group_number;
  int n, m;
};

int main() {
  int n, m, s, t, q;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  Relation relation(n, m);
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d", &s, &t);
    relation.push(s, t);
  }
  relation.makeGroup();
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d", &s, &t);
    if (relation.canAccess(s, t)) {
      printf("yes\n");
    } else {
      printf("no\n");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The above code removes the 'num_of_each' array, uses an unordered_set to find ungrouped nodes efficiently, and replaces 'new' arrays with std::vectors to manage memory automatically. 

Please note that this optimization may increase the space complexity slightly due to the additional unordered_set, but it significantly reduces time complexity, making the program more efficient overall.
