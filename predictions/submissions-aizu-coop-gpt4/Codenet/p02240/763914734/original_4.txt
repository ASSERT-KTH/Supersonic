After reviewing the code, I have identified a few potential areas of improvement in terms of performance and efficiency.

1. **Data Structures**: In the given code, vector<int> *V and int *num_of_each arrays are used to track the relationships and the number of relationships respectively for each node. The number of relationships can be obtained using the size() function of the vector. So, the num_of_each array is redundant and can be eliminated. Also, the V array of vectors can be replaced by a vector of vectors which will handle memory more efficiently.

2. **Unnecessary Computation**: In the makeGroup() function, a for loop is used to check if any ungrouped node is left after the queue is empty. This can be replaced by keeping track of the count of the grouped nodes and comparing it with the total nodes.

3. **Loop Optimization**: The while loop inside the makeGroup() function can be simplified and optimized by using the size of the vector instead of the num_of_each array for iterating over the neighbours of a node.

4. **Memory Management**: The code is using raw pointers for memory allocation, which is not recommended in modern C++. It is better to use smart pointers or STL containers which automatically manage memory.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Relation {
public:
  Relation(int tmp_n, int tmp_m) {
    n = tmp_n;
    m = tmp_m;
    V.resize(n);
    group.resize(n, 0);
    group_number = 1;
    grouped_count = 0;
  }
 
  void push(int s, int t) {
    V[s].push_back(t);
    V[t].push_back(s);
  }
 
  void makeGroup() {
    int node, i;
    queue<int> Q;
    Q.push(0);
    group[0] = 1;
    grouped_count++;
  
    while (grouped_count < n) {
      while (!Q.empty()) {
        node = Q.front();
        Q.pop();
        for (int k = 0; k < V[node].size(); k++) {
          if (group[V[node][k]] == 0) {
            group[V[node][k]] = group[node];
            Q.push(V[node][k]);
            grouped_count++;
          }
        }
      }
      group_number++;
      for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (group[i] == 0) {
          group[i] = group_number;
          Q.push(i);
          grouped_count++;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
  }
 
  bool canAccsess(int s, int t) { return group[s] == group[t]; }

private:
  vector<vector<int>> V; // Replaced pointer to vector with vector of vectors
  vector<int> group; // Replaced pointer to int with vector of ints
  int group_number;
  int grouped_count; // Added to keep track of grouped nodes
  int n, m;
};

// main function remains the same
```

The optimized code maintains the functionality of the original program while improving efficiency and readability. The key optimizations are the elimination of redundant computations, better use of STL containers, and improved memory management. The trade-off is slightly increased code complexity.
