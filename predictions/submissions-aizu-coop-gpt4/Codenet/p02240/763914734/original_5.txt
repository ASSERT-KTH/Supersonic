## Code Analysis
The provided code simulates a relation between different objects. It utilizes arrays and vectors to store the relations. The main function takes in n and m, where n is the number of objects and m is the number of relations. The `push` method is used to keep track of the relationships, and `makeGroup` method is used to group the related objects. The `canAccess` method is used to check if two objects are in the same group or not.

## Optimization Strategy

1. Data Structures: Currently, the code uses a vector array to store the relationships. We can convert this into a vector of vectors, which will simplify the code and make it easier to manage. Also, `num_of_each` array can be removed, as this information can be directly derived from the vector of vectors itself.

2. Redundant Computations: In the `makeGroup` function, we can eliminate the extra loop that increments the `group_number` and checks for ungrouped nodes after every pass of the main loop by shifting this logic inside the main loop.

3. Loops and Recursive Calls: The loops in the provided code are pretty optimized. However, we can slightly optimize the second for loop inside `makeGroup` function by breaking it as soon as we find a node that is not part of any group.

4. Compiler Optimizations: At this point, there are no specific compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can be added to the code. However, we can add `inline` keyword to `canAccess` function to possibly improve its performance.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Convert the `V` into a vector of vectors. This will make the code easier to manage and understand. Also, remove the `num_of_each` array as it is redundant. You can get the same information from the size of the vector at any index.

2. In the `makeGroup` function, move the logic of incrementing `group_number` and finding ungrouped nodes inside the main while loop. This eliminates the need for an extra loop after every pass of the main loop.

3. In the same function, break the second for loop as soon as we find a node that is not part of any group. This will potentially save us from unnecessary iterations.

4. Add `inline` keyword to `canAccess` function. This hint to the compiler can potentially improve the performance of this function by eliminating function call overhead.

## Optimized Code Block

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
class Relation {
public:
  Relation(int tmp_n, int tmp_m) {
    n = tmp_n;
    m = tmp_m;
    V.resize(n);
    group.resize(n, 0);
    group_number = 1;
  }
  void push(int s, int t) {
    V[s].push_back(t);
    V[t].push_back(s);
  }
  void makeGroup() {
    int node;
    queue<int> Q;
    Q.push(0);
    group[0] = 1;
    while (!Q.empty() || group_number <= n) {
      while (!Q.empty()) {
        node = Q.front();
        Q.pop();
        for (int k = 0; k < V[node].size(); k++) {
          if (group[V[node][k]] == 0) {
            group[V[node][k]] = group[node];
            Q.push(V[node][k]);
          }
        }
      }
      if (group_number == n)
        break;
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (group[i] == 0) {
          group_number++;
          group[i] = group_number;
          Q.push(i);
          break;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  inline bool canAccsess(int s, int t) { return group[s] == group[t]; }

private:
  vector<vector<int>> V;
  vector<int> group;
  int group_number;
  int n, m;
};

int main() {
  int n, m, s, t, q;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  Relation relation(n, m);
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d", &s, &t);
    relation.push(s, t);
  }
  relation.makeGroup();
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d", &s, &t);
    if (relation.canAccsess(s, t)) {
      printf("yes\n");
    } else {
      printf("no\n");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code should improve the performance of the original one, while maintaining its functionality and output.
