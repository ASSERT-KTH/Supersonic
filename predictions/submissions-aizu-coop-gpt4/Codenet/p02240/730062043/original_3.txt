Code Analysis:

The given code is a C++ program that uses a disjoint-set data structure (also known as a union-find data structure). The find function is implemented with recursion and can lead to a stack overflow for large inputs, which is inefficient. The program is also reading user inputs inside a loop, which can slow down the program. The input array is also large, which can increase memory usage.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the recursive find function with an iterative version to avoid stack overflow and reduce function call overhead.
2. Use fast input/output methods to speed up the process of reading user inputs and writing outputs.
3. Use vector instead of array to manage memory more efficiently.
4. Use path compression in the find function to flatten the structure of the tree, making future queries faster.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the recursive find function with an iterative version: The recursive version of the find function may cause a stack overflow for large inputs, and it also has function call overhead. An iterative version of the find function can solve these problems.

2. Use fast input/output methods: The cin and cout functions are slower compared to other methods of reading and writing. Replacing them with faster methods like scanf and printf can improve the running time of the program.

3. Use vector instead of array: Vectors in C++ are more dynamic and can manage memory more efficiently compared to arrays.

4. Use path compression in the find function: Path compression is a technique used in the find function that can flatten the structure of the tree, making future queries faster. This can be done by making every other node in the path point to its grandparent.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int find(vector<int>& join, int x) {
    while (x != join[x]) {
        join[x] = join[join[x]]; // path compression
        x = join[x];
    }
    return x;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int n, m, s, t, q;
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
    vector<int> join(n), num(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        join[i] = i;
        num[i] = 0;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        scanf("%d%d", &s, &t);
        s = find(join, s);
        t = find(join, t);
        if (s != t) {
            if (num[s] < num[t])
                join[s] = join[t];
            else {
                join[t] = join[s];
                if (num[s] == num[t])
                    num[s]++;
            }
        }
    }
    scanf("%d", &q);
    for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
        scanf("%d%d", &s, &t);
        if (find(join, s) == find(join, t))
            printf("yes\n");
        else
            printf("no\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
The trade-offs of these optimizations include increased code complexity (due to path compression and using vectors instead of arrays). However, the performance gain and memory efficiency outweigh the complexity increase.
