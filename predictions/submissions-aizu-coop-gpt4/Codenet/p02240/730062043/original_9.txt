Code Analysis:
This program appears to implement a version of the disjoint-set data structure, often used in graph algorithms such as Kruskal's minimum spanning tree. The find function is used to find the root of a set that a given element belongs to. The join operation is used to unify two sets.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. The find function is recursive and without path compression, which can be inefficient for large sets or when many find operations are being performed.
2. The use of cin and cout for input and output can be slower than using scanf and printf, respectively.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Implement path compression in the find function to make subsequent find operations on the same element faster.
2. Use scanf and printf for input and output to improve I/O efficiency.
3. Use a vector instead of static arrays to reduce memory usage.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Path Compression: When we perform a find operation, we traverse up the tree to find the root of the set. With path compression, we make each node on this path point directly to the root, reducing the time for subsequent find operations on these nodes.
2. Efficient I/O: scanf and printf functions are generally faster than cin and cout, so we can use them for improved I/O efficiency. However, the readability of the code may be slightly reduced.
3. Use of Vector: A vector is dynamic and only allocates the memory it needs. This can save memory when the number of elements is significantly less than 100000.

Now, let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> parent, rank;

int find(int x) {
  if (x != parent[x]) {
    parent[x] = find(parent[x]); // path compression
  }
  return parent[x];
}

int main() {
  int n, m, s, t, q;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);

  parent.resize(n);
  rank.resize(n, 0);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    parent[i] = i;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d", &s, &t);
    s = find(s);
    t = find(t);
    if (s != t) {
      if (rank[s] < rank[t])
        parent[s] = parent[t];
      else {
        parent[t] = parent[s];
        if (rank[s] == rank[t])
          rank[s]++;
      }
    }
  }

  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d", &s, &t);
    if (find(s) == find(t))
      printf("yes\n");
    else
      printf("no\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should provide the same functionality as the original code, but with improved efficiency and lower memory usage.
