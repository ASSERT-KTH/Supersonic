Code Analysis:

The given code is a C++ implementation of the Union-Find data structure typically used for disjoint set queries. The two main operations are `find` and `union`. `find` is used to determine the set to which an element belongs, while `union` is used to merge two sets. These operations are used in the code to process a set of `m` unions and then answer `q` queries about whether two elements are in the same set.

Performance Bottlenecks:

1. The `find` function uses recursion to determine the representative of a set (the root of the tree). This is potentially inefficient as each recursive call adds a new frame to the stack, which can lead to high memory usage and stack overflow for large inputs.

2. The union operation `join` is performed in a loop. The `find` operation is invoked twice within this loop, which is redundant and inefficient. 

3. The `find` function does not implement path compression. Path compression is a technique that flattens the structure of the tree after a find operation, so that every node on the path from the element to the root has its parent changed to the root. It is a key optimization for the Union-Find data structure.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Convert the recursive `find` function into an iterative one to reduce stack usage.

2. Use path compression in the `find` function to optimize future find operations.

3. Store the result of the `find` operation in the union loop to avoid redundant calls.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Iterative implementation of find with path compression.
int find(int join[], int x) {
  int root = x;
  while (root != join[root])
    root = join[root];
  
  // Path compression.
  while (x != root) {
    int next = join[x];
    join[x] = root;
    x = next;
  }
  
  return root;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int n, m, join[100000], num[100000], s, t;
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    join[i] = i;
    num[i] = 0;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> s >> t;
    int root_s = find(join, s);
    int root_t = find(join, t);
    if (root_s != root_t) {
      if (num[root_s] < num[root_t])
        join[root_s] = join[root_t];
      else {
        join[root_t] = join[root_s];
        if (num[root_s] == num[root_t])
          num[root_s]++;
      }
    }
  }
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    cin >> s >> t;
    if (find(join, s) == find(join, t))
      cout << "yes\n";
    else
      cout << "no\n";
  }
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. The `find` function was transformed from a recursive function to an iterative one to save memory usage on the stack. In addition, an optimization known as path compression was used. When `find` is called and a node has to traverse up to find its root, we make each node on the path point to the root directly. This will speed up future `find` operations.

2. We removed redundant calls to `find` in the union operation. By storing the results of `find` for `s` and `t` in `root_s` and `root_t`, we don't need to call `find` again, which saves us time.

Trade-offs:

1. The code becomes slightly more complex with the addition of path compression, but the performance gains in terms of time complexity outweigh this added complexity.

2. Storing the results of `find` operations in `root_s` and `root_t` uses a little more memory, but it significantly reduces the number of function calls, making the trade-off worthwhile.
