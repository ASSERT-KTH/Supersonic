ANALYSIS:

The given code is a flood-fill algorithm that explores a hexagonal grid, with each cell in the grid represented by an element in the `field` vector. The algorithm is implemented using a breadth-first search (BFS) with a queue, `rt`, in which each element contains a pair of coordinates and the current timestamp. The algorithm visits all reachable cells from a given starting position within a given time limit, `t`, and counts the number of visited cells. 

The code seems fairly optimized and there are no glaringly inefficient data structures or algorithms. But there are still a few areas that can be optimized:

1. The calculation of `y` and `ny` are repeated multiple times. This redundancy can be eliminated.
2. The size of the `field` vector is constant, but it is defined with a variable size. Its size can be determined at compile time, which can lead to more efficient memory usage.
3. The use of `mp` macro for `make_pair` is unnecessary and does not lead to any performance benefit. Direct use of `make_pair` or even using `{}` would be more idiomatic and clear.
4. There is a redundant assignment `x = sx` before `y` is calculated for `sx` and `sy`. This can be removed.

OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:

1. Remove redundant calculations: The calculation for `y` and `ny` is repeated multiple times. We can eliminate this redundancy by storing the calculated `y` and `ny` values and reusing them when needed.

2. Use a constant size for the `field` vector: Since the size of the `field` vector is determined by `max` and does not change during execution, we can define `max` as a constant and use it to initialize `field`.

3. Remove the `mp` macro: We can use `make_pair` directly or use `{}` to create pairs. This makes the code more readable.

4. Remove redundant assignment: We can remove the redundant assignment `x = sx`.

OPTIMIZED CODE:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define rep(i, b) for (int i = 0; i < b; i++)
constexpr int m_t = 60;
constexpr int max = 3 * m_t * (m_t + 1) + 1;
constexpr int zero = max / 2;
int dx[6] = {0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 0};
int dy[6] = {1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1};
vector<int> field(max);
int t, n;

int main() {
  while (cin >> t >> n, t) {
    fill(field.begin(), field.end(), 1);
    int x, y;
    rep(i, n) {
      cin >> x >> y;
      y = y * (m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(y)) / 2;
      field[zero + x + y] = 0;
    }
    int sx, sy;
    cin >> sx >> sy;
    y = sy * (m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(sy)) / 2;
    field[zero + sx + y] = 0;
    int ans = 0;
    queue<pair<int, pair<int, int>>> rt;
    rt.push({sx, {sy, 0}});
    while (!rt.empty()) {
      ans++;
      int cx = rt.front().first;
      int cy = rt.front().second.first;
      int ct = rt.front().second.second;
      rt.pop();
      if (ct < t) {
        rep(i, 6) {
          int nx = cx + dx[i];
          int ny = (cy + dy[i]) * (m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(cy + dy[i])) / 2;
          if (field[zero + nx + ny]) {
            field[zero + nx + ny] = 0;
            rt.push({nx, {cy + dy[i], ct + 1}});
          }
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

In this optimized version:
1. The `y` and `ny` calculations are done only once.
2. The `field` vector size is constant.
3. The `mp` macro is replaced with `{}` for creating pairs.
4. The redundant assignment `x = sx` is removed.

This version of the code should be faster and use memory more efficiently than the original version, while producing the same output.
