The given code is a C++ program that conducts a breadth-first search (BFS) on a hexagonal grid. The program reads input parameters and marks certain points on the grid as unreachable. It then starts a BFS from a given start point and counts the number of reachable cells within a certain number of steps.

Here are the key points for optimization:

1. Repeated Computation: The expression `(m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(y)) / 2` is computed multiple times. We can reduce this repeated computation by storing the result in a variable or function.

2. Use of `pair` and `make_pair`: The current code uses `pair` and `make_pair` which makes it less readable. We can simplify this by using structured binding.

3. Use of Vector for Field: The field is represented as a vector, which may not be the most efficient data structure for this use case. Depending on the specific requirements and constraints, an alternative data structure such as an array or a bitset might be more suitable.

4. Code Readability: The current code can be difficult to understand due to poor variable naming and lack of comments. Improving readability will make the code easier to maintain and debug.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define rep(i, b) for (int i = 0; i < b; i++)
#define MAX 60
#define MAX_FIELD_SIZE (3 * MAX * (MAX + 1) + 1)
#define ZERO (MAX_FIELD_SIZE / 2)

int dx[6] = {0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 0};
int dy[6] = {1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1};
vector<int> field(MAX_FIELD_SIZE);
int t, n;

// Function to calculate index
inline int calculate_index(int x, int y) {
    return y * (MAX * 2 + MAX * 2 + 1 - abs(y)) / 2 + x;
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> t >> n, t) {
    fill(field.begin(), field.end(), 1);
    int x, y;
    rep(i, n) {
      cin >> x >> y;
      field[ZERO + calculate_index(x, y)] = 0;
    }
    int start_x, start_y;
    cin >> start_x >> start_y;
    field[ZERO + calculate_index(start_x, start_y)] = 0;
    int count = 0;
    queue<pair<int, int>> rt; // Only store coordinates
    rt.push({start_x, start_y});
    while (!rt.empty()) {
      count++;
      auto [current_x, current_y] = rt.front();
      rt.pop();
      if (count < t) {
        rep(i, 6) {
          int next_x = current_x + dx[i];
          int next_y = current_y + dy[i];
          int index = calculate_index(next_x, next_y);
          if (field[ZERO + index]) {
            field[ZERO + index] = 0;
            rt.push({next_x, next_y});
          }
        }
      }
    }
    cout << count << endl;
  }
}
```

Key changes include:

1. A new function `calculate_index(x, y)` has been created to store the repeated computation.
2. Structured binding is used to unpack the pair in the queue.
3. Improved readability by renaming variables and adding comments.

The functionality of the code remains the same, but readability and efficiency have been improved.
