1. Code Analysis:
The provided code is a typical BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm implementation. The code reads two integers `t` and `n` from the input. If `t` is not zero, it continues to process. It fills the `field` vector with `1`, reads `n` pairs of integers into `x` and `y`, and marks these positions in `field` as `0`. It then reads another pair of integers as the starting point `sx` and `sy`, and starts the BFS algorithm from this point. It continues until the queue `rt` is empty. Finally, it outputs the number of steps `ans` and repeats the process if there is more input.

2. Optimization Strategy:
A. Inefficient data structures: The `field` vector is a large data structure that is not efficiently used. The vector is filled with `1` and then some elements are set to `0`. However, the vector is not cleared before the next iteration which can be a potential memory leakage.
B. Redundant computations: The computation for `y` and `ny` is repeated multiple times in the code. This can be optimized by storing the results of the computation.
C. Loop optimization: The inner loop in the BFS algorithm can be optimized by using iteration instead of recursion. This would reduce the overhead of function calls.
D. Compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations such as `-O2` or `-O3` can be used to further optimize the code.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
A. Optimize the data structure: To optimize the `field` vector, it can be declared as a local variable inside the while loop. This will automatically free up the memory used by the vector after each iteration.
B. Avoid redundant computations: The calculations for `y` and `ny` can be stored in a variable so that they do not need to be recalculated every time. This will reduce computational overhead.
C. Loop optimization: The BFS algorithm can be optimized by using iteration instead of recursion.
D. Compiler optimizations: Using `-O2` or `-O3` compiler options will enable the compiler to perform various optimizations such as inlining small functions, eliminating loops if they do not affect the result, and many more. This will increase the performance of the code.

    rt.push(mp(mp(sx, sy), 0));
    while (!rt.empty()) {
      ans++;
      int cx = rt.front().first.first;
      int cy = rt.front().first.second;
      int ct = rt.front().second;
      rt.pop();
      if (ct < t) {
        rep(i, 6) {
          int nx = cx + dx[i];
          int ny_calc = (cy + dy[i]) * (m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(cy + dy[i])) / 2;
          if (field[zero + nx + ny_calc]) {
            field[zero + nx + ny_calc] = 0;
            rt.push(mp(mp(nx, cy + dy[i]), ct + 1));
          }
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

The optimized code improves performance by reducing redundant computations and better managing memory usage. It also preserves the functionality and output of the original code.
