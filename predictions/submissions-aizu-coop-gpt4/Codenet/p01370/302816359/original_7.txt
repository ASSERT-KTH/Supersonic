Analysis:
The program appears to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) on a hexagonal grid. The BFS is performed by enqueuing neighbors of the current node and visiting them in the order they are dequeued, marking nodes as visited to avoid revisiting them. The search is limited to 't' steps.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Redundant Computation: The calculation of the 'ny' value is repeated in the code. This calculation can be done once and reused.
2. Use of Data Structures: The code uses a 'queue' data structure to store nodes for BFS. This is an appropriate data structure for BFS, as it allows for efficient dequeuing of nodes.
3. Loop Unrolling: The for loop used to iterate over the six possible moves can be unrolled for performance improvement. However, the trade-off is increased code complexity and size.
4. Use of std::pair: The code uses nested pairs to store the x,y coordinates and the time step. This is not a performance issue but it reduces code readability. To improve readability, a struct can be used to represent a 'Node' in the BFS.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, b) for (int i = 0; i < b; i++)
#define m_t 60
#define max (3 * m_t * (m_t + 1) + 1)
#define zero (max / 2)
#define mp make_pair
int dx[6] = {0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 0};
int dy[6] = {1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1};
vector<int> field(max);
int t, n;
int cnt;

struct Node {
    int x, y, t;
    Node(int _x, int _y, int _t) : x(_x), y(_y), t(_t) {}
};

int main() {
  while (cin >> t >> n, t) {
    fill(field.begin(), field.end(), 1);
    int x, y;
    rep(i, n) {
      cin >> x >> y;
      y = y * (m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(y)) / 2;
      field[zero + x + y] = 0;
    }
    int sx, sy;
    cin >> sx >> sy;
    x = sx;
    y = sy * (m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(sy)) / 2;
    field[zero + x + y] = 0;
    int ans = 0;
    queue<Node> rt;
    rt.push(Node(sx, sy, 0));
    while (!rt.empty()) {
      ans++;
      Node current_node = rt.front();
      rt.pop();
      if (current_node.t < t) {
        rep(i, 6) {
          int nx = current_node.x + dx[i];
          int cy = current_node.y + dy[i];
          int ny = cy * (m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(cy)) / 2; // Compute once and reuse
          if (field[zero + nx + ny]) {
            field[zero + nx + ny] = 0;
            rt.push(Node(nx, cy, current_node.t + 1));
          }
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

Trade-off: The optimization does not have much trade-off. It improves code readability by introducing a 'Node' struct to avoid nested pairs, and reduces redundant computation by computing 'ny' once and reusing it. The runtime performance should be slightly improved due to the reduced computation.
