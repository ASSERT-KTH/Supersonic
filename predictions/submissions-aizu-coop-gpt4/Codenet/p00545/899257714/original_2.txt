Code Analysis:
The provided program appears to read a series of inputs and perform a series of calculations involving those inputs. The main performance bottlenecks in the code are the nested loops, which have a time complexity of O(Q * N). In the worst case scenario, where Q and N are both at their maximum values, the time complexity of the program becomes O(N^2), which is quite inefficient.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use More Efficient Data Structures: The program uses arrays for storing people, A, and D. However, arrays are not always the most efficient data structure for all use cases. In this case, we could benefit from using vectors instead of raw arrays.

2. Reduce Redundant Computations: The program calculates 't' within both the east and west conditions, which can be avoided.

3. Optimize Loops and Recursive Calls: The program has a nested for loop structure which can be optimized. Loop unrolling can be a good strategy to reduce the execution time.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The use of compiler optimization flags can also help in enhancing the performance of the program.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace Arrays with Vectors: Using vectors instead of arrays can provide benefits such as dynamic resizing and better memory management. This can be helpful in avoiding memory wastage. Furthermore, vectors provide better cache performance than arrays due to their contiguous memory allocation, which can lead to improved performance.

2. Avoid Redundant Calculations: Calculate 't' only once outside the east and west conditions and use that value in both conditions. This will avoid duplicate computation.

3. Unroll Loops: Loop unrolling can help reduce the overhead of loop control instructions, thereby speeding up the program. However, unrolling loops will only be beneficial if the number of iterations is known and constant. If that's not the case, we will stick with the existing loop structure.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Use compiler optimization flags like -O1, -O2, -O3, or -Ofast during compilation. These flags tell the compiler to optimize the code for speed and/or size which can lead to improved performance.

Trade-offs:
The use of vectors instead of arrays might cause a slight increase in memory usage due to the overhead of the vector's size and capacity variables. However, this is usually a negligible increase and the benefits of using vectors generally outweigh this minor drawback.

Optimized Code Block:
Below is the optimized version of the provided code. The changes are minimal and the functionality of the original code is preserved.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const ll MIN = -(LONG_LONG_MAX - 1);
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int N, Q;
  ll T;
  cin >> N >> T >> Q;

  vector<ll> people(Q), A(N);
  vector<int> D(N);

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> A[i] >> D[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    cin >> people[i];
    people[i]--;
  }

  ll east = MIN;
  ll west = MIN;
  ll t;

  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    if (D[people[i]] == 1) {
      east = A[people[i]];
      for (ll j = people[i] + 1; j < N; j++) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          east = A[j];
        } else {
          t = (east + A[j]) / 2;
          break;
        }
      }
    } else {
      west = A[people[i]];
      for (ll j = people[i] - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          t = (west + A[j]) / 2;
          break;
        } else {
          west = A[j];
        }
      }
    }

    if (T < abs((D[people[i]] == 1 ? east : west) - t)) {
      cout << A[people[i]] + (D[people[i]] == 1 ? T : -T) << "\n";
    } else {
      cout << t << "\n";
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
