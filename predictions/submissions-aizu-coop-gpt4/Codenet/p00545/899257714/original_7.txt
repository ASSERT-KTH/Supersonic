Code Analysis:
This program appears to simulate the movements of a group of people either going east or west. It first takes inputs for number of people (N), time step (T), and query count (Q). It then takes the initial positions (A) and directions (D) of each person. Next, it takes the indices of people for which queries will be made. After setting up the simulation, for each query, it calculates the position of the person after time T and prints it out.

Performance Bottleneck:
1. The main performance bottleneck lies in the nested loop structure where we are calculating the east/west position. For each query, we are running a loop and inside that loop, we are again running a second loop. This makes the time complexity of these loops O(Q*N).

Optimization Strategy:
1. Instead of running the inner loop for each query, we can calculate the final positions of all people in one pass and store them. This will remove the need for nested loops and reduce the time complexity to O(N).
2. The array `people` is of size 1001, which might be more than necessary if Q < 1001. We can dynamically allocate this array to save memory.
3. Instead of using an array for `A` and `D`, we can use a vector of pairs. This will allow us to sort the people based on their position, which might make the calculation of positions more efficient.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const ll MIN = -(LONG_LONG_MAX - 1);

int main() {
  int N, Q;
  ll T;
  cin >> N >> T >> Q;
  vector<pair<ll, int>> people(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> people[i].first >> people[i].second;
  }
  sort(people.begin(), people.end());

  vector<ll> final_positions(N, MIN);
  ll east = MIN;
  ll t;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (people[i].second == 1) {
      east = people[i].first;
      if (i < N-1 && people[i+1].second == 2) {
        t = (east + people[i+1].first) / 2;
        final_positions[i] = min(east + T, t);
        final_positions[i+1] = min(people[i+1].first + T, t);
      } else {
        final_positions[i] = east + T;
      }
    }
  }
  ll west = MIN;
  for (int i = N-1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (people[i].second == 2) {
      west = people[i].first;
      if (i > 0 && people[i-1].second == 1) {
        t = (west + people[i-1].first) / 2;
        final_positions[i] = max(west - T, t);
        final_positions[i-1] = max(people[i-1].first - T, t);
      } else {
        final_positions[i] = west - T;
      }
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    int query;
    cin >> query;
    query--;
    cout << final_positions[query] << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code calculates the final positions of all people in one pass. It then simply prints out the positions for each query, which is a much more efficient approach. The trade-off is that the code becomes slightly more complex, and we need to use more memory to store the final positions of all people. However, the benefit of faster execution time outweighs these trade-offs in most cases.
