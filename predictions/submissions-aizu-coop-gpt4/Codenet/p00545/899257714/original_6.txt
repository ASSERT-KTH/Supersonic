**Code Analysis**

The code appears to simulate a scenario where N people are standing at different points on a line and each person can either move east or west. The Q number of queries are processed where each query is about an individual person. The code calculates a new position for each person after time T, based on the direction they are moving, and outputs it.

The potential performance bottlenecks in the code could be:

1. The nested loops used to find the position of people who are moving either east or west. If the number of people (N) is large, the nested loops could significantly slow down the code.
2. The use of arrays for storing data may also lead to inefficient memory usage. Although arrays are quick for accessing individual elements, they are not efficient for operations like insertion and deletion, and also occupy a fixed amount of memory.

**Optimization Strategy**

To optimize, we could:

1. Replace arrays with vectors, which are more flexible and the memory usage of vectors can be managed more efficiently.
2. Instead of doing linear search (using nested for loops) to find the position of people moving east or west, we could use a more efficient searching algorithm or data structure.
3. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up cin and cout operations.
4. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl` because `endl` causes a flush operation which can be slower.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **Replace arrays with vectors:** Vectors in C++ are dynamic, i.e., they can resize themselves automatically when an element is inserted or deleted. The container automatically handles the size. It also allows us to insert data at any place in the container. Thus vectors are more flexible than an array.

2. **Efficient search strategy:** The nested loops currently used to find the next position of people moving east or west are not very efficient. We could instead sort the data and use binary search, or use a data structure such as a set or a map, which can find elements in logarithmic time.

3. **Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:** This code disables the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams if it is called before the program performs its first input or output operation. Adding `ios_base::sync_with_stdio (false);` can speed up cin and cout.

4. **Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`:** `endl` inserts a new line into output and flushes the output buffer. This flushing operation can be slower and using `'\n'` instead can speed up the output.

**Optimized Code Block**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const ll MIN = -(LONG_LONG_MAX - 1);
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int N, Q;
  ll T;
  cin >> N >> T >> Q;
  vector<ll> people(1001);
  vector<ll> A(100001);
  vector<int> D(100001);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> A[i] >> D[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    cin >> people[i];
    people[i]--;
  }
  ll east = MIN;
  ll west = MIN;
  ll t;
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    if (D[people[i]] == 1) {
      east = A[people[i]];
      for (ll j = people[i] + 1; j < N; j++) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          east = A[j];
        } else {
          t = (east + A[j]) / 2;
          break;
        }
      }
      if (T < abs(t - A[people[i]])) {
        cout << A[people[i]] + T << '\n';
      } else {
        cout << t << '\n';
      }
    } else {
      west = A[people[i]];
      for (ll j = people[i] - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          t = (west + A[j]) / 2;
          break;
        } else {
          west = A[j];
        }
      }
      if (T < abs(A[people[i]] - t)) {
        cout << A[people[i]] - T << '\n';
      } else {
        cout << t << '\n';
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note that without changing the logic of the program - specifically the way it handles the east and west movements - it's difficult to further optimize the code. To do so would require more information about the problem constraints and requirements.
