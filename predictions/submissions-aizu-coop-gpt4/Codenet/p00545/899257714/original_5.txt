Code Analysis:
This C++ program seems to be a part of a simulation or contest-related problem where people are moving either east or west. The code reads inputs for the number of people, a time value, and a query value. It then reads the positions and directions of each person. Then it gets the indexes of the people for whom we need to find the final positions after the time 'T'. The main part of the code calculates the final positions of those people.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. The above code suffers from redundant computation in the nested loops where it tries to compute 'east' or 'west' positions.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient data structures: The array used here is not inefficient since we are using direct indexing and not performing any search operation.

2. Redundant computations: The nested loop computations performed for each query are redundant. We can precalculate and store the east and west positions of each person in two arrays. Then we can simply use these arrays to calculate the final position of a person.

3. Loops/recursion: The nested loop inside each query can be removed by precalculating the east and west positions.

4. Compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations are generally not suggested because they may not be portable across different compilers. However, using the `-O3` flag with g++ compiler can help to optimize the code further.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. To eliminate redundant computation, we will add a pre-processing step before executing the queries. In this step, we will loop through all the people and calculate the east and west positions for each person. We will store these positions in two arrays `eastPos` and `westPos`.
2. For each query, we can directly use these precalculated positions to calculate the final position of a person.
3. This approach reduces the time complexity of each query from O(N) to O(1). The total time complexity is still O(N) because we added a preprocessing step of O(N).
4. The trade-off is that we use slightly more memory to store the east and west positions. However, this is a reasonable trade-off because the number of people is up to 100001, which is manageable in modern computers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits.h>

int main() {
  int N, Q;
  ll T;

  ll A[100001];
  int D[100001];
  ll eastPos[100001];
  ll westPos[100001];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> A[i] >> D[i];
    if (i > 0 && D[i] == 1 && D[i - 1] == 2) {
      eastPos[i - 1] = westPos[i] = (A[i - 1] + A[i]) / 2;
    }
    if (D[i] == 1) {
      eastPos[i] = A[i];
    } else if (i > 0) {
      eastPos[i] = eastPos[i - 1];
    }
    if (D[i] == 2) {
      westPos[i] = A[i];
    } else if (i > 0) {
      westPos[i] = westPos[i - 1];
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    cin >> people[i];
    people[i]--;
  }
  ll t;
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    if (D[people[i]] == 1) {
      t = eastPos[people[i]];
      if (T < abs(t - A[people[i]])) {
        cout << A[people[i]] + T << endl;
      } else {
        cout << t << endl;
      }
    } else {
      t = westPos[people[i]];
      if (T < abs(A[people[i]] - t)) {
        cout << A[people[i]] - T << endl;
      } else {
        cout << t << endl;
      }
