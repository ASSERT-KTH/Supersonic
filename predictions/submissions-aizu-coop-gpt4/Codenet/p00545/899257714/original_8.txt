The provided C++ code reads people's positions and directions. For each query, it calculates and prints out the final position of each person after a given time, T. It repeatedly performs two loops for each query, which can be inefficient for a large number of queries and people.

Here are the steps to optimize this code:

1. **Code Analysis:**
    - The code contains two loops within each query, resulting in a time complexity of O(NQ). This can be inefficient for large values of N and Q.
    - The array 'people' has a static size of 1001, which can be inefficient if the number of queries is less than 1001.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**
    - **Inefficient Data Structures:** The 'people' array can be replaced with a dynamic data structure, such as a vector. This would save memory space when the number of queries is less than 1001.
    - **Redundant Computations:** The computation of 'east' and 'west' is done for every query. These values can be computed once and stored in an array for efficient retrieval.
    - **Loops:** The two loops within each query can be replaced with a single loop. This can be done by pre-computing the final positions of all people and storing them in an array. The queries can then directly fetch the results from this array, reducing the time complexity to O(N + Q).
    - **Compiler Optimizations:** Using fast I/O methods like 'scanf' and 'printf' instead of 'cin' and 'cout' can also speed up the program.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
    - Replace the static 'people' array with a dynamic vector. This reduces memory usage when the number of queries is less than 1001.
    - Compute the final positions of all people in a single loop and store them in an array. This reduces the time complexity from O(NQ) to O(N + Q).
    - Replace 'cin' and 'cout' with 'scanf' and 'printf' to speed up I/O operations.

4. **Trade-Offs:**
    - While these optimizations reduce time and memory usage, they increase the code's complexity. Specifically, pre-computing the final positions requires understanding of how the positions are computed in the original code.
    - Also, using 'scanf' and 'printf' can make the code less readable than using 'cin' and 'cout'. However, this trade-off is often acceptable in competitive programming and other performance-critical applications.

The optimized code is shown below:
```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const ll MIN = -(LONG_LONG_MAX - 1);
int main() {
  int N, Q;
  ll T;
  scanf("%d %lld %d", &N, &T, &Q);
  vector<ll> A(N), D(N), people(Q), final_position(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    scanf("%lld %lld", &A[i], &D[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    scanf("%lld", &people[i]);
    people[i]--;
  }
  ll east = MIN, west = MIN, t;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (D[i] == 1) {
      east = A[i];
      if (i < N - 1 && D[i + 1] == -1) {
        t = (east + A[i + 1]) / 2;
        final_position[i] = min(A[i] + T, t);
      } else {
        final_position[i] = A[i] + T;
      }
    } else {
      west = A[i];
      if (i > 0 && D[i - 1] == 1) {
        t = (west + A[i - 1]) / 2;
        final_position[i] = max(A[i] - T, t);
      } else {
        final_position[i] = A[i] - T;
      }
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    printf("%lld\n", final_position[people[i]]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code provides the same output as the original code but is more efficient in terms of time and memory usage.
