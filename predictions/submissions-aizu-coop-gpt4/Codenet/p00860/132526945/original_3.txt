1. Code Analysis:
- This program seems to be a pathfinding program, likely a variant of BFS (Breadth-First Search) for a 2D grid. 
- There are three main functions: `main()`, `solve()`, and `check()`. `check()` function is used in `solve()` to verify the validity of a move.
- The `wall` array is used to store the locations of walls in the grid. The `vis` array is used to store the state of each possible point in the grid to check if it was visited or not.
- The function `solve()` is the main part of the program, where the BFS algorithm is implemented.
- The `main()` function reads the input, sets up the start and goal positions, and calls the `solve()` function. 

2. Optimization Strategy:
- The `check()` function is called frequently and can be optimized. The majority of the time is spent shifting and masking bits. Precomputing some of these operations can help.
- The `solve()` function contains nested loops which can be optimized by reducing computations within the loops and reducing the number of function calls.
- Use of `memset` function for resetting the `vis` array can be optimized.
- The I/O functions `scanf()` and `printf()` can be replaced with faster alternatives for significant speedup.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
- We can create a lookup table for the operation `i << 4 | j` which appears in multiple places in the code. This will reduce the computation time as we will replace a bit manipulation operation with a simple array access.
- The `check()` function can be optimized by removing the loop and manually unrolling it for each 8 bits. This will reduce the number of iterations.
- The BFS loops inside the `solve()` function can be optimized by reducing the number of function calls. We can inline the function `check()` to avoid function call overheads.
- The `memset` function used for resetting the `vis` array uses a loop internally to set all values. Instead of using `memset`, we can keep a `timestamp` counter that is incremented for every new BFS. When we visit a cell, we set `vis[cell]` to the current timestamp. To check if a cell is visited, we check if `vis[cell] == timestamp`. If we need to do a new BFS, we increment the `timestamp` instead of resetting the whole `vis` array.
- For faster I/O, replace `scanf` with `getchar_unlocked()` to read input and `printf` with `putchar_unlocked()` to write output. This can give a significant speedup because these functions don't have the overhead of checking for multithreading locks.

4. Optimized Code Block:
Please note that the following optimized code is a rough draft and you might need to debug before using it.

```cpp
#include <cctype>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;
unsigned short vis[1 << 24];
char c[16][20];
bool wall[256];
int tm0;
int lookup[256];

inline int check(int u, int v) {
  int p1 = v & 255;
  if (p1 && (wall[p1] || p1 == ((v >> 8) & 255) || p1 == (u & 255))) {
    return false;
  }
  p1 = (v >> 8) & 255;
  if (p1 && (wall[p1] || p1 == ((v >> 16) & 255) || p1 == ((u >> 8) & 255))) {
    return false;
  }
  p1 = v >> 16;
  if (p1 && (wall[p1] || p1 == (v & 255) || p1 == ((u >> 16) & 255))) {
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}

int solve(int start, int goal) {
  const int dif[5] = {0, -1, 1, -16, 16};
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(start);
  q.push(-1);
  int tm = tm0 + 1;
  vis[start] = tm;
  while (1) {
    int u = q.front();
    q.pop();
    if (u < 0) {
      q.push(-1);
      ++tm;
    } else {
      for (int i1 = u & 255 ? 4 : 0; i1 >= 0; --i1)
        for (int i2 = u >> 8 & 255 ? 4 : 0; i2 >= 0; --i2)
          for (int i3 = u >> 16 ? 4 : 0; i3 >= 0; --i3) {
            int v = u + dif[i1] + (dif[i2] << 8) + (dif[i3] << 16);
            if (vis[v] == tm) {
              continue;
            }
            if (check(u, v)) {
              if (v == goal) {
                return tm;
              }
              vis[v] = tm;
              q.push(v);
            }
          }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int w, h;
  for(int i = 0; i < 256; i++)
    lookup[i] = i << 4 | j;
  while (scanf("%d%d%*d ", &w, &h), w) {
    for (int i = 0; i < h; ++i) {
      fgets(c[i], 20, stdin);
    }
    int goal = 0;
    int start = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; ++i) {
      for (int j = 0; j < w; ++j) {
        if (c[i][j] == '#') {
          wall[lookup[i] | j] = true;
        } else {
          wall[lookup[i] | j] = false;
          if (isupper(c[i][j])) {
            goal |= lookup[i] | j << (c[i][j] - 'A') * 8;
          } else if (islower(c[i][j])) {
            start |= lookup[i] | j << (c[i][j] - 'a') * 8;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    int tm = solve(start, goal);
    printf("%d\n", tm - tm0);
    tm0 = tm + 1;
  }
}
