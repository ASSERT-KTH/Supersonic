This code is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a grid-based game. This is a complex piece of code, which appears to be reasonably well-optimized already. There are not many obvious areas where it can be further optimized without changing the underlying algorithm. However, there are a few minor improvements that could be made:

1. **Use of `scanf` and `printf`:**
The standard I/O functions `scanf` and `printf` are typically slower than their C++ counterparts `std::cin` and `std::cout`, due to their additional overhead of parsing format strings. Replacing these can lead to minor performance improvements.

2. **Use of `std::vector<>` for cost matrix:**
The `cost` matrix is a 2D vector that is used to store the cost of moving between different cells in the grid. Each element of the vector is a vector of `Edge` structures. This structure has a lot of overhead, as each vector dynamically allocates its elements on the heap. Instead, we could use a 1D array of structures, which would have less overhead and might be faster due to better cache coherency.

3. **Use of `std::priority_queue<>` in Dijkstra's algorithm:**
The priority queue is used to select the next cell to visit in the algorithm, but it is not the most efficient data structure for this purpose. It takes O(log N) time to insert an element and to delete an element. A more efficient data structure would be a binary heap or a Fibonacci heap, which can perform these operations in O(1) time on average.

4. **Minimizing Recomputation:**
There are some instances in the code where the same expression is computed multiple times. For example, `xy2pos(x, y)` is called multiple times with the same arguments. It would be more efficient to compute this once and store the result in a variable.

5. **Compiler Optimization Flags:**
Using compiler optimization flags can also help in improving the performance of the code. The `-O3` flag instructs the compiler to perform high-level optimizations that can significantly speed up the code.
