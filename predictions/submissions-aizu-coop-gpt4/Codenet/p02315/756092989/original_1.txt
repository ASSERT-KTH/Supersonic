Code Analysis:
The given code is a C++ program implementing the Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. The program accepts the number of items and the total weight that can be carried in the knapsack, followed by the weight and values of each item. The program then calculates the maximum value that can be carried in the knapsack.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Reduce the number of global variables: The variables n, W, weight, value, and dp are all declared as global variables. While this might not directly affect the performance, it increases the chances of variable clashes and makes the code harder to maintain. These variables can be declared inside the main function.

2. Improve Memory Usage: The dp table currently uses a 2D array, which can be optimized to a 1D array because the current state only depends on the previous state. This will save a significant amount of memory.

3. Unnecessary Initialization: The line `rep(i, W + 1) dp[0][W] = 0;` is initializing the entire dp array to be 0, but this is unnecessary as we only need to initialize dp[0] to be 0.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, W;
  cin >> n >> W;

  vector<int> weight(n);
  vector<int> value(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  }

  vector<int> dp(W + 1, 0);  // Initialize dp array with size W+1 and all values as 0

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int w = W; w >= weight[i]; w--) {
      dp[w] = max(dp[w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[w]);
    }
  }

  cout << dp[W] << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The variables n, W, weight, and value are now local to the main function. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

2. The dp array is now a 1D array of size W+1. This reduces memory usage from O(n*W) to O(W).

3. The initialization of the dp array is now done during the declaration of the vector using the vector constructor. This avoids an unnecessary loop to initialize the dp array.

Trade-offs:

1. The code might be a bit harder to understand for beginners because we use a single dimension dp array instead of a two dimension dp array. But this trade-off is acceptable for more efficient memory usage.

2. The inner loop now runs in reverse order to avoid overwriting values that will be used later in the same iteration. This may be a bit counter-intuitive, but it is necessary when using a 1D dp array.
