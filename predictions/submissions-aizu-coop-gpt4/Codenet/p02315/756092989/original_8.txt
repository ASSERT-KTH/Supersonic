1. Code Analysis:

This code implements the classic 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. The goal is to find the maximum total value of items that can be put in a knapsack of a certain weight limit. 

2. Optimization Strategy:

   A. Inefficient data structures: The 'dp' array is a two-dimensional array but only two rows are used in the computation at any given time - the current row and the previous row. We can reduce this to two one-dimensional arrays.
   
   B. Redundant computations: The initialization of the 'dp' array is redundant as C++ automatically initializes non-local integral types to 0.
   
   C. Loops/recursive calls: The loops are necessary for this dynamic programming solution and cannot be optimized further.

   D. Compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations such as '-O2' or '-O3' can be used for speedups.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   A. To optimize the 'dp' array from a two-dimensional array to two one-dimensional arrays, we observe that the 'dp' value of any item only depends on the 'dp' value of the previous item. Therefore, we can use two arrays, 'dp_current' and 'dp_previous', to keep track of the current and previous 'dp' values, respectively. This would reduce the memory usage of the program.

   B. The initialization of the 'dp' array is redundant because C++ automatically initializes non-local integral types to 0. We can remove this redundant initialization.

   C. As for the loops, they are necessary for the dynamic programming solution and cannot be optimized further. The inner loop iterates over all possible weights, and the outer loop iterates over all items. This is necessary because the 'dp' value of any item depends on the 'dp' values of all smaller weights and all previous items.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, W;
    cin >> n >> W;
    int value[n], weight[n];
    int dp_current[W+1], dp_previous[W+1];

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];

    for (int i = 0; i <= W; i++) dp_previous[i] = 0; // initialization

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
            if (w >= weight[i]) {
                dp_current[w] = max(dp_previous[w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp_previous[w]);
            } else {
                dp_current[w] = dp_previous[w];
            }
        }
        for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) dp_previous[w] = dp_current[w]; // updating dp_previous with dp_current
    }

    cout << dp_current[W] << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
The trade-off in this optimization is that we have to copy the 'dp_current' array to the 'dp_previous' array in each iteration, which adds a little bit of extra computation. However, the memory savings from reducing the 'dp' array from two dimensions to one dimension is significant, especially when 'n' and 'W' are large, so this trade-off is worthwhile.
