Code Analysis:
The given C++ program is an implementation of the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. It reads the number of items `n` and maximum weight `W`, followed by the values and weights of the items. It then computes the maximum value that can be achieved with a total weight less than or equal to `W`.

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:

1. The code uses a 2D array dp[110][10010] to store the maximum value for each subset of items. This array is large and may contain many unused cells if `n` and `W` are small. This is inefficient use of memory.

2. The code includes a large number of debugging and utility macros that are not used in the main program. These increase the code size and complexity.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a smaller dynamic array for dp[][], allocated based on the actual values of `n` and `W`. This can significantly reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unused debugging and utility macros to simplify the code.

3. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` to speed up I/O operations.

4. Use `memset` to initialize the dp array to 0, which is faster than a loop.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

int n, W;
int weight[110], value[110];
int **dp;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  cin >> n >> W;

  dp = new int*[n+1];
  for(int i=0; i<=n; i++) {
    dp[i] = new int[W+1];
  }

  for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  }

  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
      if (w >= weight[i]) {
        dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
      } else {
        dp[i + 1][w] = dp[i][w];
      }
    }
  }

  cout << dp[n][W] << endl;

  for(int i=0; i<=n; i++) {
    delete [] dp[i];
  }
  delete [] dp;

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, memory for the dp array is allocated dynamically based on the inputs `n` and `W`. This can significantly reduce memory usage when `n` and `W` are small. The unused debugging and utility macros are removed, and I/O operations are sped up with `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`. The dp array is initialized to 0 with `memset`, which is faster than a loop. Finally, the memory for the dp array is correctly deallocated at the end of the program to prevent memory leaks.
