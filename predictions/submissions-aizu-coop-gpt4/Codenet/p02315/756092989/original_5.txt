After analyzing your code, I see that this is a classic 0/1 Knapsack problem implementation. The code is already pretty optimized, but I can suggest a few changes to make it even better:

1. Optimizing data structures: The 2D DP array takes up `O(nW)` space, but it's not necessary to keep so many previous states. Only the last one is needed, so we can change the 2D DP array to a 1D array to optimize memory usage.

2. Reducing computations: The initialization of the DP array seems to be incorrect because, in the loop, you are initializing all the DP[0][W] values to 0, but it should be initialized for all DP[0][w] where w ranges from 0 to W.

3. Loop optimization: There's no need to loop unrolling or recursion optimization here. The loops are already fairly optimized.

4. Compiler optimizations: There's no need for compiler optimizations here. The code is pretty straightforward.

Let's optimize the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define ll long long
#define vvi vector<vector<int>>
#define vec vector
#define pq priority_queue
#define all(v) (v).begin(), (v).end()
#define uniqueV(x) sort(x.begin(), x.end()); x.erase(unique(x.begin(), x.end()), x.end());
#define rep(i, n) for (int(i) = (0); (i) < (n); ++(i))
#define repp(i, m, n) for (int(i) = (m); (i) < (n); ++(i))

const int dx[] = {1, -1, 0, 0};
const int dy[] = {0, 0, -1, 1};
const double PI = 3.14159265358979323846;

int n, W;
int weight[110], value[110];
int dp[10010]; // We have changed 2D array to 1D array

int main() {
  cin >> n >> W;
  rep(i, n) cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];

  memset(dp,0,sizeof(dp)); // Initialize all dp[w] to 0.

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int w = W; w >= 0; w--) { // We reverse the order of this loop because we are now using a 1D DP array
      if (w >= weight[i]) {
        dp[w] = max(dp[w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[w]);
      }
      // No else part needed because if we can't take the item, nothing changes so we can leave dp[w] as it is
    }
  }
  cout << dp[W] << endl; // We changed dp[n][W] to dp[W] because we are now using a 1D DP array
  return 0;
}
```

Changes made:

1. Changed the 2D DP array to a 1D array.
2. Corrected the initialization of the DP array.
3. Reversed the order of the inner loop to accommodate the 1D DP array.
4. Removed the else part because if we can't take the item, nothing changes so we can leave dp[w] as it is.
5. Changed dp[n][W] to dp[W] because we are now using a 1D DP array.
