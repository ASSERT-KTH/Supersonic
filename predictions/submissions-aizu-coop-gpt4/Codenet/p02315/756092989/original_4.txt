1. Code Analysis:

The code is an implementation of the 0-1 Knapsack problem, a classic dynamic programming problem. The objective is to maximize the total value of items picked without exceeding the total weight limit. The code uses a bottom-up approach to solve the problem. 

The overall logic of the code is good, but there are some inefficiencies that could be improved.

2. Optimization Strategy:

a. Inefficient data structures: The 2D array `dp` is a good choice for this problem. 

b. Redundant or unnecessary computations: There is a redundant initialization of the `dp` array that can be removed.

c. Loops or recursive calls: The loops are necessary for this problem and are already efficient.

d. Compiler optimizations or pragma directives: The standard compiler optimization flags can be utilized.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

a. Remove unnecessary initialization: `dp[0][W] = 0;` This line is unnecessary because the dp array is already initialized to 0. 

b. Compiler Optimization: Using compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` can help to improve the performance of the code. These flags instruct the compiler to perform additional optimizations such as inline expansion, loop unrolling, and vectorization.

c. Remove unnecessary debugging macros: The debugging macros (`debug`, `debug2`, `debug3`, `debugB`, `line`, and `printA`) are not used in the code and can be removed to clean up the code.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define rep(i, n) for (int(i) = (0); (i) < (n); ++(i))

int n, W;
int weight[110], value[110];
int dp[110][10010];

int main() {
  cin >> n >> W;
  rep(i, n) cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
      if (w >= weight[i]) {
        dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
      } else {
        dp[i + 1][w] = dp[i][w];
      }
    }
  }

  cout << dp[n][W] << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Note: Remember to compile the code using the optimization flags `-O2` or `-O3`. For example, if you're using the GCC compiler, you would do this:

```bash
g++ -O2 -o knapsack knapsack.cpp
```
