This code implements a popular dynamic programming problem, the Knapsack problem. The given code is already quite efficient but there are a few places where performance can be improved.

1. **Code Analysis:**
   - The major performance bottleneck in this program is the double loop inside the main function. This loop has a time complexity of O(N*W) which can be pretty large if the input size is large.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**
   - The double loop cannot be completely eliminated as it is needed for solving the problem, but we can optimize the memory usage.
   - Instead of using a 2D array (dp[1001][10001]), we can use a 1D array (dp[10001]).

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
   1. Replace the 2D array with a 1D array. In the given problem, we only need to keep track of the maximum value for the current weight. So, instead of keeping track of all the previous weights and values, we can just keep track of the current weight. This will significantly reduce the memory usage.
   2. Change the loop order. By iterating the weights in reverse order, we can ensure that we are always using the values from the previous iteration without affecting the current iteration. This is important because in our new approach, updating dp[j] depends on dp[j-w[i]] which is a value from the previous iteration.
   3. The trade-off here is that the code might be a bit harder to understand, but the memory usage improvement makes it worth it.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**
```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> v(N), w(N);
  vector<int> dp(W+1, 0); // 1D DP array
  
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> v[i] >> w[i];
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = W; j >= w[i]; j--) { // Reverse loop
      dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - w[i]] + v[i]);
    }
  }

  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code works exactly the same as the original code but with a lower memory footprint. The space complexity has been reduced from O(N*W) to O(W).
