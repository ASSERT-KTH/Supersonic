This is a typical 0/1 Knapsack problem solved using dynamic programming. The code reads the number of items and the maximum weight from input, then reads pairs of values and weights for each item. It then uses a dynamic programming table to calculate the maximum value that can be obtained with a weight limit. The solution is printed out at the end.

Looking at the code, there are a few opportunities for optimization:

1. Memory Usage: The dp array is allocated with a fixed size of 1001 x 10001. If N or W are significantly less than these maximums, a lot of memory is wasted.

2. Redundant Computations: The inner loop over 'j' performs a redundant comparison 'j - w[i] < 0' for every 'j' and 'i'. This can be avoided.

3. Loop Unrolling: The inner loop over 'j' can be split into two separate loops to avoid the if-else condition, which should improve performance.

Here are the proposed optimizations:

1. Instead of using a fixed-size array for dp, use a two-dimensional vector, which can dynamically adjust its size to exactly match N and W. This will reduce memory usage.

2. The if-else condition inside the nested loop can be avoided by splitting the loop into two separate loops. The first loop runs from 0 to w[i] - 1, and the second from w[i] to W. This removes the need for the 'j - w[i] < 0' comparison in each iteration.

3. Compiler Optimizations: Use the -O3 flag when compiling the code. This enables all optimization flags, which can lead to significant performance improvements.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> v(N), w(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> v[i] >> w[i];

  // Change to dynamic 2D vector
  vector<vector<int>> dp(N + 1, vector<int>(W + 1));

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < w[i]; j++) {
      dp[i + 1][j] = dp[i][j];
    }
    for (int j = w[i]; j <= W; j++) {
      dp[i + 1][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j - w[i]] + v[i]);
    }
  }
  cout << dp[N][W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code should run faster and use less memory than the original, while still producing the same output. It's also more complex due to the split loop, so readability suffers slightly. However, for performance-critical code, this is a trade-off that's often worth making.
