Code Analysis:
This program is a classical 0/1 Knapsack problem solution using dynamic programming. It receives as input the number of items `N` and the maximum weight `W` the knapsack can hold. For each item, it reads its value `v[i]` and weight `w[i]`. The aim of the program is to find the maximum total value that can be obtained by considering the weight constraint `W`.

The main part of the program is the nested loop which iterates over all items and all possible weights from 0 to `W`, filling a 2D array `dp` with the maximum value that can be obtained considering the current item and current weight.

The main performance bottleneck in this code is the space complexity, as it uses a 2D array `dp` of size `N` x `W`, which can be quite large if `N` and `W` are large.

Optimization Strategy:
Since each calculation of `dp[i + 1][j]` only depends on the current row and the row before it, we can reduce the space complexity from `O(N*W)` to `O(W)` by only keeping two rows of the `dp` array at a time.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Instead of using a 2D array `dp` of size `N`x`W`, we use two 1D arrays `dp_current` and `dp_previous` each of size `W+1`. `dp_previous` stores the maximum values that can be obtained considering the previous item and all possible weights, while `dp_current` is used to calculate the maximum values considering the current item and all possible weights.
2. Before starting the loop over all items, initialize `dp_previous` with 0s, as no item has been considered yet.
3. In the loop over all items, for each item, calculate `dp_current[j]` for all possible weights `j` from 0 to `W`. If `j - w[i]` is less than 0, `dp_current[j]` is equal to `dp_previous[j]`. Otherwise, `dp_current[j]` is the maximum of `dp_previous[j]` and `dp_previous[j - w[i]] + v[i]`.
4. After calculating `dp_current` for the current item, copy `dp_current` to `dp_previous` in preparation for the next item.
5. The maximum value that can be obtained considering all items and the weight constraint `W` is `dp_previous[W]`.

Trade-offs:
This optimization significantly reduces the space complexity from `O(N*W)` to `O(W)`, but slightly increases the code complexity, as we need to manage two arrays and copy one array to another in each iteration.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // for std::max
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> v(N), w(N), dp_previous(W+1, 0), dp_current(W+1, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> v[i] >> w[i];
    
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
      if (j - w[i] < 0) {
        dp_current[j] = dp_previous[j];
      } else {
        dp_current[j] = max(dp_previous[j], dp_previous[j - w[i]] + v[i]);
      }
    }
    dp_previous = dp_current; // copy current dp to previous dp
  }
  cout << dp_previous[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
