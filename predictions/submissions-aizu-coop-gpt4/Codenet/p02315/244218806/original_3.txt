Code Analysis:

The given code is a classic implementation of the Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. It is designed to handle a knapsack of maximum weight W and N items, each with its own weight and value. The goal is to fill the knapsack such that the total value is maximized, without exceeding the weight limit. 

The performance bottleneck in this code can be the space complexity due to the use of a 2D array 'dp' of size 1001x10001 for storing the dynamic programming states. This can lead to higher memory usage and potential slowdowns on some systems.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a 1D array instead of the 2D array: We can reduce the space complexity from O(N*W) to O(W) by considering the items in reverse order in the inner loop. This way, we can reuse the results from the last computation without needing to store all the previous results.

2. Efficient I/O operations: We can use faster I/O operations by using 'std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)', which can significantly speed up the cin and cout operations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. 1D Array instead of 2D: In the original code, we use dp[i][j] to represent the maximum value we can get by considering the first 'i' items and with a maximum weight of 'j'. By reversing the order in the inner loop, we can make sure that when we compute dp[j], dp[j-w[i]] is always representing the state of dp[i-1][j-w[i]], thus eliminating the need for the second dimension of the array.

2. Efficient I/O operations: By default, cin and cout are synchronized with the C standard streams. By disabling this synchronization, we can make I/O operations faster, but we should be careful to use either cin/cout or scanf/printf in one instance to avoid any inconsistencies.

Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
vector<int> dp(10001, 0);
int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> v(N), w(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> v[i] >> w[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = W; j >= w[i]; j--) {
        dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - w[i]] + v[i]);
    }
  }
  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:

The optimized code has a reduced space complexity from O(N*W) to O(W), which can significantly reduce memory usage. However, the logic of the code becomes a bit harder to understand due to the reversed loop.
