Code Analysis:
The given code is a basic implementation of the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. It takes two inputs, N and W, which represent the total number of items and the maximum weight the knapsack can hold. The code then creates two vectors, v and w, to hold the values and weights of the items. It uses a 2D array, dp, to store the maximum value that can be obtained for each weight up to W. The main performance issues with this code are:

1. The use of a 2D array of size [N+1][W+1], which can cause high memory usage if N and W are large.
2. The nested for loop, which creates a time complexity of O(NW), can cause the program to run slowly if N and W are large.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Data Structure: We can replace the 2D array with a 1D array of size W+1. This is possible because each row in the dp table only relies on the row above it, so we can keep overwriting the same row and still get the correct result.
2. Redundant Computations: By reversing the inner loop, we can eliminate the need for the if-else condition in the inner loop. This is because we ensure that the weights are processed in decreasing order, so j-w[i] will never be negative.
3. Loop Optimization: Loop unrolling or tail recursion are not applicable here because the loop bounds depend on the input size.
4. Compiler Optimization: Compiler optimizations are not needed in this case. 

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Data Structure: As mentioned, we can replace the 2D array with a 1D array of size W+1. This reduces memory usage from O(NW) to O(W), which is an important optimization if the weight limit W is much smaller than the number of items N.
2. Redundant Computations: By reversing the inner loop, we can eliminate the if-else condition. This is because we ensure that the weights are processed in decreasing order, so j-w[i] will never be negative. This makes the code simpler and slightly faster because we avoid an unnecessary condition check in each iteration of the inner loop.

Trade-offs: The main trade-off here is that the code becomes slightly less intuitive because it's not immediately obvious why we can replace the 2D array with a 1D array and why we can reverse the inner loop. However, the gain in performance and memory usage is worth this slight increase in code complexity.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> v(N), w(N);
  vector<int> dp(W+1, 0);  // 1D array to replace original 2D array
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> v[i] >> w[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = W; j >= w[i]; j--) {  // Reversed loop
      dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - w[i]] + v[i]);  // No need for if-else condition
    }
  }
  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
