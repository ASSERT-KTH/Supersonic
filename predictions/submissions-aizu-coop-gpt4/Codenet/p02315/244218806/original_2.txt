Code Analysis:

The given code is an implementation of the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. It reads the number of items (N) and the maximum weight (W) allowed for the knapsack. For each item, it reads its value (v) and weight (w) and calculates the maximum total value that can be achieved without exceeding the knapsack's weight limit.

Potential performance bottlenecks:
1. Memory Usage: The dp array is of size [1001][10001] which takes a considerable amount of memory.
2. Nested loop: The nested loop with indices i and j runs N * W times, which can be processor-intensive for large inputs.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Reducing Memory Usage: The current dp array stores the maximum value for all weights from 0 to W for all items. However, we only need the previous item's data to calculate the current item's maximum value. Thus, we can optimize the dp array to a 1D array of size W + 1.

2. Loop Optimization: The inner loop runs from 0 to W. However, we can optimize this by running the loop backward from W to the item's weight. This is because for each item, we only need to consider the dp values of the weights that are greater than or equal to its weight.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> v(N), w(N), dp(W+1, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> v[i] >> w[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = W; j >= w[i]; j--) {
        dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - w[i]] + v[i]);
    }
  }
  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The dp array is reduced to 1D, saving significant memory. Now, dp[j] represents the maximum value that can be achieved with a weight limit of j. 

2. The inner loop is optimized to run backward from W to the weight of the current item. This ensures that each dp[j] is only updated once in each iteration of the outer loop.

These changes improve the time and space efficiency of the program. However, they make the code slightly less intuitive, as the dp array now only represents the current state, not the entire history of computations.
