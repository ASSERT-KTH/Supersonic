1. Code Analysis:

The provided code is implementing the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. It reads the number of items `N` and the maximum weight `W`, and for each item it reads the `value` and `weight`. It then uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum value that can be obtained within the weight limit.

The code seems to be efficient in terms of time complexity. The time complexity of the code is `O(N*W)`, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem. However, the code can be optimized in terms of memory usage.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. The code uses a 2D array `dp` of size `110*10010` to store the intermediate values. This array can be optimized to a 1D array of size `W+1` because for the calculation of `dp[i][w]`, we only need the values from the previous row, i.e., `dp[i-1][w]`.

B. The input size `N` and `W` are read from standard input and then used to declare arrays `value` and `weight`. Variable length arrays are not a standard C++ feature, and it would be better to use `std::vector` instead.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. To optimize the `dp` array, we need to traverse the `dp` array in reverse order in the inner loop. This is because we want to use the updated `dp[w]` in the same iteration which is equivalent to `dp[i-1][w]` in the original code.

B. To fix the issue with variable length arrays, we can use `std::vector`. As `std::vector` is a dynamic array, we can easily resize it according to our needs.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> value(N), weight(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  vector<int> dp(W+1, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int w = W; w >= weight[i]; w--) {
      dp[w] = max(dp[w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[w]);
    }
  }
  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

The memory usage of this code is `O(W)`, which is a significant improvement over the original code. The time complexity remains `O(N*W)`, which is optimal for this problem.
