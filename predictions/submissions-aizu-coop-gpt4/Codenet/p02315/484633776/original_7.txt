This code represents a solution to the knapsack problem, which is a classic problem in combinatorics and computer science. The knapsack problem is about finding the maximum value that can be obtained by a given set of items, each with a weight and a value, so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit. The solution uses dynamic programming to solve this problem.

Code Analysis:
1. The dp array is larger than it needs to be. It's currently a two-dimensional array with a size of 110 x 10010, but the second dimension only needs to be as large as the weight limit W, and the first dimension only needs to be as large as N (the number of items). 

2. The loop that initializes the first row of the dp array only needs to go up to W, not 110. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Reducing the size of the dp array to [N+1][W+1] will minimize memory usage.

2. The initialization of the first row of the dp array can be optimized by setting the loop limit to W+1.

3. Use of standard library <bits/stdc++.h> is not recommended as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, slowing down the compile time. Instead, include only the necessary headers.

4. Variable declaration and initialization can be improved. For example, 'N' and 'W' can be initialized at the time of declaration. 

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N, W;
    cin >> N >> W;

    int value[N], weight[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];

    int dp[N+1][W+1] = {0};

    for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
        for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
            if (i==0 || w==0)
                dp[i][w] = 0;
            else if (w >= weight[i-1])
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w - weight[i-1]] + value[i-1], dp[i-1][w]);
            else
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w];
        }
    }
    cout << dp[N][W] << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that this optimized code block assumes that the compiler supports Variable Length Arrays (VLA). If your compiler doesn't support VLA, you will need to dynamically allocate the 'value', 'weight' and 'dp' arrays using new operator and don't forget to deallocate them using delete operator to avoid memory leaks. 

Also note that in C++, it's typically more efficient to use std::vector for dynamic arrays, as it automatically manages memory and has other convenient features. This is especially true in larger programs that have more complex memory management requirements. However, for this simple program, the efficiency difference would be negligible.
