Analysis:
The given code is a solution for the classical Knapsack problem. The time complexity of the current solution is O(N*W) where 'N' is the number of items and 'W' is the maximum capacity of the knapsack. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Using Static Arrays: The current code uses Variable Length Array (VLA) which is not a standard C++ feature and it can lead to stack overflow for large inputs. We will replace VLA with static arrays or vectors.

2. Reducing Memory Usage: The DP table 'dp' uses a 2D array. However, it seems that the computation of 'dp[i+1][w]' only depends on 'dp[i][w]' and 'dp[i][w-weight[i]]' meaning we only need to keep the current and previous row of the DP table. We can optimize this to use a 1D array instead, reducing memory usage from O(N*W) to O(W).

3. Loop Optimization: The inner loop can be optimized by starting from 'weight[i]' instead of '0' as we are only updating 'dp[w]' when 'w >= weight[i]'.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 110;
const int MAX_W = 10010;

int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> value(N), weight(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
    
  vector<int> dp(MAX_W, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int w = W; w >= weight[i]; w--) { // reverse order to avoid overwriting previous row's values
      dp[w] = max(dp[w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[w]);
    }
  }
  
  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation:
1. Static Arrays/Vectors: We replaced the VLAs with vectors which are dynamic and safer. They also provide several in-built functions which make them easier to work with. 
2. Memory Optimization: We only kept the current and previous row of the DP table by using a 1D array instead of 2D. This way, we effectively reduced the memory usage from O(N*W) to O(W).
3. Loop Optimization: By iterating the inner loop in reverse (from 'W' to 'weight[i]'), we avoid the need for an extra condition and also avoid overwriting values of the previous row which we would need later in the computation.

Trade-offs:
1. Memory vs Time: We reduced memory usage from O(N*W) to O(W) at the cost of not being able to trace back the items included in the knapsack. If we need to find which items are included, we would need the complete 2D DP table.
2. Code Complexity: The reverse iteration of the inner loop may be a little harder to understand for someone reading the code for the first time.
