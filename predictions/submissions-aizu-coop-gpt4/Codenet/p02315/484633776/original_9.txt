Analyzing the provided code, it is clear that it implements a common dynamic programming problem - the Knapsack problem. This problem is about maximizing the total value of items you can carry with a weight limit (W). Each item has a certain value and weight. 

Although the given code is a standard solution for this problem and works fine, it can still be optimized in the following ways:

1. Memory Usage: The dp array is declared with a size of 110 x 10010, which means it will be using more memory than necessary if N and W are less than these values. Instead, we can create the dp array dynamically based on the input values of N and W to save memory.

2. Input/Output operations: In C++, cin and cout are slower compared to scanf and printf. This can be optimized by using fast I/O operations.

3. Redundant operations: The current code is checking and updating dp[i+1][w] even when w < weight[i]. This is unnecessary and can be optimized by only starting the inner loop from weight[i].

4. Inefficient data structures: The current program uses raw arrays to store the weights and values of the items. Using vectors instead will allow the program to manage memory more efficiently.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the dp array with a dynamically allocated 2D vector.
2. Use fast I/O operations.
3. Start the inner loop from weight[i] to avoid redundant operations.
4. Replace the weight and value arrays with vectors.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;

  vector<int> value(N), weight(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];

  vector<vector<int>> dp(N+1, vector<int>(W+1, 0));
  
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int w = weight[i]; w <= W; w++) {
      dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
    }
    for (int w = 0; w < weight[i]; w++) {
      dp[i + 1][w] = dp[i][w];
    }
  }
  
  cout << dp[N][W] << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized version of the code improves memory usage by using vectors and also reduces the number of operations. The use of fast I/O operations improves the performance of the program when handling large inputs. The trade-off is a slight increase in code complexity due to the use of vectors. However, this is a reasonable trade-off considering the performance gain.
