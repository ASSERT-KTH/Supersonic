Code Analysis:

This is a dynamic programming solution for the 0/1 Knapsack problem. The code reads the number of items (N) and the maximum weight capacity (W). For each item, it reads the item's value and weight. The dp[i][w] table is used to store the maximum value that can be obtained by considering the first "i" items and a maximum weight of "w". 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The use of arrays for "value", "weight", and "dp" is efficient and appropriate for this problem.

2. Redundant Computations: There are no redundant computations in the provided code. 

3. Loops/Recursive Calls: The loops can be optimized using a more efficient iteration order. 

4. Compiler Optimizations: The use of "-O2" or "-O3" compiler optimization flags can yield significant speedups.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Loop Iteration Order: In the current code, we are iterating over the items in the outer loop, and weights in the inner loop. This can lead to a lot of cache misses because elements that are far apart in memory are accessed in quick succession. Instead, if we iterate over the weights in the outer loop, and items in the inner loop, we can reduce cache misses and improve the run-time performance.

2. Compiler Optimization Flags: The "-O2" and "-O3" compiler optimization flags provide a host of optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, dead-code elimination, etc. These optimizations can significantly improve the performance of the code.

3. Use of std::max: The code uses the std::max function to update the dp table. This function might have a bit of overhead. Instead, we can use simple if-else statements to update the dp table, which can result in a small performance improvement.

Trade-offs:

1. Loop Iteration Order: Changing the loop iteration order can make the code a bit harder to understand for those familiar with the traditional way of solving the 0/1 knapsack problem. However, the performance improvement is worth the slight increase in complexity.

2. Compiler Optimization Flags: The use of optimization flags can lead to longer compile times. However, this is a one-time cost, and the improved run-time performance far outweighs this cost.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N, W;
    cin >> N >> W;
    int value[N], weight[N];
  
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  
    int dp[110][10010] = {};
  
    for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (w >= weight[i]) {
                int newValue = dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i];
                dp[i + 1][w] = (newValue > dp[i][w]) ? newValue : dp[i][w];
            } else {
                dp[i + 1][w] = dp[i][w];
            }
        }
    }

    cout << dp[N][W] << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Remember to compile this code with "-O2" or "-O3" flag for better performance.
