Code Analysis:
This program is implementing a classic dynamic programming problem - the Knapsack problem. It may be optimized for better performance in terms of time and memory.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: Here, we are storing the entire dp table even though we only require the last row to compute the current row. We can optimize this by only storing the previous and current rows.

2. Redundant Computations: The loop for initializing the dp table is not necessary. We can initialize it while computing the dp values.

3. Recursive Calls and Loops: The loops are necessary for dynamic programming. However, we can optimize the inner loop by starting from 'weight[i]' instead of 0 as all entries before 'weight[i]' will remain the same.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(nullptr);` to speed up the I/O operations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Since we only need the last row to compute the current row, we can optimize the space usage by only storing the previous and current rows. This reduces the space complexity from O(N*W) to O(W).

2. We are initializing the dp table to 0 in a separate loop. We can eliminate this loop by initializing the dp values to 0 while computing them.

3. In the inner loop, all entries before 'weight[i]' remain the same. So, we can start the inner loop from 'weight[i]' instead of 0. This reduces the number of iterations in the inner loop.

4. By using `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(nullptr);`, we make the I/O operations faster which reduces the total execution time.

Trade-offs: 

The optimization increases the performance of the code, but it makes the code harder to understand for beginners. The dynamic programming table is no longer fully available, which can make debugging and understanding the code more difficult.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);

  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> value(N), weight(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  
  vector<vector<int>> dp(2, vector<int>(W + 1, 0));
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int w = weight[i]; w <= W; w++) {
      dp[(i + 1) % 2][w] = max(dp[i % 2][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i % 2][w]);
    }
    // Copy the remaining values from the previous row
    if(i < N-1)
      copy(dp[i % 2].begin() + weight[i+1], dp[i % 2].end(), dp[(i+1) % 2].begin() + weight[i+1]);
  }
  cout << dp[N % 2][W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code performs the same functionality as the original code but with improved time and space efficiency.
