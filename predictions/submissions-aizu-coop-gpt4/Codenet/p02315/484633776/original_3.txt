Code Analysis:

This program implements the classic 0/1 Knapsack Problem using dynamic programming. It reads the total number of items (N) and maximum weight (W), then reads pairs of values and weights for each item. It initializes a two-dimensional array (dp) to store the maximum value that can be obtained for every possible total weight. However, the implementation has some performance issues:

1. Using "bits/stdc++.h" is not recommended as it includes many unnecessary C++ libraries. This could increase the compilation time for the code.
2. The code uses a variable length array to store the values and weights of the items, which is not standard in C++. While some compilers allow this, it is generally frowned upon.
3. The dp array is larger than necessary. Its size is fixed at 110 x 10010 regardless of the input. This wastes memory when the input size is small, and could potentially crash the program if the input size exceeds these dimensions.
4. The dp array is not initialized properly. The code only initializes the first row to 0, but it should initialize the whole array.
5. The inner loop in the main dp calculation iterates from 0 to W, which is not efficient. It should iterate from weight[i] to W, as the other cases are already handled by the else clause.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace "bits/stdc++.h" with only the necessary libraries.
2. Use the vector data structure to replace the variable length arrays.
3. Resize the dp array to match the input size.
4. Initialize the entire dp array to 0.
5. Optimize the inner loop in the main dp calculation to iterate from weight[i] to W.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  
  vector<int> value(N), weight(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
    
  vector<vector<int>> dp(N+1, vector<int>(W+1, 0));
  
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int w = weight[i]; w <= W; w++) {
      dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
    }
    // copy the rest of the dp values from the previous row
    for (int w = 0; w < weight[i]; w++) {
      dp[i + 1][w] = dp[i][w];
    }
  }
  
  cout << dp[N][W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should be more memory-efficient and faster. It's important to note that although this code is more efficient, it's slightly more complicated due to the use of the vector data structure and additional initialization. However, the trade-off in memory usage and speed is significant and worth the added complexity.
