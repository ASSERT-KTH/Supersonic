This program is a standard implementation of the knapsack problem. It uses dynamic programming to find the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting items of different weights and values subject to a total weight constraint. 

The current implementation is already quite efficient. However, there are some possible optimizations that can be made:

1. **Code Analysis:**
    1. **Inefficient data structure:** The 'dp' array is larger than necessary. As the algorithm only uses the current and previous row of the 'dp' array, we could reduce its size to just two rows.
    2. **Redundant computations:** There is no redundant computation observed in the code.
    3. **Loops:** The double loop in this program is necessary, as it iterates over every possible weight for each item. This cannot be avoided or optimized further.
    4. **Compiler optimizations:** Compiler optimizations can be used to improve the performance of the program. The '-O2' or '-O3' optimization flags could be used when compiling the program to enable these optimizations.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**
    1. **Data structure optimization:** Reduce the size of the 'dp' array to just two rows.
    3. **Compiler optimization:** Use the '-O2' or '-O3' optimization flags when compiling the program.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
    1. **Data structure optimization:** The 'dp' array in the current implementation has 'N' rows, but only the last two rows are ever used at any point in the computation. This is because the 'dp' value for a particular item only depends on the 'dp' values for the previous item. By reducing the 'dp' array to just two rows, we can save a significant amount of memory. The tradeoff here is that the code becomes slightly more complex, as we have to keep track of which row is the current and which is the previous.
    2. **Compiler optimization:** The '-O2' or '-O3' optimization flags can be used when compiling the program. These flags enable various optimization features in the compiler, such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and instruction scheduling, which can significantly improve the performance of the program. The tradeoff here is that it may make the program harder to debug, as the optimized code can behave differently than the non-optimized code.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  int value[N], weight[N];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  // Optimized dp array to use only 2 rows
  int dp[2][10010];
  for (int i = 0; i <= W; i++)
    dp[0][i] = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
      // Use modulo operation to alternate between 0 and 1 for current and previous row
      if (w >= weight[i])
        dp[(i + 1) % 2][w] = max(dp[i % 2][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i % 2][w]);
      else
        dp[(i + 1) % 2][w] = dp[i % 2][w];
    }
  }
  // Output result from the last computed row
  cout << dp[N % 2][W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
To compile the optimized code with compiler optimization, use the following command:
```
g++ -O2 -o knapsack knapsack.cpp
```
or
```
g++ -O3 -o knapsack knapsack.cpp
```
