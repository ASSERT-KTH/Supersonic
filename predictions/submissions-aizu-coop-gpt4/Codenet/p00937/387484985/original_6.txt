The provided C++ program is a graph-based problem with a dynamic programming (DP) approach. It first reads a graph from the input, then constructs a 3D DP table where `dp[i][j][k]` is a boolean value that indicates if it's possible to get from node `j` to node `k` in `i` steps. Then, it iteratively tries to find nodes that can be reached using the given array `A` and marks them as "used". Finally, it outputs if it's possible to reach the starting node.

Here are some areas we can optimize:

1. **Redundant computations in DP table construction**: The inner loop `for (int to : G[k])` iterates over the list of adjacent nodes for each node `k` for each `i` from 1 to 100, which results in redundant computations. We can replace this with a more efficient approach using matrix multiplication.

2. **Inefficient use of `used` array**: The `used` array is iterated over in each iteration to find unused nodes, and then again to mark nodes as used. We can use a `queue` data structure to keep track of unused nodes to avoid unnecessary iterations.

3. **Inefficient use of `idx` vector**: The `idx` vector is used to keep track of nodes to be marked as used in the current iteration. We can eliminate this by marking nodes as used immediately when they are discovered.

4. **Inefficient I/O operations**: Using `cin` and `cout` for I/O operations in C++ can be slow. We can improve I/O performance by using `scanf` and `printf` instead, and by disabling synchronization with C's standard streams.

Now let's implement these optimizations:

1. **Replace inner DP loop with matrix multiplication**: This avoids the need for the inner loop `for (int to : G[k])` in the DP table construction. We construct an adjacency matrix for the graph and then raise this matrix to the power `i` for each `i` from 1 to 100. This gives us the same information as the DP table, but avoids redundant computations.

2. **Use a queue to keep track of unused nodes**: Instead of iterating over the `used` array in each iteration, we maintain a `queue` of unused nodes. In each iteration, we remove nodes from the `queue` and mark them as used if they can be reached in the current iteration.

3. **Mark nodes as used immediately**: Instead of storing nodes to be marked as used in the `idx` vector and then marking them as used later, we mark nodes as used immediately when they are discovered. This eliminates the need for the `idx` vector.

4. **Use faster I/O methods and disable synchronization with C's standard streams**: This improves I/O performance.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define fast_io ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL)
using namespace std;
int N, M;
int A[3];
vector<vector<int>> adjMatrix;
bool used[51];
queue<int> unusedNodes;
int main() {
  fast_io;
  scanf("%d %d", &N, &M);
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    scanf("%d", &A[i]);
  adjMatrix.assign(N, vector<int>(N, 0));
  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    int f, t;
    scanf("%d %d", &f, &t);
    f--;
    t--;
    adjMatrix[f][t] = 1;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    adjMatrix[i][i] = 1;
    unusedNodes.push(i);
  }
  vector<vector<int>> dp(101, vector<int>(N, 0));
  dp[0] = adjMatrix;
  for (int i = 1; i < 101; i++) {
    dp[i] = matrixMultiplication(dp[i - 1], adjMatrix);
  }
  used[N - 1] = true;
  for (int ite = 1;; ite++) {
    bool ok = false;
    int size = unusedNodes.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      int node = unusedNodes.front();
      unusedNodes.pop();
      if (used[node])
        continue;
      int cnt = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        int a = A[j];
        for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
          if (dp[a][node][k] && used[k]) {
            cnt++;
            break;
          }
        }
      }
      if (cnt == 3) {
        ok = true;
        used[node] = true;
        if (node == 0) {
          printf("%d\n", ite);
          return 0;
        }
      } else {
        unusedNodes.push(node);
      }
    }
    if (!ok)
      break;
  }
  printf("IMPOSSIBLE\n");
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The function `matrixMultiplication` is a standard function to multiply two matrices, which is not shown here. It is assumed to be available in the context of this code.
