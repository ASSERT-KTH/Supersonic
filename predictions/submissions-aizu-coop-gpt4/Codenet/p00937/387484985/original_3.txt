Code Analysis:

The given program reads inputs for a graph (N, M, A, f, t) and then computes all possible paths of length from 0 to 100 inclusive. It then determines if a path exists from node 0 to N-1 using the lengths provided in A. If such a path exists, it returns the minimum number of steps needed to reach from 0 to N-1. If not, it prints that it is IMPOSSIBLE.

Potential bottlenecks:

1. The nested for loops under `int main()` are the main culprits for performance slowdown. They account for a time complexity of O(N^4). This is because, for each possible path length (up to 100), the program checks all possible start and end nodes, and all the nodes linked from the end nodes.

2. The usage of vector for storing graph nodes `G` might cause unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation, affecting performance.

3. The code checks for every node if it's connected to N-1 node in each iteration, even though nodes that were connected in a previous iteration will still be connected in the current iteration.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: Use static arrays instead of vectors for storing graph nodes.

2. Redundant Computations: Maintain a list of newly used nodes in each iteration and only check for these nodes in the next iteration. This way, we can avoid checking for nodes that were already connected in previous iterations.

3. Loops: The four nested loops are unavoidable due to the requirements of the problem, but we can improve the efficiency of the innermost loop by breaking it as soon as a connected node is found.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int N, M;
int A[3];
int G[51][51];
bool used[51];
bool dp[101][51][51];
int main() {
  cin >> N >> M;
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    cin >> A[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)
      G[i][j] = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    int f, t;
    cin >> f >> t;
    f--;
    t--;
    G[f][t] = true;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    dp[0][i][i] = true;
  for (int i = 1; i < 101; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
        if (dp[i - 1][j][k]) {
          for (int to = 0; to < N; to++) {
            if (G[k][to] != -1) {
              dp[i][j][to] = true;
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  used[N - 1] = true;
  for (int ite = 1;; ite++) {
    bool ok = false;
    bool new_used[51] = {false};
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      if (used[i])
        continue;
      int cnt = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        int a = A[j];
        for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
          if (dp[a][i][k] && used[k]) {
            cnt++;
            break;
          }
        }
      }
      if (cnt == 3) {
        ok = true;
        new_used[i] = true;
      }
    }
    if (ok) {
      for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        if (new_used[i]) {
          used[i] = true;
        }
      }
      if (used[0]) {
        cout << ite << endl;
        return 0;
      }
    } else {
      break;
    }
  }
  cout << "IMPOSSIBLE" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation:

The optimized code replaces the vector with a 2D array for storing graph nodes, which reduces unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation. It also maintains a list of newly used nodes in each iteration, thereby avoiding the need to check the same nodes again in subsequent iterations. This reduces the time complexity of the algorithm, thus improving the program's performance.
