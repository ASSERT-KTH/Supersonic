After analyzing the code, I can see some potential areas for optimization:

1. The code uses dynamic programming (dp) for the problem. However, the dp table size is fixed at 101 x 51 x 51. This can be very memory intensive especially when N (which dictates the last two dimensions' size) is large. We can reduce the memory usage by using a 3D dynamic array where the dimensions are decided by N and A[i].

2. The nested loop going over N^2*101 elements for dp table filling can be a major bottleneck when N is large. 

3. The code uses a vector of vectors to store the graph (G). This is not optimal in terms of memory usage and access time. An adjacency list representation would be more efficient.

4. The code uses a vector to store the indices of nodes to be marked as used (idx). It would be more efficient to mark the nodes as used directly in the loop, reducing the need for this vector.

Here's the optimization strategy:

1. Replace the fixed-size 3D dp array with a dynamically allocated one. Its size will be A[0] x A[1] x A[2] x N x N, which will be less than 101 x 51 x 51 for most inputs.

2. Replace the vector of vectors (G) with an array of vectors to represent the graph. This is more memory efficient and provides faster access times.

3. Refactor the loop that fills the dp table. Instead of iterating over all possible values of i, j, and k, we can iterate only over the graph's edges.

4. Mark nodes as used directly in the loop, eliminating the need for the idx vector. 

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int N, M;
int A[3];
vector<int> G[51];
bool used[51];
bool ****dp;

int main() {
  cin >> N >> M;
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    cin >> A[i];

  // Allocate memory for dp array
  dp = new bool***[A[0] + 1];
  for (int i = 0; i <= A[0]; i++) {
    dp[i] = new bool**[A[1] + 1];
    for (int j = 0; j <= A[1]; j++) {
      dp[i][j] = new bool*[A[2] + 1];
      for (int k = 0; k <= A[2]; k++) {
        dp[i][j][k] = new bool[N];
        for (int l = 0; l < N; l++) {
          dp[i][j][k][l] = false;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    int f, t;
    cin >> f >> t;
    f--;
    t--;
    G[f].push_back(t);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    dp[0][0][0][i] = true;

  for (int a = 0; a <= A[0]; a++)
    for (int b = 0; b <= A[1]; b++)
      for (int c = 0; c <= A[2]; c++)
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
          if (a > 0 && dp[a - 1][b][c][j])
            for (int to : G[j])
              dp[a][b][c][to] = true;
          if (b > 0 && dp[a][b - 1][c][j])
            for (int to : G[j])
              dp[a][b][c][to] = true;
          if (c > 0 && dp[a][b][c - 1][j])
            for (int to : G[j])
              dp[a][b][c][to] = true;
        }

  used[N - 1] = true;
  for (int ite = 1;; ite++) {
    bool ok = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      if (used[i])
        continue;
      int cnt = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        int a = A[j];
        for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
          if (dp[a][a][a][k] && used[k]) {
            cnt++;
            break;
          }
        }
      }
      if (cnt == 3) {
        ok = true;
        used[i] = true;
        if (used[0]) {
          cout << ite << endl;
          return 0;
        }
      }
    }
    if (!ok) break;
  }

  cout << "IMPOSSIBLE" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this optimization strategy assumes that A[0], A[1], and A[2] are less than or equal to 101. If they can be greater, the dynamic allocation of the dp array must be adjusted accordingly.
