## Code Analysis

The provided code seems to be solving a graph problem using dynamic programming (DP). The main performance bottlenecks in the code include:

1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The code uses a 3D boolean DP table `dp[101][51][51]`, which can be quite memory-intensive. In addition, the adjacency list `G[51]` could potentially be optimized.

2. **Redundant Computation:** The code has multiple nested loops, which increase the time complexity. For instance, in the second loop block, the code iterates over all nodes for every DP state, leading to redundant computation.

3. **Lack of Compiler Optimizations:** The code does not use any compiler optimizations or pragma directives to improve performance.

## Optimization Strategy

1. **Efficient Data Structures:** Instead of using a 3D boolean DP table, we can use a 2D DP table along with a bitset for each node to represent its connectivity with other nodes. This will significantly reduce the memory usage. 

2. **Avoid Redundant Computation:** We can reduce the time complexity by avoiding unnecessary computations. For instance, we can compute the DP transitions only for the nodes that are reachable from the current node, instead of all nodes.

3. **Compiler Optimizations:** We can use compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to instruct the compiler to optimize the code. Additionally, we can use `#pragma` directives to parallelize the loops where possible.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Efficient Data Structures:** Instead of using a 3D boolean DP table `dp[101][51][51]`, we can use a 2D DP table `dp[101][51]` along with a bitset for each node `bs[51]` to represent its connectivity with other nodes. The bitset `bs[i]` for a node `i` will have its `j-th` bit set if there is a path from `i` to `j`. This will reduce the space complexity from `O(N^3)` to `O(N^2)`. 

2. **Avoid Redundant Computation:** We can compute the DP transitions only for the nodes that are reachable from the current node. For instance, in the DP transition `dp[i][j][to] = true`, we can iterate only over the nodes `to` that are reachable from the current node `k` (i.e., `to` is in `G[k]`), instead of all nodes. This will reduce the time complexity from `O(N^3)` to `O(MN)`, where `M` is the number of edges in the graph.

3. **Compiler Optimizations:** We can use the `-O2` or `-O3` compiler optimization flag to improve the performance. These flags enable various optimization techniques like loop unrolling and constant propagation. Additionally, we can use `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to parallelize the outer loop in the DP computation, which can speed up the computation if multiple CPU cores are available.

## Optimized Code Block

Please replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the specific libraries being used in the code, as `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is not standard C++ and may not be supported by all compilers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 51;
const int MAXM = 101;

int N, M;
int A[3];
vector<int> G[MAXN];
bool used[MAXN];
bitset<MAXN> dp[MAXM][MAXN];

int main() {
  cin >> N >> M;
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    cin >> A[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    int f, t;
    cin >> f >> t;
    f--;
    t--;
    G[f].push_back(t);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    dp[0][i][i] = true;
  for (int i = 1; i < MAXM; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
      dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
      for (int k = 0; k < G[j].size(); k++) {
        dp[i][j] |= dp[i - 1][G[j][k]];
      }
    }
  }
  used[N - 1] = true;
  for (int ite = 1;; ite++) {
    bool ok = false;
    vector<int> idx;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      if (used[i])
        continue;
      int cnt = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        int a = A[j];
        if ((dp[a][i] & used).any()) {
          cnt++;
          break;
        }
      }
      if (cnt == 3) {
        ok = true;
        idx.push_back(i);
      }
    }
    if (ok) {
      for (int i : idx) {
        used[i] = true;
      }
      if (used[0]) {
        cout << ite << endl;
        return 0;
      }
    } else {
      break;
    }
  }
  cout << "IMPOSSIBLE" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should have the same functionality as the original code, but with improved performance and reduced memory usage.
