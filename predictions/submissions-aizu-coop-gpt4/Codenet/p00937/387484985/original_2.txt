### Code Analysis
The code seems to be a graph traversal problem where the nodes are interconnected in a particular order. There are three key points to note in the code:

1. The graph is represented as an adjacency list using a vector of vectors `G`.
2. The `dp` array is used to store the boolean results of whether node `j` can reach node `to` in `i` steps.
3. The `used` array keeps track of visited nodes.

### Optimization Strategy
1. **Input/Output Optimization**: Here `cin` and `cout` are used for input and output. We can use faster input-output methods to optimize the code.
2. **Data Structures**: The `vector` data structure is used here. The use of `vector` is fine for this situation. However, we can use an array for the 'used' variable instead of a vector since the size is known beforehand.
3. **Memory Usage**: The 3D `dp` array is initialized with a size of 101x51x51. We could potentially reduce this size by observing the maximum number of steps needed to reach a node.
4. **Algorithmic Optimization**: The inner loop traverses all the graph nodes for each step. We can optimize this by only considering the nodes that have been marked 'true' in the `dp` array in the previous step.

### Explanation
1. **Input/Output Optimization**: The `scanf` and `printf` functions can be faster than `cin` and `cout` for reading and writing data. This is because `cin` and `cout` have some overhead due to synchronization with C's standard streams. Additionally, we can use `\n` instead of `endl` as `endl` causes a flush operation, which can be a costly operation and can slow down the program.
2. **Data Structures**: Since the size of 'used' is known beforehand, we can use an array instead of a vector. This could slightly improve the memory usage and access times.
3. **Memory Usage**: The maximum number of steps needed to reach a node could be much less than 101. We need to analyze the problem constraints to determine the appropriate size for the `dp` array.
4. **Algorithmic Optimization**: Instead of iterating through all nodes in the graph for each step, we could maintain a list of 'active' nodes - nodes that have been marked 'true' in the `dp` array in the previous step. Then, we only need to consider these nodes in the next step.

### Optimized Code
Here's the optimized version of the given code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int N, M;
int A[3];
vector<int> G[51];
bool used[51];
bool dp[101][51][51];

int main() {
  scanf("%d %d", &N, &M);
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    scanf("%d", &A[i]);
  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    int f, t;
    scanf("%d %d", &f, &t);
    f--;
    t--;
    G[f].push_back(t);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    dp[0][i][i] = true;
  vector<int> activeNodes;
  for (int i = 1; i < 101; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < activeNodes.size(); j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
        if (dp[i - 1][j][k]) {
          for (int to : G[k]) {
            if (!dp[i][j][to]) {
              dp[i][j][to] = true;
              activeNodes.push_back(to);
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  used[N - 1] = true;
  for (int ite = 1;; ite++) {
    bool ok = false;
    vector<int> idx;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      if (used[i])
        continue;
      int cnt = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        int a = A[j];
        for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
          if (dp[a][i][k] && used[k]) {
            cnt++;
            break;
          }
        }
      }
      if (cnt == 3) {
        ok = true;
        idx.push_back(i);
      }
    }
    if (ok) {
      for (int i : idx) {
        used[i] = true;
      }
      if (used[0]) {
        printf("%d\n", ite);
        return 0;
      }
    } else {
      break;
    }
  }
  printf("IMPOSSIBLE\n");
  return 0;
}
```

### Trade-offs
While the optimized code is likely to be faster and use less memory, it may be a bit more complex due to the use of the `activeNodes` list. Furthermore, the maximum size of the `dp` array is still hard-coded, which may not be optimal if the problem constraints change.
