The provided code reads an array of integers and then finds the maximum difference between any two elements in the array, where the smaller element precedes the larger one in the order of appearance. The algorithm used is quite efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), but there are some areas where we can optimize it further.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Efficient I/O operations: The cin and cout operations in C++ are considerably slower than scanf and printf operations in C. Using these C functions for I/O operations could speed up the runtime.

2. Use of static keyword: The static keyword for the array initialization is not needed as the variable R is local to the main function. This will not affect the performance, but it is good to clean it up.

3. Avoid multiple calls to min and max functions: Each call to these functions involves a comparison operation, which could be saved by using simple if-else conditions.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Efficient I/O operations: The C++ I/O operations like cin and cout are slower due to their synchronization with C's standard streams. To improve I/O operation speed, we replace them with the scanf and printf functions from C.

2. Use of static keyword: The static keyword is used to retain the value of a local variable between different function calls. Here, it's not required since we're not calling the main function multiple times. Removing it will not directly impact performance, but it's good practice to remove unnecessary keywords for cleaner code.

3. Avoid multiple calls to min and max functions: By replacing the min and max functions with simple if-else conditions, we avoid the overhead of function calls and comparisons.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#define MAX 200000

int main() {
  int R[MAX], n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &R[i]);
  int maxv = R[1] - R[0];
  int minv = R[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (R[i] - minv > maxv)
      maxv = R[i] - minv;
    if (R[i] < minv)
      minv = R[i];
  }
  printf("%d\n", maxv);
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code should provide the same output as the original code, but with a slight performance improvement due to the faster I/O operations and the removal of unnecessary function calls.
