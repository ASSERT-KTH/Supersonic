The given C++ program is designed to find the maximum difference value in an array of integers. Overall, the code is generally well-optimized and does not contain many inefficiencies. However, there are a couple of improvements that can be made:

1. Avoid extensive use of std::min and std::max functions: These functions are often slower than simple if statements due to the overhead of function calls. In this case, we could replace them with simple if-else statements to improve efficiency.

2. Memory pre-allocation: While the memory for the array `R` is pre-allocated with a maximum size of `MAX = 200000`, it's not efficient if `n` is much smaller than `MAX` as it leads to memory waste. Instead, we could dynamically allocate the memory based on the input `n`.

3. Use faster input/output methods: The cin and cout functions are slower than scanf and printf functions. Replacing them could slightly improve the performance of the program.

Here is the optimized code following the above steps:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX 200000

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int *R = new int[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &R[i]);
  int maxv = R[1] - R[0];
  int minv = R[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (R[i] - minv > maxv)
      maxv = R[i] - minv;
    if (R[i] < minv)
      minv = R[i];
  }
  printf("%d\n", maxv);
  delete[] R;
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version, we've replaced the cin and cout operations with scanf and printf for faster I/O, changed the std::min and std::max functions to simple if-else operations for better efficiency, and used dynamic memory allocation for the array `R` to avoid memory waste.
