The given C++ program appears to be pretty optimized for the most part. However, there are some minor improvements that can be made. Below are my observations and action plan for optimization.

1. **Code Analysis**

    The code reads an array of integers, calculates the maximum difference between any two elements such that the larger number appears after the smaller number in the array, and then prints this maximum difference. 

    The only potential performance bottleneck is reading the array from standard input. Since the size of the array can be up to 200,000, reading it one element at a time can be time-consuming due to the overhead of I/O operations.

2. **Optimization Strategy**
    
    The main optimization here will be in how we read the array. Instead of reading one integer at a time, we can read an entire line of integers at once, which will significantly reduce the number of I/O operations. 

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**

    We will use the `getline` function to read an entire line from standard input, and then use a `stringstream` to extract the integers from the line. This will reduce the number of I/O operations, which should result in a significant performance boost.

    The trade-off here is that this method uses more memory because it has to store the entire line of integers in a string before extracting them. However, this is unlikely to be a problem unless the number of integers in the line is very large.

4. **Optimized Code Block**

    Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

static const int MAX = 200000;

int main() {
    int R[MAX], n;
    cin >> n;
    cin.ignore();  // ignore newline character

    string line;
    getline(cin, line);
    stringstream ss(line);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        ss >> R[i];

    int maxv = R[1] - R[0];
    int minv = R[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        maxv = max(maxv, R[i] - minv);
        minv = min(minv, R[i]);
    }

    cout << maxv << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, the array is read from standard input in a single line, which reduces the number of I/O operations compared to the original code. This should result in a significant performance boost, especially when the array size is large.
