This code finds the maximum difference in an array of integers, where the smaller integer appears before the larger one in the array. The code is already quite efficient with a time complexity of O(n). However, some minor improvements can be made:

1. **Code Analysis:**
   The main loops in this code have a linear time complexity, which is quite efficient. The variables maxv and minv are used to keep track of the maximum difference and the minimum value found so far, respectively. These variables are updated in every iteration, and the maximum difference is printed out at the end. 

2. **Optimization Strategy:**
   1. **Avoid using standard library functions in performance-critical sections:** The code uses the `max` and `min` functions from the standard library. While these functions are convenient, they can be slower than simple comparisons in some cases, especially when used inside a loop.
   2. **Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`:** These lines can help speed up input/output operations in C++. The first line makes C++ input/output streams independent from the C streams, and the second line unties `cin` from `cout`, which can speed up `cin` operations.
   3. **Use buffered input/output for large amounts of data:** If the program needs to handle large amounts of input/output, it can be beneficial to use a buffer. This can be achieved by reading the data into a `string` or `char` array before processing it.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
   1. **Avoid using standard library functions in performance-critical sections:** Instead of using `max` and `min`, we can use simple comparison statements. This reduces function call overhead and could speed up the loop.
   2. **Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`:** These lines are added before the input operations to speed up `cin` operations.
   3. **Use buffered input/output for large amounts of data:** However, in this case, since we are not dealing with a large amount of data, we are not using the buffer.

Here is the optimized code block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

static const int MAX = 200000;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
  
    int R[MAX], n;
    cin >> n;
  
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> R[i];
  
    int maxv = R[1] - R[0];
    int minv = R[0];
  
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int diff = R[i] - minv;
        if (diff > maxv)
            maxv = diff;
        if (R[i] < minv)
            minv = R[i];
    }
  
    cout << maxv << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
The changes in this optimized code include the addition of `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up input/output operations, and the replacement of `max` and `min` functions with direct comparisons. These changes can potentially improve the performance of the code, especially when dealing with larger data inputs.
