The given code is already very efficient from a time complexity perspective, with a linear time complexity of O(n). However, there are some potential improvements that can be made in terms of memory usage:

1. **Optimization Strategy**:
    1. The variable `R[MAX]` is declared with a constant size of 200000. This is inefficient when `n` is significantly less than 200000. We can save memory by dynamically allocating this array based on the value of `n`. 
    2. The use of `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input and output can be slow in certain cases. We can use faster I/O methods to improve the speed of the program.
    3. We can remove the `using namespace std;` declaration and prefix the standard library functions with `std::`. This will avoid potential naming conflicts and make the code more clear.

2. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    1. Dynamically allocating array `R[]`: Instead of declaring `R[MAX]` with a fixed size, we can declare an integer pointer `R` and then allocate memory dynamically using `new` after reading the value of `n`. This saves memory by only allocating as much as needed based on the input size.
    2. Faster I/O: We can use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` to disable the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams. This can potentially speed up input and output operations.
    3. Remove `using namespace std;`: This is not a performance optimization but a good practice in C++. It can prevent naming conflicts and make the code more clear.

3. **Optimized Code Block**:

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

#define MAX 200000

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  int* R = new int[n];  // dynamically allocated array
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> R[i];
    
  int maxv = R[1] - R[0];
  int minv = R[0];
  
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    maxv = std::max(maxv, R[i] - minv);
    minv = std::min(minv, R[i]);
  }
  
  std::cout << maxv << std::endl;
  
  delete[] R;  // delete the dynamically allocated array
  
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs: The optimized code is slightly more complex due to the dynamic memory allocation and delete operation, which requires careful management to avoid memory leaks. However, it significantly improves the memory usage efficiency of the program.
