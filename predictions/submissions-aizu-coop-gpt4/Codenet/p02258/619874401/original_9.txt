# Code Analysis:

The given code is for finding the maximum profit that could be obtained by buying and selling a single stock. The code provides an implementation of the dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. The approach is to keep track of the minimum stock price seen so far and the maximum profit obtained so far. 

Potential performance bottlenecks or areas of inefficiency are:

1. The code uses static allocation for the array which is not efficient for memory usage, especially when the size of the stock prices array (n) is much smaller than the MAX value. 

2. The input/output (I/O) operations are not optimized which could slow down the program significantly when dealing with large inputs.

# Optimization Strategy:

1. Use dynamic allocation for the array to minimize memory usage.

2. Use Fast I/O operations to speed up the input/output process.

# Step-By-Step Explanation:

1. Dynamically Allocating Array: In the original code, the array is statically allocated with a size of MAX which might lead to wastage of memory when 'n' is much smaller than MAX. Allocating the array dynamically based on the size 'n' will save memory.

2. Fast Input/Output: The cin and cout operations are slower. Using faster alternatives like scanf/printf or ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) can speed up the process. 

# Trade-offs:
The trade-off here is that the code might become a bit less readable especially for beginners. For instance, the use of scanf/printf instead of cin/cout might be less familiar to some programmers. However, the performance gain is usually worth it for large inputs.

# Optimized Code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
    cin.tie(NULL);
    
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int* R = new int[n];

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> R[i];

    int maxv = R[1] - R[0];
    int minv = R[0];

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        maxv = max(maxv, R[i] - minv);
        minv = min(minv, R[i]);
    }

    cout << maxv << "\n";

    delete[] R;
    return 0;
}
```

# Explanation of Optimized Code:

1. The 'ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);' and 'cin.tie(NULL);' lines make the input/output operations faster.

2. Instead of statically allocating an array of size MAX, we dynamically allocate an array of size 'n' using 'new' keyword, which saves memory.

3. After we're done with the array, we deallocate it using 'delete[]', to prevent memory leaks.
