The given code reads a set of integers from standard input and calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling a single item. For each element, it checks if the difference between the current element and the minimum element seen so far is greater than the current maximum profit. If so, it updates the maximum profit. It also updates the minimum element if the current element is smaller than the minimum seen so far.

The main performance bottleneck here is the unnecessary use of an iterator for vector traversal. Modern C++ compilers can optimize traditional indexed loops very well, sometimes even better than iterators, especially for standard containers like vectors. 

So, let's look at our optimization strategy:

1. Instead of using iterators, we will use traditional indexed loops.

2. We can combine the two separate loops into a single loop. In the existing code, one loop is used to read the data and another loop is used to calculate the max profit. We can combine these into a single loop to avoid iterating over the data twice.

3. The vectors `R`, `itr` and `itrE` are not necessary, we can just use a single integer variable to store the current element. This will significantly reduce memory usage.

4. Compiler optimization: We can hint the compiler to optimize the loop by using `#pragma omp parallel for` if OpenMP is available. However, in this case, it may not provide significant benefit because the loop has dependencies - each iteration depends on the result of the previous one. Thus, it's not suitable for parallelization.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    int maxProfit = INT_MIN;
    int minPrice = INT_MAX;
    int currentPrice;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> currentPrice;
        if (currentPrice - minPrice > maxProfit)
            maxProfit = currentPrice - minPrice;
        if (currentPrice < minPrice)
            minPrice = currentPrice;
    }

    cout << maxProfit << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, I have removed the vectors and used a single integer `currentPrice` to read the input data. I have also combined the two loops into one. This reduces memory usage and improves performance by avoiding unnecessary iterations over the data. The functionality of the original code is preserved, and the output remains the same.
