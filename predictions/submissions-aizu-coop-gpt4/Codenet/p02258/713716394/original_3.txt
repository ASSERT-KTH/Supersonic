1. Code Analysis:

The provided code is a simple C++ program that reads an integer `n` as the size of a vector `R` from the standard input. It then reads `n` integers into the vector `R`. The program then calculates the maximum difference between any number and its preceding number in the vector. It prints out this maximum difference (or profit).

Potential performance issues include:
- The use of iterator-based for loops where the end of the vector is calculated in every loop iteration, which can be expensive.
- The use of two loops where the first one is used to read the inputs and the second one is used for the maximum difference calculation. These two operations can be performed in one loop.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Replace iterator-based loops with index-based loops. This can allow the compiler to perform loop optimization techniques that are not possible with iterators.
    2. Combine the input reading and maximum difference calculation in one loop to reduce the total number of loop iterations.
    3. Utilize `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` to turn off synchronization with the C standard libraries. This can make I/O operations faster.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Replacing iterator-based loops with index-based loops: Iterator-based loops are less likely to be optimized by the compiler due to potential aliasing issues. Index-based loops can allow the compiler to perform loop unrolling and other optimizations.
    2. Combining the input reading and maximum difference calculation: By combining these two operations, the total number of loop iterations can be reduced from 2n to n. This can significantly improve the performance when the input size is large.
    3. Turning off synchronization with C standard libraries: By default, C++ standard libraries synchronize with C standard libraries for compatibility reasons. This synchronization can slow down I/O operations. By turning it off, we can make I/O operations faster.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // Turn off synchronization with C standard libraries
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int maxProfit = INT_MIN;
  int Ri = INT_MAX;
  int temp;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> temp;
    if (i != 0) {
      if (maxProfit < temp - Ri) {
        maxProfit = temp - Ri;
      }
    }
    if (temp < Ri) {
      Ri = temp;
    }
  }
  cout << maxProfit << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, the vector `R` is no longer needed, which reduces memory usage. The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` line speeds up I/O operations. The maximum profit calculation is done during the input reading loop, reducing the total number of loops from 2 to 1.
