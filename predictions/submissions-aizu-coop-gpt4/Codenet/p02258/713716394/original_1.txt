Code Analysis:

- The code finds the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling stocks. The price of the stock for each day is stored in the vector R.
- The maximum profit is calculated by iterating over each day's stock price and finding the difference between that day's price and the minimum price encountered so far (stored in Ri). If that difference is greater than the previously stored maximum profit, then the maximum profit is updated.

Optimization Strategy:

1. The first loop is used to read input into the vector. This operation is necessary and cannot be optimized further.
2. The second loop calculates the maximum profit. Although the logic is already efficient, the usage of iterators can be optimized. Accessing the elements of the vector by indices instead of iterators can improve cache locality and thus speed up execution.
3. Compiler optimizations: The compiler can often optimize the code better than the developer. Enabling optimization flags like -O2 or -O3 during compilation can lead to significant speed-ups. For instance, in this code, the compiler could potentially optimize the second for loop by using the loop unrolling technique. 

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. The first step is to replace vector iterators with indices while accessing the elements of the vector. C++'s random-access iterators are slower than raw pointers or array indices because they involve more complex operations. Using indices instead of iterators can also help the compiler to better optimize the code.

2. The second step is to compile the code with optimization flags. These flags hint the compiler to aggressively optimize the code, often resulting in much faster execution. However, the trade-offs include longer compilation time and potentially larger binary size. 

Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  int maxProfit = 1 - 1000000000;
  int Ri = 2000000000;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> R(n);
  // Using an integer index instead of an iterator
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> R[i];
  }
  // Using an integer index instead of an iterator
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (maxProfit < R[i] - Ri) {
      maxProfit = R[i] - Ri;
    }
    if (R[i] < Ri) {
      Ri = R[i];
    }
  }
  cout << maxProfit << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
When compiling this program, use the -O2 or -O3 flag to enable optimizations: `g++ -O2 main.cpp`.
