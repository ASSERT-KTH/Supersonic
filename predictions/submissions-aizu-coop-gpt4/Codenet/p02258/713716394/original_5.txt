1. Code Analysis:

The provided code is a simple C++ program which reads in a number 'n' from the input, and then reads 'n' numbers into a vector. Afterwards, it calculates the maximum difference between any two numbers in the array such that the smaller number appears before the larger one. The maximum difference is then printed on the console.

2. Optimization Strategy:

The program can be optimized in the following ways:

    A) Reduce use of iterators: The use of iterators in C++ is often slower than directly indexing the elements of a vector or an array. We can replace the use of iterators with direct indexing for better performance.

    B) Avoid unnecessary initialization of vector: The vector R is initially initialized with default values (zeroes). However, we immediately overwrite these values with input data. We can avoid this unnecessary initialization by using push_back() to add elements to the vector.

    C) Use of C++ STL algorithms: Instead of manually writing a loop to find the maximum profit, we can use the max_element function from the C++ STL algorithms library which can possibly be more optimized.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    A) Reduce use of iterators: Iterators are a more generalized way of accessing elements in a container. However, this generalization often comes at the cost of performance. By directly indexing the elements, we can avoid the overhead of the iterator.

    B) Avoid unnecessary initialization of vector: When we define a vector of size 'n', it gets initialized with 'n' default values (which are zeroes in this case). Since we are immediately overwriting these values, this initialization is unnecessary. We can avoid this overhead by using push_back() to add elements to the vector.

    C) Use of C++ STL algorithms: The Standard Template Library (STL) in C++ provides a set of well-optimized algorithms for common tasks. Instead of manually writing the loop to find the maximum profit, we can use the max_element function from the STL. This not only makes the code more readable, but can also be more efficient as the STL algorithms are typically well-optimized.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> R;
  R.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int num;
    cin >> num;
    R.push_back(num);
  }
  int min_price = *min_element(R.begin(), R.end());
  int max_profit = *max_element(R.begin(), R.end()) - min_price;
  cout << max_profit << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the above optimization doesn't consider the fact that the smaller number must appear before the larger one. If this condition is necessary, the optimized code would look as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> R;
  R.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int num;
    cin >> num;
    R.push_back(num);
  }
  int min_price = R[0];
  int max_profit = R[1] - R[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    max_profit = max(max_profit, R[i] - min_price);
    min_price = min(min_price, R[i]);
  }
  cout << max_profit << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
