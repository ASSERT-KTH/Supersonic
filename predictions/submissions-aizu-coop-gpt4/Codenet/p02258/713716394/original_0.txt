Code Analysis:
This code reads in a list of values and computes the maximum difference between any two elements, with the condition that the subtracted element comes before the subtracting element in the list.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the separate iterator-based loops with range-based loops. This simplifies the code and allows the compiler to make its own optimizations.
2. Remove the redundant check for maxProfit in the second loop. One comparison operation can be saved by initializing maxProfit with the smallest possible integer.
3. Use std::min and std::max functions to update the minimum value and maximum profit respectively. This can lead to more readable and maintainable code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Instead of using explicit iterators to fill up the vector and then iterate over it, we can use range-based for loops. This makes the code easier to read and understand. Moreover, modern compilers can apply their own optimizations to range-based for loops.
2. The initial value of maxProfit is set to the smallest possible integer, so there is no need to check if maxProfit is less than the difference between the current element and the minimum element found so far.
3. Using std::min and std::max functions makes the code more readable and maintainable. There is no performance penalty for using these functions as they are inlined by the compiler.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<int> R(n);

  for (int& element : R) {
    cin >> element;
  }

  int maxProfit = numeric_limits<int>::min();
  int minRi = numeric_limits<int>::max();

  for (const int& element : R) {
    maxProfit = max(maxProfit, element - minRi);
    minRi = min(minRi, element);
  }

  cout << maxProfit << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code performs the same task as the original code, but it does so more efficiently and with clearer code.
