### Code Analysis

This code is a C++ implementation of the QuickSort algorithm. The goal of the code is to read in an array of integers from the user and sort them in ascending order.

Here are some potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage in the current code:

1. The partition function is called recursively within the quicksort function. Each time it's called, it creates a new pivot and swaps elements in place. This could lead to significant overhead if the array's size is large.

2. The usage of `max_element` function inside the partition function is unnecessary and could be optimized. This function iterates over the entire range to find the maximum element, which adds extra complexity to the code.

3. The current implementation uses random pivot selection, which can be suboptimal for certain input distributions.

4. The usage of `scanf` and `printf` for input/output operations is slower compared to using `cin` and `cout` with `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` set.

### Optimization Strategy

We could consider the following optimizations:

1. Implement iterative version of QuickSort instead of recursive, as it can slightly improve the performance by avoiding function call overhead and reducing the risk of stack overflow for large inputs.

2. Avoid the use of `max_element` function in the partition process. The pivot can be selected as the last element of the array, which will reduce the computational complexity.

3. Consider using Median-of-three pivot selection for the QuickSort algorithm, which can improve the performance for certain input distributions.

4. Use `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations after setting `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` which can significantly speed up the I/O operations in C++.

### Optimized Code Block

Here is the optimized version of the provided code:

```cpp
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int arr[1000010];

void swap(int* a, int* b)
{
    int t = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = t;
}

int partition(int arr[], int low, int high)
{
    int pivot = arr[high];
    int i = (low - 1);

    for (int j = low; j <= high - 1; j++)
    {
        if (arr[j] < pivot)
        {
            i++;
            swap(&arr[i], &arr[j]);
        }
    }
    swap(&arr[i + 1], &arr[high]);
    return (i + 1);
}
  
void quickSortIterative(int arr[], int l, int h)
{
    int stack[h - l + 1];
  
    int top = -1;
  
    stack[++top] = l;
    stack[++top] = h;
  
    while (top >= 0) {
        h = stack[top--];
        l = stack[top--];
  
        int p = partition(arr, l, h);
  
        if (p - 1 > l) {
            stack[++top] = l;
            stack[++top] = p - 1;
        }
  
        if (p + 1 < h) {
            stack[++top] = p + 1;
            stack[++top] = h;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    srand(time(0));
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> arr[i];
    quickSortIterative(arr, 0, n - 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cout << arr[i] << (i == n - 1 ? '\n' : ' ');
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we implemented an iterative version of QuickSort and removed the usage of `max_element` function. We also swapped `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` for faster I/O operations.
