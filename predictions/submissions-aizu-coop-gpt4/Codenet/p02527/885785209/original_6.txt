Here's the analysis of the code:

1. Code Analysis: 
    This code is an implementation of the QuickSort sorting algorithm. It takes an array of integers as input and sorts it in ascending order. The QuickSort algorithm works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.

Potential optimization areas:

1. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses a simple array for storing the data. While this is efficient for random access and iteration, we can consider replacing this with a more advanced data structure that has built-in sorting functionality, such as a std::vector, if the requirements of the problem allow it.
    2. Redundant Computation: The code checks if the pivot is the maximum element in the array. If it is, it swaps it with the last element. This is unnecessary because QuickSort is not sensitive to the selection of the pivot. You can optimize the code by removing this check.
    3. Loop Optimization: The partitioning step involves two while loops that can potentially be optimized. However, care must be taken not to disturb the logic of the QuickSort algorithm.
    4. Compiler Optimizations: We can experiment with compiler optimizations like O3 and Ofast to see if they provide any significant speedup.

Let's now proceed to implement some of these optimizations:

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. We remove the check and swap for the maximum element. This reduces unnecessary computations.
    2. Replace C-style array with std::vector to leverage C++ STL features.
    3. Use std::swap instead of manual swapping of elements to improve code readability.
    4. Enable compiler optimizations for speedup.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

template <typename T>
void quicksort(T *l, T *r) {
  struct range {
    T *l, *r;
  };
  static range s[300];
  auto partition = [&](T *l, T *r) {
    if (r - l < 2)
      return (T *)nullptr;
    T *piv = l + rand() % (r - l);
    swap(*l, *piv);
    piv = l;
    r--;
    while (l < r) {
      while (l < r && *l <= *piv)
        l++;
      while (l<r && * r> * piv)
        r--;
      swap(*l, *r);
    }
    T *p = l - 1;
    swap(*p, *piv);
    return p;
  };
  int sz = 0;
  s[sz++] = {l, r};
  while (sz) {
    T *l = s[--sz].l;
    T *r = s[sz].r;
    T *p = partition(l, r);
    if (p != nullptr) {
      if (p + 1 < r)
        s[sz++] = {p + 1, r};
      if (l < p)
        s[sz++] = {l, p};
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  srand(time(0));
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  quicksort(a.begin(), a.end());
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cout << a[i] << (i == n - 1 ? '\n' : ' ');
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that this code may not be more efficient than the original code in all cases. The performance of QuickSort heavily depends on the distribution of the input data. However, these optimizations are aimed at general improvements and improved code readability.
