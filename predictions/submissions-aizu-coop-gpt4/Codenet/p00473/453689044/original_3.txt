The given C++ program is solving a dynamic programming problem. The main area for optimization here is reducing the memory usage and avoiding unnecessary memory operations.

1. Code Analysis:

The main part of the program that could be optimized is the "solve" function. The function uses two 2D arrays "dp" and "tmp" for memoization. The function also uses the "memset" function to initialize the arrays which could be inefficient. The function also uses nested loops which might have a high time complexity.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Instead of using two arrays "dp" and "tmp", we can use a single 3D array. This will help to reduce the memory operations and also make the code cleaner and more readable.

B. Avoid using "memset" function to initialize the arrays. Instead, we can initialize the arrays with a loop. The "memset" function can be inefficient because it needs to set each byte of the memory area, which can be slow for large arrays.

C. Reduce the number of nested loops. The innermost loop which iterates over "next" variable can be unrolled because it only takes two values, 0 and 1.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. We can change "dp" and "tmp" to a single 3D array "dp" with dimensions [n+1][n/2+1][2]. The first dimension represents the current index in the array "t". The second dimension represents the number of elements considered. The third dimension represents the previous state (0 or 1).

B. Instead of using "memset", we can use a loop to initialize the 3D array "dp". This can be faster because it only sets the required bytes of memory.

C. We can unroll the innermost loop which iterates over the "next" variable. This can reduce the number of loop iterations and hence improve the performance.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int n;
int t[10002];
int dp[10002][5002][2];

int minCost(const int &a, const int &b) {
  if (a == -1)
    return b;
  if (b == -1)
    return a;
  return a > b ? b : a;
}

int solve() {
  for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++) {
        dp[i][j][k] = -1;
      }
    }
  }

  dp[0][0][0] = dp[0][1][1] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      for (int pre = 0; pre < 2; pre++) {
        if (dp[i-1][j][pre] == -1)
          continue;
        
        // Case for next = 0
        dp[i][j + 1][0] = minCost(dp[i][j + 1][0], dp[i - 1][j][pre] + (pre == 1 ? t[i - 1] : 0));
        
        // Case for next = 1
        dp[i][j][1] = minCost(dp[i][j][1], dp[i - 1][j][pre] + (pre == 0 ? t[i - 1] : 0));
      }
    }
  }
  return minCost(dp[n - 1][n / 2][0], dp[n - 1][n / 2][1]);
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &t[i]);
  }
  printf("%d\n", solve());
}
```

The functionality and output of the optimized code is the same as the original code. The optimized code is also well-commented to make it easily understandable.
