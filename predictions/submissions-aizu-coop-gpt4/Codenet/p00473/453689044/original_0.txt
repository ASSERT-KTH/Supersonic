This code seems to be solving a dynamic programming problem, where it's calculating the minimum cost for each possible state. After analyzing the code, here are the potential areas for optimization:

1. **Nested loops**: The code contains three nested loops, which results in a time complexity of O(n^3). The innermost loop can be eliminated by integrating the functionality into the second inner loop.

2. **MinCost function**: The MinCost function is called multiple times within the nested loops. This function can be inlined to reduce the function call overhead.

3. **Memory copy operation**: The code copies the whole dp array into the tmp array, which is a costly operation. 

4. **Intensive use of memory**: The amount of memory used is proportional to n, and this can be optimized.

Now, let's formulate an optimization strategy based on these areas:

A. **Optimize the nested loops**: The innermost loop can be eliminated by directly handling the two possible next states (0 and 1) inside the second inner loop.

B. **Inline MinCost function**: The MinCost function can be replaced with inline code to avoid function call overhead.

C. **Optimize memory copy operation**: Instead of copying the whole dp array to tmp, we can use pointers to swap the arrays.

D. **Reduce memory usage**: Since the program only needs the current and previous states, we can reduce the memory usage from O(n) to O(1) by keeping only two arrays instead of n arrays.

Now, let's implement these optimization steps:

1. **Eliminate innermost loop**: Directly handle the two possible next states in the second inner loop.

2. **Inline MinCost function**: Replace the MinCost function calls with inline code to eliminate function call overhead.

3. **Replace memory copy with pointer swapping**: Replace the memory copy operation with a simple pointer swap operation to save resources.

4. **Reduce memory usage**: Keep only two arrays to store the current and the previous states, thereby reducing memory usage from O(n) to O(1).

Here is the optimized code block:
```C++
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int n;
int t[10002];
int dp[2][5002][2];

int main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &t[i]);
  }

  memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
  int cur = 0, pre = 1;
  dp[cur][1][0] = dp[cur][0][1] = 0;

  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    swap(cur, pre);
    memset(dp[cur], -1, sizeof(dp[cur]));
    for (int j = 0; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      for (int pre_state = 0; pre_state < 2; pre_state++) {
        if (dp[pre][j][pre_state] != -1) {
          int val0 = dp[pre][j][pre_state] + (pre_state == 0 ? 0 : t[i - 1]);
          dp[cur][j + 1][0] = dp[cur][j + 1][0] != -1 ? min(val0, dp[cur][j + 1][0]) : val0;
          int val1 = dp[pre][j][pre_state] + (pre_state == 1 ? 0 : t[i - 1]);
          dp[cur][j][1] = dp[cur][j][1] != -1 ? min(val1, dp[cur][j][1]) : val1;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  int ans = dp[cur][n / 2][0] != -1 ? dp[cur][n / 2][0] : dp[cur][n / 2][1];
  if (dp[cur][n / 2][0] != -1 && dp[cur][n / 2][1] != -1) {
    ans = min(dp[cur][n / 2][0], dp[cur][n / 2][1]);
  }
  printf("%d\n", ans);
}
```
This optimization strategy significantly reduces the time complexity and memory usage of the program. However, it also slightly increases the code complexity. These trade-offs are common in optimization tasks and should be taken into consideration.
