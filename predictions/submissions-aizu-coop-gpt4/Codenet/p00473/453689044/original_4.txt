Code Analysis:
The given code is a dynamic programming solution to a problem. The program reads in 'n' and 'n-1' integers, and then finds the minimum cost based on the given rules. One of the primary bottlenecks in this code is the usage of dynamic programming (dp) and temporary (tmp) two-dimensional arrays, which are used heavily in nested for-loops. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Refactor the minCost function: The minCost function is used to find the minimum value between two integers. This function could be replaced by the built-in 'min' function which would be more efficient.

2. Reduce memory usage: In the current implementation, there are two 2D arrays (dp and tmp) of size 5002x2. However, it is noticed that at every iteration of the outermost loop in the solve function, the values of dp array are simply copied to the tmp array. This suggests that the tmp array is not really required and can be removed to save memory.

3. Avoid frequent memory setting operations: The memset function is used to initialize all the elements of the dp array to -1 in every iteration of the outermost loop in the solve function. This operation could be avoided if the elements of the dp array are set to -1 only when required.

Here are the optimization steps:

Step 1: Refactor the minCost function:
The minCost function can be removed and replaced by the built-in 'min' function. This would improve code readability and also potentially improve performance as built-in functions are usually optimized.

Step 2: Reduce memory usage:
The tmp array can be removed and operations can be performed directly on the dp array. This will reduce memory usage and also the time taken to copy elements from dp to tmp.

Step 3: Avoid frequent memory setting operations:
The memset function is used to set all the elements of dp to -1. This operation can be avoided by setting the elements of dp to -1 only when required. This can be done by checking if the current value is -1 before setting it.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int n;
int t[10002];
int dp[5002][2];

int solve() {
  dp[1][0] = dp[0][1] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      for (int pre = 0; pre < 2; pre++) {
        if (dp[j][pre] == -1)
          continue;
        for (int next = 0; next < 2; next++) {
          if (pre == next) {
            if (next == 0)
              dp[j + 1][next] = min(dp[j + 1][next], dp[j][pre]);
            else
              dp[j][next] = min(dp[j][next], dp[j][pre]);
          } else {
            if (next == 0)
              dp[j + 1][next] = min(dp[j + 1][next], dp[j][pre] + t[i - 1]);
            else
              dp[j][next] = min(dp[j][next], dp[j][pre] + t[i - 1]);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return min(dp[n / 2][0], dp[n / 2][1]);
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &t[i]);
  }
  printf("%d\n", solve());
}
```
Trade-offs:
While this optimization improves memory usage and potentially the speed of the program, it does not make significant changes to the overall time complexity of the algorithm, which remains O(n^2). As such, for large inputs, the program could still be slow. Additionally, the optimized code may be slightly less readable due to the removal of the minCost function and the tmp array.
