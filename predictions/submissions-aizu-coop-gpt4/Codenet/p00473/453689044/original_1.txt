## Code Analysis

The given code is a dynamic programming problem that calculates the minimum cost. There are several potential performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies:

1. Redundant memory copy: In the end of each iteration of the outer loop, dp[][] is copied into tmp[][] entirely. This operation has a time complexity of O(n).

2. Inefficient Min Function: The minCost() function is called multiple times within a deeply nested loop structure. This function has a few conditional checks that could be optimized.

3. Inefficient memory initialization: memset() is used to initialize arrays, which iterates through the entire array. This is inefficient.

## Optimization Strategy

1. Inefficient data structures: The data structure used here, a 2D array, is efficient for this kind of problem. So no change is required in this part.

2. Redundant computations: 
    - The entire dp[][] is copied to tmp[][] at the end of every outer loop iteration. Instead, we can use dp[][] for computations in the next iteration directly, reducing the need for copying.
    - The minCost() function is called multiple times with the same arguments, causing redundant computation. We can instead calculate the value once and reuse it.

3. Loop optimizations: There are no opportunities for loop unrolling or tail recursion in this code.

4. Compiler optimizations: By default, the C++ compiler does a good job of optimizing the code. However, we can use the -O3 optimization level for more aggressive optimizations.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Remove tmp[][] and use dp[][] directly: Instead of copying dp[][] to tmp[][] at the end of each iteration, we can use dp[][] for the next iteration's computations directly. This will save the time spent in copying arrays.

2. Optimize minCost(): The minCost() function is called multiple times with the same arguments. We can instead calculate the value once and store it in a variable for reuse. This will reduce the time spent in function calls and conditional checks.

3. Compiler optimizations: Compile the code with the -O3 optimization level to enable more aggressive optimizations like function inlining, loop unrolling, vectorization etc.

## Optimized Code Block

```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int n;
int t[10002];
int dp[5002][2];

int solve() {
  memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
  dp[1][0] = dp[0][1] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      for (int pre = 0; pre < 2; pre++) {
        if (dp[j][pre] != -1) {
          for (int next = 0; next < 2; next++) {
            int cost = dp[j][pre] + (pre != next ? t[i - 1] : 0);
            if (pre == next) {
              if (next == 0)
                dp[j + 1][next] = (dp[j + 1][next] == -1) ? cost : min(dp[j + 1][next], cost);
              else
                dp[j][next] = (dp[j][next] == -1) ? cost : min(dp[j][next], cost);
            } else {
              if (next == 0)
                dp[j + 1][next] = (dp[j + 1][next] == -1) ? cost : min(dp[j + 1][next], cost);
              else
                dp[j][next] = (dp[j][next] == -1) ? cost : min(dp[j][next], cost);
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return min(dp[n / 2][0], dp[n / 2][1]);
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &t[i]);
  }
  printf("%d\n", solve());
}
```
Note: This is the same program, but with several modifications to increase efficiency. The biggest change is removing the array `tmp[][]` and using `dp[][]` directly, which reduces the need for copying. The `minCost()` function was replaced with inline code to avoid function call overhead and to enable compiler optimizations.
