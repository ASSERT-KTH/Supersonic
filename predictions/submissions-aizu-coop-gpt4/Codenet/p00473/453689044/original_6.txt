## Code Analysis
The provided code is a dynamic programming solution that calculates the minimum cost of getting from state A to state B, given two choices at each step. The code currently has several potential performance bottlenecks that could be improved:

1. The use of `memset` function to clear the entire `dp` and `tmp` arrays at each iteration of the `i` loop in the `solve` function. This is inefficient because it iterates over the entire array, regardless of how much of it is actually used. 

2. In the `solve` function, the `dp` array is updated, and then its contents are copied over to the `tmp` array. This copying step is unnecessary and could be improved.

3. The use of the `minCost` function to calculate the minimum of two numbers is less efficient than using the `std::min` function provided by the C++ Standard Library.

## Optimization Strategy
1. Reduce the use of `memset` by only clearing the sections of the `dp` and `tmp` arrays that are actually used.
2. Remove the unnecessary copying of the `dp` array to the `tmp` array by using a single array for both calculations.
3. Replace the `minCost` function with the `std::min` function from the C++ Standard Library.

## Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Instead of using `memset` to clear the entire `dp` and `tmp` arrays, we can initialize them to `-1` at the start of the program. Then, we only need to update the relevant parts of the array inside the loop. This saves time by avoiding unnecessary iteration over unused parts of the array.

2. We can remove the `tmp` array and perform all calculations directly on the `dp` array. This removes the need for the final copying step, which is a significant performance bottleneck.

3. The `std::min` function from the C++ Standard Library is optimized for performance and can be used instead of the `minCost` function.

## Trade-offs
While these optimizations will improve the performance of the code, they may also make the code slightly more complex and harder to understand for someone not familiar with the optimizations. However, given the significant potential for performance improvement, these changes are recommended.

## Optimized Code Block
Here is the optimized code, with changes highlighted:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm> // For std::min
using namespace std;

int n;
int t[10002];
int dp[5002][2];

int solve() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5002; i++)
    dp[i][0] = dp[i][1] = -1; // Initialize DP array to -1
  dp[1][0] = dp[0][1] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      for (int pre = 0; pre < 2; pre++) {
        if (dp[j][pre] == -1)
          continue;
        for (int next = 0; next < 2; next++) {
          if (pre == next) {
            if (next == 0)
              dp[j + 1][next] = std::min(dp[j + 1][next], dp[j][pre]); // Use std::min
            else
              dp[j][next] = std::min(dp[j][next], dp[j][pre]);
          } else {
            if (next == 0)
              dp[j + 1][next] =
                  std::min(dp[j + 1][next], dp[j][pre] + t[i - 1]);
            else
              dp[j][next] = std::min(dp[j][next], dp[j][pre] + t[i - 1]);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return std::min(dp[n / 2][0], dp[n / 2][1]);
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &t[i]);
  }
  printf("%d\n", solve());
}
```
This optimized code performs the same calculations as the original, but with improved performance due to the removal of the redundant copying step and the more efficient use of the `dp` array.
