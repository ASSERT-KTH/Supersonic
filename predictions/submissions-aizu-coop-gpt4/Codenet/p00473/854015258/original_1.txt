Analysis:
The given code seems to be a dynamic programming problem. It appears to be using a 3-dimensional array to store intermediate results. The apparent bottlenecks in this code are:

1. The initialization of the dp array, which iterates through each of the 5002 * 2 * 2 entries and sets them to INF.
2. The nested loop that computes the dp array values based on previously calculated values.

Optimization Strategy:

1. The initialization of the dp array can be optimized by using memset instead of nested loops which is more efficient.
2. The nested for loop can be optimized by using pointer swapping technique to reduce the space complexity from O(n) to O(1).

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replacing the nested loop initialization with memset: The memset function sets the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s to the byte c. This operation is faster than using nested loops to initialize the array.

2. Reducing space complexity with pointer swapping: In dynamic programming, it's common that the current state only relies on the previous state. In such cases, we can reduce the space complexity from O(n) to O(1) by maintaining two pointers that point to the current state and the previous state. 

Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const int INF = 1000000000;
  int n, c;
  static int dp[2][5002][2];
  memset(dp, INF, sizeof dp);    // Use memset to initialize the array
  dp[1][1][0] = 0;
  dp[1][0][1] = 0;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int(*cur)[2] = dp[0], (*prev)[2] = dp[1];  // Introduce pointers for current and previous states
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    swap(cur, prev);    // Swap the pointers for each iteration
    scanf("%d", &c);
    for (int j = 0; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      if (j == 0)
        cur[j][0] = INF;
      else
        cur[j][0] = min(prev[j - 1][0], prev[j - 1][1] + c);
      cur[j][1] = min(prev[j][0] + c, prev[j][1]);
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", min(cur[n / 2][0], cur[n / 2][1]));
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:
We optimized our code for better time efficiency and reduced space complexity. However, this has increased the complexity of our code. Especially the pointer swapping technique might be harder to understand for someone not familiar with this technique.
