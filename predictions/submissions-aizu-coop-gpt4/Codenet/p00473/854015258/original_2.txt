**Code Analysis**:

Here is an analysis of the provided code:

1. The code seems to be a dynamic programming solution to a problem. 
2. The dynamic programming table `dp[][][]` is a 3-dimensional array, which consumes a large amount of memory. 
3. The primary computational cost comes from the nested loops, where n can be as large as 5000.
4. The dynamic programming table is initialized with a value of `INF`, which suggests that it is being used to find a minimum value.
5. The code uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output, which are faster than `cin` and `cout`.

**Optimization Strategy**:

1. **Inefficient Data Structures**: The 3-dimensional dynamic programming table `dp[][][]` is memory inefficient. However, due to the nature of dynamic programming, we cannot propose more memory efficient alternatives without knowing the exact problem it is trying to solve. 

2. **Redundant Computations**: The computations inside the inner most loop are not redundant, but they can be optimized.

3. **Optimizing Loops**: The loop that initializes the dynamic programming table can be optimized. The inner loop that performs the dynamic programming calculations can also be optimized.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: The `-O3` compiler flag can be used to enable all optimization levels, which can potentially improve the performance of the code.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**:

1. **Optimizing Loop that Initializes the Dynamic Programming Table**: Currently, the initialization is done using two nested loops. However, since all values are being initialized to the same value `INF`, we can use `std::fill` to fill the entire array in one line.

2. **Optimizing Inner Loop**: The computations inside the inner loop can potentially be optimized by computing `dp[t][j - 1][0]` and `dp[t][j][0]` once and storing them in temporary variables, as they are used more than once.

3. **Compiler Optimizations**: Use the `-O3` compiler flag to enable all optimization levels. This can be done when compiling the program.

**Trade-offs**:

The optimizations proposed will make the code faster and more memory efficient. However, using compiler optimizations can sometimes lead to unexpected results, so it is important to thoroughly test the program after using these optimizations.

**Optimized Code Block**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm> // for std::fill
using namespace std;
int main() {
  const int INF = 1000000000;
  int n, c;
  static int dp[2][5000 + 2][2];

  // Use std::fill to initialize the array
  fill(&dp[0][0][0], &dp[0][0][0] + sizeof(dp)/sizeof(dp[0][0][0]), INF);

  dp[1][1][0] = 0;
  dp[1][0][1] = 0;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    int s = i % 2, t = 1 - s;
    scanf("%d", &c);
    for (int j = 0; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      int t_j_0 = dp[t][j][0], t_j_1 = dp[t][j][1];
      if (j == 0)
        dp[s][j][0] = INF;
      else
        dp[s][j][0] = min(t_j_0, dp[t][j - 1][1] + c);
      dp[s][j][1] = min(t_j_0 + c, t_j_1);
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", min(dp[0][n / 2][0], dp[0][n / 2][1]));
}
```

Use the following command to compile the code with `-O3` optimization flag:

```bash
g++ -O3 -o optimized_program program.cpp
```
