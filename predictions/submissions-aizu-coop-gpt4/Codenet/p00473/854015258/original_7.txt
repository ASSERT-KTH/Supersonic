1. Code Analysis:

The provided code is a dynamic programming implementation that is attempting to find a minimum value based on some input received from the user. The code is running a computation that involves three-dimensional array manipulations.

2. Optimization Strategy:

The primary performance issue here is the use of a static three-dimensional array. Static arrays are allocated in memory at compile-time and can lead to wasted space if not fully utilized. We can optimize this by using dynamic data structures and minimizing unnecessary computations.

A. Use dynamic data structures: Instead of a static array, we can use a dynamic array that can be resized based on the input size. This can result in significant memory savings.

B. Minimize unnecessary computations: In the inner loop, the code is checking if `j == 0` and setting `dp[s][j][0] = INF`. This operation can be moved out of the loop to reduce unnecessary computations.

C. Compiler optimization: We can enable compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to make the compiler optimize the code further during compilation.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Dynamic data structures: We will replace the static array with a dynamic array using std::vector. This allows us to resize the array based on the input size, which can save memory.

B. Minimizing unnecessary computations: The check `if (j == 0)` only needs to be performed once per loop iteration, not `n / 2` times. We can move this operation out of the loop to reduce unnecessary computations.

C. Compiler optimization: Enabling `-O2` or `-O3` compiler flags can result in faster code. This tells the compiler to perform optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining and dead code elimination.

4. Optimized Code:

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const int INF = 1000000000;
  int n, c;
  vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(2, vector<vector<int>>(5002, vector<int>(2, INF)));

  dp[1][1][0] = 0;
  dp[1][0][1] = 0;
  cin >> n;
  
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    int s = i % 2, t = 1 - s;
    cin >> c;
    
    dp[s][0][0] = INF; // move out of the loop
    for (int j = 1; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      dp[s][j][0] = min(dp[t][j - 1][0], dp[t][j - 1][1] + c);
      dp[s][j][1] = min(dp[t][j][0] + c, dp[t][j][1]);
    }
  }
  cout << min(dp[0][n / 2][0], dp[0][n / 2][1]) << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code uses less memory by using a dynamic array and reduces unnecessary computations by moving the `if (j == 0)` check out of the loop. The functionality and output remain the same. Enable `-O2` or `-O3` compiler flag during compilation for further optimizations.
