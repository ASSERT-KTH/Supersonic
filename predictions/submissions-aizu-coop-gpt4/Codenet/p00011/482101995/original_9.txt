1. Code Analysis:

The provided C++ code is a simple console program that takes two inputs. The first input `w` signifies the width of a line in terms of points and the second input `n` signifies the number of horizontal lines. After initializing a vector `StartingPoint` with the points from 1 to `w`, it takes `n` lines of input where each line contains two points `Left` and `Right` with a comma in between. Then, it swaps the points `Left` and `Right` in the vector `StartingPoint`. Finally, it prints the points in the `StartingPoint` vector.

The primary potential performance bottlenecks in this program are:
- The initialization of the `StartingPoint` vector, which takes O(w) time.
- The swapping operation inside the loop, which also takes O(n) time.
- The final loop to print the vector, which takes O(w) time.
- The vector `StartingPoint` has a size of `w` which could be large, leading to inefficient memory usage.

2. Optimization Strategy:

The strategy for optimizing this program is as follows:
- Using an iota function to fill the vector instead of a manual loop.
- Reducing the size of the vector to `n` instead of `w`.
- Implementing compiler optimizations.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A1: Replacing the Initialization of `StartingPoint` Vector with Iota function:

The `iota` function is used to fill the `StartingPoint` vector. This function is more efficient than a manual loop because it has less overhead.

A2: Reducing the Size of the Vector `StartingPoint`:

Instead of making the size of the vector `w`, we make it `n`. This reduces memory usage.

A3: Compiler Optimizations:

We can use compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` for optimizations which can help in making the code run faster.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
using namespace std;
struct THorizonalLine {
  int Left;
  int Right;
};
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int w;
  cin >> w;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> StartingPoint(n);
  iota(StartingPoint.begin(), StartingPoint.end(), 1);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    THorizonalLine HorizonalLine;
    char Dummy;
    cin >> HorizonalLine.Left >> Dummy >> HorizonalLine.Right;
    swap(StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1],
         StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    cout << StartingPoint[i] << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` is used to make `cin` and `cout` operations faster.

It's crucial to understand that changing the size of the vector `StartingPoint` to `n` might not be feasible in all scenarios. Here it's assumed that `w` is always equal to or greater than `n`. If there are specific constraints on the inputs to your program, you will need to adjust your optimizations accordingly.
