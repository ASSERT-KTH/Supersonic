This C++ program reads in a series of horizontal line coordinates and swaps the "Left" and "Right" values of the horizontal line in the StartingPoint vector. The program is already efficient, but there are a few minor optimizations we can do:

1. Code Analysis: The primary performance bottlenecks in the given code are the initial population of the vector `StartingPoint` and the multiple `swap` operations performed within the second for loop. Also, the program is doing unnecessary memory allocation for the `THorizontalLine` struct inside the loop, which can be moved outside the loop to save memory allocation and deallocation time.

2. Optimization Strategy: 
    1. Instead of populating the `StartingPoint` vector with a for loop, we can use the `iota` function from the `<numeric>` library, which is designed to fill a range with sequentially increasing values.
    2. We can move the declaration of `THorizonalLine` outside the second loop to save memory allocation and deallocation time.
    3. We can use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` to untie cin and cout, which can speed up input/output operations.
    4. We can use `'\n'` instead of `endl` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output stream.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Replace the initialization loop for `StartingPoint` with `iota`. This is a standard library function designed for filling a sequence with successive increments of the starting value. This will eliminate the need for the loop and might be faster.
    2. Move the declaration of `THorizonalLine` outside the loop. This will save memory allocation/deallocation time.
    3. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`. These two lines of code will untie the cin and cout streams, which can speed up input/output operations. This is a common optimization for C++ programs that perform a lot of input/output operations.
    4. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`. The `endl` command not only inserts a newline character, but also flushes the output stream, which can be an expensive operation. In contrast, `'\n'` simply inserts a newline character without flushing the stream.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
using namespace std;

struct THorizonalLine {
  int Left;
  int Right;
};

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int w, n;
  cin >> w >> n;

  vector<int> StartingPoint(w);
  iota(StartingPoint.begin(), StartingPoint.end(), 1);

  THorizonalLine HorizonalLine;
  char Dummy;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> HorizonalLine.Left >> Dummy >> HorizonalLine.Right;
    swap(StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1], StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1]);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    cout << StartingPoint[i] << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
