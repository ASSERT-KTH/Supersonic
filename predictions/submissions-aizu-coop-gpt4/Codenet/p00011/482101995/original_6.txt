Code Analysis:
The provided code is a simple C++ program that reads the width of a line and a number of operations from input, performs a series of swaps on a vector, and finally outputs the resulting vector. The program uses the `std::vector` data structure to store the initial line and performs the swaps in-place. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: The `std::vector` data structure is actually pretty efficient for the tasks this program is performing. There's no need to change this.

2. Redundant computations: The program initializes the `StartingPoint` vector with the sequence 1 to w. This initialization is not needed as we can directly assign the value when we perform the swap operation.

3. Loop Optimizations: The existing loops are already efficient. However, the output loop can be optimized using the `copy` algorithm from the standard library along with an `ostream_iterator` to output the entire vector in one go.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations can be used to further optimize the program. For instance, the `-O3` flag can be used with g++ compiler for optimization.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The initialization of the `StartingPoint` vector can be avoided. Instead, when performing the swap operation, we can directly assign the value i+1 to the swapped elements. This saves one loop iteration over the entire vector.

2. The output loop can be optimized using the `copy` algorithm along with an `ostream_iterator`. This will output the entire vector in one go and is faster than looping and outputting each element individually.

3. Using compiler optimizations like `-O3` flag with g++ compiler can further optimize the code at compile-time.

Trade-offs: These optimizations will lead to performance improvements but could make the code more complex and harder to understand for some developers. Also, the compiler optimizations are compiler-dependent and may not work or may have different effects with different compilers.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iterator>
using namespace std;

struct THorizonalLine {
  int Left;
  int Right;
};

int main() {
  int w;
  cin >> w;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> StartingPoint(w);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    THorizonalLine HorizonalLine;
    char Dummy;
    cin >> HorizonalLine.Left >> Dummy >> HorizonalLine.Right;
    StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1] = HorizonalLine.Left;
    StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1] = HorizonalLine.Right;
  }

  copy(StartingPoint.begin(), StartingPoint.end(), ostream_iterator<int>(cout, "\n"));

  return 0;
}
```
Note: To compile the above code with optimizations, use the `-O3` flag (if using g++ compiler): `g++ -O3 main.cpp`
