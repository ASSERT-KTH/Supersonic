The provided code essentially simulates a swapping of positions in a line of objects as indicated by the user. The user gives the total number of objects in the line, and then the number of swaps to carry out. Each swap consists of two positions in the line, and the objects in these positions are swapped.

Now let's analyze the code and propose optimizations:

1. Code Analysis:
    - The vector `StartingPoint` is initialized with sequential integers. This is a linear time operation (O(n)) with a memory requirement of O(n).
    - For each swap operation, the code performs a swap operation on the vector `StartingPoint`. 
    - Finally, it prints out the resulting sequence. 

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - Data Structure Optimization: The current data structure used is a vector. There is no need for a dynamic structure since the size is known beforehand.
    - Redundant Computations: The initialization of `StartingPoint` with sequential numbers can be avoided since it is just an overhead here.
    - Loop Optimization: There is no scope for loop unrolling, as each iteration depends on the input. However, we can use a better approach to avoid the second loop completely.
    - Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations can be used. However, this is often the last resort when all other techniques have been exhausted, as they are compiler dependent and can lead to non-portable code.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   - Instead of initializing the `StartingPoint` with sequential integers, we can use the index of the vector directly as the initial position.
   - We don't actually need to perform the swap operation on the `StartingPoint` vector. Instead, we can maintain a map of swaps, where each swap operation just updates the map.
   - Instead of iterating the vector `StartingPoint` to print the final position of each point, we can directly use the map we maintained to print the final position.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int w, n;
    cin >> w >> n;

    unordered_map<int, int> swaps;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int left, right;
        char dummy;
        cin >> left >> dummy >> right;
        if(swaps.find(left) == swaps.end())
            swaps[left] = left;
        if(swaps.find(right) == swaps.end())
            swaps[right] = right;
        swap(swaps[left], swaps[right]);
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= w; i++) {
        if(swaps.find(i) != swaps.end())
            cout << swaps[i] << endl;
        else
            cout << i << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This code maintains an unordered map for swaps and uses it to print the final positions. It only stores the swapped items, which can potentially save a lot of space if the number of swaps is much less than the total number of items. The trade-off here is that the unordered map operations may have a worst-case complexity of O(n), but on average, it performs well with a complexity of O(1). If the order of input is guaranteed, using a normal map could be considered.
