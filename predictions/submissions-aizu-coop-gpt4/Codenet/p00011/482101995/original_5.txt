Code Analysis:
The given code reads 'w', the number of points, and 'n', the number of horizontal lines, from the standard input. It then initializes a vector "StartingPoint" of size 'w' with values from 1 to 'w'. The code goes on to read 'n' horizontal lines. For each line, it swaps the elements at positions 'Left' and 'Right' in the "StartingPoint" vector. Finally, the code prints out the elements in the "StartingPoint" vector.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. Initialization of the vector "StartingPoint" involves a loop of 'w' iterations.
2. Swapping of elements in the vector "StartingPoint" involves 'n' iterations.
3. Printing of the vector "StartingPoint" involves 'w' iterations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Efficient Data Structures: The vector "StartingPoint" is appropriate for this task since it supports efficient indexing and swapping operations. Hence, no change is required in this aspect.
2. Redundant Computations: The initialization of the vector "StartingPoint" with values from 1 to 'w' can be optimized by using the iota function from the numeric library.
3. Loop Optimizations: The loops for swapping and printing cannot be optimized further as every horizontal line and every element in the vector needs to be considered.
4. Compiler Optimizations: The use of compiler optimization flags such as '-O2' or '-O3' can help in improving the performance of the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the loop for initializing the vector "StartingPoint" with the iota function from the numeric library. The iota function initializes a range of elements with sequentially increasing values. This reduces the number of lines of code and potentially improves performance as the iota function is likely to be optimized for the specific architecture.
2. The trade-off here is that the use of the iota function may make the code less readable to those unfamiliar with the numeric library.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric> // include numeric library for iota function
using namespace std;
struct THorizonalLine {
  int Left;
  int Right;
};
int main() {
  int w;
  cin >> w;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> StartingPoint(w);
  iota(StartingPoint.begin(), StartingPoint.end(), 1); // use iota function to initialize vector
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    THorizonalLine HorizonalLine;
    char Dummy;
    cin >> HorizonalLine.Left >> Dummy >> HorizonalLine.Right;
    swap(StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1],
         StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    cout << StartingPoint[i] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
