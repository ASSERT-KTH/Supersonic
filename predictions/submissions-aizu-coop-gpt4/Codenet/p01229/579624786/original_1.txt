This code seems to be solving a competitive programming problem. It's taking some input and using dynamic programming approaches to solve the problem. Here are some optimization steps that can be applied to this code:

1. **Avoid repeated computation**: In the current code, there are repetitive computations that can be avoided. For instance, the bitwise AND operation `cur & 1` is calculated multiple times. You can calculate it once and store it in a variable for future use.

2. **Avoid unnecessary operations**: In the current code, there are operations that can be avoided. For instance, we are setting the `dp[][][]` table to false twice, first, at the beginning of each test case and then at the end of each iteration of `cur`. We can avoid setting the table to false at the beginning of each test case and only do it at the end of each `cur` iteration.

3. **Use efficient data structures**: The use of a three-dimensional array here is costly in terms of memory and accessing each element. If the problem allows, consider using more efficient data structures. However, without the context of the problem, it's hard to suggest alternatives.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: You can use compiler flags to optimize the code. For instance, the `-O2` flag tells the compiler to perform nearly all supported optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define REP(i, s, n) for (int i = s; i < n; i++)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define MAX 150
using namespace std;
bool dp[MAX][MAX][2];
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // to speed up I/O operations
  cin.tie(NULL); // untie cin and cout ties to speed up I/O operations
  int T;
  while (cin >> T) {
    while (T--) {
      int N;
      cin >> N;
      vector<int> input(N);
      rep(i, N) cin >> input[i];
      if (N <= 2) {
        cout << input[N - 1] << "\n";
        continue;
      }
      int ans = input[N - 1];
      REP(cur, 1, N - 1) {
        int curBit = cur & 1;
        dp[input[cur - 1]][input[cur]][curBit] = true;
        int R = input[cur + 1];
        rep(L, MAX) {
          rep(M, MAX) {
            if (!dp[L][M][curBit])
              continue;
            if (M == 0) {
              if (cur + 2 < N) {
                dp[M][R][(cur + 1) & 1] = true;
              } else
                ans = max(ans, R);
            } else {
              if (cur + 2 < N) {
                dp[M][R][(cur + 1) & 1] = true;
                dp[M - 1][R + L][(cur + 1) & 1] = true;
              } else {
                ans = max(ans, R + L);
              }
            }
          }
        }
        rep(i, MAX) rep(j, MAX) dp[i][j][curBit] = false;
      }
      cout << ans << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Changes made:
- The `inf` and `cmath` are not used, so they were removed.
- The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` were added to speed up I/O operations.
- Created `curBit` to avoid repeated computation of `cur & 1`.
- Removed the initial setting of `dp[][][]` to false at the beginning of each test case. It's now done only at the end of each `cur` iteration.
- Replaced int array with vector for dynamic allocation.
- Replaced `endl` with `\n` to avoid unnecessary flush of the buffer.
