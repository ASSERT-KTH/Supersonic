The given C++ code takes a number of test cases as input, and for each test case, it takes an integer `N` and `N` numbers. The primary algorithm seems to be a dynamic programming approach for finding some maximum value `ans`. This code is quite complex and uses three-dimensional arrays, which are often expensive in terms of memory.

Here's an optimization strategy:

1. **Memory Usage**: The dynamic programming matrix `dp` has been declared with a size `MAX`x`MAX`x`2`. The size `MAX` is set to `150`, so the total size of the matrix is `150*150*2`, which is a large memory space. We should reduce the size of the matrix if possible. Additionally, it is declared globally which makes it harder to manage the memory.

2. **Redundant Computations**: The code includes clearing the dynamic programming matrix in every iteration of `cur` using `rep(i, MAX) rep(j, MAX) dp[i][j][cur & 1] = false;`. This operation has a time complexity of O(`MAX`^2) which can be expensive. We can avoid this by using a different approach.

3. **Data Structures**: The input data is stored in a C-style array. This can be replaced with a `std::vector<int>` which is more flexible and offers better methods for manipulation.

4. **Loop Optimizations**: The loops `rep(L, MAX)` and `rep(M, MAX)` are running up to `MAX` times which is not necessary as we are only interested in the range that has data. This can be optimized to run only for the valid range.

Here's the optimized code:

```C++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    int N;
    cin >> N;
    vector<int> input(N);
    for (int &num : input)
      cin >> num;

    if (N <= 2) {
      cout << input[N - 1] << endl;
      continue;
    }

    int ans = input[N - 1];
    vector<vector<vector<bool>>> dp(N, vector<vector<bool>>(N, vector<bool>(2, false)));
    for (int cur = 1; cur < N - 1; ++cur) {
      dp[input[cur - 1]][input[cur]][cur & 1] = true;
      int R = input[cur + 1];
      for (int L = 0; L <= cur; ++L) {
        for (int M = 0; M <= cur; ++M) {
          if (!dp[L][M][cur & 1])
            continue;
          if (M == 0) {
            if (cur + 2 < N) {
              dp[M][R][(cur + 1) & 1] = true;
            } else
              ans = max(ans, R);
          } else {
            if (cur + 2 < N) {
              dp[M][R][(cur + 1) & 1] = true;
              dp[M - 1][R + L][(cur + 1) & 1] = true;
            } else {
              ans = max(ans, R + L);
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code:

1. I replaced the array `input` with `std::vector<int>`, which is easier to work with.

2. I reduced the size of the `dp` matrix to `N`x`N`x`2` and declared it inside the main function to manage memory more effectively.

3. I removed the redundant clearing of the `dp` matrix in each `cur` iteration.

4. I optimized the loops over `L` and `M` to only iterate over the valid range.

The trade-off of these changes is that the optimized code is slightly more complex due to the introduction of std::vector. However, the benefit in terms of improved performance and reduced memory usage is significant.
