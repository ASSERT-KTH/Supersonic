The given C++ program seems to be dealing with an array of `Data` structures that store two properties, size and value. The program sorts the array based on size and value, then calculates and outputs a certain maximum value based on the properties of the structures.

Here are the possible areas of optimization:

1. The `cmp` function can be simplified.
2. The `Max` function can be replaced with `std::max`.
3. The `Data` struct can be replaced with `std::pair` for better readability and efficiency.
4. The loop can be improved by removing redundant code.
5. The input can be read faster using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`.
6. The array can be replaced with `std::vector` for safer and more efficient memory management.

The step-by-step optimization strategy is as follows:

1. `cmp` function: This function is used for sorting the array. It can be simplified and optimized by using `std::tie` which generates a tuple that can be compared lexicographically.

2. `Max` function: This function is used to calculate the maximum of two numbers. It can be replaced with `std::max` which is a built-in function in C++ and is more efficient.

3. `Data` struct: This struct is used to store two properties of each element. It can be replaced with `std::pair` which is a built-in data structure in C++ and is more efficient and readable.

4. Loop: The loop can be optimized by removing the redundant code. For example, `size` and `value` are assigned the same value in each iteration, so they can be removed.

5. Input: The input can be read faster by using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` before the input operations.

6. Array: The array can be replaced with `std::vector`. `std::vector` is a dynamic array that can grow and shrink at runtime and is safer and more efficient than a regular array.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long llong;
typedef pair<llong, llong> Data;
#define N_MAX 500000

int main(void) {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  vector<Data> art(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    cin >> art[i].first >> art[i].second;
  }
  sort(art.begin(), art.end());
  llong min_size = art[0].first;
  llong sum_value = art[0].second;
  llong ans = art[0].second;
  for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
    llong tmp = sum_value + art[i].second - (art[i].first - min_size);
    if (tmp < art[i].second) {
      ans = max(ans, art[i].second);
      sum_value = art[i].second;
      min_size = art[i].first;
    } else {
      ans = max(ans, tmp);
      sum_value += art[i].second;
    }
  }
  cout << ans << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code follows the same logic as the original code but is more efficient and readable.
