After analyzing the code, the key areas that can be optimized are:

1. Data Structure: The struct 'Data' is being used to store the size and value. This appears to be efficient for this use case as we are only dealing with two items of data for each object.

2. Redundant Computations: There are some redundant computations, particularly in the for loop where we calculate the 'tmp' value on every iteration, even in cases where it might not be used.

3. Loops: The sorting operation and the for loop are the main areas where the time complexity of the program comes into play. The sorting operation has a time complexity of O(N log N). The for loop has a time complexity of O(N). These seem to be as efficient as they can be for this case.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations can be used to improve the performance of the code. For example, enabling compiler optimizations like `-O2` or `-O3` can help in removing some of the redundant computations.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Reduce Redundant Computations: Move the calculation of 'tmp' inside the else block where it is used. This will avoid computing 'tmp' when it is not used.

2. Enable Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations can be enabled using the `-O2` or `-O3` flag during the compilation process. These optimizations can greatly improve the performance of the code by making several optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, etc.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long llong;

struct Data {
  llong size;
  llong value;
};

#define N_MAX 500000
Data art[N_MAX];

inline bool cmp(const Data &a, const Data &b) {
  return a.size == b.size ? a.value < b.value : a.size < b.size;
}

inline llong Max(llong a, llong b) { return a > b ? a : b; }

int main(void) {
  int N;
  scanf("%d", &N);

  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    scanf("%lld %lld", &art[i].size, &art[i].value);
  }

  sort(art, art + N, cmp);

  llong min_size = art[0].size;
  llong sum_value = art[0].value;
  llong ans = art[0].value;

  for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
    llong value = art[i].value;
    llong size = art[i].size;

    if (sum_value + value - (size - min_size) < value) {
      ans = Max(ans, value);
      sum_value = value;
      min_size = size;
    } else {
      llong tmp = sum_value + value - (size - min_size);
      ans = Max(ans, tmp);
      sum_value += value;
    }
  }

  printf("%lld\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

The above code minimizes redundant computations and enables compiler optimizations for better performance. The functionality and output of the original code are preserved.
