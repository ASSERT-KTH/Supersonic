**1. Code Analysis**

The given code accepts an array of data structures (with fields 'size' and 'value'), sorts it, and then processes the sorted array to calculate a final answer. 

The primary performance bottlenecks are:

1. The sorting process: The sort function has a time complexity of O(N log N), where N is the number of elements in the array to sort. 

2. The use of inline functions: While inline functions can speed up small, frequently called functions by reducing function call overhead, they can increase the overall size of the binary, which could lead to increased cache misses.

**2. Optimization Strategy**

1. Sorting is necessary here, so the time complexity can't be improved. However, we can improve the sorting efficiency by using std::sort's ability to accept custom comparators directly through lambda functions. This avoids the need for a separate comparison function.

2. We can replace the custom Max function with the max function from the algorithm library. This reduces code complexity and reliance on inline functions.

3. We can minimize memory usage by reducing the scope of variables to where they are needed.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. Use a lambda function as a custom comparator in std::sort: The lambda function can be provided directly to the sort function, eliminating the need for the separate cmp function. This simplifies the code and potentially improves performance by reducing function calls.

2. Replace the Max function with std::max: The algorithm library provides a max function. Using this instead of a custom function reduces code complexity and removes the reliance on inline functions, which can potentially lead to larger binaries and more cache misses.

3. Reduce scope of variables: Declaring variables (like 'value', 'size', and 'tmp') inside the loop where they are used can help reduce memory usage and potentially improve cache efficiency.

**4. Optimized Code Block**

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long llong;

struct Data {
  llong size;
  llong value;
};

#define N_MAX 500000
Data art[N_MAX];

int main(void) {
  int N;
  scanf("%d", &N);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    scanf("%lld %lld", &art[i].size, &art[i].value);
  }

  sort(art, art + N, [](const Data &a, const Data &b) {
    return a.size == b.size ? a.value < b.value : a.size < b.size;
  });

  llong min_size = art[0].size;
  llong sum_value = art[0].value;
  llong ans = art[0].value;
  
  for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
    llong value = art[i].value;
    llong size = art[i].size;
    llong tmp = sum_value + value - (size - min_size);
    
    if (tmp < value) {
      ans = max(ans, value);
      sum_value = value;
      min_size = size;
    } else {
      ans = max(ans, tmp);
      sum_value += value;
    }
  }

  printf("%lld\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code preserves the functionality of the original code and minimizes memory usage by reducing the scope of some variables. It also improves performance by replacing inline functions with library functions and using lambda functions for custom comparisons in sort.
