Code Analysis:
The code appears to be a solution to a performance problem involving sorting and maximizing values. The main sections of the code that can be optimized are:

1. The sorting operation. Sorting is usually a costly operation with O(n log n) complexity. We need to check if it's really necessary or if we can optimize it.
2. The for loop performing computations and comparisons. We need to ensure that the computations are efficient and necessary.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use of Efficient Data Structures: The data structure used is an array of structs. This seems to be efficient enough as arrays provide constant time access. However, we need to ensure that the struct itself is efficient.
2. Avoid Redundant Computations: We need to check if all computations are necessary and if we can avoid any of them.
3. Optimize Loops: We need to see if the loop can be optimized in any way.
4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler options for optimization such as -O2 or -O3 for GCC.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Efficient Data Structures: The struct and array used are efficient for the given problem. No changes are required in this step.
2. Avoid Redundant Computations: The computation of `tmp` seems to be unnecessary in some cases. We can move it inside the if condition to avoid unnecessary computation.
3. Optimize Loops: The loop seems to be efficient. However, we can avoid reassignment of `ans` in each iteration by keeping a flag to check if it's necessary.
4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimization can help in improving performance but it's not part of the code. It's a good practice to use -O2 or -O3 option with GCC for performance critical code.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long llong;
struct Data {
  llong size;
  llong value;
};
#define N_MAX 500000
Data art[N_MAX];
inline bool cmp(const Data &a, const Data &b) {
  return a.size == b.size ? a.value < b.value : a.size < b.size;
}
inline llong Max(llong a, llong b) { return a > b ? a : b; }
int main(void) {
  int N;
  scanf("%d", &N);
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    scanf("%lld %lld", &art[i].size, &art[i].value);
  }
  sort(art, art + N, cmp);
  llong min_size = art[0].size;
  llong sum_value = art[0].value;
  llong ans = art[0].value;
  bool flag = true; // to check if ans needs to be updated
  for (i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
    llong value = art[i].value;
    llong size = art[i].size;
    if (sum_value + value - (size - min_size) < value) {
      if(flag || ans < value) {
        ans = value;
        flag = false;
      }
      sum_value = value;
      min_size = size;
    } else {
      if(flag || ans < sum_value + value) {
        ans = sum_value + value;
        flag = false;
      }
      sum_value += value;
    }
  }
  printf("%lld\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, I have introduced a flag which is used to check if `ans` needs to be updated. This avoids unnecessary reassignment of `ans` in each iteration. Also, the computation of `tmp` is moved inside the if condition to avoid unnecessary computation when `tmp` is not needed.
