Code Analysis:
The given program reads a list of items (art), each with a size and value, sorts the list, and then finds the maximum value achievable by adding the values and subtracting the difference in sizes from the smallest size.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Data Structures: The current data structures used in the program are optimal and efficient for the task at hand.

2. Redundant Computation: There are no redundant computations in the given code.

3. Loops/Recursive Calls: The program contains a single loop which goes through each element in the sorted list once. This cannot be optimized further.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The compiler should automatically optimize the code to a large extent, but we can still provide explicit hints using `#pragma`.

However, there is some room for optimization in the way "art" array is manipulated and how "cmp" function operates.

Step-by-step Explanation:
1. Using references in the cmp function: Whenever the cmp function is called, a copy of the Data objects is created. This can be avoided by passing the objects by reference, thereby reducing the number of copy operations. This can save both time and memory especially when the object size is large. However, in the given code, this optimization is already implemented.

2. Use of "inline" keyword: The `inline` keyword is used for small functions that are called frequently, to avoid the overhead of the function call. The time saved can be significant when the function is small and called very often. However, the `inline` keyword is only a hint to the compiler, and it may choose to ignore it. In the given code, the `inline` keyword is used appropriately for small, frequently called functions.

3. Use of `#pragma` directives: We can use the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to parallelize the for loop, which could provide a significant time reduction on multi-core systems. However, in this case, the loop operations are dependent on previous iterations, so it cannot be parallelized.

4. Avoiding multiple array accesses: In the main loop, the "art" array is accessed multiple times. We can reduce this by storing the current element in a local variable.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long llong;
struct Data {
  llong size;
  llong value;
};
#define N_MAX 500000
Data art[N_MAX];
inline bool cmp(const Data &a, const Data &b) {
  return a.size == b.size ? a.value < b.value : a.size < b.size;
}
inline llong Max(llong a, llong b) { return a > b ? a : b; }
int main(void) {
  int N;
  scanf("%d", &N);
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    scanf("%lld %lld", &art[i].size, &art[i].value);
  }
  sort(art, art + N, cmp);
  llong min_size = art[0].size;
  llong sum_value = art[0].value;
  llong ans = art[0].value;
  for (i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
    Data &current = art[i]; // store current element in a local variable to reduce array access
    llong value = current.value;
    llong size = current.size;
    llong tmp = sum_value + value - (size - min_size);
    if (tmp < value) {
      ans = Max(ans, value);
      sum_value = value;
      min_size = size;
    } else {
      ans = Max(ans, tmp);
      sum_value += value;
    }
  }
  printf("%lld\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```
Trade-offs:
The optimization proposed doesn't significantly increase the code's complexity. It does, however, assume that the size of "Data" is large enough to make the reduced array access beneficial. If "Data" were smaller, the overhead of copying the object into a local variable might outweigh the benefits of reduced array access.
