The provided C++ program is already quite optimized, but we can still make a few minor changes to further improve its performance.

Code Analysis:
1. The code uses a struct to store the data. This is efficient for memory usage.
2. The sort function of the std library is used, which is quite efficient as it applies introsort (a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from quicksort and heapsort).
3. The program uses inline functions, which reduce the overhead of function calls.
4. The loop structure seems to be efficient.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use of vectors instead of arrays: Vectors are more dynamic and easy to work with compared to arrays. They can reduce memory usage by allocating only the required amount of memory.
2. Avoiding multiple definitions: In the for loop, variables 'value', 'size', and 'tmp' are defined in every iteration. We can define them before the loop to avoid multiple definitions.
3. Use of const reference in loops: By using const reference, we can avoid copying the data, hence improving performance.

Steps:

1. Replace array 'art' with vector 'artVect'. It's more dynamic, easy to work with, and can reduce memory usage by allocating only the required amount of memory.

2. Define variables 'value', 'size', and 'tmp' before the loop to avoid multiple definitions.

3. In the loop where we iterate through 'artVect', use a const reference to each element. This will prevent unnecessary copying of data and improve performance.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long llong;
struct Data {
  llong size;
  llong value;
};

inline bool cmp(const Data &a, const Data &b) {
  return a.size == b.size ? a.value < b.value : a.size < b.size;
}

inline llong Max(llong a, llong b) { return a > b ? a : b; }

int main(void) {
  int N;
  scanf("%d", &N);
  
  vector<Data> artVect(N);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    scanf("%lld %lld", &artVect[i].size, &artVect[i].value);
  }
  
  sort(artVect.begin(), artVect.end(), cmp);
  
  llong min_size = artVect[0].size;
  llong sum_value = artVect[0].value;
  llong ans = artVect[0].value;
  llong value, size, tmp;
  
  for (const auto &item : artVect) {
    value = item.value;
    size = item.size;
    tmp = sum_value + value - (size - min_size);
    if (tmp < value) {
      ans = Max(ans, value);
      sum_value = value;
      min_size = size;
    } else {
      ans = Max(ans, tmp);
      sum_value += value;
    }
  }
  
  printf("%lld\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

The trade-off in this optimization is that vectors are slightly slower than arrays. However, the difference is negligible and often outweighed by the benefits of using vectors.
