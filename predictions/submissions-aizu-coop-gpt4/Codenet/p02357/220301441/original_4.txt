This is a complex program that uses a variety of data structures and strategies to perform a range minimum query (RMQ) on an array of integers. The RMQ problem is to answer queries of the form "what is the minimum value in the array between indices i and j?".

1. Code Analysis:
The program uses a custom class `StaticRMQ`, which pre-computes a "sparse table" for the range minimum queries in its constructor. This table is used later in the `operator()` method to quickly answer any RMQ query. The main function reads in an array of integers and a length `l`, initializes a `StaticRMQ` object with the array, then prints out the minimum value in each sub-array of length `l`.

Potential performance bottlenecks include the construction of the `StaticRMQ` object and the repeated RMQ queries in the main function. However, the sparse table strategy used here is a standard approach for RMQ with a time complexity of O(n log n) for pre-processing and O(1) for queries, which is hard to improve upon. The repeated RMQ queries in the main function are also done in O(1) time each, so there is not much room for optimization there either.

2. Optimization Strategy:

   A. Inefficient Data Structures:
    The program uses a combination of arrays and vectors to store its data, which is generally efficient for the operations being performed. The use of bit manipulation and sparse tables is a standard approach for this kind of problem and is already quite efficient.

   B. Redundant computations:
    The `operator()` method performs a similar calculation in two different branches of an if statement, which could be factored out to avoid repetition. However, this won't have a significant impact on performance.

   C. Loops or recursive calls:
    The loops in the constructor and main function are necessary for the sparse table construction and the RMQ queries respectively, and can't be easily optimized.

   D. Compiler optimizations:
    Compiler optimizations like `-O3` could be used to potentially speed up the execution of the program. However, this might not have a significant impact as the program is already quite efficient.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   Given that the code already implements a highly efficient algorithm for the problem at hand, and uses appropriate data structures, there aren't apparent optimization steps that we could take without changing the nature of the solution.

4. Optimized Code Block:
   The provided code is already optimized for the problem it solves. An attempt to refactor or change the data structures might result in a less efficient solution. Therefore, the original code block stands as the optimized one.
