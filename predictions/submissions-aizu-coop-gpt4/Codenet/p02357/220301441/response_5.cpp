The given code is a C++ program that uses a data structure called static range minimum query (StaticRMQ) to find the smallest number in a given range of a list. The StaticRMQ data structure is built upon the given list, and then the smallest numbers in different ranges are queried.

First, let's analyze the code:

1. The code uses a lot of bit manipulations, which are generally faster than arithmetic operations. However, some of these operations are not intuitive and can be difficult to understand, affecting code readability.

2. The use of C-style memory management (calloc) in C++ is not recommended due to potential memory leaks and it also makes the code less readable. C++ provides alternatives such as unique_ptr or shared_ptr which handle memory management automatically.

3. __builtin_clz, __builtin_ctz, and __builtin_clrsb are GCC compiler built-ins. These could slow down the performance on other compilers.

4. Using a lot of global variables and macro definitions can make the code harder to understand and debug.

5. The code has a high cyclomatic complexity due to the number of conditional statements, which may hinder performance.

Optimization strategy:

1. Replace C-style memory management with C++ style memory management.

2. Refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable. This includes removing or refactoring the use of complex bitwise operations and replacing them with equivalent, more readable code.

3. Use a more efficient data structure for storing the information used in the range minimum query. Currently, the code uses several arrays. A single structure with clear field names could help improve readability and potentially speed up access times.

4. Use inline functions instead of macros. This will aid in better debugging and type checking.

5. Use const variables instead of macros for constant values. This will provide the benefits of type checking, scope limitation, and better debugging.

6. Try to reduce the cyclomatic complexity by simplifying the logic, reducing the number of conditional statements, and breaking down complex expressions into simpler ones.

7. Replace the use of GCC compiler specific built-ins with standard C++ functions or custom functions that perform the same operation.
