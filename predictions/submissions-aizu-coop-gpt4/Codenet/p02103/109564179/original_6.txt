1. Code Analysis:
This C++ program appears to be solving a pathfinding problem on a grid using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is implemented in 4 different functions: `bfs()`, `bfs2()`, `bfs3()`, `bfs4()`. Each function has a similar structure but starts from a different position on the grid.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Try to merge the four BFS functions into one, taking the start position as a parameter. This will reduce the code duplication.
    2. In the BFS algorithm, the same map element is searched multiple times using `g.find()`. Instead of using `g.find()` multiple times, store the iterator returned by `g.find()` and use it for further operations.
    3. Try to reduce the number of conditions inside the nested loops in the BFS functions. 

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Merge Four BFS functions into one: The four BFS functions are extremely similar, with the only differences being the initial conditions and some specific continue conditions. We can merge these into one function, taking the start position, and the specific conditions as parameters. This will simplify the code and potentially improve the performance by improving cache locality and reducing the function call overhead.
   2. Reduce multiple `g.find()` calls: In the current implementation, `g.find()` is called multiple times for the same element. This could be optimized by storing the iterator returned by `g.find()` once and reusing it in the rest of the code. This will reduce the time complexity from multiple logarithmic operations to a single logarithmic operation.
   3. Reduce the number of conditions inside the nested loops: The nested loops inside the BFS functions contain multiple conditions to continue the loop. We can optimize these by ordering the conditions based on their likelihood of being true, so the most likely conditions are checked first.

Let's proceed with the above-mentioned optimizations. Please note that the optimizations proposed are purely code-level optimizations and may not guarantee a significant performance boost. Performance tuning can be very specific to the problem at hand and often requires a deep understanding of the underlying architecture and the specific requirements of the program.
