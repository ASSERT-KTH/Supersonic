The given code is a C++ program that uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path in a grid. It uses four BFS functions (bfs, bfs2, bfs3, bfs4) to search for the path from different start points. Each BFS function uses a queue to manage the nodes to visit, and a map to store the visited nodes. 

Here are few observations and potential performance improvements:

1. **Use of std::map**: The code uses std::map, which provides O(log n) complexity for search, insert, and delete operations. As an alternative, if the range of keys is not so large, we could use a std::vector or a std::array for faster O(1) access.

2. **Repeated BFS Code**: The BFS code is repeated four times with slight variations. This leads to code redundancy and increases the program size. We can refactor the BFS function to accept starting points as arguments to reduce redundancy.

3. **Use of Queues**: Two separate queues (que and que2) are used where one is used for zero-cost movements and the other for one-cost movements. We can optimize this by using a single queue with a pair of values - the node and the cost.

4. **Repeated Condition Checking**: There are numerous repeated condition checks inside the nested for-loops. These should be minimized or combined where possible to reduce the number of instructions executed.

5. **Compiler Optimization**: You can also use compiler flags to optimize your code. For example, you can use the `-O2` or `-O3` flag with g++ to perform various performance optimizations during compilation.
