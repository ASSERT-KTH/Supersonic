Code Analysis:

The code is quite large and involves various BFS (Breadth-First Search) traversals on a grid represented as a map. The code uses `map<ll, int> g` to store the cell coordinates compressed into a single value as keys and their indices on the grid as values. 

It utilizes multiple BFS functions (bfs, bfs2, bfs3, bfs4) to traverse this grid from different start points and directions. Each BFS function uses two queues: one for cells that can be reached without cost and another for cells that can be reached with a cost of one. 

The performance of the code can be improved by avoiding redundant operations and using efficient data structures. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Efficient Data Structures: The code uses a map to store the grid, which is inefficient because it requires O(log n) operations to insert and find an element. If possible, a direct 2D array would be more efficient for this purpose as access times would be O(1).

2. Redundant Operations: There are many repeated calculations and redundant operations. For instance, `g.find(nval)` is called multiple times, `cost[g[nval]]` is accessed multiple times, and `nx` and `ny` are computed multiple times. This can be avoided by storing these values in local variables.

3. Unnecessary Memory Usage: The `cost` array is reinitialized with `-1` before each BFS call. This could be avoided by setting the `cost` of visited nodes back to `-1` after their usage in each BFS call.

4. Loop Unrolling: There are nested loops iterating from -2 to 2 in each BFS function. The innermost loops can be unrolled to reduce the loop overhead.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace `map<ll, int> g` with a 2D array or vector, if the size `n` and `m` is not too large. This will allow O(1) access to the elements.

2. Store the results of `g.find(nval)` and `cost[g[nval]]` in local variables to avoid calling these functions multiple times.

3. After each BFS call, set the `cost` of visited nodes back to `-1`. This can be done by storing the visited nodes in a list during the BFS call and iterating over this list to reset the `cost` after the BFS call.

4. Unroll the innermost loops in the BFS functions to reduce the loop overhead. This means manually writing out the iterations of the loop. This can improve performance as it reduces the number of jump and comparison operations.

Trade-offs:

Using a 2D array instead of a map will increase the memory usage if the grid is sparse, i.e., if `n` and `m` are large but `k` is small. However, it will significantly improve the performance.

Unrolling loops can make the code longer and harder to read. It can also introduce bugs if not done correctly. However, it can improve performance by reducing the number of jump and comparison operations.
