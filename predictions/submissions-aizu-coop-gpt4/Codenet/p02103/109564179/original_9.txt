The provided C++ code is a BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm that is used in various graph traversal problems. The code uses a map to store the visited nodes and a queue to perform the BFS. 

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Use of Unordered Map: The code uses a std::map which maintains its elements in a sorted order. This provides an O(logN) look-up time complexity. An unordered_map, on the other hand, provides an average time complexity of O(1) for look-ups and insertions, which can significantly speed up the program.

2. Repeated Code: The code contains four similar BFS functions (bfs, bfs2, bfs3, and bfs4) which can be combined into a single function to reduce code redundancy. This will improve code maintainability and readability.

3. Avoiding std::map::find: In C++, map::find function is used to find an element with a key equivalent to the key. This function is used multiple times in the code, which is not efficient. Instead, we can use map::operator[], which also searches for the key, and if it is not found, inserts the key into the map with a default value.

4. Precomputing the cost: We notice that the cost is computed for every node in every BFS function. It would be more efficient to precompute the cost for each node before the BFS functions are called, and store these in an array. This would reduce the time complexity of each BFS function.

5. Use of memset: memset is used to initialize the cost array to -1. However, memset may not work as expected with non-byte types. It's better to use std::fill instead.

Given these points, the optimization strategy would be as follows:

1. Replace std::map with std::unordered_map to improve look-up times.

2. Combine the four bfs functions into one, reducing code redundancy.

3. Replace std::map::find with std::map::operator[] to avoid unnecessary look-ups.

4. Precompute the cost for each node before the BFS functions are called, reducing the time complexity of each BFS function.

5. Replace memset with std::fill to properly initialize the cost array.

These optimizations would improve the time complexity and memory usage of the code, as well as its readability and maintainability. However, it should be noted that using an unordered_map instead of a map may increase the memory usage slightly because an unordered_map doesn't keep its elements in a sorted order. This trade-off is acceptable given the significant performance improvement. 

Now let's implement these changes in the code.
