1. Code Analysis:
The provided code computes the smallest enclosing disc for a set of points in 2D space. This algorithm is called Welzl's Algorithm, which is based on randomized incremental construction. It also sorts and matches radii of some circles. The current implementation has a few potential performance bottlenecks:

   1. Use of `random_shuffle()`: This introduces randomness into the algorithm and can potentially lead to inconsistent performance times.
   2. Unnecessary lambda function definitions inside a function call: This can be optimized by defining these lambda functions outside the function.
   3. Multiple use of `vector::emplace_back` and `vector::push_back`: These operations can be expensive in terms of time complexity.
   4. Multiple nested loops: This can significantly slow down the program if the input size is large.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Replace `random_shuffle()` with `shuffle()` which is a more efficient and modern approach.
    2. Move the lambda function definitions outside the `smallest_enclosing_disc` function.
    3. Replace the use of `vector::push_back` or `vector::emplace_back` with pre-allocated vectors and indexing.
    4. Try to reduce the depth of nested loops or use a more efficient looping construct if possible.
    5. Use `reserve()` function to pre-allocate memory for vectors when the size is known beforehand which can improve performance by minimizing reallocations and copies.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   1. Replace `random_shuffle()` with `shuffle()`: `random_shuffle()` is deprecated in C++14 and removed in C++17. The `shuffle()` function is a safer and more efficient alternative as it uses a superior random number generation method.

   2. Move lambda function definitions: Defining the lambda functions `c3`, `c2` and `in_circle` outside of the `smallest_enclosing_disc` function will make the function cleaner and more readable. This change doesn't have a significant impact on performance, but it improves the structure of the code.

   3. Replace `vector::push_back` or `vector::emplace_back`: Instead of using these functions, we can create a vector of a known size and then just assign values to each index. This can be faster because it avoids the overhead of dynamically resizing the vector.

   4. Reduce nested loops: The current implementation has a nested loop of depth 3. If possible, we should try to reduce the depth of the nested loop or use a more efficient looping construct.

   5. Use `reserve()` function: When we know how many elements we will store in a vector, it's a good practice to pre-allocate memory using the `reserve()` function. This can avoid multiple reallocations as the vector grows.

4. Optimized Code Block:

   Here is the optimized code reflecting the strategy above. This code should be more efficient and faster than the original code. For simplicity, only the changes in the main function and `smallest_enclosing_disc` function are shown:

```cpp
// Lambda function definitions moved outside
auto c3 = [](const P &a, const P &b, const P &c) {
  ld A = norm(b - c);
  ld B = norm(c - a);
  ld C = norm(a - b);
  ld S = abs(cross(b - a, c - a));
  P p = (A * (B + C - A) * a + B * (C + A - B) * b + C * (A + B - C) * c) / (4 * S * S);
  ld r = abs(p - a);
  return make_pair(r, p);
};
auto c2 = [](const P &a, const P &b) {
  P c = (a + b) / (ld)2;
  ld r = abs(a - c);
  return make_pair(r, c);
};
auto in_circle = [](const P &a, const C &c) {
  return norm(a - c.pnt) <= c.rad * c.rad + eps;
};

C smallest_enclosing_disc(vector<P> ps) {
  // Replaced random_shuffle() with shuffle()
  shuffle(ps.begin(), ps.end(), std::mt19937{std::random_device{}()});
  C c = c2(ps[0], ps[1]);
  // Unchanged code omitted for brevity
  return c;
}

int main() {
  // Unchanged code omitted for brevity
  rep(i, m) {
    int k;
    cin >> k;
    G g(k);
    rep(j, k) {
      ld x, y;
      cin >> x >> y;
      g[j] = P(x, y);  // Replaced push_back() with direct assignment
    }
    mb[i] = smallest_enclosing_disc(g).rad;
  }
  // Unchanged code omitted for brevity
}
```
