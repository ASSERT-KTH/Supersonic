First, let's analyze this code to understand what it does. This program reads a 2D grid of size `a` by `b`, and `n` points (obstacles) in the grid. It then calculates the number of ways to navigate from the top-left corner of the grid to the bottom-right corner, moving only down or to the right, without passing through any obstacles. This is a classic dynamic programming problem.

Here are some potential optimization points:

1. The `way` 2D array is of fixed size `17x17`, which may be much larger than necessary for smaller inputs. However, since this size is not too large, it is not a significant memory issue. Reducing it to exactly the required size would complicate the code without much gain, so we leave this as is.

2. There are several nested loops used to initialize the `way` array and calculate the number of paths to each point. These loops could potentially be optimized.

3. The program uses `break` when an obstacle is found in the first row or column. This leaves the remaining cells uninitialized, which might affect the final result. Instead, we can continue initializing the remaining cells to `0`.

Optimization strategy:

1. Merge the initialization of `way` array and the input of obstacles into one loop to reduce the number of iterations. This avoids the need for a separate loop to initialize the array.

2. Remove the `break` statement when an obstacle is found in the first row or column. Instead, we can set a flag to stop setting `1` to the remaining cells.

3. Instead of calculating `w` and `h` separately, we can directly add `way[i][j - 1]` and `way[i - 1][j]` if they are not obstacles.

4. Use `++i` or `++j` instead of `i++` or `j++` in loops for slight performance improvement. 

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
int main() {
  int a, b, n, t1, t2, way[17][17] = {0};
  while (scanf("%d %d", &a, &b), a || b) {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= b; ++i) {
      for (int j = 1; j <= a; ++j)
        way[i][j] = (i == 1 || j == 1) ? 1 : 0;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      scanf("%d %d", &t1, &t2), way[t2][t1] = -1;
      if (t1 == 1) for (int j = t2; j <= b; ++j) way[j][1] = 0;
      if (t2 == 1) for (int j = t1; j <= a; ++j) way[1][j] = 0;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i <= b; ++i) {
      for (int j = 2; j <= a; ++j) {
        if (way[i][j] != -1) {
          if (way[i][j - 1] != -1) way[i][j] += way[i][j - 1];
          if (way[i - 1][j] != -1) way[i][j] += way[i - 1][j];
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", way[b][a]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code has the same functionality as the original code but is more efficient due to reduced number of iterations and improved calculations. It also fixes the issue with the `break` statement in the original code.
