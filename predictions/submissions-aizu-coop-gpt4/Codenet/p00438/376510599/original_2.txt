This C++ program seems to be calculating the number of paths in a grid with some blocked cells. It uses a 2D integer array to keep track of the number of ways to reach each cell. Here are some potential performance issues and optimization strategies:

1. **Redundant Initialization:** Currently, the program initializes each cell in the grid to 0 before reading the blocked cells. Then, it potentially overwrites this value if the cell is blocked. This double initialization can be avoided.

2. **Sequential Memory Access:** The program accesses memory in a non-sequential manner when updating the number of ways to each cell. This can be slow due to cache misses.

3. **Unnecessary Conditions:** The program checks if the cell to the left and above the current cell is blocked before adding their values. This can be avoided as blocked cells will have a value of -1.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** The program can benefit from compiler optimization flags for better performance.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
int main() {
  int a, b, n, t1, t2, way[17][17];
  while (scanf("%d %d", &a, &b), a || b) {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= b; ++i) {
      for (int j = 1; j <= a; ++j)
        way[i][j] = (i == 1 || j == 1) ? 1 : 0; // Initialize to 1 for edges and 0 otherwise
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      scanf("%d %d", &t1, &t2), way[t2][t1] = -1;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i <= b; ++i) {
      for (int j = 2; j <= a; ++j) {
        if (way[i][j] != -1) {
          way[i][j] = way[i][j - 1] + way[i - 1][j]; // Add the number of ways from the cell above and to the left
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", way[b][a]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version eliminates the redundant initialization and unnecessary condition checks. It also rearranges the code for more sequential memory access. Finally, using compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` when compiling this program can improve performance even further.
