Code Analysis:
The given C++ code reads in two numbers, a and b, and an array of size a*b. Then it calculates a dynamic programming solution for a grid-based problem, where some cells in the grid are blocked (indicated by -1). The result of each cell is the sum of the results from the cell above and the cell to the left, unless the cell is blocked. The final result is the calculated value of the bottom right cell.

The code is mainly composed of loops for scanning the input and performing the calculations. The performance bottleneck in this code is likely to be the nested loop that performs the dynamic programming calculations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: The 2D array 'way' is not inefficient in this case, as we need to maintain state information for each cell in the grid.

2. Redundant Computation: The code is calculating the sum of cells for each cell even when the cell is blocked. While the value is not used in the calculation, it can still contribute to wasted computation time.

3. Loop / Recursive Calls: The double for loop is necessary for this problem as we need to traverse each cell in the grid. However, the if statements inside the loop could be optimized.

4. Compiler Optimizations / Pragma Directives: We can use compiler flags such as -O2 or -O3 for optimization during the compilation process. 

Optimization Steps:
1. Remove the redundant calculation inside the for loop. We don't need to calculate the sum if the cell is blocked.
2. We can avoid unnecessary if checks by initializing the grid to 1 instead of 0. This way, we only need to check if the cell is blocked when calculating the sum.
3. Use compiler optimization flags during compilation. 

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int a, b, n, t1, t2, way[17][17];
  while (scanf("%d %d", &a, &b), a || b) {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= b; i++) {
      for (int j = 1; j <= a; j++)
        way[i][j] = 1; // Initialize all cells to 1
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%d %d", &t1, &t2), way[t2][t1] = -1; // Mark blocked cells

    // If the first cell is blocked, can't move at all
    if (way[1][1] == -1) {
      printf("0\n");
      continue;
    }

    for (int i = 2; i <= a; i++) {
      if (way[1][i] == -1)
        way[1][i] = 0; // If a cell in the first row is blocked, it can't be reached
      else
        way[1][i] += way[1][i - 1]; // Sum up the ways to reach this cell
    }
    for (int i = 2; i <= b; i++) {
      if (way[i][1] == -1)
        way[i][1] = 0; // If a cell in the first column is blocked, it can't be reached
      else
        way[i][1] += way[i - 1][1]; // Sum up the ways to reach this cell
    }

    for (int i = 2; i <= b; i++) {
      for (int j = 2; j <= a; j++) {
        if (way[i][j] != -1) {
          way[i][j] = (way[i][j - 1] != -1 ? way[i][j - 1] : 0) + (way[i - 1][j] != -1 ? way[i - 1][j] : 0);
        } else {
          way[i][j] = 0;
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", way[b][a]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs: The optimized code is slightly more complex due to the extra initialization steps and the calculation logic inside the loops. However, the performance gain from reducing the unnecessary calculations should outweigh the slight increase in code complexity.
