Code Analysis:
The program is designed to parse a boolean expression and evaluate it for all possible values of boolean variables (represented as lowercase alphabets). It performs this operation in a brute-force manner by iterating through all possible combinations of boolean values. 

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:
1. The evaluation of the boolean expression is performed using recursion, which can be computationally expensive.
2. For every possible combination of boolean variables, the entire string is parsed and evaluated from the beginning, which can lead to excessive computation.
3. The string is processed character by character, which can make the process slower.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Memoization: As the same boolean expressions might be evaluated multiple times, we can use memoization to store the results of previously evaluated expressions to avoid redundant computation.
2. Iterative Parsing: Instead of recursively parsing the boolean expression, we can try to parse it iteratively which might help to reduce the function call overhead.
3. Preprocessing: If possible, we should preprocess the string to replace all lowercase alphabets with their corresponding boolean values for each mask. This can speed up the parsing and evaluation process.

Optimized Code Block:
To implement these optimizations, we'll need to make quite significant changes to the code. However, we'll ensure that the changes preserve the functionality and output of the original program. 

Here's the optimized code block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cctype>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int mask;
unordered_map<string, bool> memo;

string preprocess(string S) {
    for (char &c : S) {
        if (islower(c)) {
            c = (mask >> (c - 'a')) & 1 ? 'T' : 'F';
        }
    }
    return S;
}

bool solve(string S) {
    if (memo.count(S)) {
        return memo[S];
    }

    vector<bool> stk;
    for (char c : S) {
        if (c == 'T') {
            stk.push_back(true);
        } else if (c == 'F') {
            stk.push_back(false);
        } else if (c == '+' || c == '*') {
            bool x = stk.back(); stk.pop_back();
            bool y = stk.back(); stk.pop_back();
            bool res = (c == '+' ? x || y : x && y);
            stk.push_back(res);
        } else if (c == '-') {
            bool x = stk.back(); stk.pop_back();
            stk.push_back(!x);
        }
    }

    bool res = stk.back(); stk.pop_back();
    return memo[S] = res;
}

int main() {
    string S;
    while (cin >> S && S != "#") {
        memo.clear();
        bool ans = true;
        for (mask = 0; mask < (1 << 11); mask++) {
            if (!solve(preprocess(S))) {
                ans = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        cout << (ans ? "YES" : "NO") << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Note that this code reuses much of the logic from the original program, but it incorporates memoization, string preprocessing, and an iterative parsing algorithm to improve efficiency. These optimizations should help to reduce both the running time and memory usage of the program.
