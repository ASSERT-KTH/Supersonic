Code Analysis:

The provided code is a C program that reads in a float value and determines a boxing weight class based on the input. The program uses a chain of ternary operators to perform this categorization. The code is simple, but the extensive use of nested ternary operators makes it hard to read and maintain.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace ternary operators with if-else statements: The nested ternary operators make the code difficult to read and maintain. Switching to if-else statements can improve readability without affecting performance.

2. Use an array and loop for checks: Instead of manually writing out each comparison, we can put the weight thresholds and associated class names into two arrays. We can then use a loop to find the appropriate weight class. This makes the code shorter, easier to read, and more maintainable.

3. Minimize function calls: The puts function is being called within the loop, which can be inefficient. We could minimize the number of function calls by assigning the result to a variable and calling puts once after the loop. This reduces the overhead of function calls.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace ternary operators with if-else statements: Switching to if-else statements can improve readability and maintainability of the code. The performance remains the same, as the number of comparisons and branches is identical. The trade-off is slightly longer code.

2. Use an array and loop for checks: Instead of manually comparing the input to each threshold, we can put the thresholds and class names into two arrays. We then loop through the array, comparing the input to each threshold until we find the correct weight class. This makes the code shorter, easier to read, and easier to maintain. The trade-off is a slight increase in memory usage due to the arrays, but this is generally negligible.

3. Minimize function calls: By assigning the result to a variable and calling puts once after the loop, we reduce the overhead of multiple function calls. The trade-off is a small increase in memory usage due to the extra variable, but this is generally negligible.

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  float f;
  char* weight_classes[] = {"heavy", "light heavy", "middle", "light middle", "welter", "light welter", "light", "feather", "bantam", "fly", "light fly"};
  float weight_thresholds[] = {91, 81, 75, 69, 64, 60, 57, 54, 51, 48};
  int num_classes = sizeof(weight_thresholds) / sizeof(float);
    
  while (scanf("%f", &f) != EOF){
    char* result;
    for (int i=0; i < num_classes; i++){
      if (f > weight_thresholds[i]){
        result = weight_classes[i];
        break;
      }
    }
    if (!result){
      result = weight_classes[num_classes];
    }
    puts(result);
  }

  return 0;
}
```
This code performs the same task as the original, but is easier to read and maintain. It also minimizes the number of function calls, potentially increasing performance.
