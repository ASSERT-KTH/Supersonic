1. Code Analysis:
   The given C code reads a floating-point number from the standard input and based on its value, it prints a string to the standard output. The code uses nested ternary operators to define the conditions for each string. 

2. Optimization Strategy:
   A. Inefficient data structures: The code doesn't use any data structures, so this point is not applicable.
   B. Redundant or unnecessary computations: The code repeatedly checks the same condition multiple times due to the nested ternary operators.
   C. Loops or recursive calls: There's only one loop, the for loop which reads the input until it fails. This can't be optimized.
   D. Compiler optimizations or pragma directives: Compiler optimizations are beyond the scope of the code itself and depend on the specific compiler and the development environment.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. The use of nested ternary operators makes the code hard to read and maintain. It would be better to use if-else statements instead. This way, we can eliminate the repeated checks for the same condition.
   2. The floating-point comparison could potentially be a performance bottleneck, especially if the input is large. We can optimize this by converting the floating-point numbers to integers after multiplying them by 10. This way, we can perform integer comparisons which are faster than floating-point comparisons.
   3. Trade-offs: The optimized code will be longer and slightly more complex than the original code. However, it will be easier to read and maintain, and it will perform better, especially with large inputs.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  float f;
  int i;

  while (scanf("%f", &f) != EOF) {
    i = f * 10;  // Convert float to int to improve performance.

    if (i > 910) {
      puts("heavy");
    } else if (i > 810) {
      puts("light heavy");
    } else if (i > 750) {
      puts("middle");
    } else if (i > 690) {
      puts("light middle");
    } else if (i > 640) {
      puts("welter");
    } else if (i > 600) {
      puts("light welter");
    } else if (i > 570) {
      puts("light");
    } else if (i > 540) {
      puts("feather");
    } else if (i > 510) {
      puts("bantam");
    } else if (i > 480) {
      puts("fly");
    } else {
      puts("light fly");
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code is easier to read and maintain, and it should perform better than the original code, especially with large inputs.
