This code classifies a series of floating point values according to a series of weight categories. Each value is read from the standard input using `scanf()`, and the result is output to standard output using `puts()`.

Here are some potential areas of optimization:

1. **Nested Conditional Operators:** The use of deeply nested conditional operators (`?:`) makes the code hard to read and understand. Instead, an array of structs can be used to map the weight ranges to their labels. This will also improve performance by reducing the number of comparisons.

2. **Input Reading:** The infinite loop with `scanf()` function can be optimized by using a while loop. It will make the code more readable and also optimize the performance by avoiding the bitwise NOT operation (~).

3. **Output Writing:** `puts()` function can be replaced with `printf()` function for better performance and control over the output.

Given these potential areas of optimization, here is the new optimized version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    float weight;
    const char* label;
} WeightCategory;

static const WeightCategory weightCategories[] = {
    {91, "heavy"},
    {81, "light heavy"},
    {75, "middle"},
    {69, "light middle"},
    {64, "welter"},
    {60, "light welter"},
    {57, "light"},
    {54, "feather"},
    {51, "bantam"},
    {48, "fly"},
    {0, "light fly"}
};

int main() {
    float f;
    while(scanf("%f", &f) != EOF) {
        for(int i = 0; i < sizeof(weightCategories) / sizeof(WeightCategory); i++) {
            if(f > weightCategories[i].weight) {
                printf("%s\n", weightCategories[i].label);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
In this code:

- An array of struct (`weightCategories[]`) is used to hold each weight range and its corresponding label.
- A while loop is used to read the input until the end of the file is reached.
- A for loop is used to loop through the `weightCategories[]` array until a matching category is found.
- `printf()` is used instead of `puts()` for better control over the output.
- The code readability is improved by using meaningful variables and struct names.
- This version of the code has fewer comparisons which improves performance, and it uses less memory because it doesn't need to store each string separately.
