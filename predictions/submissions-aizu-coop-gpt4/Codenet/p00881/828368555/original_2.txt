1. Code Analysis:
The given code is a recursive implementation of a search algorithm that divides a problem into two subproblems at each recursion level. The recursion is based on the 'm' bits of the input strings, and the function tries to partition the string indices into two disjoint sets such that each set has the same bits at the same positions.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. The current code uses std::map for memoization. We can use unordered_map instead of map because unordered_map provides O(1) access time which is faster than map's O(logN). This change can significantly improve performance.
    2. The code repeatedly calls make_pair to check and access elements in the map, which is redundant and inefficient. We can store the pair once and use it for both operations.
    3. The code is creating new vector instances in each recursive call which might be costly in terms of memory. We can avoid this by passing the start and end indices of the vector to the recursive function instead of passing the whole vectors.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Replace the map with an unordered_map. The unordered_map in C++ STL uses hashing, which makes access, search, and insertion operations faster as compared to map.
    2. Store the pair once and use it for both operations. This will save the time of repeatedly creating the same pair multiple times.
    3. Instead of creating new vector instances in each recursive call, we can pass the start and end indices of the vector to the recursive function. This helps in minimizing memory usage.
    
4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

unordered_map<pair<vector<int>, int>, int> mp;
string qes[128];

int search(vector<int> &vi, int start, int end, int depth, int used, int m, int n) {
  auto key = make_pair(vi, used);

  if (mp.count(key))
    return mp[key];
  if (end - start > (1 << (m - depth)))
    return 100;
  if (end - start == 1)
    return depth;

  int res = 100;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    if ((used >> i) & 1)
      continue;
    int mid = start;
    for (int j = start; j < end; j++) {
      if (qes[vi[j]][i] == '0')
        swap(vi[j], vi[mid++]);
    }
    if (mid == start || mid == end)
      continue;
    res = min(res, max(search(vi, start, mid, depth + 1, used | (1 << i), m, n),
                       search(vi, mid, end, depth + 1, used | (1 << i), m, n)));
  }
  return mp[key] = res;
}

int main() {
  int m, n;
  while (cin >> m >> n, m) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> qes[i];
    vector<int> vi(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      vi[i] = i;
    mp.clear();
    cout << search(vi, 0, n, 0, 0, m, n) << endl;
  }
}
