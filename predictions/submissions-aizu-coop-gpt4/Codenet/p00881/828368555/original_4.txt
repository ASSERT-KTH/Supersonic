Code Analysis:
The given code performs a search operation using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The function 'search' is being recursively called, which can lead to large stack memory usage when the size of the input increases. Also, the code uses a map to store the previous results which may take a lot of memory and time due to hashing and collision resolution.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Data Structure: We can use an unordered_map instead of map. Unordered_map typically has a constant-time complexity for search, insert and delete operations, but it may vary due to hash collisions. This change can improve the performance as the unordered_map is generally faster than map.

2. Redundant Computations: The same pair is being created multiple times in the 'search' function. We can create the pair once and use it in both the if condition and the return statement.

3. Recursive Calls: Since the function is recursively called, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP) to store the results of the subproblems and avoid re-computation, which can significantly reduce the execution time. 

4. Compiler Optimizations: Using the compiler flag -O3 can provide a significant speedup. This flag tells the compiler to perform multiple passes over the code to identify and optimize patterns that it recognizes.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. We will replace the map with an unordered_map. This should provide a performance boost as search, insert, and delete operations in an unordered_map have an average time complexity of O(1), compared to a map's O(log n).

2. We will create the pair only once and use it in the if condition and the return statement. This reduces the number of times the pair is created, thereby reducing the time taken for these operations.

3. We will use Dynamic Programming to store the results of the subproblems. This helps in avoiding re-computation of the same subproblems, thus saving computation time.

4. We will suggest using the compiler optimization flag -O3 to allow the compiler to perform a variety of optimizations on the code.

Trade-offs:
The use of unordered_map improves average case performance but can potentially degrade worst-case performance due to hash collisions. Also, the use of DP increases memory usage.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
unordered_map<pair<vector<int>, int>, int> mp;
string qes[128];

int search(vector<int> &vi, int depth, int used, int m, int n) {
  pair<vector<int>, int> p = make_pair(vi, used);
  if (mp.count(p))
    return mp[p];
  if (vi.size() > (1 << (m - depth)))
    return 100;
  if (vi.size() == 1)
    return depth;
  int res = 100;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    if ((used >> i) & 1)
      continue;
    vector<int> a, b;
    for (int j = 0; j < vi.size(); j++) {
      if (qes[vi[j]][i] == '0')
        a.push_back(vi[j]);
      else
        b.push_back(vi[j]);
    }
    if (a.empty() || b.empty())
      continue;
    res = min(res, max(search(a, depth + 1, used | (1 << i), m, n),
                       search(b, depth + 1, used | (1 << i), m, n)));
  }
  return mp[p] = res;
}

int main() {
  int m, n;
  while (cin >> m >> n, m) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> qes[i];
    vector<int> vi(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      vi[i] = i;
    mp.clear();
    cout << search(vi, 0, 0, m, n) << endl;
  }
}
```
Remember to compile the code with the -O3 flag for further optimization.
