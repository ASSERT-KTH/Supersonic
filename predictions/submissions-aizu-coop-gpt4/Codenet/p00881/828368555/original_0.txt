Here are the steps that we can follow to optimize the provided code:

## Code Analysis

1. Redundant computation of keys: The key `make_pair(vi, used)` is computed multiple times in the `search` function. We can avoid these redundant computations by storing the key in a variable.

2. Inefficient use of container: The `std::map` container offers a balance of efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. However, in this particular context, we're primarily interested in search operations, and the map's balanced tree structure could be overkill. We could consider using `std::unordered_map` instead, which offers average constant-time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.

3. Expensive copying of vector: In the `search` function, vectors `a` and `b` are passed by value, which means each recursive call involves copying the entire vector. This can be quite costly in terms of both time and space. We could avoid this by passing a reference to the vector, along with indices that specify the range of elements we're interested in.

## Optimization Strategy

1. Replace `std::map` with `std::unordered_map`: `std::unordered_map` provides average constant-time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations, which can significantly improve performance if the map contains a large number of elements.

2. Avoid redundant computations: Store the key `make_pair(vi, used)` in a variable to avoid redundant computations.

3. Avoid expensive copying of vectors: Pass a reference to the vector, along with indices that specify the range of elements we're interested in, instead of passing the entire vector by value.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Replace `std::map` with `std::unordered_map`: `std::unordered_map` uses a hash table under the hood, which allows for faster search operations compared to the balanced tree structure used by `std::map`. The trade-off here is that `std::unordered_map` requires more memory to store the hash table, and the time complexity of search operations can degrade to linear in the worst case.

2. Avoid redundant computations: By storing the key `make_pair(vi, used)` in a variable, we can avoid computing it multiple times. This can significantly improve performance, especially if the map contains a large number of elements. The trade-off here is that we need to use a little more memory to store the key.

3. Avoid expensive copying of vectors: By passing a reference to the vector, along with indices that specify the range of elements we're interested in, we can avoid copying the entire vector at each recursive call. This can significantly improve performance in terms of both time and space. The trade-off here is that the code becomes a bit more complex, as we need to manage the indices ourselves.

## Optimized Code Block

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
unordered_map<pair<vector<int>, int>, int> mp;
string qes[128];
int search(vector<int> &vi, int start, int end, int depth, int used, int m, int n) {
  pair<vector<int>, int> key = make_pair(vi, used);
  if (mp.count(key))
    return mp[key];
  if (end - start + 1 > (1 << (m - depth)))
    return 100;
  if (end - start + 1 == 1)
    return depth;
  int res = 100;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    if ((used >> i) & 1)
      continue;
    vector<int> a, b;
    for (int j = start; j <= end; j++) {
      if (qes[vi[j]][i] == '0')
        a.push_back(vi[j]);
      else
        b.push_back(vi[j]);
    }
    if (a.empty() || b.empty())
      continue;
    res = min(res, max(search(a, 0, a.size() - 1, depth + 1, used | (1 << i), m, n),
                       search(b, 0, b.size() - 1, depth + 1, used | (1 << i), m, n)));
  }
  return mp[key] = res;
}
int main() {
  int m, n;
  while (cin >> m >> n, m) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> qes[i];
    vector<int> vi(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      vi[i] = i;
    mp.clear();
    cout << search(vi, 0, vi.size() - 1, 0, 0, m, n) << endl;
  }
}
```

In this code, I've replaced `std::map` with `std::unordered_map` for faster search operations, stored the key `make_pair(vi, used)` in a variable to avoid redundant computations, and passed a reference to the vector, along with start and end indices, to avoid copying the entire vector at each recursive call.
