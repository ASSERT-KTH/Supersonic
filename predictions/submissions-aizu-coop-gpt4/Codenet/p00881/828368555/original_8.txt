Code Analysis:
The code performs a depth-first search on a binary decision tree. It uses a map to cache results to avoid repeated calculations. This map `mp` is used to store the result of the search for a given vector and depth. The function `search()` is recursive and explores different paths in the decision tree. This function is called repeatedly from the main function with different input vectors and depths.

However, there are several performance bottlenecks and inefficient operations in the code:

1. The function `search()` makes multiple calls to `make_pair()`, which creates unnecessary pair objects. 

2. The function `search()` repeatedly checks if a pair is in the map `mp` using `mp.count()`. This operation is inefficient because it searches for the pair in the map twice: once to check if it's present and again to retrieve its value.

3. The function `search()` also repeatedly creates and destroys vectors `a` and `b`, which leads to inefficient memory usage.

4. The data structure `map<pair<vector<int>, int>, int> mp` is inefficient for lookup operations, which are performed often in this code, resulting in higher time complexity.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the map with an unordered map, which has average constant-time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups.

2. Avoid multiple calls to `make_pair()`. Instead, create a pair once and reuse it.

3. Avoid repeated checks and retrievals from the map by using a single operation to check the presence and get the value of an element.

4. Preallocate vectors `a` and `b`, and clear them instead of destroying and recreating them.

5. Avoid using global variables where possible. Instead, pass them as function parameters.

Optimization Steps:

1. Replace `map<pair<vector<int>, int>, int> mp` with `unordered_map<pair<vector<int>, int>, int, pair_hash> mp`. Here, `pair_hash` is a custom hash function for pairs of vector and int.

2. In the `search()` function, create a `pair<vector<int>, int> key = make_pair(vi, used);` and use this key for all subsequent operations involving this pair.

3. Use the `insert()` member function to check for an element's presence and get its value in a single operation.

4. Preallocate vectors `a` and `b` before the loop, and clear them at the beginning of each iteration.

5. Pass `mp` and `qes` as parameters to the `search()` function instead of using them as global variables.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

struct pair_hash {
    template <class T1, class T2>
    std::size_t operator () (const std::pair<T1,T2> &p) const {
        auto h1 = std::hash<T1>{}(p.first);
        auto h2 = std::hash<T2>{}(p.second); 
        return h1 ^ h2;  
    }
};

int search(unordered_map<pair<vector<int>, int>, int, pair_hash> &mp, vector<string> &qes, vector<int> &vi, int depth, int used, int m, int n) {
  pair<vector<int>, int> key = make_pair(vi, used);
  auto it = mp.insert({key, 100});
  if (!it.second)
    return it.first->second;
  if (vi.size() > (1 << (m - depth)))
    return 100;
  if (vi.size() == 1)
    return depth;
  int res = 100;
  vector<int> a, b;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    a.clear(); b.clear();
    if ((used >> i) & 1)
      continue;
    for (int j = 0; j < vi.size(); j++) {
      if (qes[vi[j]][i] == '0')
        a.push_back(vi[j]);
      else
        b.push_back(vi[j]);
    }
    if (a.empty() || b.empty())
      continue;
    res = min(res, max(search(mp, qes, a, depth + 1, used | (1 << i), m, n),
                       search(mp, qes, b, depth + 1, used | (1 << i), m, n)));
  }
  return it.first->second = res;
}

int main() {
  int m, n;
  while (cin >> m >> n, m) {
    vector<string> qes(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> qes[i];
    vector<int> vi(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      vi[i] = i;
    unordered_map<pair<vector<int>, int>, int, pair_hash> mp;
    cout << search(mp, qes, vi, 0, 0, m, n) << endl;
  }
}
```

Trade-offs: The optimized code is slightly more complex due to the custom hash function and the use of `unordered_map::insert()`. However, the performance gain from these changes is significant.
