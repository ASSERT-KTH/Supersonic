Code Analysis:
The given code is a simple C++ program, which reads an integer n and then n lines of i, p, q values. It maintains a mapping from integer i to a sum of product of p and q. If the sum is greater than or equal to one million for any i, it prints i. If no such i exists, it prints "NA". 

The main performance bottlenecks in the code are:

1. Use of map::find in the loop. Since it's guaranteed that vec[i] exists in the map, this operation is unnecessary and costly.
2. Use of std::vector for storing i values. This incurs unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation while resizing the vector.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use auto iterator instead of map::find: Instead of using map::find to get the iterator pointing to the element, we can directly use auto iterator in the for loop. This will reduce the time complexity from O(log n) to O(1).
2. Use std::array instead of std::vector: Since the maximum size of the array is known in advance (the value of n), std::array can be used to store the i values instead of std::vector. This will avoid unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation.
3. Use early exit: If a qualifying i is found, the program can terminate early without checking the rest of the elements.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. The use of auto iterator instead of map::find: This reduces the time complexity from O(log n) to O(1) because we are iterating over the elements of the map directly. The trade-off is that we have to ensure that the element exists in the map before accessing it, which is guaranteed in this case.

2. The use of std::array instead of std::vector: This reduces the memory usage because std::array does not need to dynamically resize like std::vector. The trade-off is that we have to know the maximum size of the array in advance, which is known in this case.

3. The use of early exit: This can significantly reduce the running time in case a qualifying i is found early. The trade-off is that we can't print all qualifying i's, but this is acceptable because the original code also prints only the first qualifying i.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <array>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, i;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    map<int, long long> m;
    array<int, 100> arr; // assuming n <= 100
    int size = 0;
    long long p, q;
    while (n--) {
      cin >> i >> p >> q;
      if (!m[i])
        arr[size++] = i;
      m[i] += p * q;
    }
    for (int j = 0; j < size; j++) {
      auto it = m.lower_bound(arr[j]); // get iterator directly
      if (it->second >= 1000000) {
        cout << it->first << endl;
        return 0; // early exit
      }
    }
    cout << "NA" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
