The code is essentially inputting multiple sets of data. For each set of data, it inputs a series of triples (i, p, q), then for each unique 'i' value, it accumulates the product 'p*q', storing it in a map 'm'. 

Then it checks for each unique 'i' value, if the accumulated product is more than or equal to 1,000,000. If there is such 'i', it prints 'i' and sets 's' as 1. If no 'i' satisfies the condition, it prints 'NA'.

Here are the optimization strategies:

1. **Data Structures:** We are using both a map and vector to keep track of the unique 'i' values. The map is used to calculate the total product for each 'i', while the vector is used to remember the order of the 'i' values. This is inefficient as each insert into the map and the vector takes extra time and space. We should only use the map which can also keep track of the insertion order since C++11.

2. **Redundant Computation:** The find operation inside the loop is unnecessary because we are guaranteed that the key will be present in the map. This operation takes logarithmic time in the size of the map, which slows down the program.

3. **Loop Optimization:** We can combine the two while loops into one, saving the overhead of looping over the data twice. 

4. **Compiler Optimization:** We could use compiler optimizations like O2 or O3, but these are usually not recommended as they may lead to unexpected behavior.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, i;
    long long p, q;

    while (cin >> n, n) {
        map<int, long long> m;
        bool s = false;

        while (n--) {
            cin >> i >> p >> q;
            m[i] += p * q;
            if (m[i] >= 1000000 && !s) {
                s = true;
                cout << i << endl;
            }
        }

        if (!s)
            cout << "NA" << endl;
    }
}
```

In this optimized version, we've removed the vector 'vec' and combined the two loops into one. This reduces memory usage and improves performance. We also eliminated the redundant map find operation. This code maintains the functionality of the original code and should run faster and use less memory.
