1. **Code Analysis:** The provided C++ program is reading an integer `n` as input and then reading `n` tuples of integers. For each tuple, it multiplies the second and third integers and adds the result to a map using the first integer as key. Finally, it checks if any value in the map is equal to or greater than 1000000, and if so, it prints its corresponding key. If no such value is found, it prints "NA". 

2. **Optimization Strategy:** 

    1. **Inefficient data structures:** Here, the map and vector are used efficiently. However, the map's find operation can be avoided.

    2. **Redundant or unnecessary computations:** The map's find operation is unnecessary because we already know that the key exists in the map.

    3. **Loops or recursive calls:** The for loop that iterates over the vector can be optimized by using a range-based for loop.

    4. **Compiler optimizations or pragma directives:** Compiler optimizations can be used to further optimize the code. For example, the `-O2` or `-O3` optimization level can be used when compiling the code.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

    1. **Remove the map's find operation:** The current code uses the map's find operation to get an iterator to the key-value pair in the map. This operation is unnecessary because we know that the key exists in the map. So, we can directly access the value using the key. This will improve performance because the map's find operation has a time complexity of O(log n), while directly accessing the value has a time complexity of O(1). The trade-off is that if the key does not exist in the map, it will be created with a default value. However, we know that the key exists in the map because we have added it before.

    2. **Use a range-based for loop:** The current code uses a traditional for loop to iterate over the vector. We can use a range-based for loop instead. This will improve performance because the compiler can optimize the loop more effectively. The trade-off is that the code becomes a little less explicit.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, i;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    map<int, long long> m;
    vector<int> vec;
    long long p, q, s = 0;
    while (n--) {
      cin >> i >> p >> q;
      if (!m[i])
        vec.push_back(i);
      m[i] += p * q;
    }
    for (const auto& i : vec) {  // Use a range-based for loop.
      if (m[i] >= 1000000) {  // Directly access the value using the key.
        s = 1;
        cout << i << endl;
      }
    }
    if (!s)
      cout << "NA" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Remember to compile the code with `-O2` or `-O3` optimization level for further performance improvement.
