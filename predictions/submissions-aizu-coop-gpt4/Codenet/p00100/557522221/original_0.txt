1. Code Analysis: The given C++ code block is reading input pairs of integers, multiplying them and maintaining a sum of these products for each unique first integer. It keeps track of these sums in a map and also stores every unique first integer in a vector. After all the input pairs are processed, the code iterates over the vector and checks the corresponding sums in the map. If a sum is greater than or equal to 1000000, it prints the associated integer, otherwise, it prints "NA".

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. Inefficient data structures: One inefficiency comes from the use of the vector 'vec' to store the unique keys of the map. We can completely avoid this vector by simply iterating over the map entries.
   2. Redundant computations: The code unnecessarily searches the map entries for 'vec[i]' in the second loop. Since we are iterating over the vector and the vector contains the keys of the map, there's no need to use the find function.
   3. No loops or recursive calls could be optimized here.
   4. Compiler optimizations: To ensure better optimization, we could use the -O3 flag during compilation. This flag tells the compiler to perform all optimizations and can drastically improve the performance of the code.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Remove the vector 'vec'. This will reduce memory usage, as we won't be storing the keys of the map in a separate data structure.
    2. Instead of iterating over the vector, iterate directly over the map. This will remove the need for the find function, which would improve the performance as we no longer need to search for the key in the map.
    3. The trade-off in this optimization is that we may lose the original order of the input integers. This is because maps in C++ are ordered by their keys, and our input integers may not be in ascending order. However, if maintaining the original order is not important, this optimization will improve both time and space efficiency.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, i;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    map<int, long long> m;
    long long p, q, s = 0;
    while (n--) {
      cin >> i >> p >> q;
      m[i] += p * q;
    }
    for (auto const& [key, value] : m) {
      if (value >= 1000000) {
        s = 1;
        cout << key << endl;
      }
    }
    if (!s)
      cout << "NA" << endl;
  }
}
```
In this optimized code, we've eliminated the vector 'vec', and instead of iterating over the vector and then searching in the map, we're directly iterating over the map. This reduces memory usage and improves the performance.
