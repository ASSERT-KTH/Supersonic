# Code Analysis:

This program performs the following tasks:

1. Reads a series of numbers from the standard input. The first number, `n`, is used to determine how many subsequent numbers to read. If `n` is 0, the program ends.
2. The program then reads `n` numbers, storing their sum in `s` and the last one in `a`.
3. After that, it reads `n-1` more numbers into an array `j`. The last number read is discarded.
4. The array `j` is sorted in ascending order.
5. The program then calculates the maximum of `n * s` and `a` for each `n` from `n` to 1, updating `a` with the maximum each time. The sum of `s` and `j[n]` is also calculated for each `n`.

# Optimization Strategy:

1. **Avoid unnecessary reading of `n-1` numbers into array `j`:** Instead of reading `n-1` numbers and discarding the last one, we can read `n-2` numbers into array `j`, and read the last number into `a`. This will save memory and make the program run faster.

2. **Use efficient data structures:** The array `j` is sorted in every iteration. Sorting an array is an expensive operation (O(n log n) complexity). We can use a priority queue instead of an array to efficiently get the maximum value at each iteration (O(log n) complexity).

3. **Minimize redundant computations:** The calculation of `n * s` is done in every iteration, but `s` doesn't change within the loop. It can be calculated once outside the loop and reused.

4. **Compiler optimizations:** We can use compiler flags to enable optimizations. For example, `-O3` enables all optimization levels, `-march=native` enables all instruction subsets supported by the local machine, and `-flto` enables link time optimization.

# Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Read `n-2` numbers into array `j`, and the last number into `a`: This saves memory and reduces the number of reads from the standard input.

2. Use a priority queue instead of an array `j`: This allows us to efficiently get the maximum value at each iteration without sorting the entire array.

3. Calculate `n * s` once outside the loop: This prevents redundant computations and makes the program run faster.

4. Use compiler flags to enable optimizations: This can significantly improve the performance of the program.

# Trade-offs:

These optimizations make the code slightly more complex, but they significantly improve the performance and efficiency of the program.

# Optimized Code Block:

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

main() {
  priority_queue<long long> q;
  for (long long i, n, s, a;; cout << a << endl) {
    cin >> n;
    if (!n)
      break;
    for (i = s = 0; i < n - 2; i++) {
      cin >> a;
      s += a;
      q.push(a);
    }
    cin >> a;
    s += a;
    long long max_product = n * s;
    for (; n > 1; n--) {
      s += q.top();
      q.pop();
      max_product = max(n * s, max_product);
    }
    a = max_product;
  }
}
```
To compile this program with optimizations, use the following command:

```
g++ -O3 -march=native -flto -o program program.cpp
```
