Code Analysis:
The provided code appears to be a C++ program that takes a series of numbers as input, performs some calculations on them, and then outputs the results. The code has several potential performance bottlenecks and areas for improvement:

1. The use of cin and cout for input and output can be slow compared to other methods.
2. The code sorts the array j[] after reading the input which could be avoided if the input is already sorted.
3. Each iteration of the last loop calculates the maximum of all previous results which can be avoided by using a variable to keep track of the maximum value.
4. The code uses long long for all variables, this could be unnecessarily consuming memory if the values can be guaranteed to be smaller.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace cin and cout with faster input and output methods.
2. Use priority queue to avoid sorting the array.
3. Keep track of the maximum value to avoid unnecessary comparisons.
4. Use appropriate data type for variables.

Step-by-step Explanation:

1. I/O operations can be a major bottleneck in C++ if not handled properly. One way to improve I/O operations is to use the faster scanf/printf functions instead of cin/cout.

2. The sort operation in the code can be avoided by using a priority queue data structure. This would allow the code to access the smallest or largest element in constant time, instead of having to sort the entire array.

3. In the last loop, the maximum of all previous results is calculated. This can be avoided by keeping a variable max_val to track the maximum value so far.

4. All variables are declared as long long, which is a 64-bit integer. This may be unnecessarily consuming memory if the values can be guaranteed to be smaller. If the values of the variables are guaranteed to be less than 2^31 - 1, we can safely use int instead of long long.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  priority_queue<int> pq;
  int n, a, s, max_val;
  while (scanf("%d", &n) != EOF && n) {
    s = max_val = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      scanf("%d", &a);
      s += a;
      pq.push(a);
    }
    while (!pq.empty()) {
      a = pq.top();
      pq.pop();
      max_val = max(max_val, n * s);
      s -= a;
      --n;
    }
    printf("%d\n", max_val);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version of the code, scanf and printf are used instead of cin and cout. A priority queue is used to avoid the need to sort the array, and a variable max_val is used to keep track of the maximum value, avoiding the need to calculate the maximum in each iteration of the loop. All variables are declared as int, reducing the memory usage of the program.
