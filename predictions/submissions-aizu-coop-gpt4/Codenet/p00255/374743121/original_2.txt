Code Analysis: 

This C++ program reads an integer (n) from the input until it encounters a zero, at which point it breaks the loop and ends. For each n, it reads n numbers from the input two times, with the second set of numbers being stored in an array (j). The program then sorts this array and performs some calculations involving the array elements and the previously read numbers. 

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:

1. The array j has a fixed size of 99999, which may be wasteful if n is usually much smaller than this.
2. The program reads the input twice for each n, which is unnecessary duplication of effort.
3. The array j is sorted for each n, which can be inefficient if n is large.
4. For each n, the program performs a calculation involving all elements of the array j, which can be time-consuming if n is large.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the array j with a dynamic data structure, such as a vector, to avoid wasting memory when n is small.
2. Read the input once for each n and store the numbers in the vector.
3. Use a sorting algorithm with good average-case complexity, such as quicksort or heapsort, to sort the vector.
4. Try to reduce the number of calculations involving the vector elements, for example by accumulating the sum while reading the input.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the array j with a vector. The vector will automatically resize itself as needed, saving memory when n is small. This change will require modifying the code to use vector methods instead of array operations.

2. Read the input once for each n and store the numbers in the vector. This will eliminate the need to read the input twice, which will save time.

3. Use the sort function from the algorithm library to sort the vector. This function uses the introsort algorithm, which is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from quicksort and heapsort, with a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). This change will not require any modifications to the code, as the sort function can be used with vectors in the same way as with arrays.

4. Accumulate the sum while reading the input. This will reduce the number of calculations involving the vector elements, saving time.

Trade-offs:

These optimizations will make the code more efficient in terms of time and memory usage, but they will also make it slightly more complex. The use of a vector instead of an array and the accumulation of the sum while reading the input are both common techniques in C++, but they may be unfamiliar to beginners.

Optimized Code Block:

```C++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  for (long long i, n, s, a; cin >> n && n != 0; cout << a << endl) {
    vector<long long> j(n);
    for (i = s = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> a;
      s += a;
      j[i] = a;
    }
    sort(j.begin(), j.end());
    for (a = 0; n > 0; s += j[n])
      a = max(n-- * s, a);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, the array j has been replaced with a vector of the same name. The input is read once for each n and the numbers are stored in the vector. The sum of the numbers is accumulated while reading the input. The vector is then sorted using the sort function from the algorithm library, and the calculations involving the vector elements are performed as before.
