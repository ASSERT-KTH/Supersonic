The given C++ code seems inefficient in several ways. Here are the issues I found along with the proposed optimizations:

1. **Code Analysis:**

   a. The code uses a global array `j[99999]` without any bound checks. This may lead to an out-of-bound error if `n` is larger than 99999.
   
   b. The second and third loops are separated, we could combine them to reduce the number of operations.
   
   c. The code uses `std::sort` on each iteration. This is a costly operation in terms of time complexity. 

2. **Optimization Strategy:**

   a. Replace the global array with a vector. This allows dynamic size adjustment and bound checking.
   
   b. Combine the second and third loops to reduce the number of operations.
   
   c. Use a priority queue instead of sorting the entire vector on each iteration. A priority queue keeps the elements in sorted order and has a time complexity of O(log n) for insertion and removal. This is more efficient than sorting the entire vector in each iteration.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

   a. We replace the global array `j` with a vector `jVec`. This allows us to create a dynamic array with size `n` and avoid out-of-bound errors. The trade-off is a slight increase in memory usage, but this is negligible compared to the benefits.
   
   b. We combine the second and third loops. This reduces the number of iterations from 2n to n.
   
   c. We replace the sorting operation with a priority queue. This reduces the time complexity from O(n log n) to O(log n) for each insertion and removal. The trade-off is a slight increase in code complexity, but the performance gain is significant.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  while (true) {
    long long n, s = 0, a;
    cin >> n;
    if (n == 0) break;
    
    vector<long long> jVec(n);
    priority_queue<long long> pq;

    for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> a;
      s += a;
      cin >> jVec[i];
      pq.push(jVec[i]);
    }

    a = 0;
    while (!pq.empty()) {
      a = max(n-- * s, a);
      s += pq.top();
      pq.pop();
    }
    cout << a << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code is a minimal change from the original one, preserves the functionality, and significantly improves performance.
