The given program reads a series of numbers from the input, performs some operations on them, and outputs the results. The main parts of the code that can be optimized are the loops, redundant computations, and inefficient data structure usage.

1. Code Analysis:
The code primarily consists of three loops - one for reading inputs, another for storing inputs into an array, and the last one for computation and determining the maximum value. The array size is fixed at 99999, which can be inefficient if the number of inputs is significantly smaller than this.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Use Dynamic Memory Allocation: The static allocation of the array is inefficient. Use dynamic memory allocation such as std::vector to create an array that fits the number of inputs.
    2. Avoid Redundant Computations: The program computes `n-- * s` multiple times, which is unnecessary. We can store the result and update it only when necessary.
    3. Optimize Loops: The program uses three separate loops to read the inputs, store them in an array, and perform computations. These operations can be condensed into fewer loops to increase efficiency.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Dynamic Memory Allocation: Instead of using a fixed-size array, use a std::vector to store the inputs. This structure automatically adjusts its size to fit the number of elements, improving memory usage.
    2. Avoid Redundant Computations: Instead of repeatedly calculating `n-- * s`, store the result in a variable and update it only when necessary. This avoids redundant computations and increases performance.
    3. Optimize Loops: Instead of using three separate loops, the input reading and storing can be done in the same loop, and the computation can be done in another loop. This reduces the number of iterations and improves performance.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  long long n, s, a, result;
  vector<long long> j;

  while (true) {
    cin >> n;
    if (!n)
      break;

    j.resize(n);
    for (long long i = 0, s = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> a;
      s += a;
      if (i != 0)
        cin >> j[i];
    }

    sort(j.begin(), j.end());

    result = n * s;
    for (long long i = n - 1; i > 0; --i) {
      s -= j[i];
      result = max(result, i * s);
    }

    cout << result << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, a vector is used instead of a fixed-size array, redundant computations are removed, and the loops are optimized to reduce the number of iterations. These changes improve the performance and memory usage of the program.
