The given code is a maze solving algorithm. It recursively navigates through a 2D array `C[102][102]` (which represents a grid/maze), starting from a specific point `(xs, ys)`. If the destination point `(xg, yg)` is reachable, it prints "OK", else it prints "NG". 

There are several ways to optimize this code:

1. **Avoiding Global Variables:** In the current code, `C[102][102]` is a global variable. Using global variables is usually not a good practice as it can lead to code that is hard to understand and debug. It's better to pass it as a parameter to the function.

2. **Optimizing the Recursive Function:** The given code uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) to navigate the grid. This can lead to a stack overflow if the grid is large, because each recursive call adds a level to the stack. An iterative approach using a stack would avoid this issue and also eliminate the overhead of recursive calls.

3. **Optimizing Input/Output Operations:** If the code is intended to be used for large inputs, it might benefit from faster input/output operations. In such cases, using `scanf` and `printf` can be faster than `cin` and `cout`.

4. **Avoiding Redundant Computations:** In the main loop, the 2D array `C` is filled with a value of `10` in every iteration. Instead, we can initialize it once and then only update the necessary cells based on the input. 

5. **Optimizing Data Structures:** The 2D array `C` is larger than needed. We can declare it based on the maximum of `w` and `h`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <stack>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

void meiro(int W, int H, int c, vector<vector<int>>& C){
    stack<pair<int, int>> stk;
    stk.push({W, H});

    while(!stk.empty()){
        int x = stk.top().first;
        int y = stk.top().second;
        stk.pop();

        if(x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= W || y >= H || C[x][y] != c) 
            continue;

        C[x][y] = -1;
        stk.push({x-1, y});
        stk.push({x, y+1});
        stk.push({x+1, y});
        stk.push({x, y-1});
    }
}

int main(){
    while(true){
        int w, h;
        scanf("%d %d", &w, &h);
        if(w == 0 && h == 0) 
            break;

        vector<vector<int>> C(max(w,h), vector<int>(max(w,h), 10));

        int xs, ys, xg, yg;
        scanf("%d %d %d %d", &xs, &ys, &xg, &yg);

        int n;
        scanf("%d", &n);

        int c, d, x, y;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            scanf("%d %d %d %d", &c, &d, &x, &y);
            if (d == 0) {
                for (int j = x; j < x + 4; j++) {
                    for (int k = y; k < y + 2; k++) {
                        C[j][k] = c;
                    }
                }
            } else {
                for (int j = x; j < x + 2; j++) {
                    for (int k = y; k < y + 4; k++) {
                        C[j][k] = c;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        meiro(xs, ys, C[xs][ys], C);

        if (C[xg][yg] == -1) {
            printf("OK\n");
        } else {
            printf("NG\n");
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:
- The use of stack increases memory usage compared to recursion, but it avoids the risk of stack overflow for large inputs.
- Using `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout` makes the code less readable, but it can significantly improve performance for large inputs.
- Using vector instead of a 2D array makes the code a bit more complex, but it allows us to only allocate the necessary memory.
