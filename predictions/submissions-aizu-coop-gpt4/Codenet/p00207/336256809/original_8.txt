Code Analysis:
1. The code first reads two integers, `w` and `h`. If both are zero, the program ends.
2. Then, it initializes a 2D array `C` with a size of 102x102 and fills all elements with 10. 
3. It reads four more integers, `xs`, `ys`, `xg`, `yg`. Then, it reads another integer `n`.
4. Depending on the value of `d`, it fills a 4x2 or 2x4 area in `C` with the value of `c`.
5. The `meiro` function is then called, which recursively visits all neighbours of a given cell that have the same value as the cell itself and sets them to -1.
6. If the cell at `C[xg][yg]` is -1, it prints "OK". Otherwise, it prints "NG".

Optimization Strategy:
1. The `meiro` function is recursive, which may lead to a stack overflow if the recursion depth becomes too large. We can convert this recursive function into an iterative one using a stack to avoid this problem.
2. The initialization of the array `C` can be optimized to only initialize the required cells instead of the whole array.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. The `meiro` function can be converted from recursive to iterative using a stack. This will prevent potential stack overflow errors if the recursion depth becomes too large. The stack will store pairs of integers representing the `W` and `H` values. We will use a loop that continues until the stack is empty. In each iteration, it pops a pair from the stack, and if the current cell value is `c`, it sets the value to -1 and pushes the neighbour cells onto the stack. This is equivalent to the recursive function but avoids the potential for stack overflow.

2. The array `C` is initialized with all elements set to 10. This initialization can be optimized to only initialize the cells that are required. Since the range of `x` and `y` values are read from the input, we can initialize only the cells that will be used instead of the whole array.

Trade-offs:
1. The iterative version of the `meiro` function is slightly more complex than the recursive version due to the explicit use of a stack. However, the benefit of avoiding potential stack overflow errors outweighs the slight increase in complexity.
2. Optimizing the initialization of the array `C` increases the complexity of the code slightly since we need to track the range of cells that need to be initialized. However, this can significantly reduce the amount of memory operations, leading to a speedup in the program.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

  stack<pair<int, int>> stk;
  stk.push({W, H});

  while (!stk.empty()) {
    pair<int, int> p = stk.top();
    stk.pop();

    int W = p.first, H = p.second;
    if (C[W][H] != c) {
      continue;
    }

    C[W][H] = -1;
    stk.push({W - 1, H});
    stk.push({W, H + 1});
    stk.push({W + 1, H});
    stk.push({W, H - 1});
  }
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    int w, h;
    cin >> w >> h;
    if (w == 0 && h == 0) {
      break;
    }

    int xmin = 101, ymin = 101, xmax = 0, ymax = 0;

    int xs, ys, xg, yg;
    cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;
    xmin = min(xmin, min(xs, xg));
    ymin = min(ymin, min(ys, yg));
    xmax = max(xmax, max(xs, xg));
    ymax = max(ymax, max(ys, yg));

    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int c, d, x, y;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
      xmin = min(xmin, x);
      ymin = min(ymin, y);
      if (d == 0) {
        xmax = max(xmax, x + 4);
        ymax = max(ymax, y + 2);
        for (int j = x; j < x + 4; j++) {
          for (int k = y; k < y + 2; k++) {
            C[j][k] = c;
          }
        }
      } else {
        xmax = max(xmax, x + 2);
        ymax = max(ymax, y + 4);
        for (int j = x; j < x + 2; j++) {
          for (int k = y; k < y + 4; k++) {
            C[j][k] = c;
          }
        }
      }
    }

    for (int i = xmin; i <= xmax; i++) {
      for (int j = ymin; j <= ymax; j++) {
        if (i < xmin || i > xmax || j < ymin || j > ymax) {
          C[i][j] = 10;
        }
      }
    }

    meiro(xs, ys, C[xs][ys]);
    if (C[xg][yg] == -1) {
      cout << "OK" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "NG" << endl;
    }

  return 0;
