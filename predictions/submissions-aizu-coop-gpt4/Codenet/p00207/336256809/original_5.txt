Code Analysis:
The given program is a simple maze solver, which uses a recursive function "meiro" to find a path in the maze. The maze is input by the user and is represented as a 2D integer array "C". The program checks if we can go from a start point (xs, ys) to an end point (xg, yg) in the maze. 

Before we dive into optimizing the code, let's identify what might be causing performance issues:

1. The function "meiro" uses recursion, which could lead to a stack overflow if the recursion depth is too large. This can slow down the program, or even cause it to crash in the worst-case scenario. The recursion is also not tail-optimized.

2. The nested for loops in the main function, which are used to fill the maze array "C", could be optimized to reduce redundancy and improve loop performance.

3. The size of the array "C" is constant (102x102). This is inefficient if the size of the maze is consistently smaller than this, as it wastes memory.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Convert recursive calls in the "meiro" function to iterative using a stack. This will prevent potential stack overflow issues and improve performance.

2. The nested for loops in the main function can be replaced with a call to std::fill function, which is a more efficient way to fill an array.

3. Instead of using a constant size for the array "C", we can use dynamic memory allocation to create an array that matches the size of the maze. This can significantly reduce memory usage if the size of the maze is consistently smaller than 102x102.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef pair<int, int> pii;

void meiro(vector<vector<int>>& C, int W, int H, int c) {
    stack<pii> s;
    s.push({W, H});

    while (!s.empty()) {
        pii p = s.top(); s.pop();
        int W = p.first, H = p.second;

        if (C[W][H] != c)
            continue;

        C[W][H] = -1;

        s.push({W - 1, H});
        s.push({W, H + 1});
        s.push({W + 1, H});
        s.push({W, H - 1});
    }
}

int main() {
    while (1) {
        int w, h;
        cin >> w >> h;
        if (w == 0 && h == 0)
            break;

        vector<vector<int>> C(w + 2, vector<int>(h + 2, 10));

        int xs, ys, xg, yg;
        cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        int c, d, x, y;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
            for (int j = x; j < (d == 0 ? x + 4 : x + 2); j++) {
                fill(C[j].begin() + y, C[j].begin() + y + (d == 0 ? 2 : 4), c);
            }
        }

        meiro(C, xs, ys, C[xs][ys]);
        if (C[xg][yg] == -1)
            cout << "OK" << endl;
        else
            cout << "NG" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
The optimized code uses a stack to convert the recursion to iteration, the std::fill function to fill array elements, and dynamic memory allocation to create a 2D array that matches the size of the maze. This version of the code should run faster and use less memory than the original version.
