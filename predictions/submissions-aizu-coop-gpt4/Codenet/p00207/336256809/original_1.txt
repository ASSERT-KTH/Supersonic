The code is a simulation of a maze where it recursively checks if it is possible to reach the goal from the start while moving through the maze, which consists of elements with certain values.

1. Code Analysis:
The recursive function `meiro` can cause a stack overflow if the size of the grid is large. This is because each recursive call is added to the system stack until it reaches the base case. If the recursion tree is very deep, it could exceed the systemâ€™s stack limit.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. The recursive function `meiro` can be replaced by an iterative approach using a stack or queue. This will prevent the possibility of a stack overflow.
    2. The initialization of the array `C` can be optimized by using `memset` which is faster than the double `for` loop.
    3. Use of `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up the I/O operations.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Convert the recursive function into an iterative one using a stack. This will prevent stack overflow during deep recursion and make the code more efficient.
    2. Use `memset` to initialize the array. It is an in-built function in C/C++ and is faster than using loops.
    3. I/O operations are a bit slow in C++. By adding `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);`, we can make I/O operations faster and bring them closer to the speed of scanf/printf.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int C[102][102];
int dx[4] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
int dy[4] = {0, 1, 0, -1};

void meiro(int W, int H, int c) {
    stack<pair<int, int>> st;
    st.push({W, H});

    while (!st.empty()) {
        auto [x, y] = st.top();
        st.pop();
        if (C[x][y] != c)
            continue;

        C[x][y] = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int nx = x + dx[i], ny = y + dy[i];
            if (nx >= 0 && nx < 102 && ny >= 0 && ny < 102)
                st.push({nx, ny});
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    while (1) {
        int w, h;
        cin >> w >> h;
        if (w == 0 && h == 0)
            break;

        memset(C, 10, sizeof(C));

        int xs, ys, xg, yg;
        cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        int c, d, x, y;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
            if (d == 0) {
                for (int j = x; j < x + 4; j++)
                    for (int k = y; k < y + 2; k++)
                        C[j][k] = c;
            } else {
                for (int j = x; j < x + 2; j++)
                    for (int k = y; k < y + 4; k++)
                        C[j][k] = c;
            }
        }

        meiro(xs, ys, C[xs][ys]);
        if (C[xg][yg] == -1)
            cout << "OK" << endl;
        else
            cout << "NG" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This optimized code will run faster and is less likely to cause a stack overflow due to recursion. However, it uses more memory to store the stack in the `meiro` function. This is a trade-off between memory usage and preventing stack overflow.
