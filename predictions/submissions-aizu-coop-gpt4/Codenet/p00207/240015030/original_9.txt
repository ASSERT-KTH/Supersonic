Code Analysis:

This program performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) on a grid represented by a 2D matrix 'Board'. The search starts at the specified start point (xs, ys) and ends at the goal point (xg, yg). The DFS function is called recursively for all four directions (up, down, left, right) from the current point. 

Potential performance bottlenecks include:

1. Redundant computation: The DFS function is called recursively for all four directions without checking if the next point is within the grid. This means a significant number of function calls might be wasted on exploring outside of the grid.

2. Inefficient memory usage: The 'Board' matrix is larger than necessary. The dimensions are set to 102x102 but the input only specifies the width and height.

3. Recursive implementation of DFS: The recursive implementation of DFS can cause a large stack depth, especially for large inputs.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Avoid redundant computation: Check if the next point is within the grid before making a recursive call in DFS.

2. Optimize memory usage: Adjust the size of the 'Board' matrix to match the input dimensions.

3. Convert recursive DFS to iterative: Implement DFS using a stack data structure to prevent large stack depth due to recursion.

4. Compiler optimizations: Use compiler flags to optimize the code. For example, the -O3 flag can be used with g++ to enable all optimization levels.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Avoiding Redundant Computation:
    - Before making a recursive call in DFS, check if the next point (x+1, y), (x, y+1), (x-1, y), (x, y-1) is within the grid boundary. This can be done by adding an 'if' condition to check if the point lies within the grid.
    - This will significantly reduce the number of function calls, thus improving the runtime.

2. Optimizing Memory Usage:
    - Currently, the 'Board' matrix has a fixed size of 102x102 which is inefficient if the input grid is smaller.
    - To optimize memory usage, dynamically allocate the 'Board' matrix based on the input dimensions 'w' and 'h'.
    - This will minimize the memory footprint of the program.

3. Converting Recursive DFS to Iterative:
    - Instead of using recursion, DFS can be implemented using a stack data structure. This will prevent a large stack depth which can cause a stack overflow for large inputs.
    - Push the start point (xs, ys) to the stack.
    - While the stack is not empty, pop the top point. If it is the goal point, set 'isOK' to true and break from the loop. Otherwise, push the valid neighbors to the stack.
    - This will improve the runtime by avoiding recursion and also prevent potential stack overflow issues.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
    - Using the -O3 flag with g++ compiler will enable all optimization levels. This can optimize the code further by performing operations such as loop unrolling and function inlining.

Trade-offs:
    - Checking grid boundary before each recursive call in DFS may slightly increase the size of the code but it will significantly reduce the number of function calls.
    - Dynamically allocating the 'Board' matrix will require additional code for memory management but it will optimize memory usage.
    - The iterative implementation of DFS will increase the complexity of the code as compared to the recursive implementation but it will prevent potential stack overflow issues and improve the runtime.
    - Using compiler optimization flags can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior but in most cases, it will enhance the performance of the code. 

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

bool isOK;
int xs, ys, xg, yg;

struct Point {
  int x, y;
};

void DFS(vector<vector<int>>& Board, int c) {
  stack<Point> s;
  s.push({xs, ys});
  int h = Board.size(), w = Board[0].size();

  while (!s.empty()) {
    Point p = s.top();
    s.pop();

    if (p.x < 0 || p.y < 0 || p.x >= w || p.y >= h || Board[p.y][p.x] != c)
      continue;

    if (p.x == xg && p.y == yg) {
      isOK = true;
      break;
    }

    Board[p.y][p.x] = 0;

    s.push({p.x + 1, p.y});
    s.push({p.x, p.y + 1});
    s.push({p.x - 1, p.y});
    s.push({p.x, p.y - 1});
  }
}

int main() {
  int w, h;
  while (true) {
    cin >> w >> h;
    if (w == 0 && h == 0)
      break;
    isOK = false;
    vector<vector<int>> Board(h, vector<int>(w, -1));
    cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;
    int n, c, d, x, y;
    cin >> n;
    for (int t = 0; t < n; t++) {
      cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
      int wb = 2 + (!d * 2);
      int hb = 2 + (d * 2);
      for (int i = 0; i < hb; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < wb; j++)
          Board[y + i][x + j] = c;
      }
    }
    DFS(Board, Board[ys][xs]);
    if (isOK)
      cout << "OK" << endl;
    else
      cout << "NG" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code checks the grid boundary before each DFS call, uses a dynamic vector instead of a fixed-size array for the 'Board' matrix, and implements DFS iteratively to prevent stack overflow due to recursion.
