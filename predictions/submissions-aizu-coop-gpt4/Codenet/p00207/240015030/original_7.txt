After analyzing the code, I believe there are a few approaches to optimizing the program:

1. Code Analysis:
    - The DFS (Depth-First Search) function is recursively called for each cell in the grid. This could cause a stack overflow if the grid is too large.
    - The DFS function is called for each direction (up, down, left, right) without checking if the new position is valid. This could lead to unnecessary function calls.
    - The Board array is re-initialized for every test case. This could be avoided by only updating the changed cells.
    - Global variables are used for the board and the status of the search. While it's not a performance issue, it's generally better to avoid global variables when possible.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - Use a non-recursive DFS to avoid stack overflow.
    - Check if a position is valid before calling the DFS function.
    - Maintain a separate visited array to avoid re-initializing the board.
    - Pass the board and the status as parameters instead of using global variables.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    - Instead of recursion, use a stack to implement DFS. This prevents stack overflow and can be faster because it avoids the overhead of function calls.
    - Before calling DFS, check if the new position is within the board and if it hasn't been visited yet. This avoids unnecessary function calls.
    - Instead of re-initializing the board for every test case, maintain a separate visited array to mark the visited cells. Reset this array for every test case.
    - Pass the board and the status as parameters to the DFS function. This makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

struct Position {int x, y;};
bool visited[102][102];

void DFS(int c, int x, int y, int xg, int yg, int w, int h, int Board[102][102], bool& isOK) {
  stack<Position> s;
  s.push({x, y});
  while (!s.empty()) {
    Position p = s.top();
    s.pop();
    if (p.x < 0 || p.x >= w || p.y < 0 || p.y >= h || visited[p.x][p.y] || Board[p.x][p.y] != c)
      continue;
    visited[p.x][p.y] = true;
    if (p.x == xg && p.y == yg) {
      isOK = true;
      return;
    }
    s.push({p.x + 1, p.y});
    s.push({p.x, p.y + 1});
    s.push({p.x - 1, p.y});
    s.push({p.x, p.y - 1});
  }
}

int main() {
  int w, h;
  while (true) {
    cin >> w >> h;
    if (w == 0 && h == 0)
      break;
    bool isOK = false;
    int Board[102][102];
    int xs, ys, xg, yg;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++)
        Board[j][i] = -1, visited[j][i] = false;
    }
    cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;
    int n, c, d, x, y;
    cin >> n;
    for (int t = 0; t < n; t++) {
      cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
      int wb = 2 + (!d * 2);
      int hb = 2 + (d * 2);
      for (int i = 0; i < hb; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < wb; j++)
          Board[x + j][y + i] = c;
      }
    }
    DFS(Board[xs][ys], xs, ys, xg, yg, w, h, Board, isOK);
    if (isOK)
      cout << "OK" << endl;
    else
      cout << "NG" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code should be faster and more memory-efficient than the original version.
