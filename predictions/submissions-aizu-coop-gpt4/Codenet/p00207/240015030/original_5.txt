1. Code Analysis:
   This code is a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm that navigates a 2D array "Board". The algorithm starts at a given point (xs, ys) and ends at a target point (xg, yg). It checks whether it's possible to reach the target point from the starting point while only moving through the cells that have the same value as the starting cell. The performance bottleneck lies in the DFS function, which is recursive and potentially runs many times due to its four recursive calls for each cell.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   A. Use a stack for DFS instead of using recursion to avoid stack overflow in case of large inputs.
   B. Introduce a visited array to avoid visiting the same cell multiple times, which can significantly reduce unnecessary computations.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   A. Convert DFS to Iterative:
      The DFS function is currently recursive, which could lead to stack overflow on large inputs. Converting it to an iterative function using a stack data structure can solve this issue and potentially improve performance.
   B. Introduce a visited array:
      The current code may visit the same cell multiple times, which is unnecessary. By introducing a visited array, we can mark cells as visited after the first visit, avoiding multiple visits and reducing the number of computations.

4. Optimized Code Block: 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

int Board[102][102];
bool visited[102][102];
int xs, ys, xg, yg;

struct Point
{
    int x;
    int y;
};

void DFS(int c) {
    stack<Point> s;
    s.push({xs, ys});
    
    while(!s.empty()) {
        Point p = s.top();
        s.pop();

        if(p.x < 0 || p.y < 0 || p.x >= 102 || p.y >= 102)
            continue;
        if(Board[p.x][p.y] != c || visited[p.x][p.y])
            continue;

        visited[p.x][p.y] = true;
        if (p.x == xg && p.y == yg) {
            cout << "OK" << endl;
            return;
        }

        s.push({p.x + 1, p.y});
        s.push({p.x, p.y + 1});
        s.push({p.x - 1, p.y});
        s.push({p.x, p.y - 1});
    }
    cout << "NG" << endl;
}

int main() {
    int w, h;
    while (true) {
        cin >> w >> h;
        if (w == 0 && h == 0)
            break;
        for (int i = 0; i < 102; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 102; j++)
                Board[j][i] = visited[j][i] = -1;
        }
        cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;
        int n, c, d, x, y;
        cin >> n;
        for (int t = 0; t < n; t++) {
            cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
            int wb = 2 + (!d * 2);
            int hb = 2 + (d * 2);
            for (int i = 0; i < hb; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < wb; j++)
                    Board[x + j][y + i] = c;
            }
        }
        DFS(Board[xs][ys]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, the DFS function has been converted to an iterative form using a stack data structure. A visited array has been added to prevent visiting the same cell multiple times. The DFS function now directly prints "OK" or "NG" instead of setting a boolean flag, which simplifies the code a little bit. The complexity of the main logic of the code is preserved.
