### Code Analysis
The code seems to be solving a type of path-finding problem on a grid. The grid is represented by a 2D array `Board`. The `DFS` function performs a depth-first search on the grid from a starting point to a goal point, and determines if a path exists between these two points.

### Optimization Strategy
1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The 2D array `Board` is larger than necessary. The maximum size of the grid seems to be `w` x `h`, but `Board` is always a 102 x 102 array. This wastes a significant amount of memory when the grid is smaller than 102 x 102.
2. **Redundant Computations:** The program repeatedly initializes the entire `Board` array in the main loop. This is unnecessary if the size of the grid changes infrequently. The grid should only be re-initialized when its size changes.
3. **Loop Optimization:** The nested loops in the main function can be optimized by avoiding the computation of `wb` and `hb` in each iteration.
4. **Compiler Optimizations:** The `DFS` function can be optimized using tail recursion. This is because the recursive call to `DFS` is the last operation in the function. This can potentially allow the compiler to optimize the function.

### Step-by-step Explanation
1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The `Board` array should only be as large as necessary. This can be achieved by dynamically allocating memory for the `Board` array based on the size of the grid, `w` x `h`. This will save memory when the grid is smaller than 102 x 102.
2. **Redundant Computations:** The `Board` array should only be re-initialized when the size of the grid changes. This can be achieved by storing the size of the grid and only re-initializing `Board` when a new size is read from `cin`.
3. **Loop Optimization:** The computation of `wb` and `hb` can be moved outside of the inner loop. This will reduce the number of computations in each iteration of the loop.
4. **Compiler Optimizations:** The `DFS` function can be optimized by using tail recursion. This means that the recursive call to `DFS` should be the last operation in the function. This allows the compiler to optimize the function, as it can simply reuse the current function's stack frame for the next recursive call. This can potentially improve performance, especially for deep recursion.

### Trade-offs
The proposed optimizations may increase the complexity of the code. Dynamically allocating memory for the `Board` array requires careful memory management to avoid leaks. Also, using tail recursion in the `DFS` function may make the code harder to understand for some programmers. However, these optimizations can significantly improve the performance and memory usage of the program, which is a worthwhile trade-off in most cases.

### Optimized Code Block
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int** Board;
bool isOK;
int xs, ys, xg, yg;
int w_prev = 0, h_prev = 0;

void DFS(int c, int x, int y) {
  if (Board[x][y] != c) {
    return;
  } else if (x == xg && y == yg) {
    isOK = true;
    return;
  }
  Board[x][y] = 0;
  DFS(c, x + 1, y);
  DFS(c, x, y + 1);
  DFS(c, x - 1, y);
  DFS(c, x, y - 1);
}

int main() {
  int w, h;
  while (true) {
    cin >> w >> h;
    if (w == 0 && h == 0)
      break;
    
    isOK = false;
    
    if (w != w_prev || h != h_prev) {
      // Deallocate previous Board
      for (int i = 0; i < h_prev; i++) {
        delete[] Board[i];
      }
      delete[] Board;

      // Allocate new Board
      Board = new int*[h];
      for (int i = 0; i < h; i++) {
        Board[i] = new int[w];
      }
      
      w_prev = w;
      h_prev = h;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++)
        Board[j][i] = -1;
    }
    
    cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;
    int n, c, d, x, y;
    cin >> n;
    for (int t = 0; t < n; t++) {
      cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
      int wb = 2 + (!d * 2);
      int hb = 2 + (d * 2);
      for (int i = 0; i < hb; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < wb; j++)
          Board[x + j][y + i] = c;
      }
    }
    DFS(Board[xs][ys], xs, ys);
    if (isOK)
      cout << "OK" << endl;
    else
      cout << "NG" << endl;
  }
  
  // Deallocate Board at the end of the program
  for (int i = 0; i < h_prev; i++) {
    delete[] Board[i];
  }
  delete[] Board;
  
  return 0;
}
