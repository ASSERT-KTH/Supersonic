# Code Analysis
The given C++ program is a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm that traverses a 2D array `Board`. The DFS function checks for a path from the source `(xs, ys)` to the goal `(xg, yg)`. 

# Optimization Strategy
1. **Data Structures**: The 2D array `Board[102][102]` is unnecessarily large. We can dynamically allocate memory to the board based on the width and height `w` and `h` in the main function.
2. **Redundant Computations**: The DFS function is calling itself recursively four times for each neighbouring cell. This results in a lot of unnecessary function calls and stack usage. We can use an iterative approach with a stack or queue to avoid this.
3. **Loops**: In the main function, there is a nested loop to initialize the `Board` array. This loop runs `102*102 = 10404` times even when `w` and `h` are not as large. This is an unnecessary waste of CPU cycles. We can initialize the `Board` only up to `w` and `h`.

# Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **Dynamic 2D Array**: Instead of `Board[102][102]`, we can dynamically allocate memory based on `w` and `h`. This will help in reducing memory usage.
2. **DFS Iterative Approach**: Instead of calling DFS function recursively for each neighbouring cell, we can use an iterative approach with a stack. This will reduce the function call overhead and stack usage.
3. **Initialize only required cells**: Instead of initializing all `10404` cells, we should only initialize `w*h` cells. This will reduce unnecessary CPU cycles.

# Optimized Code Block
Below is the optimized C++ code applying the above-mentioned optimization strategies:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

struct Point {
    int x, y;
    Point(int _x, int _y) : x(_x), y(_y) {}
};

void DFS(vector<vector<int>>& Board, int xs, int ys, int xg, int yg) {
    stack<Point> st;
    st.push(Point(xs, ys));
    int c = Board[xs][ys];
    while (!st.empty()) {
        Point p = st.top();
        st.pop();
        int x = p.x, y = p.y;
        if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= Board.size() || y >= Board[0].size() || Board[x][y] != c) {
            continue;
        }
        Board[x][y] = 0;
        if (x == xg && y == yg) {
            cout << "OK" << endl;
            return;
        }
        st.push(Point(x + 1, y));
        st.push(Point(x, y + 1));
        st.push(Point(x - 1, y));
        st.push(Point(x, y - 1));
    }
    cout << "NG" << endl;
}

int main() {
    int w, h;
    while (true) {
        cin >> w >> h;
        if (w == 0 && h == 0)
            break;
        vector<vector<int>> Board(h, vector<int>(w, -1));
        int xs, ys, xg, yg;
        cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;
        int n, c, d, x, y;
        cin >> n;
        for (int t = 0; t < n; t++) {
            cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
            int wb = 2 + (!d * 2);
            int hb = 2 + (d * 2);
            for (int i = 0; i < hb; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < wb; j++)
                    Board[y + i][x + j] = c;
            }
        }
        DFS(Board, xs, ys, xg, yg);
    }
    return 0;
}
