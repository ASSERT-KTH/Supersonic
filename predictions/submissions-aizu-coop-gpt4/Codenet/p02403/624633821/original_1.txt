## Code Analysis
The provided code reads pairs of `H` and `W` values until a pair of zeros is encountered. It then uses these pairs to print rectangles of `#` symbols, where `H` is the height and `W` is the width of the rectangle. The code is simple and straightforward, but there are a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The size of the arrays `H` and `W` are fixed at 100. If the number of rectangles is less than 100, there will be wasted space. If the number of rectangles is more than 100, the program will fail.

2. The `printf` function is called for each individual `#` symbol and for each newline character `\n`. Calling `printf` multiple times can be quite expensive.

## Optimization Strategy
1. **Dynamic Arrays:** Switch to dynamic arrays (e.g., `std::vector`) instead of static arrays to better manage memory usage.

2. **Reduce the number of `printf` calls:** Instead of calling `printf` for each individual `#` symbol, we could build the entire row as a `std::string` and print it at once.

## Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **Dynamic Arrays:** Using dynamic arrays in C++ (`std::vector`) will help us to manage memory more efficiently. `std::vector` will automatically manage its size as we add elements to it. This will not improve the time complexity but it will reduce the space complexity of the program, as we will only use the space that we need.

2. **Reduce the number of `printf` calls:** Calling `printf` for each `#` symbol can be expensive. Instead, we could build the entire row as a single `std::string` and print it at once. This reduces the number of `printf` calls from `W` to just 1 for each row, which will result in a significant performance boost if `W` is large.

## Trade-offs
The major trade-off here is between code simplicity and performance. The original code is very simple and easy to understand, but it is not optimized for performance. The optimized code will be slightly more complex, but it will be much more efficient in terms of memory usage and performance.

## Optimized Code Block
Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  vector<int> H, W;
  int h, w;
  while (true) {
    cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0)
      break;
    H.push_back(h);
    W.push_back(w);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < H.size(); i++) {
    string row(W[i], '#');
    for (int j = 0; j < H[i]; j++) {
      cout << row << "\n";
    }
    cout << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code:

- I have replaced the arrays `H` and `W` with `std::vector<int>`, which will dynamically manage its size based on the number of rectangles.

- I have also replaced the nested `for` loop with a single loop that builds a `std::string` of `#` symbols, then prints the entire string at once. This reduces the number of `printf` / `cout` calls, improving performance.
