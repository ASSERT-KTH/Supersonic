Let's begin with a detailed analysis of the code:

This program reads pairs of integers from the standard input until a pair of zeros is entered, and then for each pair of integers (H, W), the program prints a "rectangle" of hash symbols (#), where the number of rows is H and the number of columns is W.

The main optimization opportunities in this code are:

1. I/O Operations: Input/Output operations are time-consuming. In this code, we're reading input using cin and writing output using printf. We can use faster I/O operations.

2. String Operations: The code is currently printing each '#' character individually. We can reduce the number of I/O calls by preparing the entire string for each row and then printing it.

Here is the optimized strategy:

1. Use scanf and printf instead of cin and cout for faster I/O.
2. Prepare the whole string for each row first, then print it all at once instead of doing it character by character. This can be achieved by using string concatenation and repeating string.

Let's implement this strategy:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a = 0, H[100], W[100];
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %d", &H[a], &W[a]);
    if (H[a] == 0 && W[a] == 0)
      break;
    a++;
  }
  for (int b = 0; b < a; b++) {
    string row(W[b], '#');
    for (int i = 0; i < H[b]; i++) {
      printf("%s\n", row.c_str());
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Optimization explanation:

1. Replaced cin with scanf for faster I/O. The scanf and printf functions are faster because they have less overhead than cin and cout.

2. Reduced the number of I/O calls by preparing the entire string for each row and then printing it. This reduces the number of system calls, which are expensive operations.

Trade-offs include slightly more complex code due to the use of string operations. However, the performance gain from faster I/O and reduced system calls significantly outbalances this.
