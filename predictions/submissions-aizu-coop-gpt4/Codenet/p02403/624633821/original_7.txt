The given code reads a series of pairs of integers from the standard input. Each pair represents a height and a width of a rectangle. The program's output is a series of rectangles represented by the '#' character, with the number of rows equal to the height and the number of columns equal to the width. The sequences of rectangles are separated by an empty line.

There are few areas in this code that can be optimized:

1. Code Analysis:

    * The use of 'cin' and 'printf' together for input and output operations. It's better to use either 'cin/cout' or 'scanf/printf' consistently throughout the program. In terms of performance, 'scanf/printf' are faster.

    * The nested loops in the second while loop are used for printing the rectangles, which might be a performance bottleneck if the width and height of the rectangles are large.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    * Use 'scanf/printf' consistently for input and output operations.

    * Instead of nested loops, use the string constructor that fills the string with a repeated character and 'printf' function to print the rectangles. This could potentially speed up the process of printing large rectangles.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    * Replace 'cin' with 'scanf' for consistency and improved speed.

    * In the second while loop, remove the inner 'for' loop that prints each '#' character. Instead, create a string filled with '#' characters using the string constructor, and print this string. This can reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n), where n is the number of '#' characters to be printed.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 0, H[100], W[100];

    // Use scanf consistently for input
    while (scanf("%d %d", &H[a], &W[a]), H[a] || W[a]) {
        a++;
    }

    for (int b = 0; b < a; b++) {
        // Create a string filled with '#' characters and print it
        string line(W[b], '#');
        for (int i = 0; i < H[b]; i++) {
            printf("%s\n", line.c_str());
        }

        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code avoids the nested loop for printing each '#' character, which could potentially speed up the execution time for large inputs. However, this approach might use slightly more memory to store the string 'line'. The trade-off here is memory consumption for execution speed.
