**1. Code Analysis:**

The provided C++ program reads a series of pairs of integers from the standard input, treating each pair as the dimensions (height and width, respectively) of a rectangle. For each pair, it prints a rectangle of '#' characters of the corresponding dimensions. The input reading stops when a pair of zeros is encountered. There are several areas of potential inefficiency in this program.

- The use of `cin` and `printf` instead of `scanf` and `printf` or `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input/output operations. Mixing C-style I/O with C++-style I/O can result in performance overhead due to synchronization issues.
- The use of two separate while loops to first read the input and then print the rectangles. This is not necessary and can be combined into a single loop.
- The use of fixed-size arrays `H[100]` and `W[100]` for storing the input. This could lead to wasted memory if the number of inputs is less than 100, or worse, a buffer overflow if it exceeds 100.

**2. Optimization Strategy:**

A1. Use consistent I/O methods: We can use either `scanf` and `printf` or `std::cin` and `std::cout` for all I/O operations. 

A2. Combine the input reading and rectangle printing loops: We don't need to store all input pairs before starting to print the rectangles. We can print each rectangle immediately after reading its dimensions.

A3. Skip the storage of input pairs: Since we're processing each input pair immediately, we don't need to store them in arrays.

B1. Avoiding redundant computations: The computations in this code are not redundant, but we can simplify the rectangle printing by using the string constructor that fills a string with a given number of copies of a character.

C1. Loops optimization: There's no need for loop unrolling or tail recursion in this case. The nested loops are necessary for printing the rectangles.

D1. Compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations are beyond the scope of this code, but they could include options like `-O3` for GCC or `-Ox` for MSVC.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Switch all I/O operations to `scanf` and `printf` for consistency and to avoid the overhead of synchronizing C-style and C++-style I/O.

2. Combine the input reading and rectangle printing loops. This eliminates the need to store the input pairs and allows us to print each rectangle as soon as we read its dimensions. This should reduce memory usage and potentially increase performance.

3. Use the string constructor to create a row of '#' characters, rather than iterating over the width of each rectangle. This might be faster and is certainly more concise.

**4. Optimized Code Block:**

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int h, w;
  while (scanf("%d%d", &h, &w) == 2 && h != 0 && w != 0) {
    string row(w, '#');
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++) {
      printf("%s\n", row.c_str());
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we're using `scanf` to read the input pairs and `printf` to print the rectangles. The input reading and rectangle printing are combined into a single loop, and we create the string representing a row of '#' characters once per rectangle, rather than once per row. This reduces the number of calls to `printf`, which might improve performance, especially for large rectangles.
