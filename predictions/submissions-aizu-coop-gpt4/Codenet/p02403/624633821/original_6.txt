**Code Analysis:**

1. This is a simple C++ program that reads pairs of integers from the console until a pair of zeros is encountered. Each pair of numbers represents the dimensions of a rectangle, which is printed to the console with '#' symbol.

2. The program uses arrays to store the height and width of each rectangle. These arrays have a fixed size of 100. 

3. There are two while loops, the first one is used to read the input and the second one to print the rectangles.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The fixed-size arrays can be replaced with dynamic data structures such as vectors. Vectors automatically handle their own memory allocation and deallocation, which can lead to more efficient memory usage.

2. **Redundant Computations:** There are no redundant computations in this code.

3. **Loop Optimization:** The inner loop that prints each row of the rectangle can be replaced with a single call to printf. This would reduce the number of function calls and make the code more efficient.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** The compiler optimization can be done by using flags such as O3 during the compilation process. This can significantly improve the performance of the program.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Replace the fixed-size arrays with vectors. This will free up memory when it's no longer needed and allocate memory only when required.

2. Replace the inner loop with a single call to printf. This will reduce the number of function calls.

3. Use O3 optimization level during compilation. This will instruct the compiler to apply high-level optimizations that can significantly improve the performance of the program.

**Trade-offs:**

1. Using vectors instead of arrays may lead to a slight increase in memory usage due to the overhead of vector's automatic memory management. However, the benefit of not having to manually manage memory outweighs this cost.

2. The use of printf with a repeated character string can make the code less readable. However, the performance gain from reducing the number of function calls is worth the trade-off.

**Optimized Code:**

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  vector<int> H, W;
  int h, w;
  while (1) {
    cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0)
      break;
    H.push_back(h);
    W.push_back(w);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < H.size(); i++) {
    string row(W[i], '#');
    for (int j = 0; j < H[i]; j++) {
      printf("%s\n", row.c_str());
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Compile the program with O3 optimization level using g++: `g++ -O3 program.cpp`
