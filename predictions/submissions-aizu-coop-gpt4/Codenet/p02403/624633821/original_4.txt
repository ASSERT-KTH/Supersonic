The provided code reads multiple pairs of integers as input until it encounters a pair of zeros. Each pair (H, W) is meant to represent the height and width of a rectangle, and the code prints out a 'grid' of '#' characters for each rectangle. 

Here are a few areas where we can optimize the code:

1. **I/O Optimizations**: The 'cin' and 'cout' operations are slower compared to 'scanf' and 'printf'. So, we can replace 'cin' with 'scanf' for faster input operations.

2. **Avoiding Redundant Computations**: In the nested loop structure that prints the rectangle, the inner loop prints '#' W times. This calculation is repeated unnecessarily H times. We can create a string with W '#' characters once and print it H times instead.

3. **Memory Usage**: The arrays H[] and W[] are declared with a static size of 100. If we don't need to store all the pairs at once, we can reduce memory usage by only storing one pair at a time.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: We can use the 'O2' compiler flag. This flag tells the compiler to perform more aggressive optimizations that include inline function expansion, delay slot filling, and loop unrolling.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Declare the height and width variables
    int H, W;
    
    // Use a 'while' loop to continuously input pairs of integers
    while (1) {

        // Use 'scanf' for faster input
        scanf("%d %d", &H, &W);
        
        // Break the loop when both height and width are zero
        if (H == 0 && W == 0)
            break;

        // Create a string with W '#' characters
        string line(W, '#');

        // Print the line H times
        for (int i = 0; i < H; i++) {
            printf("%s\n", line.c_str());
        }

        // Print an extra newline character after each rectangle
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we've greatly reduced the number of computations by pre-calculating the line string. We've also reduced memory usage by storing only one pair of integers at a time. Additionally, we've increased the speed of our I/O operations by using 'scanf' and 'printf' instead of 'cin' and 'cout'. The readability of the code is maintained, with comments added for clarity.
