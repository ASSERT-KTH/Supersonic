Code Analysis:
The given C++ program receives pairs of height and width (H, W) and for each pair, prints a rectangle of '#' characters of the given height and width. The input ends when a pair of zeros is entered. The program uses two arrays, H and W, to store the dimensions.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Eliminate the use of arrays to store the rectangle dimensions. Since the rectangle is immediately printed after receiving a dimension pair, there's no need to store all the dimensions. This will reduce memory usage.
2. Rather than using a nested loop to print each '#' character, use string's ability to create a string of a certain length filled with a specific character. This reduces the complexity of the code and might also lead to faster execution because of the internal optimization of this string operation.
3. Use 'cout' instead of 'printf' for consistency as 'cin' is used for input. 

Step-by-step Explanation:
1. Remove the arrays H and W, and replace them with single integer variables. This is possible because the dimensions are processed immediately after being read, so there's no need to store them for later use. This reduces memory usage.

2. Replace the inner loop that prints '#' characters with a single line of code that creates a string of '#' characters of the required length. This reduces the complexity of the code and might also improve performance because string operations are often optimized internally by the compiler.

3. Replace 'printf' with 'cout' for consistency. It's good practice to use 'cin' and 'cout' together, or 'scanf' and 'printf' together.

4. The trade-offs of these optimizations include the potential loss of flexibility (since we no longer store all the dimensions, we can't easily change the program to process the dimensions later) and slightly increased code complexity due to the use of the string constructor to create a string of '#'s.

Optimized Code Block:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int h, w;
  while (1) {
    cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0)
      break;

    // Create a string of '#'s of the required length and print it
    string line(w, '#');
    for (int i = 0; i < h; ++i) {
      cout << line << "\n";
    }
    cout << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code retains the functionality of the original code while reducing memory usage and potentially improving performance. It also makes use of C++ string and stream features for cleaner and more readable code.
