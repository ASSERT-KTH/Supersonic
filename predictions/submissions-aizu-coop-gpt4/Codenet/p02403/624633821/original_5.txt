1. Code Analysis: The provided code reads pairs of integers from the standard input and uses these pairs to print rectangles composed of '#' characters. The performance bottlenecks are the nested loops for printing each rectangle and the use of printf() for outputting each character.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Use vector<int> instead of arrays for dynamic size control.
    2. Replace printf() with cout for better type safety and performance.
    3. Use string constructor to generate each row of the rectangle, reducing the innermost loop.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Use vector<int> instead of arrays: This change allows us to avoid defining a fixed-size array and to instead use a dynamic vector that can grow as needed. It also eliminates the need for a manual counter 'a' as we can use the vector's size property.
    2. Replace printf() with cout: The printf() function is a C-style function that does not provide type safety and may lead to slower performance compared to cout. By using cout, we can ensure better type safety and potentially improve performance.
    3. Use string constructor to generate each row: Instead of using a loop to print each '#' character, we can use the string constructor that takes a character and a count to generate a string of '#' characters. This reduces the innermost loop to a single line, improving performance.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  vector<int> H, W;
  int h, w;
  while (1) {
    cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0)
      break;
    H.push_back(h);
    W.push_back(w);
  }
  for (size_t i = 0; i < H.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < H[i]; j++) {
      cout << string(W[i], '#') << "\n";
    }
    cout << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: While this code is more optimized, it is important to remember that the performance gain might not be noticeable for small input sizes. The performance improvement will be more evident for larger input sizes.
