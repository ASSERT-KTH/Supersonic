Code Analysis:
The provided code is implementing two sorting algorithms, Bubble Sort and Selection Sort, on a deck of cards. It then checks if the two sorts are stable, i.e., if equal elements appear in the same order in the sorted output.

Optimization Strategy:

1.  Data Structures: The program uses an array to store the deck of cards which is efficient in this case.

2. Redundant Computations: 
    - The program is using two different sorting algorithms to sort the same data. This is not necessary and adds to the inefficiency of the program. We can stick to one efficient sorting algorithm.
    - The swapping of cards is done in two places: in the function `swap_Card()` and directly in the `BubbleSort()` and `SelectionSort()` functions. This is redundant and can be optimized by using the `swap_Card()` function in the sorting algorithms.

3. Loops and Recursion: 
    - Both Bubble Sort and Selection Sort have a time complexity of O(N^2), which is not efficient for large inputs. We can replace these with a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as Quick Sort or Merge Sort, which have a time complexity of O(NlogN).
    - In the final part of the program where it checks if the sorts are stable, the program prints "Stable" every time it doesn't find a difference in the suits. This is unnecessary and the condition can be simplified to print "Stable" once if no difference is found.

4. Compiler Optimizations: 
    - We may use `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flags during compilation to enable various optimization features in the compiler. However, this should be done carefully as it can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the Bubble Sort and Selection Sort methods with either Quick Sort or Merge Sort. This will improve the time complexity from O(N^2) to O(NlogN).

2. Use the `swap_Card()` function in the sorting algorithm to eliminate redundancy.

3. Simplify the final part of the program that checks if the sorts are stable to print "Stable" once if no difference is found.

4. Use compiler optimization flags during compilation to enable various optimization features.
