The provided code sorts an array of `Card` using BubbleSort and SelectionSort, and then checks if the order of the cards' suits have been maintained (stability) in both sorts. The main bottlenecks in the code are the BubbleSort and SelectionSort functions, which both have time complexity O(N^2), where N is the size of the array. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use Efficient Sorting Algorithms: The most significant optimization would be to replace the BubbleSort and SelectionSort with more efficient sorting algorithms, such as QuickSort or MergeSort. However, these algorithms aren't stable, which means they can change the relative order of equal elements. Therefore, you might need to implement a stable version of these algorithms, or use a stable sorting algorithm like TimSort, which has a time complexity of O(N log N).

2. Minimize Redundant Operations: In the provided code, the swapping operation is being called even when the element and the minimum element are the same. This can be avoided.

3. Compiler Optimizations: Using compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` during the compilation can improve the performance of the code.

4. Utilize In-built Functions: If the environment allows, we can use inbuilt sorting function which is generally optimized.

Here's how to implement these strategies:

1. Efficient Sorting Algorithm: As we need to maintain the stability of the sort, we will use the in-built `qsort` function for this purpose. This function is a part of the standard library in C and is highly optimized. For comparison, we will use a function that first compares the values, and if they are equal, it compares the suits. This will keep the sort stable.

2. Minimize Redundant Operations: We will check if the current index `i` and `minj` are different before swapping the elements. This will avoid unnecessary swapping operations.

3. Using `-O2` or `-O3` compiler flags can provide automatic optimizations like loop unrolling or function inlining.

4. Using in-built `qsort` function for sorting.

Here is the optimized code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct {
  char suit;
  int value;
} Card;

// Compare function for qsort
int cmp(const void *a, const void *b) {
  Card *cardA = (Card *)a;
  Card *cardB = (Card *)b;
  if (cardA->value != cardB->value)
    return cardA->value - cardB->value;
  return cardA->suit - cardB->suit;
}

void SelectionSort(Card A[], int N) {
  int i, j;
  int minj;
  Card temp;
  for (i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
    minj = i;
    for (j = i + 1; j < N; j++) {
      if (A[j].value < A[minj].value) {
        minj = j;
      }
    }
    if(i != minj) {
      temp = A[i];
      A[i] = A[minj];
      A[minj] = temp;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int N;
  scanf("%d\n", &N);
  int i, j;
  Card BC[36];
  Card SC[36];
  for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    Card c;
    scanf("%c", &c.suit);
    scanf("%d ", &c.value);
    BC[i] = c;
    SC[i] = c;
  }
  // Using qsort instead of BubbleSort
  qsort(BC, N, sizeof(Card), cmp);
  SelectionSort(SC, N);
  for (i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
    printf("%c%d ", BC[i].suit, BC[i].value);
  }
  printf("%c%d\n", BC[N - 1].suit, BC[N - 1].value);
  puts("Stable");
  for (i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
    printf("%c%d ", SC[i].suit, SC[i].value);
  }
  printf("%c%d\n", SC[N - 1].suit, SC[N - 1].value);
  for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (BC[i].suit != SC[i].suit) {
      puts("Not stable");
      return 0;
    }
  }
  puts("Stable");
  return 0;
}
```

It should be noted that the `qsort` function is not guaranteed to be a stable sort, but in this case, we're comparing the suits if the values are the same, which provides stability. An alternative, albeit more complex approach, would be to implement a stable sorting algorithm like TimSort or MergeSort.
