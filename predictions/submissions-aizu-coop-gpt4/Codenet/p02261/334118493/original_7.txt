1. Code Analysis:

The given code is a simple implementation of Bubble Sort and Selection Sort for sorting an array of 'Card' structures based on their 'value'. The 'Card' structure contains two fields: 'suit' which is of type char and 'value' which is of type int. The sorting is done in ascending order.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. More efficient data structures: The data structures used in the code seem to be the most appropriate for the task at hand. 

B. Redundant computations: There are no redundant computations in the code. 

C. Loop optimizations: The bubble sort and selection sort algorithms have a time complexity of O(n^2). We can use a more efficient sorting algorithm, like QuickSort or MergeSort, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). 

D. Compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations are not applicable here as the code does not contain any complex computations or operations that could be optimized by the compiler.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

Step 1: Replace the Bubble Sort and Selection Sort algorithms with a more efficient one, like QuickSort or MergeSort. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n).

Trade-offs: Implementing a more complex sorting algorithm like QuickSort or MergeSort will increase the complexity of the code. However, the performance gain in terms of reduced time complexity makes this trade-off worthwhile.

4. Optimized Code Block:

The optimized code block will use the std::sort function from the C++ Standard Library to sort the array of 'Card' structures. This function uses the Introsort algorithm, which is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from QuickSort and HeapSort.

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <algorithm>

typedef struct {
  char suit;
  int value;
} Card;

bool compare(Card a, Card b) {
  return a.value < b.value;
}

int main() {
  int N;
  scanf("%d\n", &N);
  int i, j;
  Card BC[36];
  Card SC[36];
  for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    Card c;
    scanf("%c", &c.suit);
    scanf("%d ", &c.value);
    BC[i] = c;
    SC[i] = c;
  }
  
  std::sort(BC, BC + N, compare);
  std::sort(SC, SC + N, compare);
  
  for (i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
    printf("%c%d ", BC[i].suit, BC[i].value);
  }
  printf("%c%d\n", BC[N - 1].suit, BC[N - 1].value);
  puts("Stable");
  for (i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
    printf("%c%d ", SC[i].suit, SC[i].value);
  }
  printf("%c%d\n", SC[N - 1].suit, SC[N - 1].value);
  for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (BC[i].suit != SC[i].suit) {
      puts("Not stable");
      return 0;
    }
  }
  puts("Stable");
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The compare function is used to specify the sorting criteria for the std::sort function. This function returns true if the 'value' of the first Card is less than the 'value' of the second Card. This ensures that the array of Cards is sorted in ascending order based on their 'value'.
