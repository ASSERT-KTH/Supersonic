1. Code Analysis:
    This code is a part of the dynamic programming problem. The code takes X and Y as input. It then runs a while loop where it takes X*Y integers as input. The inputs are stored in a 2D array and the "func" function is called for each column in the first row. The func function checks for possible paths from the top to the bottom of the 2D grid. The function calculates the number of different paths and stores the result in the memo array.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Redundant Initialization: The 2D array 'data' is being initialized to 0 in every iteration. But, when we take the input for this array, every cell of this array is already getting updated. So, initializing it again is redundant.
    2. Avoiding Recursion: The 'func' function is a recursive function, which may lead to a stack overflow for large inputs. It could be replaced with an iterative approach.
    3. Use of Constants: The constant N is defined, but it is not used properly. We can define X and Y as constants.
    4. Compiler Optimization: Using the -O3 flag during compilation instructs the compiler to perform optimizations such as inlining, loop unrolling, etc.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. The initialization of 'data' can be removed as it is redundant. We are already updating every cell of this 2D array when taking input.
    2. The recursive function 'func' can be replaced with an iterative approach. This will avoid the possibility of a stack overflow and will generally be faster as it avoids the overhead of function calls.
    3. The constant N is defined, but it is not used properly. We can define X and Y as constants to avoid reading them in every iteration.
    4. Using the -O3 flag during compilation will instruct the compiler to perform a number of optimizations that can significantly improve the performance of the code.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define N 15
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const int X = N, Y = N;
  int data[Y][X], memo[Y][X];

  while (1) {
    if (X == 0 && Y == 0)
      break;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < Y; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < X; j++)
        cin >> data[i][j], memo[i][j] = 0;

    for (int i = X - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      for (int j = 0; j < Y; j++) {
        if (j == Y - 1) {
          memo[j][i] = 1;
        } else if (data[j + 1][i] == 0) {
          memo[j][i] += memo[j + 1][i];
        }
        if (i > 0 && data[j + 1][i - 1] == 0) {
          memo[j][i] += memo[j + 1][i - 1];
        }
        if (i < X - 1 && data[j + 1][i + 1] == 0) {
          memo[j][i] += memo[j + 1][i + 1];
        }
      }
    }

    int cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < X; i++)
      cnt += memo[0][i];
    cout << cnt << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimized code is under the assumption that X and Y are constants and the maximum possible value of X and Y is N. If X and Y are not constants, then the original approach of taking X and Y as inputs should be used and the array size should be declared dynamically.
