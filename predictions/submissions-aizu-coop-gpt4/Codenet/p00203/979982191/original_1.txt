Code Analysis:
The given code is used to process a grid of size `N x N`. The grid dimensions and grid data is input by the user. The 'func' function is used to process the grid and fill in a memoization table based on a set of rules. The 'jump' function is used to determine the next Y-coordinate to process given a certain condition.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. Recursion in 'func' function: Recursive calls can be expensive in terms of time and memory. Here, recursion is used to process grid cells. This can be improved through dynamic programming or memoization.
2. Initialization of 'data' and 'memo' arrays: The initialization of these arrays is done using nested loops. This is not very efficient and can be improved using `std::fill` or `std::memset`.
3. The 'jump' function: The 'jump' function uses a while loop to find the next Y-coordinate to process. This can result in unnecessary iterations and can be improved.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Optimize the initialization of 'data' and 'memo' arrays: Use `std::fill` or `std::memset` to initialize these arrays more efficiently.
2. Optimize the 'func' function: The 'func' function can be optimized by eliminating recursion and using dynamic programming or memoization to store intermediate results.
3. Optimize the 'jump' function: The 'jump' function can be optimized by eliminating unnecessary iterations and using a more efficient searching strategy.

1. Initialize 'data' and 'memo' arrays: 

```cpp
std::fill(&data[0][0], &data[0][0] + sizeof(data), 0);
std::fill(&memo[0][0], &memo[0][0] + sizeof(memo), 0);
```

2. Optimize 'func' function: 

We can eliminate recursion and use dynamic programming instead. Instead of calling 'func' recursively for each cell, we can fill in the 'memo' array iteratively. For each cell, we calculate the 'memo' value based on its neighbors. This avoids the overhead of recursive calls and allows us to reuse previously computed results.

```cpp
for (int y = Y - 2; y >= 0; --y) {
  for (int x = 0; x < X; ++x) {
    // calculate memo[y][x] based on neighbors
  }
}
```

3. Optimize 'jump' function: 

The 'jump' function can be optimized by using a more efficient search strategy. Instead of iterating over every cell, we can skip cells that we know won't meet the condition. This can be done by adding a step size to the 'y' coordinate, which allows us to skip cells.

```cpp
int step = 2;
while (y < Y - 1) {
  y += step;
  // check condition
}
```
The optimized code block will be provided in the next step.
