This C++ program appears to solve a complex problem related to a graph and uses several matrices for computation. This may be a graph-related problem with dynamic programming. Here are a few optimizations that could be done:

1. Code Analysis:

    - The multiplication of matrices in the `mul` function is a major performance bottleneck. It has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the size of the matrices, which can be significant for large matrices.
    - The `mul` function also creates a lot of temporary objects which might consume a lot of memory.
    - The `shortPhase` function contains a loop which can be executed up to 150 times and each iteration of the loop also contains a for each loop. This could be a performance bottleneck.
    - The code uses `vector<vector<int>>` for matrices, which might not be the most efficient way of representing matrices.
    
2. Optimization Strategy:

    - The multiplication of matrices in the `mul` function can be optimized by using the Strassen algorithm or Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm. These algorithms reduce the time complexity of matrix multiplication.
    - The `mul` function can be optimized to reduce the creation of temporary objects.
    - The `shortPhase` function can be optimized by reducing the number of iterations in the loop.
    - The code can use a more efficient data structure for representing matrices.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    - The multiplication of matrices in the `mul` function can be optimized by using the Strassen algorithm or Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm. These algorithms divide the matrix into smaller sub-matrices and then perform the multiplication. This reduces the time complexity of the multiplication from O(n^3) to O(n^log2(7)) for Strassen and O(n^2.376) for Coppersmith-Winograd.
    - The `mul` function can be optimized to reduce the creation of temporary objects by reusing the same object for intermediate computations.
    - The `shortPhase` function can be optimized by reducing the number of iterations in the loop. This can be done by using a more efficient algorithm for finding the shortest path in the graph.
    - The code can use a more efficient data structure for representing matrices. For instance, a one-dimensional array can be used instead of a `vector<vector<int>>`. This reduces the overhead of managing multiple vectors and can lead to better cache utilization.

Please note that these optimizations might increase the complexity of the code and make it harder to understand. However, they can significantly improve the performance of the code.

Due to the complexity of the task and the lack of a specific problem statement, it's difficult to provide a fully optimized code block. But here is a small example of how the `mul` function can be optimized to reduce the creation of temporary objects:

```cpp
void mul(Mat &res, const Mat &a, const Mat &b) {
    int N = a.size();
    for_(i, 0, N) 
        for_(j, 0, N) 
            for_(k, 0, N) {
                if (a[i][k] >= 0 && b[k][j] >= 0)
                    maxUpdate(res[i][j], a[i][k] + b[k][j]);
            }
}
```

Here, `Mat &res` is used as a parameter to the function, so the function directly modifies the result matrix instead of creating a new one. Also, the `a` and `b` matrices are passed as const references to avoid unnecessary copying.
