Code Analysis:
The provided code seems to be solving some form of pathfinding problem with additional constraints. It uses dynamic programming (dp) for the 'shortPhase' function and matrix multiplication for the 'calcMinStep' function. 

Potential bottlenecks could include:
1. Matrix multiplication in the 'mul' function: It is currently implemented in O(n^3), which could be a significant bottleneck for large matrices.
2. The 'shortPhase' function contains a nested for loop iterating over the adjacency list of every vertex, which could be a performance issue if there are many edges.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Change the algorithm for matrix multiplication to Strassen's algorithm, which improves the time complexity to approximately O(n^2.81). Although this algorithm is more complex, it will provide significant performance improvements for large matrices.
2. Instead of iterating over the adjacency list of every vertex, we can maintain a priority queue that contains the next vertices to visit, sorted by their current maximum score. This way, we only need to process each edge once.
3. Use compiler optimization flags like O2 or O3 to enable various compiler optimizations like loop unrolling and function inlining.

Now, let's move on to the step-by-step explanation of the optimization steps. Please note that actual code implementation may require more steps and considerations. 

1. Change the Algorithm for Matrix Multiplication:
   - Replace the 'mul' function with an implementation of Strassen's algorithm.
   - This algorithm divides the input matrices into four smaller matrices, computes their products recursively, and combines the results to get the final matrix.
   - This reduces the time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2.81), which is a significant improvement for large matrices.

2. Optimize the 'shortPhase' function:
   - Instead of iterating over the adjacency list of every vertex, we can maintain a priority queue that contains the next vertices to visit, sorted by their current maximum score. This way, we only need to process each edge once.
   - We first initialize the queue with all vertices, then in each iteration, we pop a vertex from the queue, update the maximum score of its neighbors, and push them into the queue. We repeat this process until the queue is empty or we have found a path with a score greater than or equal to K.
   - This optimization reduces the time complexity from O(V*E) to O(E log E), assuming that we can extract the maximum element from the queue in O(log E) time.

3. Use Compiler Optimization Flags:
   - Compiler optimization flags like O2 or O3 can automatically apply a wide range of optimization techniques to the code, such as function inlining, loop unrolling, instruction scheduling, and constant folding.
   - For instance, function inlining can reduce the overhead of function calls, loop unrolling can improve the efficiency of loops by executing multiple iterations in a single loop cycle, and constant folding can compute the results of constant expressions at compile-time.
   
Please note, the optimized code for the above steps will be provided upon request. It's important to note that optimization can sometimes lead to less readable code and increased code complexity. Make sure to comment your code well and only use optimization where necessary.
