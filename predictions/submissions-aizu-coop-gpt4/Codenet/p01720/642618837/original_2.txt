This program seems to be implementing a form of Dijkstra's algorithm on a bidirectional graph to find the shortest path from source to target and counting the number of distinct shortest paths. The performance can be improved by optimizing I/O operations, replacing vector with array where applicable, and using efficient data structures. 

## Code Analysis

The program has a few potential performance bottlenecks:
1. I/O operations: The current I/O operations are using `scanf` and `printf`. This can be optimized by using faster I/O operations.
2. Vector operations: The current program is using `vector` for `G`, `d1`, `d2`, `r1`, and `r2`. This can be optimized by using an array in place of vector where applicable.
3. Graph representation: The graph is represented as an adjacency list. Depending on the graph's sparsity, an adjacency matrix might be more efficient.

## Optimization Strategy

1. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `std::cin` and `std::cout` with `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0)` and `cin.tie(0)`.
2. Replace `vector` with `array` where the size is known at compile time.
3. Use `reserve` function for vectors to allocate memory beforehand and reduce the number of reallocations.
4. Use `std::array` or C-style array for `d1`, `d2`, `r1`, `r2` as their sizes are known in advance. This can potentially save memory and provide faster access.
5. Use `std::list` instead of `vector` for adjacency list `G` to avoid costly insertions.
6. Use breadth-first search (BFS) efficiently by avoiding unnecessary checks.

## Optimized Code Block

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
#include <list>
#include <array>

#define INF (1 << 23)

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);

  int N, M, s, t, u, v;
  cin >> N >> M >> s >> t;
  s--; t--;

  vector<list<int>> G(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    cin >> u >> v;
    G[u - 1].push_back(v - 1);
    G[v - 1].push_back(u - 1);
  }

  array<int, INF> d1;
  d1.fill(INF);
  d1[s] = 0;
  
  array<int, INF> d2;
  d2.fill(INF);
  d2[t] = 0;
  
  queue<int> que;
  que.push(s);
  
  while (!que.empty()) {
    int node = que.front();
    que.pop();
    for (auto i : G[node]) {
      if (d1[i] == INF) {
        d1[i] = d1[node] + 1;
        que.push(i);
      }
    }
  }
  
  que.push(t);
  
  while (!que.empty()) {
    int node = que.front();
    que.pop();
    for (auto i : G[node]) {
      if (d2[i] == INF) {
        d2[i] = d2[node] + 1;
        que.push(i);
      }
    }
  }
  
  int shortest = d1[t];
  array<int, INF> r1;
  r1.fill(0);
  array<int, INF> r2;
  r2.fill(0);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (d1[i] < shortest - 1) {
      r1[d1[i]]++;
    }
    if (d2[i] < shortest - 1) {
      r2[d2[i]]++;
    }
  }
  
  long long ret = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < shortest - 1; i++) {
    ret += 1LL * r1[i] * r2[shortest - i - 2];
  }
  
  cout << ret << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, `std::cin` and `std::cout` are used instead of `scanf` and `printf`. `std::array` is used instead of `std::vector` for `d1`, `d2`, `r1`, `r2` as their sizes are known at compile-time. `std::list` is used instead of `std::vector` for adjacency list `G` to avoid costly insertions. The BFS is implemented efficiently by avoiding unnecessary checks.
