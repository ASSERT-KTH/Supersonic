This program is a standard BFS (Breadth-First Search) graph traversal algorithm. It finds the shortest path between two points and calculates the number of such paths that exist. Here is a step-by-step optimization plan for this code:

1. Code Analysis:

   The current implementation uses vectors for storing adjacency lists and distances from the source and destination nodes. Two BFS traversals are performed, one from the source and the other from the destination.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    1. Reducing unnecessary memory usage: The r1 and r2 vectors are created with a size of shortest - 1, which might not be necessary. These vectors could be resized as required, saving memory.

    2. Reducing unnecessary CPU cycles: The size() function is called inside the for loop in BFS. Caching the size before the loop could reduce the number of function calls.

    3. Compiler optimization: Use -O3 flag for compiler optimization. 

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    1. The r1 and r2 vectors are initially created with a size of shortest - 1. By not specifying an initial size and using the push_back function to add elements, we can save memory. This approach may slightly increase the time complexity due to frequent resizing, but the memory savings are worth this trade-off, especially when dealing with large inputs.

    2. In the BFS function, the size() function is called for each iteration of the for loop. By caching the size in a variable before the for loop, we can reduce the number of function calls, thus saving CPU cycles.

    3. Compiler optimization flags like -O3 instruct the compiler to apply various optimization techniques to the generated machine code. This can result in more efficient code execution without modifying the source code. However, the effectiveness of compiler optimizations can vary depending on the specific code and compiler used.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
#define INF (1 << 23)
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, M, s, t, u, v;
  scanf("%d", &N);
  scanf("%d", &M);
  scanf("%d", &s);
  s--;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  t--;
  vector<vector<int>> G(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &u);
    scanf("%d", &v);
    G[u - 1].push_back(v - 1);
    G[v - 1].push_back(u - 1);
  }
  vector<int> d1(N, INF);
  d1[s] = 0;
  vector<int> d2(N, INF);
  d2[t] = 0;
  queue<int> que;
  que.push(s);
  while (!que.empty()) {
    int node = que.front(); que.pop();
    int size = G[node].size(); // Cache size
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      if (d1[G[node][i]] == INF) {
        d1[G[node][i]] = d1[node] + 1;
        que.push(G[node][i]);
      }
    }
  }
  que.push(t);
  while (!que.empty()) {
    int node = que.front(); que.pop();
    int size = G[node].size(); // Cache size
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      if (d2[G[node][i]] == INF) {
        d2[G[node][i]] = d2[node] + 1;
        que.push(G[node][i]);
      }
    }
  }
  int shortest = d1[t];
  vector<int> r1, r2;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (d1[i] < shortest - 1) {
      while(d1[i] >= r1.size()) r1.push_back(0);
      r1[d1[i]]++;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (d2[i] < shortest - 1) {
      while(d2[i] >= r2.size()) r2.push_back(0);
      r2[d2[i]]++;
    }
  }
  long long ret = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < shortest - 1; i++) {
    ret += 1LL * r1[i] * r2[shortest - i - 2];
  }
  printf("%lld\n", ret);
  return 0;
}
```

To compile this code with optimizations, use the `-O3` flag with the g++ compiler:

```bash
g++ -O3 code.cpp -o optimized_code
```
