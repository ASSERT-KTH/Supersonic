Code Analysis:

The provided code is a typical breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph. The program accepts the number of nodes (N), the number of edges (M), the starting node (s), the destination node (t), and the connections between nodes. 

It first initializes the graph and then runs two BFS operations, one from the starting node, and another from the destination node. This is to find the shortest path from both directions. Then it calculates the number of nodes at each level of the graph from both directions. Finally, it multiplies the number of nodes at each level from both directions and sums them up.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use scanf and printf functions: The program already uses these functions which are faster than std::cin and std::cout. 

2. Reducing unnecessary memory allocation: The program uses two vectors d1 and d2 to store the shortest path from the start node and the end node respectively. We can reduce this to one vector by reversing the graph for the second BFS.

3. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The size of the adjacency list for each node is called in every iteration of the BFS loop. This can be avoided by storing the size in a variable.

4. Use reserve to preallocate memory for vectors: Since the size of the graph (N) is known beforehand, we can use the reserve function to preallocate memory for vectors. This can avoid reallocations during the push_back operations.

5. Use of prefix increment (++i) over postfix increment (i++): In C/C++, the prefix version (++i) is usually faster than the postfix (i++) version in loops.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
#define INF (1 << 23)
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, M, s, t, u, v;
  scanf("%d %d %d %d", &N, &M, &s, &t);
  s--; t--;
  vector<vector<int>> G(N), R(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
    scanf("%d %d", &u, &v);
    u--; v--;
    G[u].push_back(v);
    R[v].push_back(u);  // Reverse graph
  }
  vector<int> d(N, INF), r1(N, 0), r2(N, 0);
  d[s] = 0;
  queue<int> que;
  que.push(s);
  while (!que.empty()) {
    int node = que.front();
    que.pop();
    for (int i = 0, sz = G[node].size(); i < sz; ++i) {
      int next_node = G[node][i];
      if (d[next_node] == INF) {
        d[next_node] = d[node] + 1;
        que.push(next_node);
      }
    }
  }
  int shortest = d[t];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) if (d[i] < shortest) ++r1[d[i]];
  fill(d.begin(), d.end(), INF);
  d[t] = 0;
  que.push(t);
  while (!que.empty()) {
    int node = que.front();
    que.pop();
    for (int i = 0, sz = R[node].size(); i < sz; ++i) {
      int next_node = R[node][i];
      if (d[next_node] == INF) {
        d[next_node] = d[node] + 1;
        que.push(next_node);
      }
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) if (d[i] < shortest) ++r2[d[i]];
  long long ret = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < shortest; ++i) ret += (long long)r1[i] * r2[shortest - i - 1];
  printf("%lld\n", ret);
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the memory used is reduced by reusing the vector d. The vector R is created to store the reversed graph. We also avoid unnecessary function calls by storing the size of the adjacency list in a variable. And the prefix version (++i) of increment is used instead of the postfix (i++) version. The trade-off is a slight increase in code complexity due to the addition of the reversed graph.
