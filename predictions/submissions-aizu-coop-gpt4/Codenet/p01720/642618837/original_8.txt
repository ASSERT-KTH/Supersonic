1. Code Analysis: 

The provided code finds all shortest paths from a source node to a target node in a graph. It uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm twice, first from the source node and second from the target node. Then it calculates the number of shortest paths and prints it. The potential performance bottlenecks are the BFS loops and the loops used to fill r1 and r2 vectors.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. The BFS loops can be optimized by using iterator instead of indexing for traversing the adjacent nodes. This reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(1) for each access.

B. The code is using two separate loops for filling the vectors r1 and r2. These two loops can be combined into a single loop to reduce the number of iterations.

C. The filling of vectors r1 and r2 can be done during the BFS itself to reduce the extra iterations.

D. Use fast I/O methods for reading and writing data.

E. Use 'auto' keyword for automatic type inference to make code cleaner and more maintainable.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Replace 'for' loop with range-based 'for' loop in BFS. This uses iterators under the hood and provides O(1) access to elements in the vector, improving runtime performance.

B. Combine the two separate loops used to fill r1 and r2 vectors into a single loop. This reduces the number of iterations from 2N to N, thereby improving performance.

C. Instead of filling vectors r1 and r2 after BFS, fill them during BFS itself. This removes the need for extra iterations over all nodes.

D. Use 'std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)' and 'cin.tie(NULL)' for faster I/O operations.

E. Use 'auto' keyword wherever possible to make code cleaner and more maintainable.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
#define INF (1 << 23)

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int N, M, s, t, u, v;
  cin >> N >> M >> s >> t;
  s--; t--;
  
  vector<vector<int>> G(N);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    cin >> u >> v;
    G[u - 1].push_back(v - 1);
    G[v - 1].push_back(u - 1);
  }
  
  vector<int> d1(N, INF), d2(N, INF), r1(N, 0), r2(N, 0);
  d1[s] = d2[t] = 0;
  
  queue<int> que;
  que.push(s);
  
  while (!que.empty()) {
    auto node = que.front();
    que.pop();
    for (auto neighbor : G[node]) {
      if (d1[neighbor] == INF) {
        d1[neighbor] = d1[node] + 1;
        r1[d1[neighbor]]++;
        que.push(neighbor);
      }
    }
  }
  
  que.push(t);
  
  while (!que.empty()) {
    auto node = que.front();
    que.pop();
    for (auto neighbor : G[node]) {
      if (d2[neighbor] == INF) {
        d2[neighbor] = d2[node] + 1;
        r2[d2[neighbor]]++;
        que.push(neighbor);
      }
    }
  }
  
  int shortest = d1[t];
  long long ret = 0;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < shortest - 1; i++) {
    ret += 1LL * r1[i] * r2[shortest - i - 2];
  }
  
  cout << ret << '\n';
  
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code retains the functionality of the original code while improving its performance and reducing memory usage. The trade-offs include slightly increased code complexity.
