1. Code Analysis:
The provided C++ program seems to be a graph-based problem where it calculates the shortest distance from source to destination and counts the number of nodes at each level of the shortest path. It uses Breadth-First-Search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the graph and find the shortest path. Then, it multiplies the number of nodes at each level from source and destination and adds them all together.

2. Optimization Strategy:
The code is generally well-structured, but there are several areas where performance can be enhanced:

    A. I/O operations: The code uses scanf and printf for input and output operations, which are already quite efficient. However, we can further optimize it by disabling synchronization of C++ and C I/O streams.
    
    B. Loop unrolling: The code uses a for loop to iterate through the adjacency list of each node. We can't do much in this case as the number of adjacent nodes can vary.
    
    C. Redundant Computations: The code calculates shortest path from source to destination and vice versa separately. This can be optimized by calculating them together.
    
    D. Data Structures: The code uses a 2D vector to store the graph, which is efficient in this case. However, we can optimize memory usage by storing graph edges in an adjacency list.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    A. I/O Operations: The standard C++ streams are synchronized with the standard C streams. This synchronization ensures that you can mix calls to functions on <iostream> objects with calls to functions on <cstdio> objects. However, this synchronization can slow down I/O operations. In this case, we can disable it to make I/O operations faster.
    
    B. Loop unrolling: Loop unrolling is a technique that increases a program's speed by reducing or eliminating instructions that control the loop, such as incrementing the loop counter and testing for the loop termination condition. In our case, the number of adjacent nodes of each node can vary. So, it's not possible to unroll the loop here.
    
    C. Redundant Computations: Currently, the code calculates the shortest path from source to destination and vice versa separately. This can be optimized by calculating them together. It will reduce the number of operations and thus improve performance.
    
    D. Data Structures: The code uses a 2D vector to store the graph. It's efficient in this case. However, we can optimize memory usage by storing graph edges in an adjacency list. It will reduce the memory usage as we only store the edges that exist.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#define INF (1 << 23)
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
    cin.tie(NULL); 

    int N, M, s, t, u, v;
    cin >> N >> M >> s >> t;
    s--; t--;
    vector<vector<int>> G(N);

    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
        cin >> u >> v;
        G[u - 1].push_back(v - 1);
        G[v - 1].push_back(u - 1);
    }

    vector<int> d1(N, INF), d2(N, INF);
    d1[s] = d2[t] = 0;
    queue<int> que;
    que.push(s);
    que.push(t);
    bool turn = true; // to switch between s and t

    while (!que.empty()) {
        int node = que.front();
        que.pop();
        for (int i = 0; i < G[node].size(); i++) {
            if (turn && d1[G[node][i]] == INF) {
                d1[G[node][i]] = d1[node] + 1;
                que.push(G[node][i]);
            }
            if (!turn && d2[G[node][i]] == INF) {
                d2[G[node][i]] = d2[node] + 1;
                que.push(G[node][i]);
            }
        }
        turn = !turn;
    }

    int shortest = d1[t];
    vector<int> r1(shortest - 1, 0), r2(shortest - 1, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        if (d1[i] < shortest - 1) r1[d1[i]]++;
        if (d2[i] < shortest - 1) r2[d2[i]]++;
    }

    long long ret = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < shortest - 1; i++) {
        ret += 1LL * r1[i] * r2[shortest - i - 2];
    }

    cout << ret << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
This optimized code should be faster and consume less memory compared to the original code.
