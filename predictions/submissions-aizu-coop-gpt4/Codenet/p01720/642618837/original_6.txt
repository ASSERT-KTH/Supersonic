### Code Analysis
The provided C++ program calculates the number of shortest paths from a source node to a destination node in an undirected graph. It applies Breadth-First Search (BFS) twice, once from the source node and once from the destination node, to determine the distance of each node from the source and destination respectively. It also keeps track of the number of nodes at each distance from the source and destination. The total number of shortest paths is then calculated by multiplying the number of nodes at each distance from the source by the number of nodes at the corresponding distance from the destination.

### Optimization Strategy
1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The current graph representation uses adjacency lists via `vector<vector<int>>`. This is an efficient representation for sparse graphs. However, it can be optimized for graph traversals by using adjacency matrix if the graph is dense.
   
2. **Redundant Computations:** The current implementation of BFS is quite efficient, but it could be optimized further by avoiding repeated computation of `G[node].size()` in the BFS loop. 
   
3. **Loops or Recursive Calls:** The loops in the BFS algorithm and while calculating shortest paths could be made more efficient by using modern C++ features like range-based loops.
   
4. **Compiler Optimizations:** The `#pragma warning(disable : 4996)` directive is used to disable specific compiler warnings. However, it doesn't contribute to performance optimization.

### Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **Avoid repeated computation of `G[node].size()`:** In the BFS loop, `G[node].size()` is computed for each iteration of the loop. This value can be stored in a variable before the loop, thus avoiding the repeated computation.

2. **Use range-based loops:** Range-based loops in C++ can provide cleaner syntax and potential performance improvements by optimizing the way the loop is compiled. We can replace traditional for loops with range-based loops in BFS and when calculating shortest paths.

3. **Avoid unnecessary use of `#pragma warning(disable : 4996)`:** This directive is not needed unless we are using a deprecated or unsafe function which is not the case here. So, we can remove this line.

    scanf("%d", &t);
    t--;
    vector<vector<int>> G(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &u);
        scanf("%d", &v);
        G[u - 1].push_back(v - 1);
        G[v - 1].push_back(u - 1);
    }
    vector<int> d1(N, INF);
    d1[s] = 0;
    vector<int> d2(N, INF);

    while (!que.empty()) {
        int node = que.front();
        que.pop();
        int nodeSize = G[node].size(); // avoid repeated computation
        for (int i = 0; i < nodeSize; i++) {
            if (d1[G[node][i]] == INF) {
                d1[G[node][i]] = d1[node] + 1;
                que.push(G[node][i]);
            }
        }
    }
    que.push(t);
    while (!que.empty()) {
        int node = que.front();
        que.pop();
        int nodeSize = G[node].size(); // avoid repeated computation
        for (int i = 0; i < nodeSize; i++) {
            if (d2[G[node][i]] == INF) {
                d2[G[node][i]] = d2[node] + 1;
                que.push(G[node][i]);
            }
        }
    }
    int shortest = d1[t];
    vector<int> r1(shortest - 1, 0);
    for (const auto &nodeDist : d1) {
        if (nodeDist < shortest - 1) {
            r1[nodeDist]++;
        }
    }
    vector<int> r2(shortest - 1, 0);
    for (const auto &nodeDist : d2) {
        if (nodeDist < shortest - 1) {
            r2[nodeDist]++;
        }
    }
    long long ret = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < shortest - 1; i++) {
        ret += 1LL * r1[i] * r2[shortest - i - 2];
    }
    printf("%lld\n", ret);
    return 0;
}
```
This optimized code performs the same functionality as the original code, but with improved efficiency due to avoided repeated computations and use of range-based loops.
