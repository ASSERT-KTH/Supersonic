Code Analysis:
The code reads 'n' inputs from the user, stores them in a vector, and then prints the minimum value, maximum value, and the sum of those inputs.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The inefficient part here is the usage of three different STL functions: `min_element`, `max_element`, and `accumulate`. Each of these functions traverses the entire vector once, leading to a total of three traversals. A more efficient approach would be to calculate the minimum, maximum, and sum in a single traversal.

2. Avoid using `push_back` in a loop where the size of the container is known beforehand. Instead, we can pre-allocate the memory, which would avoid dynamic resizing of the vector, leading to better time and space efficiency.

3. There is no need for `algorithm` library in the optimized code, so it can be removed.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Instead of using three different functions, we can use a single loop to find the minimum, maximum, and the sum of the values. This reduces the time complexity from O(3n) to O(n).
2. By using `vector::reserve` function, we can allocate the required memory for the vector at once, which avoids the overhead of dynamic resizing during the `push_back` operations.
3. Removing the unnecessary `algorithm` library will reduce the code size and improve the compile-time efficiency.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::vector<long long> a;
  a.reserve(n);  // pre-allocate memory
  
  long long min = LLONG_MAX, max = LLONG_MIN, sum = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    long long ii;
    std::cin >> ii;
    a.push_back(ii);
    
    // calculate min, max and sum
    if (ii < min) min = ii;
    if (ii > max) max = ii;
    sum += ii;
  }

  std::cout << min << " " << max << " " << sum << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces the number of traversals over the vector from 3 to 1, and avoids dynamic resizing of the vector, leading to a more efficient program.
