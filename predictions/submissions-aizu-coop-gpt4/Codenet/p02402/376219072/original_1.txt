1. Code Analysis:

The given code reads a number as input and creates a vector of that size. It then fills the vector with input numbers. Finally, it calculates the minimum element, maximum element, and the sum of all elements and prints them.

The main performance bottleneck in this code is the separate calls to "min_element", "max_element", and "accumulate".

2. Optimization Strategy:

    1. Replace separate calls to "min_element", "max_element", and "accumulate" with a single loop that calculates all three values simultaneously.
    2. Reserve space for the vector before filling it with elements to avoid reallocations.
    3. Use faster I/O methods to reduce the input/output time.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    1. To minimize the number of iterations over the vector, we can replace the separate calls to "min_element", "max_element", and "accumulate" with a single loop that finds the minimum and maximum elements and calculates the sum. This change reduces the time complexity from O(3n) to O(n).
    
    2. We can reserve space for the vector before filling it with elements to avoid reallocations. This change reduces the number of potential memory allocations and deallocations, improving memory usage.
    
    3. We can use faster I/O methods to reduce the input/output time. Using scanf and printf instead of cin and cout can significantly reduce the time taken for input and output operations.
    
4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  std::vector<long long> a(n);
  long long min_val = 1e18; // Initialize with a large value
  long long max_val = -1e18; // Initialize with a small value
  long long sum = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%lld", &a[i]);
    min_val = std::min(min_val, a[i]);
    max_val = std::max(max_val, a[i]);
    sum += a[i];
  }
  
  printf("%lld %lld %lld\n", min_val, max_val, sum);

  return 0;
}
```
