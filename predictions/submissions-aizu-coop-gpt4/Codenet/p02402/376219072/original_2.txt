Code Analysis:
The provided code reads in an integer n, and then reads in n long long integers, storing them in a vector. It then prints the minimum, maximum, and sum of the elements in the vector. The main potential performance issues here are:

1. Repeated traversal of the vector: The min_element, max_element, and accumulate functions all traverse the entire vector. This is inefficient, as we could compute the minimum, maximum, and sum in a single pass.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace multiple passes over the array with a single pass.
2. Preallocate space in the vector. This is a minor optimization, but it can reduce the overhead of memory reallocation when the vector grows.

Optimization Steps:

1. Single Pass: Instead of using min_element, max_element, and accumulate, we can use a single for loop that updates the min, max, and sum. This reduces the time complexity from O(3n) to O(n).

2. Preallocate Vector: Since we know the size of the input (n), we can preallocate space for the vector using the vector constructor. This may save a small amount of time, as it avoids the need for the vector to reallocate and copy its elements as it grows.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    long long n, min, max, sum = 0;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<long long> a(n); // Preallocate space

    for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> a[i];
        if (i == 0) {
            min = max = a[i];
        } else {
            if (a[i] < min) min = a[i];
            if (a[i] > max) max = a[i];
        }
        sum += a[i];
    }

    std::cout << min << " " << max << " " << sum << std::endl;
}
```

This optimizes the code's running time by reducing the number of traversals of the vector from three to one. The memory usage is not significantly improved, but preallocating the vector can slightly reduce the overhead of memory reallocation. The trade-off is a slight increase in code complexity, as we now manually calculate the min, max, and sum.
