### Code Analysis:

The code reads in a number `n`, then it reads `n` integers, and finally it prints the minimum, maximum, and the sum of these integers. The code is pretty simple and straightforward. However, there are some inefficiencies in the code that can be improved.

1. It uses three separate algorithms (`std::min_element`, `std::max_element`, `std::accumulate`) to compute the minimum, maximum, and the sum, each of which traverses entire vector separately. This means the vector is traversed three times.

2. While reading the input, it uses `push_back` to append each integer to the vector. This operation can potentially lead to multiple reallocations and copying of the vector if it grows beyond its current capacity.

### Optimization Strategy:

1. Combine the three separate algorithms into a single loop that computes the minimum, maximum, and the sum in one pass. This reduces the number of times the vector is traversed from three to one.

2. Reserve space in the vector before reading the input to avoid potential reallocations and copying.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Reserve space in the vector: When the size of the vector is known in advance, we can reserve the exact amount of space needed before reading the input. This means that the vector only needs to allocate memory once, and no copying is needed when the vector grows.

2. Combine three separate algorithms: Instead of using three separate algorithms to compute the minimum, maximum, and the sum, we can combine these operations into a single loop. This reduces the number of times the vector is traversed from three to one, which can improve performance significantly for large vectors.

### Trade-offs:

1. Code complexity: The optimized code is slightly more complex because it combines three separate operations into a single loop. However, the performance gain is significant, especially for large vectors.

2. Memory usage: The optimized code reserves space in the vector before reading the input, which means that it uses slightly more memory in the beginning. However, this is compensated by the fact that it avoids potential reallocations and copying.

### Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    std::vector<long long> a(n); // Reserve space in vector

    long long min_val = std::numeric_limits<long long>::max();
    long long max_val = std::numeric_limits<long long>::min();
    long long sum = 0;

    // Read input and compute min, max, and sum in one pass
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> a[i];
        min_val = std::min(min_val, a[i]);
        max_val = std::max(max_val, a[i]);
        sum += a[i];
    }

    std::cout << min_val << " " << max_val << " " << sum << std::endl;
}
```
This optimized code computes the minimum, maximum, and the sum of the integers in one pass, and reserves space in the vector to avoid potential reallocations. It preserves the functionality and output of the original code, and includes comments to explain the changes.
