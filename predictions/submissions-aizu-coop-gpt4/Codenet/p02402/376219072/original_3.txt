Code Analysis:
The code reads an array of long long integers, prints out the smallest element, the largest element, and the sum of all the elements. The potential performance issue here is that the program makes three passes over the array, one for each operation (min, max, and sum). This is unnecessary because all three operations can be performed in a single pass.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Combine the three passes over the array into a single pass. This will reduce the time complexity from O(3n) to O(n).
2. Use reserve() function to allocate memory for the vector before inserting elements to avoid reallocation.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Combine min, max, and sum operations into a single loop: This reduces the number of passes over the array from three to one, which will significantly improve performance for large arrays.

2. Use reserve function for vector: This will preallocate memory for the vector, reducing the time spent on memory allocation during the push_back operations. 

Code Optimization:

Here is the optimized version of the code. It performs the min, max, and sum operations in a single pass over the array, and uses the reserve function to preallocate memory for the vector.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::vector<long long> a;
  a.reserve(n); // Reserve memory for the vector

  long long minVal = LLONG_MAX, maxVal = LLONG_MIN, sum = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    long long ii;
    std::cin >> ii;
    a.push_back(ii);

    // Calculate min, max, and sum in a single loop
    minVal = std::min(minVal, ii);
    maxVal = std::max(maxVal, ii);
    sum += ii;
  }

  std::cout << minVal << " " << maxVal << " " << sum << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

The functionality and output of the code remain the same after the optimization. The only trade-off is a slight increase in code complexity due to the addition of logic for calculating min, max, and sum in the same loop. However, this is a minor trade-off considering the significant performance gain.
