Code Analysis:

The code takes an integer 'n' as input, followed by 'n' integers. It then calculates and outputs the minimum and maximum elements, as well as the sum of all the elements in the list. The potential performance bottlenecks in this code are:

1. The vector 'a' is not preallocated, which could lead to reallocations during the push_back operations. 

2. The code traverses the entire vector three times: once to find the minimum element, once to find the maximum element, and once to compute the sum of the elements. All these operations could be combined into a single loop.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use reserve() method to preallocate memory for the vector.
2. Combine the three separate traversals into a single loop to calculate the minimum, maximum, and the sum.

Optimization Steps:

1. Use the reserve() function to preallocate memory for the vector. This avoids multiple reallocations as elements are added to the vector. This can improve performance as reallocation is an expensive operation.

2. Combine the min_element, max_element, and accumulate calls into a single loop. Each of these functions traverses the entire vector, which means the code is doing three full traversals of the vector. By combining these into a single loop, we reduce this to just one traversal.

3. The trade-off here is that we lose some clarity in the code. The original code is very clear in its intent: find the minimum, find the maximum, and calculate the sum. The optimized code is more efficient but not as easy to understand.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::vector<long long> a;
  a.reserve(n);  // preallocate memory
  
  long long min_val = LLONG_MAX;
  long long max_val = LLONG_MIN;
  long long sum = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    long long ii;
    std::cin >> ii;
    a.push_back(ii);
    
    min_val = std::min(min_val, ii);  // compare with min_val
    max_val = std::max(max_val, ii);  // compare with max_val
    sum += ii;  // add to sum
  }
  
  std::cout << min_val << " " << max_val << " " << sum << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, we are doing all the calculations in a single loop, which significantly reduces the number of iterations. Also, using reserve() to preallocate memory for the vector can avoid potential reallocations, improving the performance of the code.
