**1. Code Analysis:**

The given C++ code reads a vector of `n` `long long` integers from the standard input, computes the minimum value, maximum value and the sum of the numbers, and then prints these values. It uses `std::min_element`, `std::max_element` and `std::accumulate` functions from the Standard Template Library (STL) to get the minimum, maximum and sum.

The main performance issue with this code is that it traverses the entire vector three times to compute the minimum, maximum and sum. This is inefficient because these three operations can be done in a single pass.

**2. Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The data structure used, `std::vector<long long>`, is efficient for this task. Therefore, no changes are proposed in this regard.

2. **Redundant/Unnecessary Computations:** The computations of minimum, maximum, and sum of the elements are redundant. These three operations can be performed in a single pass through the vector instead of three.

3. **Loops or Recursive Calls:** There are no recursive calls. The single loop in the code is necessary for reading the input data and cannot be optimized further.

4. **Compiler Optimizations or Pragma Directives:** No specific compiler optimizations or pragma directives are necessary for this code.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Single Pass Computation of Min, Max, and Sum:** Instead of computing the minimum, maximum, and sum in separate passes through the vector, we can compute these values in a single pass. This reduces the time complexity from O(3n) to O(n). The trade-off is slight increase in code complexity as we'll have to handle these computations manually instead of using STL functions.

**4. Optimized Code Block:**

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  long long min_val = LLONG_MAX; // Initialize to maximum possible value
  long long max_val = LLONG_MIN; // Initialize to minimum possible value
  long long sum = 0;             // Initialize sum to 0

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    long long ii;
    std::cin >> ii;
    min_val = std::min(min_val, ii); // Update min_val if ii is smaller
    max_val = std::max(max_val, ii); // Update max_val if ii is larger
    sum += ii;                       // Add ii to the sum
  }

  std::cout << min_val << " " << max_val << " " << sum << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we calculate the minimum, maximum, and sum in a single loop. This reduces the time complexity of the program from O(3n) to O(n), enhancing the performance of the code. The functionality and output of the original code are preserved, and the code is well-commented for clarity.
