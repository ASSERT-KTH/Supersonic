Code Analysis:
The code reads 'n' long long integers from standard input, stores them in a vector 'a', and then calculates and prints the smallest number, the largest number, and the sum of all numbers. 

The main performance issue is that the code traverses the vector three times: once to find the minimum, once to find the maximum, and once to calculate the sum. Each of these operations is O(n), so the total time complexity is O(3n) = O(n), but we can combine these operations into a single pass, reducing the number of iterations over the vector.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Instead of using separate functions to calculate the minimum, maximum, and sum of the vector, we can do all of these in one loop. This would reduce the traversal of the vector from three times to just once.

2. We can reserve memory for the vector before the loop to avoid reallocation during the push_back operations. Reallocation can be a costly operation as it involves creating a new block of memory, copying the old elements, and then deleting the old memory block.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  // Reserve memory ahead of time for efficiency
  std::vector<long long> a;
  a.reserve(n);
  
  long long min = LLONG_MAX, max = LLONG_MIN, sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    long long num;
    std::cin >> num;
    a.push_back(num);
    
    // Update min, max, and sum in one pass
    min = std::min(min, num);
    max = std::max(max, num);
    sum += num;
  }
  
  std::cout << min << " " << max << " " << sum << std::endl;
}
```

Rationale and Trade-offs:
The optimization improves performance by reducing the number of times the vector is traversed and by avoiding potential reallocations of the vector. The trade-off is that the code becomes slightly more complex due to the additional logic within the loop. However, this should be an acceptable trade-off, especially for large inputs, where the performance gain will be significant.
