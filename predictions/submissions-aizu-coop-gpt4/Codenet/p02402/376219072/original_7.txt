**Code Analysis**

The given C++ program takes an integer `n` as input, then reads `n` long long integers and stores them in a vector `a`. The program then prints out the minimum value, the maximum value, and the sum of all the numbers in the vector.

Potential performance bottlenecks could be:

1. The use of three separate standard library functions (min_element, max_element, and accumulate) which each traverse the entire vector once. This results in the vector being traversed three times in total.

2. The use of the push_back function in a loop to add elements to the vector. This function may cause reallocation of the vector memory, which can be time-consuming for large vectors.

**Optimization Strategy**

1. Instead of using separate functions to find the minimum, maximum, and sum of the vector, we could use a single loop that computes all three values at once.

2. Reserve memory for the vector upfront based on the known size `n` to avoid potential costly reallocations.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. Instead of calling `std::min_element`, `std::max_element`, and `std::accumulate` which each traverse the entire vector, we can compute the minimum, maximum, and sum in a single loop right after reading the numbers. This reduces the number of traversals from three to one, which can significantly improve performance for large vectors.

2. When we know the size of a vector in advance, we can use the `reserve` function to allocate enough memory for the entire vector at once. This avoids potentially costly reallocations when using `push_back` to add elements to the vector.

**Trade-offs**

While this optimization improves performance by reducing the number of vector traversals and potential memory reallocations, it does slightly increase the complexity of the code, as we now have to manually compute the minimum, maximum, and sum. However, this increase in complexity is minimal and well worth the potential performance gains.

**Optimized Code Block**

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  // Reserve memory for the vector upfront
  std::vector<long long> a;
  a.reserve(n);
  
  long long min_val = LLONG_MAX;
  long long max_val = LLONG_MIN;
  long long sum = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    long long ii;
    std::cin >> ii;
    a.push_back(ii);

    // Calculate min, max and sum on the fly
    min_val = std::min(min_val, ii);
    max_val = std::max(max_val, ii);
    sum += ii;
  }

  std::cout << min_val << " " << max_val << " " << sum << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code achieves the same result as the original but should perform better, particularly for large inputs.
