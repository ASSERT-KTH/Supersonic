1. Code Analysis:
The provided C++ program performs some sort of optimization task, possibly a variation of the Knapsack problem, where items have different costs and values. The primary performance bottleneck in this code is the nested loop inside the `dpru` function, which has a time complexity of O(n*m) - where n is the number of items and m is the maximum cost. This can be costly when n and m are large. 

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Data Structures: The code uses arrays to store costs and values of items. This is efficient. No changes required here.
   - Redundant Computations: The function `max_swap` is called in a loop, which results in the same element being compared multiple times. This could be optimized.
   - Loops: The nested loop in the `dpru` function is the most time-consuming part of the code. This cannot be unrolled or made more efficient as it is part of a dynamic programming solution that requires each cell to be filled.
   - Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations such as `-O3` flag or using pragma directives like `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")` can be used.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   - Instead of calling `max_swap` repeatedly inside the loop, we can directly use `std::max` function in the assignment. This would reduce the function call overhead.
   - We can use compiler optimizations. By using optimization flags like `-O3`, the compiler will automatically optimize the code for speed. Additionally, we can use pragma directives like `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")` at the beginning of the code which tells the compiler to optimize the code as much as possible. This can lead to significant speedups.
   - Note that compiler optimizations may increase the size of the executable and may make debugging more challenging. Also, some optimizations may not be portable between different compilers or platforms.

typedef long long ll;

const double PI = acos(-1.0);
const int dx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
const int dy[] = {1, 0, -1, 0};

int n, m;

int dpru(int *c, int *v) {
  int dp[333][333];
  CLEAR(dp, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= m; ++j) {
      dp[i + 1][j] = dp[i][j];
      if (j >= c[i])
        dp[i + 1][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 1][j - c[i]] + v[i]);
    }
  }
  return dp[n][m];
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> n >> m) {
    int c[333], v[3][333];
    rep(i, n) {
      string s;
      int t;
      getline(cin, s);
      getline(cin, s);
      cin >> t;
      c[i] = t;
      rep(j, 3) cin >> v[j][i];
    }
    int res = 0;
    rep(i, 3) res = max(res, dpru(c, v[i]));
    cout << res << endl;
  }
}
```

In this optimized version, we have removed the `max_swap` function and used `std::max` directly in the `dpru` function. Also, we use compiler optimization flags and pragma directives for better performance.
