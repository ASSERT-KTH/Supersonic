Code Analysis:
The program seems to be implementing a knapsack problem with multiple types of items. It reads the number of items and the maximum capacity, then reads the cost and values of each item for three types of items. After that, it calculates the maximum value of the items that can be put into the knapsack without exceeding the maximum capacity.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient data structures: The program uses fixed-size arrays for storing the cost and values of the items. Using dynamic arrays like std::vector would be more memory-efficient since they can be resized according to the number of items.

2. Redundant computations: The program calculates the maximum value of the knapsack for each type of item separately. We can store the maximum value after each calculation and only update it if the new value is greater, eliminating the need for the subsequent max_swap function calls.

3. Loops: The nested for loop in the dpru function is necessary for the dynamic programming algorithm and cannot be optimized without changing the algorithm.

4. Compiler optimizations: Using the -O3 optimization flag when compiling the code can result in a significant performance improvement.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the fixed-size arrays c and v with std::vector. This will make the program more memory-efficient since vectors are dynamically resizable.

2. Instead of using the max_swap function to update the maximum value after each calculation, store the maximum value in a variable and update it only if the new value is greater. This will reduce the number of function calls and improve the performance.

3. Use the -O3 optimization flag when compiling the code.

Trade-offs: 

Optimizing the code may increase its complexity slightly. However, the performance improvement will be significant and worth the minor increase in complexity.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int dpru(vector<int> &c, vector<int> &v, int n, int m) {
    int dp[333][333];
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= m; ++j) {
            dp[i + 1][j] = dp[i][j];
            if (j >= c[i])
                dp[i + 1][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i+1][j-c[i]]+v[i]);
        }
    }
    return dp[n][m];
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    while (cin >> n >> m) {
        vector<int> c(n);
        vector<vector<int>> v(3, vector<int>(n));
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            string s;
            int t;
            getline(cin, s);
            getline(cin, s);
            cin >> t;
            c[i] = t;
            for(int j = 0; j < 3; ++j) cin >> v[j][i];
        }
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) res = max(res, dpru(c, v[i], n, m));
        cout << res << endl;
    }
}
```
This version of the code is optimized for efficiency, with improvements in memory usage and running time.
