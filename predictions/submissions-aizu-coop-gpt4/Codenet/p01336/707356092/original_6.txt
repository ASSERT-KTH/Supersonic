1. Code Analysis:
   The provided code seems to be implementing a kind of knapsack problem, where it is trying to maximize the value of idols within a given capacity. The main potential performance bottlenecks are in the triple loop where the program is calculating the maximum value obtainable for each capacity. There is no apparent inefficient memory usage, but there may be some redundant computations in this loop as well. 

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Minimize the number of loops: The third innermost loop seems unnecessary and can be removed.
   - Redundant computations: The code is computing the maximum value for each capacity, then later on it is computing the maximum value across all capacities and categories. This could be computed in the first loop itself, thereby saving computations.
   - Using appropriate data structures: The vector "idols" can be replaced by an array to save some memory overhead introduced by vectors.
   
3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Remove the third loop: The third loop is used to calculate the maximum value obtainable for each idol at different capacities. However, this is not necessary as we can simply divide the current capacity by the idol's cost to get the maximum number of that idol that can be taken. This simplifies the code and reduces the number of iterations significantly.
   2. Compute maximum value in the first loop: Instead of iterating over the capacities and categories again to find the maximum value, we can simply keep track of the maximum value while calculating the maximum value obtainable for each capacity. This saves a significant amount of computation.
   3. Replace vector with array: The vector "idols" is used to store the idols' information. However, since the number of idols is not going to change during the execution of the program, we can use an array instead of a vector to save some memory overhead.

Please note that the actual improvement in speed and memory usage would depend on the specific inputs and the compiler optimizations used. Additionally, the trade-off here is that the code may become a bit more complex due to the extra calculations and the usage of array instead of vector. However, the speed and memory usage improvements can be significant, especially for large inputs.
