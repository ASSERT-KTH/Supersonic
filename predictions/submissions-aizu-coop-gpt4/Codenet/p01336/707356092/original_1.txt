1. Code Analysis:

The given code is a typical dynamic programming problem where we are trying to maximize the total value of idols we can take given a constraint on total cost. The state of our dynamic programming solution is defined by the total cost we have used and the type of the idol. For each idol, we try all possible quantities we can take given the cost, and update our dynamic programming solution accordingly.

The main performance bottleneck is the three nested loops in the dynamic programming solution. The outer loop iterates over all possible costs, the middle loop iterates over all idols, and the inner loop iterates over all possible quantities of the current idol we can take given the cost.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Inefficient Data Structures: The current data structures are appropriate for the problem.

B. Redundant Computations: The computation of `i - idols[j].mC * k` is repeated three times for each idol and each possible cost. This computation could be performed once and stored in a variable for later use.

C. Loops and Recursive Calls: The inner loop is a prime candidate for optimization. It's iterating over all possible quantities of an idol given the cost, but we could potentially avoid some of these iterations through an improved strategy.

D. Compiler Optimizations: Inline functions or pragma directives do not seem to be applicable in this case.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    
    1. Redundant Computation Optimization: We can store the result of `i - idols[j].mC * k` in a variable for later use. This reduces the number of arithmetic operations we perform in each iteration of the innermost loop.

    2. Loop Optimization: We can optimize the inner loop by noticing that if `dp[i][0] = dp[i - idols[j].mC * k][0] + idols[j].mV * k` for some `k`, then `dp[i][0]` will be at least as large for all larger `k`. Therefore, once we find a `k` for which `dp[i][0] < dp[i - idols[j].mC * k][0] + idols[j].mV * k`, we can break out of the inner loop early. The same applies to `dp[i][1]` and `dp[i][2]`.

Trade-offs: The main trade-off with this optimization is that the code will become slightly more complex due to the additional break statements in the inner loop. However, this increase in complexity is offset by the potential performance gain.

Here's the optimized version of the code:
