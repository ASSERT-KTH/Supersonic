### Code Analysis
This C++ program appears to be a type of dynamic programming problem, perhaps a variant of the knapsack problem. We have a number of idols, each with a cost, and three distinct values (mV, mD, mL). The goal seems to be to maximize the total value of these three properties without exceeding a given cost M. The program reads the input, which consists of the number of idols and the maximum cost, followed by the name and the four properties of each idol. The program then performs dynamic programming to find the maximum value that can be obtained for each possible cost up to M.

The main performance bottleneck in this code is the triplicate nested loop structure in the dynamic programming solution. The outer loop iterates over the costs up to M, the middle loop iterates over each idol, and the inner loop iterates over multiples of each idol's cost up to the current cost limit. This results in an overall time complexity of O(N * M^2), which is quite high.

### Optimization Strategy
1. **Inefficient Data Structure Optimization:** The `idols` vector is not inefficient, but we can avoid storing the name of each idol since it is not used anywhere in the code. This can save a considerable amount of memory if the names are long and there are many idols.
2. **Redundant Computation Optimization:** The inner loop of the dynamic programming solution can be removed by directly calculating the number of multiples of each idol's cost that can be afforded within the current cost limit. This can be done using integer division, which is a much faster operation than loop iteration.
3. **Loop Optimization:** The dynamic programming solution only depends on the previous cost, so it can be optimized to only keep the current and previous cost's data in memory at a time, reducing the memory usage from O(M) to O(1).
4. **Compiler Optimization:** Compiler optimization flags such as `-O2` or `-O3` can be used to further optimize the code at the machine level. This could potentially result in more efficient utilization of the CPU and memory, but the specific effects depend on the compiler and the system architecture.

### Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **Data Structure Optimization:** Remove the `mName` property from the `Data` class and the corresponding code that reads the idol names from the input. This reduces the memory usage of each `Data` object by the size of a string, which can be considerable.
2. **Computation Optimization:** Replace the inner loop of the dynamic programming solution with a direct calculation of the number of multiples of each idol's cost that can be afforded within the current cost limit. This is done using the integer division operation `i / idols[j].mC`, which is much faster than iterating over each multiple with a loop.
3. **Loop Optimization:** Modify the dynamic programming solution to only keep the current and previous cost's data in memory at a time, reducing the memory usage from O(M) to O(1). This is done by maintaining two arrays `dp[2][3]` instead of `dp[301][3]`, and using the variable `cur` to keep track of the current cost index. The `dp` array is updated in place for each cost, and the values for the previous cost are overwritten after they are no longer needed.
4. **Compiler Optimization:** When compiling the code, use the `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flag to enable automatic optimization by the compiler.
