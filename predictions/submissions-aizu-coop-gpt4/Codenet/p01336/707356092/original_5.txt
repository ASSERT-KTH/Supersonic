1. Code Analysis:

The current code is a kind of dynamic programming (DP) code which is used to determine the maximum value of three kinds of attributes (mV, mD, mL) when buying idols with limited money (M). Each idol has its own cost, and three attributes. The code maintains a DP table dp[i][j] which represents the maximum value of attribute j that can be achieved with i units of money.

2. Optimization Strategy:

   A. The current DP state transition contains three nested loops which makes the time complexity approximately O(n^2 * m), where n is the number of idols and m is the total amount of money. This is quite high and can be optimized.
   
   B. The current code unnecessarily calculates the same states again and again, which is redundant and can be optimized.
   
   C. The code is using strings for storing idol names which is unnecessary as the names are not used anywhere in the computations or the final output.
   
   D. The code is using an inefficient way of inputting data, which can be improved by using fast I/O methods.
   
3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   A. The nested loop for k in line 54 can be removed by directly using the equation which it represents. For each idol, we can directly calculate the number of that idol we can buy with the current money and then update the DP table accordingly. This reduces the time complexity to O(n*m).
   
   B. Instead of calculating the same states again and again, we can just store the previously calculated states and use them when needed. This can be achieved by changing the order of the nested DP loops, first iterating over the idols and then over the amount of money.
   
   C. Remove the unnecessary string variables as they are not used anywhere in the computations or the final output.
   
   D. Use the fast I/O methods to input the data to speed up the program.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

class Data {
public:
  int mC, mV, mD, mL;
  Data(int _c, int _v, int _d, int _l) {
    mC = _c;
    mV = _v;
    mD = _d;
    mL = _l;
  }
};

int dp[301][3];

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // Fast I/O
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int N, M;
  while (cin >> N >> M) {
    vector<Data> idols;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      int C, V, D, L;
      cin >> C >> V >> D >> L;
      idols.push_back(Data(C, V, D, L));
    }
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
      for (int i = idols[j].mC; i <= M; i++) {
        int k = i / idols[j].mC;
        dp[i][0] = max(dp[i][0], dp[i - idols[j].mC * k] + idols[j].mV * k);
        dp[i][1] = max(dp[i][1], dp[i - idols[j].mC * k] + idols[j].mD * k);
        dp[i][2] = max(dp[i][2], dp[i - idols[j].mC * k] + idols[j].mL * k);
      }
    }
    int maxv = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= M; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        maxv = max(dp[i][j], maxv);
      }
    }
    cout << maxv << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code has a reduced time complexity of O(n*m) and reduced space complexity by removing unnecessary string variables. However, the trade-off is that the code now does not store and does not output the names of the idols.
