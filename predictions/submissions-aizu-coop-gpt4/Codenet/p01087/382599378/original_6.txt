Looking at the provided C++ code, here are a few performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities:

1. Use of `std::vector<int> term` in the `solve` function: Each recursion creates a new vector, which involves dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. This could be a performance bottleneck, particularly for deep recursions.

2. The use of `std::accumulate` function: For sum or multiplication of elements, a simple loop would be more efficient than `std::accumulate`.

3. The `all(a)` macro: It is used to get the `begin` and `end` of a container. Using `begin(a)` and `end(a)` directly is more efficient and clear.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace `std::vector<int> term` with `std::array<int, MAX_SIZE> term`, where `MAX_SIZE` is a constant that is large enough to hold all possible terms. This change avoids dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in each recursion.

2. Replace `std::accumulate` with a simple loop.

3. Replace `all(a)` macro with `begin(a)` and `end(a)`.

4. Use pre-increment (++i) instead of post-increment (i++) whenever possible. Pre-increment avoids unnecessary copy.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < int(n); ++i)

const int MAX_SIZE = 1000; // Define a large enough size

int solve(vector<string> &s, int n, int &y, int x) {
  if (isdigit(s[y][x]))
    return s[++y][x] - '0';
  char op = s[y][x];
  ++y, ++x;
  array<int, MAX_SIZE> term; // Use array instead of vector
  int term_count = 0;
  while (y < n && (int)s[y].size() > x) {
    term[term_count++] = solve(s, n, y, x);
  }
  if (op == '+') {
    int sum = 0;
    // Replace accumulate with a simple loop
    for(int i = 0; i < term_count; ++i)
      sum += term[i];
    return sum;
  }
  else {
    int product = 1;
    // Replace accumulate with a simple loop
    for(int i = 0; i < term_count; ++i)
      product *= term[i];
    return product;
  }
}

int main(void) {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    vector<string> s(n);
    rep(i, n) cin >> s[i];
    int y = 0;
    cout << solve(s, n, y, 0) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The `MAX_SIZE` needs to be large enough for the worst case scenario. If the maximum size cannot be determined, or it is too large, a dynamic data structure (like `std::vector`) might still be the best option despite its overhead. The key is to balance between memory usage and performance.
