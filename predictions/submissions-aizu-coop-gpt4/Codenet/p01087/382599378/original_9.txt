Code Analysis:
This C++ program takes an input of multiple strings representing a simple arithmetic expression and evaluates it. The arithmetic expression is stored in a 2D grid where every cell either contains a digit or an operation '+' or '*'. The program then recursively evaluates the expression and prints the result.

The main function of the program is the `solve` function, which recursively parses the arithmetic expression and calculates the result. If a cell contains a digit, it directly returns the integer value of the digit. If it contains an operation, it recursively calls `solve` function for the cells in the same column below until it hits a row where the cell in the same column is empty. It then applies the operation to all the results obtained from the recursive calls and returns the final result.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structure: The data structure used to store the results of recursive calls in the `solve` function is a `vector<int>`. However, we don't need to store all the results since we are just applying an operation (either addition or multiplication) to them. We could just keep a running total or product and apply the operation to each result as we get it. This would reduce the memory usage of the program.

2. Redundant Computation: The program is using the `accumulate` function from the `<numeric>` library to calculate the sum or the product of the elements in the `term` vector. This function traverses the entire vector which is unnecessary because we could do this calculation while getting the results of the recursive calls.

Here's how we can optimize the code:

1. Replace the `vector<int> term` with an `int result` variable to store the running total or product. Initialize this variable with 0 if the operation is '+' or 1 if the operation is '*'.

2. In the while loop, apply the operation to `result` and the return value of the `solve` function call directly. If the operation is '+', add the return value to `result`. If the operation is '*', multiply `result` with the return value.

3. Return `result` at the end of the function.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < int(n); ++i)

int solve(vector<string> &s, int n, int &y, int x) {
  if (isdigit(s[y][x]))
    return s[y++][x] - '0';
  char op = s[y][x];
  ++y, ++x;
  int result = (op == '+') ? 0 : 1;  // Initialize result
  while (y < n && (int)s[y].size() > x) {
    int term = solve(s, n, y, x);
    if(op == '+')
      result += term;  // Add term to result
    else
      result *= term;  // Multiply term with result
  }
  return result;
}

int main(void) {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    vector<string> s(n);
    rep(i, n) cin >> s[i];
    int y = 0;
    cout << solve(s, n, y, 0) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program has the same functionality as the original program but uses less memory and has less redundant computation. The trade-off here is a slight increase in complexity in the `solve` function where we need to perform the operation manually. However, this increase in complexity is relatively small compared to the performance gain.
