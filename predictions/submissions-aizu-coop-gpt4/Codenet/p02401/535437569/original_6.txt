This is a very simple program written in C++. It reads in pairs of integers and an operation symbol from the standard input, performs the operation, and then outputs the result. The operation symbols are '+', '-', '/', and '*' for addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication respectively. The program exits when it reads the symbol '?'.

Although the code is simple and straightforward, there are still some areas where we can optimize it for better performance:

1. **Code Analysis:**

    a. The program continuously checks for different operation symbols using if-else statements. This could be optimized using a switch case, which is faster than if-else statements when dealing with multiple conditions.

    b. The program uses scanf and printf for I/O operations. These are slower compared to cin and cout in C++. We can use ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) to speed up I/O operations.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**

    a. Replace if-else statements with a switch case for faster execution.

    b. Use ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) to speed up I/O operations.

    c. Optimize division operation to avoid division by zero.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

    a. **Use Switch Case:** The original code checks each operation symbol using if-else statements. This is inefficient as every condition will be checked sequentially. By using a switch case, we can jump directly to the correct operation. This is faster and more efficient when dealing with multiple conditions. However, this might slightly increase the complexity of the code.

    b. **Faster I/O Operations:** The original code uses scanf and printf for I/O operations. These are slower compared to cin and cout in C++. We can make I/O operations faster by using ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(NULL), and cout.tie(NULL). This will speed up cin and cout to the speed of scanf and printf. However, it will disable the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams, so they should not be mixed in the same program.

    c. **Avoid Division by Zero:** The original code does not check if the divisor is zero before performing a division operation. We should add a check to avoid division by zero, which could crash the program.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL); 
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  int x, y;
  char z;
  while (true) {
    cin >> x >> z >> y;
    switch(z) {
      case '+':
        cout << x + y << "\n";
        break;
      case '-':
        cout << x - y << "\n";
        break;
      case '/':
        if(y != 0)
          cout << x / y << "\n";
        else
          cout << "Cannot divide by zero\n";
        break;
      case '*':
        cout << x * y << "\n";
        break;
      case '?':
        return 0;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
