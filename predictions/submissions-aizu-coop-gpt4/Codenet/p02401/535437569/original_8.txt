Code Analysis:
This is a simple calculator program written in C++. It takes two integers and an operator as input and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. The program has a `while (1)` loop, which makes it an infinite loop. It only breaks when the operator input is '?'. There are no obvious performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usage in this code. However, there is some room for minor optimizations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Instead of using multiple 'if' conditions, we can use a 'switch' statement which is generally faster because it uses a jump table in the background.
2. Instead of performing the arithmetic operations inside the printf function, we can perform the operation before it. It's a small optimization but can make a difference in complex programs.

Optimized Code Block:

```C++
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int x, y, result;
  char z;
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %c %d", &x, &z, &y);
    switch(z) {
      case '?':
        return 0;
      case '+':
        result = x + y;
        break;
      case '-':
        result = x - y;
        break;
      case '/':
        result = x / y;
        break;
      case '*':
        result = x * y;
        break;
      default:
        continue;
    }
    printf("%d\n", result);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replaced multiple 'if' conditions with a 'switch' statement. The 'switch' statement uses a jump table in the background and jumps directly to the case that matches the value, while 'if' statement checks each condition sequentially. Thus, 'switch' is generally faster when there are more than 2 conditions.

2. Moved the arithmetic operation out of the printf function. This helps in separating the calculation from the print operation, which can aid in debugging and is a good programming practice. It might also slightly improve performance in more complex programs.

3. Added a default case in the 'switch' statement. It does nothing and just continues to the next iteration of the loop. This is to handle the scenario when the operator input is none of '+', '-', '/', '*', or '?'. It's not a performance optimization but a safety measure to prevent unexpected behavior.

Trade-offs: The optimized code is slightly longer and a bit more complex due to the addition of the 'switch' statement. However, its performance is potentially better, especially when the number of conditions increases.
