Looking at the code, it seems that the given program accepts an expression from the terminal, evaluates it, and prints the result. It continues to do so until it receives an expression with '?' as the operator. While the overall structure of the code is well-organized, there are several areas where performance and efficiency can be improved.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. Use of the `scanf` and `printf` functions: These are standard I/O functions in C/C++ and are generally slower than their counterparts in C++, i.e., `cin` and `cout`. For a program that does a lot of I/O operations, this can be a performance bottleneck.

2. Conditional Statements: The use of multiple `else if` statements can be inefficient due to multiple branch predictions by the CPU. Using a `switch` statement here would be more efficient as it reduces the number of branch predictions and directly jumps to the appropriate case.

**Optimized Code:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    int x, y;
    char z;

    while (1) {
        cin >> x >> z >> y;
        if (z == '?') {
            return 0;
        }
        switch (z) {
            case '+':
                cout << x + y << '\n';
                break;
            case '-':
                cout << x - y << '\n';
                break;
            case '/':
                cout << x / y << '\n';
                break;
            case '*':
                cout << x * y << '\n';
                break;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
**Explanation:**

1. `ios::sync_with_stdio(false);`: This line disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. By default, all standard streams are synchronized, which in practice allows you to mix calls to functions from the C and C++ standard libraries that perform input and output operations on the standard streams. When synchronization is turned off, C++ streams are allowed to have their own independent buffers, which can potentially speed up the I/O operations.

2. `cin.tie(NULL);` and `cout.tie(NULL);`: By default, `cin` is tied to `cout` to ensure a sensible order of operations when reading and writing to the standard streams. This line unties `cin` from `cout`, which can result in faster I/O operations because there's no need to flush `cout` before every I/O operation to `cin`.

3. Multiple `else if` statements are replaced with `switch` statement: A `switch` statement can be more efficient than a series of `if-else` statements in programs with many branch operations because it reduces the number of branch predictions and directly jumps to the appropriate case.

**Trade-offs:**

1. Disabling synchronization and untying `cin` and `cout` can lead to problems if you are mixing C-style and C++-style I/O operations or if you're relying on the order of operations between `cin` and `cout`.

2. Using `switch` statements makes the code cleaner and more efficient. However, `switch` statements can only be used with integer and character types and not with floating-point or string types. In this case, it's not a problem because we're only dealing with character operators.
