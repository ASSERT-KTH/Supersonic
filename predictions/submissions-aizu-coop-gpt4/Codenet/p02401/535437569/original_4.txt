This program is a simple calculator that reads in two integers and an operator from the command line, performs the arithmetic operation specified by the operator, and prints the result. It continues to do this in an infinite loop until it encounters a '?' character as the operator, at which point it terminates.

Code Analysis:
The code in its current form is quite simple and efficient. It does not involve complex computations, large data structures or nested loops that can be major sources of inefficiencies. However, there are few areas where we can still make improvements.

1. It repeatedly uses `printf` and `scanf` functions inside the loop. These are expensive I/O operations, and their usage can be optimized.
2. The `if-else` chain for operator checking can also be optimized using a switch case statement. Switch statements are generally more efficient than `if-else` chains when there are more than a few conditions to check.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Reduce I/O operations: `printf` and `scanf` functions can be replaced with faster I/O operations using `getchar_unlocked` and `putchar_unlocked`, which are faster as they avoid the overhead of locking the I/O stream.
2. Replace `if-else` chain with `switch` statement: The `if-else` chain can be replaced with a `switch` statement for checking the operator. This will be more efficient because `switch` statements use a jump table in memory, allowing the program to directly jump to the case for the matched condition, rather than having to evaluate each condition in sequence.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replacing `scanf` and `printf` with `getchar_unlocked` and `putchar_unlocked`: This will speed up the I/O operations in the program. We will have to write separate functions to read integers and print them. These functions will use `getchar_unlocked` and `putchar_unlocked` to read and write characters one by one, and convert them to integers or convert integers to characters as required. This will avoid the overhead of locking the I/O stream.

2. Replacing `if-else` chain with `switch` statement: This will optimize the time taken for checking the operator. For each operator, we will have a separate case, and the operation corresponding to that operator will be performed in that case. This will be faster than the `if-else` chain as it avoids the need to check each condition in sequence.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int read_int() {
  int num = 0;
  char c = getchar_unlocked();
  while (c < '0' || c > '9') c = getchar_unlocked();
  while (c >= '0' && c <= '9') {
    num = (num << 3) + (num << 1) + c - '0';
    c = getchar_unlocked();
  }
  return num;
}

void print_int(int num) {
  if (num == 0) {
    putchar_unlocked('0');
    putchar_unlocked('\n');
    return;
  }
  char buf[11]; 
  buf[10] = '\n';
  int i = 9;
  while (num) {
    buf[i--] = num % 10 + '0';
    num /= 10;
  }
  while (buf[i] != '\n') putchar_unlocked(buf[++i]);
}

int main() {
  int x, y;
  char z;
  while (1) {
    x = read_int();
    z = getchar_unlocked();
    y = read_int();
    switch (z) {
    case '+':
      print_int(x + y);
      break;
    case '-':
      print_int(x - y);
      break;
    case '/':
      print_int(x / y);
      break;
    case '*':
      print_int(x * y);
      break;
    case '?':
      return 0;
    default:
      break;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code should run faster than the original code due to faster I/O operations and faster operator checking. However, it is more complex than the original code due to the additional functions for reading and printing integers. This is a trade-off that has to be considered.
