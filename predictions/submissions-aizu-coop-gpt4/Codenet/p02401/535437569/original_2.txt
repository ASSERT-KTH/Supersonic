The provided code is a simple calculator program that reads an expression from the standard input and writes the result to the standard output. It continuously reads expressions in a loop until it encounters an expression with '?' operator. 

The code is quite simple and straightforward, and there might not be much room for performance optimization. However, we can propose a few minor improvements to make the code more efficient and clean.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. Reduce the number of branches with a switch-case: A switch-case statement can be more efficient than multiple "else if" statements in some cases. This is because it uses a jump table internally, which can make the program run faster, especially when there are many branches. 

2. Avoid division by zero: The code currently does not check if 'y' is zero before performing division, which can lead to undefined behavior. It's important to handle this case.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```c++
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int x, y;
  char z;
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %c %d", &x, &z, &y);
    if (z == '?') {
      return 0;
    } 
    switch(z) {
      case '+':
        printf("%d\n", x + y);
        break;
      case '-':
        printf("%d\n", x - y);
        break;
      case '/':
        if(y != 0) {
          printf("%d\n", x / y);
        } else {
          printf("Error: Division by zero\n");
        }
        break;
      case '*':
        printf("%d\n", x * y);
        break;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
**Explanation of the changes:**

1. The multiple "else if" statements were replaced with a switch-case statement. This potentially reduces the number of condition checks and is generally considered cleaner and more readable.

2. Before performing division, we check if 'y' is zero. If 'y' is zero, we print an error message instead of performing the division. This avoids a potential division by zero error. 

These changes make the code more efficient and robust while preserving the functionality and output of the original code. These optimizations have very little trade-off in terms of code complexity while providing potential improvements in efficiency and robustness.
