Code Analysis:

The provided code is a calculator program that reads two numbers and an operation from the input, performs the operation, and prints the result. It continues to do so in an infinite loop until it encounters a '?' operation, at which point it terminates.

This code is fairly optimized, but there are potential improvements:

1. The program is currently using multiple if-else statements to determine the operation to perform. This is not the most efficient way to handle this situation, since each else-if statement will be checked sequentially until a match is found.

2. The printf function is called multiple times with the same format ("%d\n"). This redundancy can be reduced.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a switch-case statement instead of multiple if-else statements. Switch-case statements are generally more efficient for this type of situation, as the compiler can optimize them into a jump table, resulting in faster execution.

2. Instead of calling printf inside each case, store the result in a variable and print it after the switch-case block. This reduces the redundancy of calling the same function with the same format multiple times.

Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int x, y, result;
  char z;
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %c %d", &x, &z, &y);
    if (z == '?') {
      return 0;
    }
    switch(z) {
      case '+':
        result = x + y;
        break;
      case '-':
        result = x - y;
        break;
      case '/':
        result = x / y;
        break;
      case '*':
        result = x * y;
        break;
    }
    printf("%d\n", result);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These changes should maintain the same functionality while slightly improving the performance of the code. The trade-off is minimal, as the code is still easily understandable.
