The provided program performs different mathematical operations based on the operator input. The program continuously reads from standard input until it encounters '?', at which point it terminates.

Looking at the code, there isn't much scope for optimization in terms of time complexity, memory usage, or data structures. The code runs in constant time and memory for each operation, and the data structures used (basic types like int and char) are already optimal for their purpose. However, there are some improvements we can make to enhance the code efficiency and readability.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Switch Case instead of If-Else: Replace multiple if-else statements with a switch-case statement. It's more efficient and readable when dealing with many conditions, especially when these conditions involve comparing a variable to different constant values.
2. Removing unnecessary else: The else keywords after return or continue statements are unnecessary because the function or loop iteration would have already exited if the condition was true. Removing these makes the code cleaner and easier to read.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int x, y;
  char z;
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %c %d", &x, &z, &y);
    switch (z) {
      case '+':
        printf("%d\n", x + y);
        break;
      case '-':
        printf("%d\n", x - y);
        break;
      case '/':
        printf("%d\n", x / y);
        break;
      case '*':
        printf("%d\n", x * y);
        break;
      case '?':
        return 0;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code is more readable and slightly more efficient than the original. The functionality and output of the original code are preserved. The switch statement makes the code cleaner and marginally faster by avoiding multiple if-else condition evaluations. The 'else' keywords have been removed as they were unnecessary after 'return' statements.
