1. Code Analysis:
The provided code is a simple calculator program that takes two integer inputs and an operator, then performs the corresponding operation and prints the result. It continues to do this in an infinite loop until it encounters a '?' operator, at which point it returns 0 and terminates.

The code is relatively straightforward, with a single loop and no complex data structures or recursive calls. However, there are still a few potential areas for optimization.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. Use of a switch-case statement instead of multiple if-else statements: The if-else ladder can be replaced with a switch-case structure to make the code more readable and slightly faster. Switch-case statements are generally faster because they use a jump table in the background, which can potentially speed up the execution.
   
   2. Avoid division by zero: In the case where z is '/', the program doesn't handle the scenario where y is zero, which would cause a divide by zero error. Adding a check for this condition can prevent this error from occurring.

   3. Use of fgets instead of scanf: The scanf function is generally slower and less safe than fgets. Swapping scanf for fgets and then parsing the input can increase performance and safety.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Replace the if-else ladder with a switch-case statement: This change makes the code more readable and possibly faster. However, the performance gain might be negligible for a small number of cases like this.
      
   2. Check for division by zero: Adding a simple if statement to check whether y is zero before dividing can prevent a divide by zero error. The trade-off here is adding an extra conditional check, which can slightly slow down the code, but the benefit of avoiding a potential runtime error outweighs this minor slowdown.
      
   3. Swap scanf for fgets and sscanf: This change increases performance and safety. The trade-off is that the code becomes slightly more complex and harder to read.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```C++
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int x, y;
  char z;
  char input[20];
  while (1) {
    fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);
    sscanf(input, "%d %c %d", &x, &z, &y);
    switch (z) {
      case '?':
        return 0;
      case '+':
        printf("%d\n", x + y);
        break;
      case '-':
        printf("%d\n", x - y);
        break;
      case '/':
        if (y != 0) {
          printf("%d\n", x / y);
        } else {
          printf("Error: Division by zero\n");
        }
        break;
      case '*':
        printf("%d\n", x * y);
        break;
      default:
        printf("Unknown operator '%c'\n", z);
        break;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, the improvements made include the use of a switch-case statement, a check for division by zero, and swapping scanf for fgets and sscanf for a safer and potentially faster input parsing.
