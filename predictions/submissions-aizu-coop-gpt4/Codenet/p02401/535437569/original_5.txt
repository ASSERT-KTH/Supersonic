**1. Code Analysis:**

The given C++ program reads a pair of integers and an operator from standard input, performs the operation, and prints the result. It continues to do this in an infinite loop until it reads a '?' character as the operator. 

The program seems to be fairly optimized as it is. There are no large data structures that could be made more efficient, nor are there any particularly complex computations. However, there are still a few minor improvements that could be made.

**2. Optimization Strategy:**

A. Use a switch-case statement instead of multiple if-else statements: In the existing code, every operation (i.e., '+', '-', '/', '*') is checked sequentially until the right one is found. Using a switch-case statement would be slightly faster as it uses a lookup table under the hood, which can be more efficient than several if-else conditions.

B. Minimize function calls: The code calls the printf function multiple times, which can be reduced to a single call by first computing the result based on the operation and then printing the result.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

A1. A switch-case statement is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed based on the value of a variable or expression. Instead of checking each condition sequentially as in an if-else ladder, the switch-case statement directly finds the matching case using a lookup table, which makes it faster.

A2. While it's not guaranteed the switch-case statement will always perform better than if-else, in this case, it makes the code cleaner and more readable. And the performance gain, though minor, is a bonus.

B1. Currently, the printf function is being called multiple times within each if-else block. Each function call has a certain overhead, and by reducing the number of function calls, we can improve the performance of the code.

B2. The trade-off here is slightly increased code complexity because we need to introduce a new variable to store the result of the computation. However, the performance gain from reducing function calls outweighs this minor increase in complexity.

**4. Optimized Code Block:**

Here is the optimized version of the given code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int x, y, result;
  char z;
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %c %d", &x, &z, &y);
    if (z == '?') {
      return 0;
    }

    switch (z) {
      case '+':
        result = x + y;
        break;
      case '-':
        result = x - y;
        break;
      case '/':
        result = x / y;
        break;
      case '*':
        result = x * y;
        break;
    }
    
    printf("%d\n", result);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, I've replaced the if-else ladder with a switch-case statement and computed the result before calling the printf function. This reduces the number of function calls and potentially improves performance.
