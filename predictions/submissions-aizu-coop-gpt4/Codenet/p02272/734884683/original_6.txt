1. Code Analysis:

The provided code is a C++ implementation of the merge sort algorithm. It reads an array of integers from the user, sorts it using the merge sort algorithm and prints out the sorted array.

The main performance bottlenecks in this code are:

   a) The use of vectors L and R to store left and right halves of the array in the merge function. This adds an overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
   
   b) The use of the 'compared' global variable to count the number of comparisons made. This can have performance implications due to cache coherency issues when using multi-threaded or multi-core systems.

   c) The use of cin and cout for input and output, which can be slow compared to other methods.

2. Optimization Strategy:

   a) Replace the vectors L and R with static arrays. This will eliminate the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
   
   b) Instead of using a global variable to count comparisons, return the count from the merge function and add it to the total in mergeSort.
   
   c) Use fast I/O methods instead of cin and cout.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   a) The vectors L and R are replaced with static arrays. This will eliminate the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, leading to faster execution times. The trade-off here is that we might use more memory than before, but it's not an issue since the size is not large.

   b) The 'compared' variable is moved into the mergeSort function and its value is returned. This will eliminate potential cache coherency issues, leading to faster execution times. The trade-off here is that we have to add an additional return value to the mergeSort function, but this does not significantly increase the complexity of the code.

   c) The cin and cout statements are replaced with faster I/O methods. This will speed up the input and output operations, leading to faster overall execution times. The trade-off here is that the code will be less readable and more error-prone.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdint>

const int MAXN = 250000;
uint32_t L[MAXN], R[MAXN];

void inputArray(uint32_t A[], int num) {
  for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    scanf("%u", &A[i]);
  }
}

void printArray(uint32_t A[], int num) {
  for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    if(i != 0) printf(" ");
    printf("%u", A[i]);
  }
  printf("\n");
}

uint32_t merge(uint32_t A[], uint32_t left, uint32_t mid, uint32_t right) {
  uint32_t n1 = mid - left;
  uint32_t n2 = right - mid;
  for(uint32_t i=0; i<n1; i++) L[i] = A[left+i];
  for(uint32_t i=0; i<n2; i++) R[i] = A[mid+i];
  L[n1] = R[n2] = UINT32_MAX;
  uint32_t i = 0, j = 0, compared = 0;
  for(uint32_t k = left; k < right; k++) {
    compared++;
    if (L[i] <= R[j]) {
      A[k] = L[i];
      i++;
    } else {
      A[k] = R[j];
      j++;
    }
  }
  return compared;
}

uint32_t mergeSort(uint32_t A[], uint32_t left, uint32_t right) {
  uint32_t compared = 0;
  if (left+1 < right) {
    uint32_t mid = (left + right) / 2;
    compared += mergeSort(A, left, mid);
    compared += mergeSort(A, mid, right);
    compared += merge(A, left, mid, right);
  }
  return compared;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  uint32_t A[n];
  inputArray(A, n);
  uint32_t compared = mergeSort(A, 0, n);
  printArray(A, n);
  printf("%u\n", compared);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code improves the performance of the original code by eliminating the overhead of dynamic memory allocation, avoiding potential cache coherency issues, and using faster I/O methods.
