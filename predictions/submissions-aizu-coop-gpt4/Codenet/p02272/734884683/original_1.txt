1. Code Analysis:

The provided code is a simple implementation of the merge sort algorithm in C++. The code takes an array as input and sorts it using the merge sort algorithm. It also counts the number of comparisons performed during the sorting process and prints that value. 

2. Optimization Strategy:

The primary areas of optimization include:

1. Reducing memory usage by avoiding the creation of temporary vectors L and R in the merge function.
2. Reducing the number of assignments and comparisons in the merge function.
3. Improving the way the input array is taken.
4. Removing global variables.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. The merge function creates two temporary vectors L and R, which are copies of the portions of A[] that need to be merged. This copying of data is not necessary and increases memory usage. Instead, the merge operation can be performed directly on A[] without creating temporary vectors.

2. The merge function assigns UINT32_MAX to the last elements of L and R, and then continuously compares the top elements of L and R to merge them. Instead of doing this, we can use two iterators pointing to the beginning of the two portions in A[] that need to be merged. We can then compare the elements pointed to by the iterators and move the iterators accordingly.

3. The inputArray function takes the input array one element at a time using cin. This can be slow for large arrays. Instead, we can use std::copy and std::istream_iterator to take the entire input array at once.

4. The global variable compared can be moved inside the main function to reduce its scope and avoid potential conflicts with other code.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <iterator>
using namespace std;

static inline void merge(vector<uint32_t>& A, uint32_t left, uint32_t mid, uint32_t right, int& compared) {
    vector<uint32_t> temp;
    uint32_t i = left, j = mid;
    while(i < mid && j < right) {
        compared++;
        if(A[i] <= A[j]) {
            temp.push_back(A[i++]);
        } else {
            temp.push_back(A[j++]);
        }
    }
    while(i < mid) {
        temp.push_back(A[i++]);
    }
    while(j < right) {
        temp.push_back(A[j++]);
    }
    for(i=left; i<right; ++i) {
        A[i] = temp[i-left];
    }
}

static inline void mergeSort(vector<uint32_t>& A, uint32_t left, uint32_t right, int& compared) {
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    uint32_t mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergeSort(A, left, mid, compared);
    mergeSort(A, mid, right, compared);
    merge(A, left, mid, right, compared);
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<uint32_t> A(n);
  copy(istream_iterator<uint32_t>(cin), istream_iterator<uint32_t>(), back_inserter(A));
  int compared = 0;
  mergeSort(A, 0, n, compared);
  copy(A.begin(), A.end(), ostream_iterator<uint32_t>(cout, " "));
  cout << endl << compared << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
