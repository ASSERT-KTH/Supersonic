1. Code Analysis: The provided code is a merge sort program that sorts an array in ascending order. The program uses two helper vectors, `L` and `R`, to hold the left and right halves of the array during the merge process. The code also keeps track of the number of comparisons made during sorting. 

2. Optimization Strategy: The following optimizations can be made to the code:
   A. Use of excessive global memory: The program uses two global vectors, `L` and `R`, which are of fixed size. Instead of using these extra vectors, we can use local vectors in the merge function. This will reduce the memory footprint of the program.
   
   B. Redundant memory assignments: The vectors `L` and `R` are filled using the `assign()` function at the start of each merge operation. This operation is redundant and can be avoided by directly using the values from the original array `A[]`.
   
   C. Use of `cin` and `cout`: `cin` and `cout` operations are slower compared to `scanf` and `printf`. Replacing these will improve the I/O performance of the program.
   
   D. Use of unnecessary condition check: In the `printArray` function, the condition check to decide whether to print a space before the number is unnecessary and can be avoided.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   A. Instead of using fixed size global vectors `L` and `R`, we can declare them inside the `merge` function. This will reduce the memory usage of the program.
   
   B. We can avoid the redundant memory assignments by accessing the values directly from the original array `A[]` instead of copying them to `L` and `R`.
   
   C. Replacing `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` respectively will improve the I/O operations of the program.
   
   D. In the `printArray` function, we can print a space before each number except the first one without checking a condition for every number.

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

static void inputArray(uint32_t A[], int num) {
  for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    scanf("%u", &A[i]);
  }
}

static void printArray(uint32_t A[], int num) {
  for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    if (i != 0)
      printf(" ");
    printf("%u", A[i]);
  }
  printf("\n");
}

static int compared = 0;

static inline void merge(uint32_t A[], uint32_t left, uint32_t mid,
                         uint32_t right) {
  uint32_t n1 = mid - left;
  uint32_t n2 = right - mid;
  uint32_t i = 0, j = 0, k = left;
  while (k < right) {
    compared++;
    if (i < n1 && (j >= n2 || A[left + i] <= A[mid + j])) {
      A[k] = A[left + i];
      i++;
    } else {
      A[k] = A[mid + j];
      j++;
    }
    k++;
  }
}

static inline void mergeSort(uint32_t A[], uint32_t left, uint32_t right) {
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    uint32_t mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergeSort(A, left, mid);
    mergeSort(A, mid, right);
    merge(A, left, mid, right);
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  uint32_t A[n];
  inputArray(A, n);
  mergeSort(A, 0, n);

  return 0;
