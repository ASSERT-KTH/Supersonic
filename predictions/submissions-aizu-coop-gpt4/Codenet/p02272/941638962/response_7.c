Code Analysis:
The given program implements the Merge Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. I have identified the following potential areas for optimization:

1. Global Variables: The code uses numerous global variables (e.g., "count", "n", "Left", "Right", "i", "j", "k", "n1", "n2"), which can slow down the program and make it harder to understand and debug. These should be replaced with local variables where possible.

2. Size of Arrays: The sizes of the "Left" and "Right" arrays are fixed and relatively large. This may lead to inefficient memory usage if the size of the input is smaller.

3. Division Operations: In the 'mergesort' function, the mid-point is calculated using a division operation which is generally slower than bit-shift operations.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace global variables with local variables where possible. This would reduce the memory footprint and potentially increase performance.

2. Dynamically allocate memory for the "Left" and "Right" arrays based on the actual size of the input instead of a fixed size.

3. Replace the division operation with a right bit-shift operation while calculating the mid-point in the 'mergesort' function. This should increase the performance.

4. Use 'fgets' and 'sscanf' for input operations instead of 'scanf' directly as they are generally faster.

5. Use 'printf' less frequently by using a buffer to store the output string and printing the buffer once it's full or when the program finishes.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Global to Local Variables: Global variables are slower to access than local variables because they are stored in the data segment of the program, which is slower to access than the stack where local variables are stored. Additionally, using global variables can make the code harder to understand and debug.

2. Dynamic Memory Allocation: Allocating memory based on the actual size of the input can reduce memory usage and can increase performance because less memory needs to be initialized.

3. Bit-shift Operations: Bit-shift operations are generally faster than division and multiplication operations. So, replacing the division operation with a right bit-shift operation can increase performance.

4. Input Operations: Using 'fgets' and 'sscanf' can be faster than using 'scanf' directly because 'scanf' has to parse the format string every time it's called while 'fgets' and 'sscanf' only have to parse it once.

5. Output Operations: Using 'printf' less frequently can increase performance because writing to the console is a relatively slow operation. By using a buffer to store the output string and only writing to the console once the buffer is full or at the end of the program, the number of 'printf' calls can be reduced.

Trade-offs:

1. Code Complexity: The proposed optimizations will increase the complexity of the code because dynamic memory allocation and buffer manipulation need to be managed manually in C.

2. Debugging: Debugging can also become more difficult because memory-related errors can lead to hard-to-find bugs.

3. Memory Allocation Overhead: Dynamic memory allocation can introduce some overhead, but this is generally outweighed by the benefits of reduced memory usage.
