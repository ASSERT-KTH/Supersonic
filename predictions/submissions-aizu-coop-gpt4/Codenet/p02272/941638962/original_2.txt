Before diving into the optimization, let's first understand what this program does. It's a simple implementation of the merge sort algorithm, which is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. The code reads an array from the standard input, sorts it using merge sort, and then outputs the sorted array along with the total number of merge operations performed.

Now, let's discuss the potential optimizations:

1. Global Variables: The code uses a lot of global variables which is not a good practice as it can be a source of bugs and it also increases memory usage.

2. Memory Allocation: The `Left` and `Right` arrays are always allocated with a size of 250001, regardless of the actual size needed. This can lead to unnecessary memory usage.

3. Unnecessary Computations: The `count` variable is incremented in each call to `merge`, but it is simply equal to `n - 1` at the end of the program (as for `n` numbers, we need `n - 1` merge operations).

Optimization Strategy includes:

1. Move the global variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `n1` and `n2` inside the functions where they are used.

2. Allocate the `Left` and `Right` arrays dynamically based on the size needed in the `merge` function.

3. Remove the `count` variable and print `n - 1` directly at the end of the program.

4. Use `memcpy` function to copy the subarrays in `merge` function, which is usually more efficient than manual copying.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#define MAX 1000000001

void mergesort(int *, int, int);
void merge(int *, int, int, int);

int n;

int main(void) {
  int S[500000];
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  mergesort(S, 0, n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("%d", S[i]);
    if (i != n - 1)
      printf(" ");
  }
  printf("\n%d\n", n - 1);  // Print number of merge operations directly
  return 0;
}

void mergesort(int *S, int left, int right) {
  int mid;
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergesort(S, left, mid);
    mergesort(S, mid, right);
    merge(S, left, mid, right);
  }
}

void merge(int *S, int left, int mid, int right) {
  int n1 = mid - left;
  int n2 = right - mid;
  
  int *Left = (int*) malloc((n1 + 1) * sizeof(int));
  int *Right = (int*) malloc((n2 + 1) * sizeof(int));
  
  memcpy(Left, &S[left], n1 * sizeof(int));
  memcpy(Right, &S[mid], n2 * sizeof(int));
  
  Left[n1] = MAX;
  Right[n2] = MAX;
  int i = 0, j = 0;
  for (int k = left; k < right; k++) {
    if (Left[j] > Right[i])
      S[k] = Right[i++];
    else
      S[k] = Left[j++];
  }
  free(Left);
  free(Right);
}
```

The optimized code is now more efficient in terms of memory usage and has no unnecessary computations. However, it requires dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, which might be a bit slower than using static memory allocation (as in the original code), but it's a worthy trade-off considering the significant reduction in memory usage.
