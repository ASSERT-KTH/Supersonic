The given code is a standard implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in C. The Merge Sort algorithm is a comparison-based algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer strategy. It works by dividing the array into two halves, sorting them separately, and then merging them. This process is recursive, with the base condition being when a sub-array has only one element left.

### Code Analysis

1. The program uses global variables for `count`, `n`, `Left`, `Right`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `n1`, `n2`. The use of global variables has a few issues like it increases the complexity of the code, makes debugging difficult, and increases the risk of naming conflicts. 

2. The merge function creates two additional arrays `Left` and `Right` to hold the halves of the array being sorted. This doubles the memory usage.

3. The merge function uses a sentinel value `MAX`, which is the maximum value an integer can hold. If the input array has elements equal to this value, it may lead to incorrect results.

### Optimization Strategy

1. **Avoid Global Variables**: Move the variables to local scope where they are needed. This helps in managing memory more efficiently and reduces the risk of naming conflicts.

2. **Reduce Memory Usage**: Instead of creating two additional arrays to hold the halves of the array being sorted, we can sort the array in-place.

3. **Avoid Sentinel Value**: Instead of using a sentinel value to mark the end of an array, we can use the length of the array.

### Optimized Code Block

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void mergesort(int *, int, int);
void merge(int *, int, int, int);

int main(void) {
  int S[500000];
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  mergesort(S, 0, n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("%d", S[i]);
    if (i != n - 1)
      printf(" ");
  }
  printf("\n");
  return 0;
}

void mergesort(int *S, int left, int right) {
  int mid;
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergesort(S, left, mid);
    mergesort(S, mid, right);
    merge(S, left, mid, right);
  }
}

void merge(int *S, int left, int mid, int right) {
  int n1 = mid - left;
  int n2 = right - mid;
  int i = 0;
  int j = 0;
  int k = left;
  while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
    if (S[left + i] <= S[mid + j])
      S[k++] = S[left + i++];
    else
      S[k++] = S[mid + j++];
  }
  while (i < n1)
    S[k++] = S[left + i++];
  while (j < n2)
    S[k++] = S[mid + j++];
}
```
Please note that the `count` variable has been removed from the optimized code as it was not being used anywhere. If it is necessary for your program, you can reintroduce it, but it should be a local variable in the `main` function, and it should be passed as an argument to the `mergesort` and `merge` functions where it is incremented.
