Code Analysis:
This code is a standard implementation of merge sort algorithm. The primary performance bottleneck is the usage of global variables and some overhead from recursion.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace global variables with local variables or arguments. This will reduce memory usage and may improve performance. Global variables are slower to access than local variables due to the mechanism C uses to look up global variables.
2. Convert the merge sort function from a recursive form to an iterative form. The recursive implementation incurs function call overhead for each recursive call, which can be avoided in an iterative implementation.
3. Use a more efficient data structure. Converting the arrays to vectors can help manage memory and access data more efficiently.

Step-by-step Explanation:
1. Replace global variables: Global variables are slower to access and can cause problems with re-entrancy and concurrency. By making them local or passing them as parameters, we can make the code cleaner and potentially faster.
2. Iterative merge sort: Recursion in C/C++ can be expensive in terms of performance because each recursive call involves a function call overhead. By converting the merge sort function to an iterative form, we can avoid this overhead.
3. Use vectors: Converting arrays to vectors can manage memory more efficiently, and accessing data in vectors can be faster than in arrays due to better cache locality.

Optimized Code Block:
```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
#define MAX 1000000001

void mergesort(std::vector<int> &S);
void merge(std::vector<int> &S, int left, int mid, int right, std::vector<int> &Left, std::vector<int> &Right, int &count);

int main(void) {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  std::vector<int> S(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  mergesort(S);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("%d", S[i]);
    if (i != n - 1)
      printf(" ");
  }
  printf("\n");
  return 0;
}

void mergesort(std::vector<int> &S) {
  int n = S.size();
  std::vector<int> Left(n), Right(n);
  int count = 0;
  for (int segmentSize = 1; segmentSize < n; segmentSize *= 2) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 2 * segmentSize) {
      int mid = i + segmentSize < n ? i + segmentSize : n;
      int end = i + 2 * segmentSize < n ? i + 2 * segmentSize : n;
      merge(S, i, mid, end, Left, Right, count);
    }
  }
}

void merge(std::vector<int> &S, int left, int mid, int right, std::vector<int> &Left, std::vector<int> &Right, int &count) {
  int n1 = mid - left;
  int n2 = right - mid;
  for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++)
    Left[i] = S[left + i];
  for (int i = 0; i < n2; i++)
    Right[i] = S[mid + i];
  Left[n1] = MAX;
  Right[n2] = MAX;
  int i = 0;
  int j = 0;
  for (int k = left; k < right; k++) {
    if (Left[j] > Right[i])
      S[k] = Right[i++];
    else
      S[k] = Left[j++];
  }
  count += right - left;
}
```
This optimized code uses vectors instead of arrays, which makes memory management more efficient. The merge sort function is now iterative, avoiding the overhead of recursive function calls. The use of local variables and parameters instead of global variables makes the code cleaner and potentially faster.
