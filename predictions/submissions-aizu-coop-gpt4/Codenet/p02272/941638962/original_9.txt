**Code Analysis:**

This code is implementing merge sort, a common sorting algorithm. It uses two functions, `mergesort` and `merge`, to recursively divide the input array and then combine the sorted sub-arrays, respectively. 

**Potential Bottlenecks:**

1. The main performance bottleneck in this code is the use of global variables, which can lead to inefficient memory use and potential errors due to side effects. 

2. The merge function creates two new arrays, `Left` and `Right`, each time it is called. This can lead to significant memory overhead, especially for large input arrays.

3. The code relies on a defined maximum value (MAX) to handle the merging process, which is not an efficient method and can cause errors if the data to be sorted contains values close to this maximum.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. Replace global variables with local ones to avoid potential side effects and improve memory management.

2. Instead of creating new arrays `Left` and `Right` each time the merge function is called, consider using a single temporary array that can be reused to reduce memory overhead.

3. Use a different method for merging sorted sub-arrays instead of relying on a defined maximum value.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Move all global variables to their respective local scopes, except `count` which is used across different function calls. This will improve memory management and avoid potential side effects.

2. Create a single temporary array in the `mergesort` function and pass it to the `merge` function. This will reduce memory overhead as we are not creating new arrays each time merge is called.

3. Instead of using a defined maximum value for merging, we can add a condition in the merge function to check which array (Left or Right) has been fully copied to the sorted array. This will avoid potential errors when the data to be sorted contains values close to the defined maximum value.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX 1000000001
void mergesort(int *, int, int, int *);
void merge(int *, int, int, int, int *);
int count = 0, n;

int main(void) {
  int S[500000];
  int Temp[500000];
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  mergesort(S, 0, n, Temp);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("%d", S[i]);
    if (i != n - 1)
      printf(" ");
  }
  printf("\n%d\n", count);
  return 0;
}

void mergesort(int *S, int left, int right, int *Temp) {
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergesort(S, left, mid, Temp);
    mergesort(S, mid, right, Temp);
    merge(S, left, mid, right, Temp);
  }
}

void merge(int *S, int left, int mid, int right, int *Temp) {
  int n1 = mid - left;
  int n2 = right - mid;
  for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++)
    Temp[i] = S[left + i];
  for (int i = 0; i < n2; i++)
    Temp[n1+i] = S[mid + i];
  int i = 0, j = n1, k = left;
  while (k < right) {
    if (j >= right || (i < n1 && Temp[i] <= Temp[j]))
      S[k++] = Temp[i++];
    else
      S[k++] = Temp[j++];
  }
  count += right - left;
}
```

The optimized code reduces memory usage by using a single temporary array instead of creating new ones for each merge operation. It also avoids potential errors by not using a defined maximum value for merging. The use of local variables improves memory management and readability. The trade-off is a slight increase in code complexity due to the additional condition in the merge function and the passing of the temporary array to the merge function.
