Analysis:
This program is implementing the merge sort algorithm which has a time complexity of O(n log n). However, the code is not optimal in terms of memory usage as it uses extra arrays Left and Right which are defined globally and their size is fixed to 250001 elements.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Using Dynamic Allocation: The arrays Left and Right are of fixed size 250001 which is not efficient if the array to be sorted is small. We can use dynamic memory allocation to allocate only the required amount of memory.

2. Local Variables: The variables i, j, k, n1, n2, count, and n are defined globally which might lead to issues in a large program and are also not good practice. We can make these variables local to improve the code design. 

3. Reducing the number of print statements: In the main function, individual elements of the sorted array are printed in separate print statements. This could be optimized by using a single print statement.

4. Pass count as a parameter: Instead of using a global variable count, we can pass it as a parameter to the mergeSort function and return its value.

Optimization Steps:

1. Dynamic Allocation: Instead of defining arrays Left and Right with fixed size, we can use malloc() to allocate memory dynamically. The size of the arrays will be equal to the number of elements they will hold. This will save memory when the array to be sorted is small.

2. Local Variables: Make the variables i, j, k, n1, n2, count, and n local. This will improve the code design and prevent potential issues in a larger program.

3. Printing the array: Use a buffer to store the array elements as a string and print the string. This will reduce the number of calls to printf(), thereby saving time.

4. Pass count variable: Instead of using a global variable count, pass it as a parameter to the mergeSort function and return its value.

Optimized Code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#define MAX 1000000001

void mergeSort(int *, int, int, int*);
void merge(int *, int, int, int, int*);

int main(void) {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int* S = malloc(n*sizeof(int));
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  
  int count = 0;
  mergeSort(S, 0, n, &count);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("%d", S[i]);
    if (i != n - 1)
      printf(" ");
  }
  printf("\n%d\n", count);
  
  free(S);
  return 0;
}

void mergeSort(int *S, int left, int right, int* count) {
  int mid;
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergeSort(S, left, mid, count);
    mergeSort(S, mid, right, count);
    merge(S, left, mid, right, count);
  }
}

void merge(int *S, int left, int mid, int right, int* count) {
  int n1 = mid - left;
  int n2 = right - mid;

  int *Left = malloc((n1+1)*sizeof(int));
  int *Right = malloc((n2+1)*sizeof(int));

  for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++)
    Left[i] = S[left + i];
  for (int i = 0; i < n2; i++)
    Right[i] = S[mid + i];
    
  Left[n1] = MAX;
  Right[n2] = MAX;
  
  int i = 0;
  int j = 0;

  for (int k = left; k < right; k++) {
    if (Left[j] > Right[i]) {
      S[k] = Right[i++];
    } else {
      S[k] = Left[j++];
    }
  }

  *count += right - left;
  
  free(Left);
  free(Right);
}
```

Note: We are using malloc() and free() for dynamic allocation and deallocation of memory. Make sure to always check the return value of malloc() in a real-world scenario, to ensure memory has been successfully allocated.
