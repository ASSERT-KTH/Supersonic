This program is implementing the merge sort algorithm for sorting an array. There are some areas where we can optimize this code:

1. Reducing global variables: There are global variables like `S`, `L`, `R`, `INF`, `MAX`, `cnt` which are not required to be global. We can move them inside the main function or where they are required. This will not have a significant impact on performance, but it is a good practice to limit the scope of variables as much as possible.

2. Avoiding unnecessary copying of elements to `L` and `R` arrays in the `merge` function: This is a major performance bottleneck in the current code as it involves unnecessary copying of elements. Instead of copying, we can directly use the `A` array itself.

3. Reducing the number of `cout` calls in the main function: Each `cout` call has some overhead associated with it. Instead of printing each integer separately, we can append all integers to a string and then print the string once.

Here is a step-by-step optimization process:

1. Move the global variables inside the main function or where they are required. For example, `cnt`, `N`, and `S` can be moved inside the main function.

2. Use the array `A` directly in the `merge` function instead of copying elements to `L` and `R`. To do this, modify the `merge` function to take two more parameters `L` and `R` that represent the start and end of the left and right subarrays. Then use these indices to access elements in the `A` array directly.

3. In the main function, create an empty string `output`. Each time we want to print an integer, append it to `output` along with a space. After all integers have been appended, print `output`.

4. Also, use `'\n'` instead of `endl` to print a new line. The `endl` manipulator flushes the output buffer each time it is called, which can be slower than using `'\n'` which doesn't flush the buffer.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

void merge(int *A, int left, int mid, int right, int &cnt) {
    int n1 = mid - left;
    int n2 = right - mid;
    int i = 0, j = 0, k;
    for (k = left; k < right; k++) {
        if (i >= n1) {
            A[k] = A[mid + j++];
        } else if (j >= n2) {
            A[k] = A[left + i++];
        } else if (A[left + i] <= A[mid + j]) {
            A[k] = A[left + i++];
        } else {
            A[k] = A[mid + j++];
            cnt += n1 - i; // Count the number of inversions.
        }
    }
}

void mergesort(int *A, int left, int right, int &cnt) {
    if (left + 1 < right) {
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;
        mergesort(A, left, mid, cnt);
        mergesort(A, mid, right, cnt);
        merge(A, left, mid, right, cnt);
    }
}

int main() {
    int N;
    cin >> N;
    int S[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        cin >> S[i];
    }
    int cnt = 0;
    mergesort(S, 0, N, cnt);
    string output;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        output += to_string(S[i]) + ' ';
    }
    cout << output << '\n' << cnt << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should perform significantly faster than the original code while still producing the same output.
