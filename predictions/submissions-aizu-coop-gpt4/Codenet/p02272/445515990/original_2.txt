The given program is a merge sort algorithm implemented in C++. It sorts an array of integers in ascending order and counts the number of elements processed while merging. Here is the optimization process:

1. Code Analysis:
   - The mergesort function is recursively dividing the array into two halves until it has only one element. Then it merges the halves in sorted order. This function has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is optimal for comparison-based sorting algorithms.
   - The merge function merges two sorted halves of the array. It uses two additional arrays L and R to store the halves. The time complexity of this function is O(n), but it consumes a lot of extra space.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Use in-place merging to save space. This approach, however, may increase time complexity.
   - Instead of using the 'cout' statement multiple times in a loop for output, store the output in a string and print it once after the loop.
   - Use 'scanf' and 'printf' instead of 'cin' and 'cout' for faster input and output operations.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   - Keep the mergesort function as it is because its time complexity is already optimal.
   - In the merge function, instead of creating extra arrays L and R, use the original array and two indices i and j to track the current elements in the two halves.
   - After reading the input, instead of printing each element one by one, append them to a string with a space in between. After the loop, print the string once.
   - Replace 'cin' and 'cout' with 'scanf' and 'printf' for faster input and output.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

const int MAX = 500000;
int cnt;
int S[MAX] = {0};

void merge(int *A, int left, int mid, int right) {
  int i = left, j = mid;
  while (i < mid && j < right) {
    if (A[i] <= A[j]) {
      i++;
    } else {
      swap(A[i], A[j]);
      j++;
    }
    cnt++;
  }
}

void mergesort(int *A, int left, int right) {
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergesort(A, left, mid);
    mergesort(A, mid, right);
    merge(A, left, mid, right);
  }
}

int main() {
  int N;
  cnt = 0;
  scanf("%d", &N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  }
  mergesort(S, 0, N);
  string output;
  for (int i = 0; i < N-1; i++) {
    output += to_string(S[i]) + " ";
  }
  output += to_string(S[N-1]);
  printf("%s\n%d\n", output.c_str(), cnt);
  return 0;
}
```

Note: In this optimized code, the merge function uses an in-place merging approach which may not always be faster than the original merge function. If preserving the original order of equal elements (stability) is important, then the original merge function is better.
