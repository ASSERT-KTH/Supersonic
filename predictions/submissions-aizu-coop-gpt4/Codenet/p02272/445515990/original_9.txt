The provided code is a well-known sorting algorithm called Merge Sort. It has a time complexity of O(n log(n)) and a space complexity of O(n), which is already quite efficient. However, we can still apply some optimizations to make it even better.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use references to pass the array, which will avoid creating copies of the array.
2. Avoid global variables whenever possible. Make them local to the functions that use them. This will reduce the chance of unintended side effects.
3. Instead of using C-style arrays, use std::vector which is safer and provides more functionalities.
4. Instead of using two separate arrays L and R, use one temporary array to hold the merged elements, which can reduce memory usage.
5. Use std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) to make I/O operations faster.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void merge(vector<int>& A, int left, int mid, int right, int& cnt) {
  int n = right - left;
  vector<int> tmp(n);
  int i = left, j = mid, k = 0;
  while (i < mid && j < right) {
    if (A[i] <= A[j]) {
      tmp[k++] = A[i++];
    } else {
      tmp[k++] = A[j++];
      cnt += mid - i; // count inversions
    }
  }
  while (i < mid) {
    tmp[k++] = A[i++];
  }
  while (j < right) {
    tmp[k++] = A[j++];
  }
  for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    A[left + i] = tmp[i];
  }
}

void mergesort(vector<int>& A, int left, int right, int& cnt) {
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergesort(A, left, mid, cnt);
    mergesort(A, mid, right, cnt);
    merge(A, left, mid, right, cnt);
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  vector<int> S(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> S[i];
  }
  int cnt = 0;
  mergesort(S, 0, N, cnt);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (i > 0) cout << " ";
    cout << S[i];
  }
  cout << "\n" << cnt << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version maintains the functionality of the original program while reducing memory usage and potentially improving runtime. It also eliminates the use of unsafe global variables and C-style arrays. The trade-off is a slight increase in code complexity due to the use of vector and references. However, this is generally acceptable given the benefits in terms of performance and safety.
