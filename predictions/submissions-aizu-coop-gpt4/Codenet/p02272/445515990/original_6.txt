The provided code is a C++ implementation of the merge sort algorithm, which sorts an array of integers and counts the number of array element comparisons made during the sorting process. This is a classic divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges them together in sorted order.

Let's analyze the code and find potential improvements:

1. **Repeated Memory Allocations:** In the merge function, the left (L) and right (R) subarrays are created for each recursive call, which involves a lot of memory allocation and deallocation.

2. **Unnecessary Value Comparison:** The code uses a sentinel value (INF) to mark the end of each subarray, which leads to unnecessary comparisons.

3. **Excessive Variable Definitions:** The code has multiple variable definitions at the beginning of the merge function, which can be simplified.

4. **Unoptimized Input/Output:** The usage of cin and cout for input and output can be slower than using scanf and printf.

Here is the optimization strategy:

1. **Memory Allocation:** To reduce the overhead of repeated memory allocation, we can allocate memory for the temporary arrays once and reuse them.

2. **Sentinel Value:** We can avoid using a sentinel value and instead check the indices of the subarrays.

3. **Variable Definitions:** We can simplify variable definitions by defining them only when needed.

4. **Input/Output:** We can use scanf and printf for faster input and output.

5. **Compiler Optimizations:** We can use compiler optimization flags such as -O2 or -O3 when compiling the code.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#define MAX 500000
#define INF 2000000000

int N;
int cnt;
int S[MAX] = {0}, L[MAX / 2 + 2], R[MAX / 2 + 2];

void merge(int *A, int left, int mid, int right) {
  int n1 = mid - left;
  int n2 = right - mid;
  for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) L[i] = A[left + i];
  for (int i = 0; i < n2; i++) R[i] = A[mid + i];
  int i = 0, j = 0;
  for (int k = left; k < right; k++) {
    if (j >= n2 || (i < n1 && L[i] <= R[j])) {
      A[k] = L[i++];
    } else {
      A[k] = R[j++];
    }
    cnt++;
  }
}

void mergesort(int *A, int left, int right) {
  if (left+1 < right) {
    int mid = (left + right)>>1;
    mergesort(A, left, mid);
    mergesort(A, mid, right);
    merge(A, left, mid, right);
  }
}

int main() {
  cnt = 0;
  scanf("%d", &N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  mergesort(S, 0, N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (i) printf(" ");
    printf("%d", S[i]);
  }
  printf("\n%d\n", cnt);
  return 0;
}
```

The trade-off in this optimized version is that while we've improved performance, the code might be a bit more complex to understand due to the removal of the sentinel value and the use of scanf and printf instead of cin and cout. However, the improvements in performance can be significant, especially for large inputs.
