Code Analysis:
The given C++ code is using Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The code seems to be quite efficient already, but there are still a few areas where improvements can be made. 

1. Using "bits/stdc++.h" is not recommended because it includes all the standard library headers, which increases the compilation time. 

2. The code uses a vector "S" as a stack but the standard library provides a stack data structure which has a constant time complexity for push and pop operations.

3. The code is copying Edge objects which can be avoided by using const reference.

4. The Edge structure can be replaced by a simple integer as it only wraps a single integer.

5. The code is not using reserve function to preallocate memory for a vector which can avoid reallocations.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" with the specific headers needed for this program.

2. Use std::stack instead of std::vector for the stack operations.

3. Use const reference when iterating over edges to avoid copying.

4. Use integers instead of Edge objects.

5. Reserve memory for vectors in advance to avoid unnecessary reallocations.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <cassert>
using namespace std;

typedef vector<vector<int>> Adj_list;

vector<int> topological_sort(Adj_list G) {
  const int V = G.size();
  vector<int> inorder(V, 0);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    for (const int &e : G[i])
      inorder[e]++;
      
  stack<int> S;
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    if (inorder[i] == 0)
      S.push(i);
  
  assert(!S.empty());
  
  vector<int> topological_order;
  topological_order.reserve(V);
  
  while (!S.empty()) {
    int v = S.top();
    S.pop();
    topological_order.push_back(v);
    
    for (const int &e : G[v]) {
      inorder[e]--;
      if (inorder[e] == 0)
        S.push(e);
    }
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    assert(inorder[i] == 0);
  
  return topological_order;
}

int main() {
  int V, E;
  cin >> V >> E;
  
  Adj_list G(V);
  for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
    int s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    G[s].push_back(t);
  }
  
  vector<int> ans = topological_sort(G);
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    cout << ans[i] << endl;
}
```

These optimizations will make the code faster and more efficient, while preserving the same functionality and output. It's also slightly simpler and more readable, as we've removed the unnecessary Edge structure.
