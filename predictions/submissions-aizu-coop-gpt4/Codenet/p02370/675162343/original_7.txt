Code Analysis:
The provided code is implementing topological sort on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) using depth-first search. The time complexity of this code is O(V+E) (where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges), which is optimal for topological sorting. However, there are some parts of this code that could be optimized to improve its performance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use `reserve` method for vectors: The `reserve` method can be used to preallocate memory for vectors. This can potentially improve performance by reducing the number of memory reallocations when elements are added to the vector with `push_back`.

2. Avoid copying objects: In the code, `Edge e = G[v][i];` creates a copy of the object. This can be avoided by using a reference to the object instead.

3. Use `back` and `pop_back` methods for stacks: Instead of accessing the last element of the `S` vector with `S[S.size() - 1]`, the `back` method can be used. This makes the code more readable and slightly more efficient.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Reserve memory for vectors: The `reserve` method can be used to preallocate memory for the `S` and `topological_order` vectors. This can potentially improve performance by reducing the number of memory reallocations when elements are added to the vector with `push_back`.

2. Avoid object copying: Instead of creating a copy of the `Edge` object with `Edge e = G[v][i];`, a reference to the object can be used with `Edge& e = G[v][i];`. This avoids unnecessary object copying, which can improve performance, especially when the objects are large.

3. Use `back` and `pop_back` methods for stacks: Instead of accessing the last element of the `S` vector with `S[S.size() - 1]`, the `back` method can be used. This makes the code more readable and slightly more efficient.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
struct Edge {
  int tgt_;
  Edge(int t) { tgt_ = t; }
};
typedef vector<vector<Edge>> Adj_list;
vector<int> topological_sort(Adj_list G) {
  const int V = G.size();
  vector<int> S;
  S.reserve(V);    // reserve memory
  vector<int> inorder(V, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    for (Edge &e : G[i])
      inorder[e.tgt_]++;
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    if (inorder[i] == 0)
      S.push_back(i);
  assert(S.size() > 0);
  vector<int> topological_order;
  topological_order.reserve(V);    // reserve memory
  while (S.size()) {
    int v = S.back();   // use back
    S.pop_back();
    topological_order.push_back(v);
    for (int i = G[v].size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      Edge& e = G[v][i];    // use reference
      inorder[e.tgt_]--;
      if (inorder[e.tgt_] == 0)
        S.push_back(e.tgt_);
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    assert(inorder[i] == 0);
  return topological_order;
}
int main() {
  int V, E;
  cin >> V >> E;
  Adj_list G(V);
  for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
    int s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    G[s].push_back(Edge(t));
  }
  vector<int> ans = topological_sort(G);
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    cout << ans[i] << endl;
}

The proposed optimizations are minor and do not change the overall structure of the code. The functionality and output of the code remain the same. The optimizations are intended to improve the performance of the code by reducing memory allocations and avoiding unnecessary object copying.
