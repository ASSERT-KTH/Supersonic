The provided code is a C++ program that reads a directed graph from standard input and then performs a topological sort on the graph. Below are the identified areas which can be optimized:

1. **Inefficient Data Structures**: The code uses a vector for `S`, which behaves like a stack in this case. Using a `std::stack` instead will provide clear intentions and can have better performance in some cases.

2. **Redundant Computations**: The line `int v = S[S.size() - 1]` is used to access the last element of `S` vector, which is an unnecessary computation. If we use `std::stack`, we can directly use `stack.top()` to get the last element.

3. **Loops**: The inner loop in `topological_sort` function using `for (int i = G[v].size() - 1; i >= 0; i--)` can be optimized by using iterators or range-based for loop for better readability and potential performance improvements.

4. **Compiler optimizations**: Compiler optimizations can be enabled via compiler flags (like `-O3` for GCC/Clang) to automatically optimize the program at compile time.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <cassert>

using namespace std;

struct Edge {
  int tgt_;
  explicit Edge(int t) : tgt_(t) {}
};

typedef vector<vector<Edge>> Adj_list;

vector<int> topological_sort(Adj_list G) {
  const int V = G.size();
  vector<int> inorder(V, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    for (Edge &e : G[i])
      inorder[e.tgt_]++;

  stack<int> S;
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    if (inorder[i] == 0)
      S.push(i);

  assert(!S.empty());

  vector<int> topological_order;
  while (!S.empty()) {
    int v = S.top();
    S.pop();
    topological_order.push_back(v);

    for (Edge &e : G[v]) {
      inorder[e.tgt_]--;
      if (inorder[e.tgt_] == 0)
        S.push(e.tgt_);
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    assert(inorder[i] == 0);

  return topological_order;
}

int main() {
  int V, E;
  cin >> V >> E;
  Adj_list G(V);
  for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
    int s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    G[s].push_back(Edge(t));
  }
  vector<int> ans = topological_sort(G);
  for (int i : ans)
    cout << i << endl;
}
```

In this optimized code, we made the following changes:

1. Replaced the `vector<int> S` with `stack<int> S` for clear intention and better performance.
2. Used `stack.top()` and `stack.pop()` to access and remove the last element from the stack.
3. Used range-based for loops for iterating over elements in the graph `G`.
4. Removed the use of `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a lot of unnecessary headers, and instead included only the necessary ones.

Please note that the performance improvement might be minimal because the original code is already quite optimized. The main improvements here are readability and code quality.
