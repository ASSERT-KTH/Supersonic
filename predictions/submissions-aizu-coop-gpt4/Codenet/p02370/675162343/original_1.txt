Code Analysis:

The provided code is a C++ implementation of the topological sorting algorithm on a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The code reads the number of vertices and edges from the input, builds an adjacency list representation of the graph, and then performs a topological sort on it. The result is printed to the standard output.

The main areas that can be optimized in the code are:

1. The Edge struct: It is a fairly simple struct with a single data member. It can be replaced by an integer for simplicity and memory efficiency.

2. The adjacency list (Adj_list): The Adj_list is a vector of vectors. This might cause unnecessary copying of data when the vector is resized.

3. The topological_sort function: It uses a vector as a stack, which can be inefficient in terms of memory usage. Also, it iterates over the graph multiple times, which can be optimized.

4. The input/output operations: The cin and cout operations are slower than scanf and printf. This can be a bottleneck when dealing with large inputs/outputs.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the Edge struct by int: The Edge struct is an overkill for this application. We can simply use int instead of Edge. This saves memory and simplifies the code.

2. Replace vector of vectors by list of vectors: The Adj_list can be a list of vectors instead of a vector of vectors. This avoids unnecessary data copying when resizing the vector.

3. Use queue instead of vector in topological_sort: A queue is more appropriate for the topological sorting algorithm. This can improve the performance of the algorithm.

4. Use scanf and printf instead of cin and cout: The scanf and printf functions are faster than cin and cout. This can speed up the input/output operations.

5. Use reserve() function: To prevent the resizing operation of vector which can be expensive, we can use the reserve() function which allocates memory for the vector in advance.

Step-by-step Explanation:

1. Replace the Edge struct by int: This simplifies the code and reduces memory usage. The tgt_ member of the Edge struct is replaced by an int.

2. Replace vector of vectors by list of vectors: The Adj_list is changed to a list of vectors. This prevents unnecessary data copying when the vector is resized.

3. Use queue instead of vector in topological_sort: In the topological_sort function, we replace the vector S by a queue Q. This improves the performance of the algorithm.

4. Use scanf and printf instead of cin and cout: The scanf and printf functions are faster than cin and cout. This speeds up the input/output operations.

5. Use reserve() function: This function is used to allocate memory for the vectors in advance, which can significantly improve the performance when dealing with large inputs.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef vector<int> Edge;
typedef list<vector<int>> Adj_list;
vector<int> topological_sort(Adj_list &G) {
  const int V = G.size();
  vector<int> inorder(V, 0);
  for (const auto &edges : G)
    for (int e : edges)
      inorder[e]++;
  queue<int> Q;
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    if (inorder[i] == 0)
      Q.push(i);
  assert(!Q.empty());
  vector<int> topological_order;
  topological_order.reserve(V);
  while (!Q.empty()) {
    int v = Q.front();
    Q.pop();
    topological_order.push_back(v);
    for (int e : G[v]) {
      inorder[e]--;
      if (inorder[e] == 0)
        Q.push(e);
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    assert(inorder[i] == 0);
  return topological_order;
}
int main() {
  int V, E;
  scanf("%d %d", &V, &E);
  Adj_list G(V);
  for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
    int s, t;
    scanf("%d %d", &s, &t);
    G[s].push_back(t);
  }
  vector<int> ans = topological_sort(G);
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    printf("%d\n", ans[i]);
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The list and queue data structures used in the optimized code have certain trade-offs. While list and queue can improve performance in this case, they might not be suitable for all applications. Also, using scanf and printf instead of cin and cout can make the code less readable and prone to errors.
