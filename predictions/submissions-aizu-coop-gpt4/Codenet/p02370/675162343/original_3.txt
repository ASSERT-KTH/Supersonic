1. **Code Analysis:**

    The given program is implementing a topological sorting algorithm for a directed acyclic graph (DAG) using a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The primary bottlenecks for this program could be the extensive use of vectors for storing and manipulating data, which might not be the most efficient in terms of memory usage and performance.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**

    A. **Data Structures:** The current implementation uses the STL vector for storing edges, tracking nodes with zero incoming edges, and holding the final topological order. The deque data structure could be used instead of vector to hold the nodes with zero incoming edges (S), as deque provides faster insertion and deletion from both ends.

    B. **Redundant Computations:** The code currently computes `S.size() - 1` and `G[v].size() - 1` multiple times. Instead, these values could be computed once and reused.

    C. **Loops:** The nested loops for updating the `inorder` array and checking for nodes with zero incoming edges could potentially be optimized.

    D. **Compiler Optimizations:** Compiler optimization flags such as `-O2` or `-O3` can be used during compilation to automatically optimize the code for performance.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

    A. **Data Structures:** Replace the vector `S` with a deque. Deque provides faster insertion and deletion from both ends, which can boost performance.

    B. **Redundant Computations:** Save the results of `S.size() - 1` and `G[v].size() - 1` in variables to avoid recomputing these values.

    C. **Loops:** The nested for loop for updating the `inorder` array could be optimized using a technique called loop unrolling, where multiple iterations of the loop are combined into a single iteration, reducing the overhead of loop control.

    D. **Compiler Optimizations:** Use the `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flags during compilation to allow the compiler to automatically optimize the code.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct Edge {
  int tgt_;
  Edge(int t) : tgt_(t) {}
};

typedef vector<vector<Edge>> Adj_list;

vector<int> topological_sort(Adj_list G) {
  const int V = G.size();
  deque<int> S;
  vector<int> inorder(V, 0);

  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    for (Edge &e : G[i])
      inorder[e.tgt_]++;

  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    if (inorder[i] == 0)
      S.push_back(i);

  assert(!S.empty());

  vector<int> topological_order;
  while (!S.empty()) {
    int v = S.back();
    S.pop_back();
    topological_order.push_back(v);

    int GvSize = G[v].size();
    for (int i = GvSize - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      Edge e = G[v][i];
      inorder[e.tgt_]--;
      if (inorder[e.tgt_] == 0)
        S.push_back(e.tgt_);
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    assert(inorder[i] == 0);

  return topological_order;
}

int main() {
  int V, E;
  cin >> V >> E;
  Adj_list G(V);
  for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
    int s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    G[s].push_back(Edge(t));
  }
  vector<int> ans = topological_sort(G);
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    cout << ans[i] << endl;
}
```
