This code seems to implement a topological sort on a directed graph. After analyzing the code, here are some points that can be optimized:

1. Inefficient data structures: `vector<vector<int>> edge(10001)` allocates unnecessary memory from the start. The size of the outer vector should be proportional to the number of vertices (V), not a constant value.

2. Redundant computations: Currently, the code checks each element in the `state` vector to see if its value is zero. Instead of doing this, we can maintain a queue of vertices with zero incoming edges.

3. Loops: The second nested loop is iterating through all the edges of a vertex. It could benefit from being a range-based loop for readability.

4. Compiler optimizations: The code could benefit from enabling compiler optimizations such as `-O2` or `-O3`.

Here is the optimized code based on the above suggestions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // Faster I/O
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int V, E;
  cin >> V >> E;

  vector<vector<int>> edge(V);
  vector<int> state(V, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
    int s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    edge[s].push_back(t);
    state[t]++;
  }

  queue<int> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
    if (state[i] == 0)
      q.push(i);
  }

  vector<int> ans;
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int v = q.front();
    q.pop();
    ans.push_back(v);

    for (const auto& t : edge[v]) {
      state[t]--;
      if (state[t] == 0)
        q.push(t);
    }
  }

  for (const auto& v : ans) {
    cout << v << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Changed the size of the `edge` vector to match the number of vertices, which reduces memory usage.
2. Used a queue (`q`) to store vertices with zero incoming edges instead of checking the whole `state` vector, which reduces time complexity.
3. Simplified the loop over the edges of a vertex using a range-based for loop, which improves readability.
4. Added `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` to speed up I/O operations.
5. Replaced `endl` with `"\n"` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output buffer, which can slow down the program when printing many lines.

Trade-offs:

1. The code complexity remains the same, there is no trade-off in this regard.
2. The memory usage is reduced, so there is no trade-off in terms of memory.
3. The runtime performance is improved by reducing the number of operations, so there are no trade-offs in terms of performance.
4. The code readability is somewhat improved by using range-based for loops and removing redundant computations.
