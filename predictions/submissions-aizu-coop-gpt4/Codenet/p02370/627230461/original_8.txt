This program is implementing a Topological Sorting algorithm on a directed graph. The graph is represented by vertices and edges. The vertices are numbered from 0 to V-1 and the edges are represented as pairs of vertices.

Here are some potential optimization strategies:

1. The size of the 'edge' vector is hardcoded as 10001, which is not efficient if the number of vertices (V) is much less than 10001. We should resize it to the actual number of vertices to save space.

2. The 'state' vector keeps track of the indegree of each vertex. The indegree of a vertex is the number of incoming edges. In this program, a vertex with indegree 0 is added to the 'ans' vector which is the output of the topological sort.

3. The nested loop inside the main loop (i.e., the loop over 'j') does multiple lookups in the 'edge' and 'state' vectors, which is inefficient. We can reduce the number of lookups by storing the result in a local variable.

4. The 'ans' vector is used as a queue to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) on the graph. However, it is also used to store the final result. This can lead to performance issues when the 'push_back' operation is called repeatedly because it may cause dynamic memory allocation. We can use a separate queue for the BFS to avoid this.

5. The output loop is not necessary. We can print the vertices as they are added to the 'ans' vector.

6. We can use faster I/O methods to improve speed.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

// Use faster I/O methods
#define FAST_IO ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(nullptr)

int main() {
    FAST_IO;

    int V, E;
    cin >> V >> E;

    vector<vector<int>> edge(V);
    vector<int> state(V, 0);
    queue<int> Q;

    for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
        int s, t;
        cin >> s >> t;
        edge[s].push_back(t);
        state[t]++;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < state.size(); i++) {
        if (state[i] == 0) {
            cout << i << endl; // Print the vertex as it is added to the queue
            Q.push(i);
        }
    }

    while (!Q.empty()) {
        int v = Q.front();
        Q.pop();

        for (auto t : edge[v]) {
            state[t]--;
            if (state[t] == 0) {
                cout << t << endl; // Print the vertex as it is added to the queue
                Q.push(t);
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should reduce memory usage and improve runtime significantly, especially for large inputs. The trade-off is the slightly increased code complexity due to the introduction of the queue and the faster I/O methods.
