This code basically implements a version of Kahn's algorithm for finding a topological sort of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The algorithm works by iteratively finding nodes with no incoming edges (i.e., nodes that are not a target of any edge), removing them from the graph, and adding them to the output list.

Let's analyze the code and identify potential optimizations:

1. Code Analysis:
    - The edge list is unnecessarily large, as it has a fixed size of 10001. This could lead to excessive memory usage.
    - The usage of vectors for storing the edges and the result increases memory usage and slows down the code due to dynamic memory allocations.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    A. Data Structures:
        - Replace the edge list with a more efficient data structure. We can use an array of vectors of fixed size equal to the number of vertices (V), thus reducing memory usage.
        - Use a queue data structure instead of a vector for storing and processing nodes. This will significantly reduce the number of dynamic memory allocations and deallocations, thus improving performance.
    B. Redundant Computations:
        - The code repeatedly calls `ans.size()`, `state.size()`, and `edge[ans[i]].size()`. We can store these sizes in variables to avoid these redundant computations.
    C. Loops:
        - The loops are already quite efficient, but we can slightly improve the second main loop by using a while loop with the queue, which is more suitable for this kind of operation.
    D. Compiler Optimizations:
        - We can use fast I/O operations to speed up the input and output process.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    A. Data Structures:
        - The edge list is replaced with a more memory-efficient array of vectors of size V. This reduces memory usage significantly.
        - A queue is used instead of a vector for storing and processing nodes. This reduces dynamic memory allocations and deallocations.
    B. Redundant Computations:
        - Sizes of vectors are stored in variables to avoid calling `size()` multiple times.
    C. Loops:
        - The second main loop is changed to a while loop for processing the queue, which is more suitable for this kind of operation.
    D. Compiler Optimizations:
        - Fast I/O operations are used to speed up the input and output process.

Let's translate these optimizations into code.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

// Use fast I/O operations
#define FAST_IO ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);

int main() {
    FAST_IO;

    int V, E;
    cin >> V >> E;

    vector<vector<int>> edge(V);
    vector<int> state(V, 0);
    queue<int> Q;

    for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
        int s, t;
        cin >> s >> t;
        edge[s].push_back(t);
        state[t]++;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
        if (state[i] == 0)
            Q.push(i);
    }

    while (!Q.empty()) {
        int node = Q.front();
        Q.pop();
        cout << node << endl;
        for (auto &t : edge[node]) {
            state[t]--;
            if (state[t] == 0)
                Q.push(t);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimization process assumes that the input graph is a DAG. If the graph contains cycles, the code will not work as expected, but this is consistent with the original code's behavior as well.
