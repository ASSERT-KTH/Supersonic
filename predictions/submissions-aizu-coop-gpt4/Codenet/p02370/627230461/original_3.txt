To analyze the provided code, it appears to be performing a type of graph traversal, specifically a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Topological sort. The code reads in the number of vertices (V) and edges (E) from the input, then reads in each edge and stores it in a 2D adjacency list (vector of vectors), while also updating the 'state' vector that counts the number of incoming edges to each vertex. Afterward, it pushes vertices with no incoming edges into the 'ans' vector and iteratively processes each vertex by decrementing the state of its adjacent vertices and pushing those with no remaining incoming edges into the 'ans' vector.

Here are some potential optimizations:

1. **Memory Allocation**: The 'edge' vector is initialized with a fixed size of 10001 irrespective of the number of vertices. This could lead to a waste of memory if V is significantly less than 10001. We can initialize 'edge' with size V instead.

2. **Data Structure**: The 'ans' vector is used as a queue data structure. But using 'push_back' and direct indexing to simulate a queue in a vector is not efficient as it can lead to multiple reallocations and copies when the vector grows. Using an actual queue would be more efficient.

3. **Loop Optimization**: The loop that traverses the adjacency list of each vertex in the 'ans' vector and pushes vertices with no remaining incoming edges into the 'ans' vector can be optimized. Instead of decrementing the state of the vertex and checking if it's zero in two separate steps, we can perform these operations simultaneously.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int V, E;
  cin >> V >> E;
  vector<vector<int>> edge(V);    // optimize memory allocation
  vector<int> state(V, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
    int s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    edge[s].push_back(t);
    state[t]++;
  }
  
  queue<int> ans;                 // use a queue instead of vector
  for (int i = 0; i < state.size(); i++) {
    if (state[i] == 0)
      ans.push(i);
  }
  while (!ans.empty()) {          // use a while loop to process the queue
    int v = ans.front();
    ans.pop();
    cout << v << endl;
    for (int t : edge[v]) {
      if (--state[t] == 0)        // decrement and check simultaneously
        ans.push(t);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The functionality remains the same with these changes, but the efficiency is improved in terms of both time and memory usage. The main trade-off is slightly more complex code due to the use of a queue instead of a vector, but it's a small price to pay for enhanced performance.
