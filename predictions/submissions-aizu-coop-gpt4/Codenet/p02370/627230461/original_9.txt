This C++ program reads in a directed graph from standard input, performs a topological sort on the graph, and prints out the sorted order of the vertices. The graph is represented by a 2D vector `edge` and a vector `state`, which represents the number of incoming edges for each node. The topological sort is performed by iteratively finding nodes with no incoming edges (i.e., `state[i] == 0`) and removing them from the graph.

Here are some potential optimizations:

1. **Avoid unnecessary memory allocation**: The `edge` vector is initialized with a size of 10001, regardless of the actual number of vertices (V) in the graph. This can lead to memory wastage when V << 10001. It would be more efficient to initialize the `edge` vector with a size equal to the number of vertices in the graph.

2. **Efficient data structures for ans**: The `ans` vector is used as a queue in the code, with elements being added to the end and removed from the front. However, vectors are not designed to efficiently remove elements from the front, which is a costly operation. Using a data structure like `deque`, which allows efficient addition and removal of elements from both ends, can be more optimal.

3. **Reserve memory for ans**: We know that in the worst case the `ans` deque will have size V. We can reserve this much space in the deque initially to avoid unnecessary reallocations.

4. **Avoid using the `size` function in loops**: The `size` function is called in each iteration of the loops, which can lead to unnecessary overhead. It would be more efficient to compute the size once before the loop and use the computed value in the loop condition.

Here's how we can implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int V, E;
  cin >> V >> E;

  // Allocate edge vector according to actual number of vertices
  vector<vector<int>> edge(V);
  vector<int> state(V, 0);

  for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
    int s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    edge[s].push_back(t);
    state[t]++;
  }

  // Use deque instead of vector for ans
  deque<int> ans;
  ans.reserve(V); // Reserve space for V elements

  // Compute size before loop
  int stateSize = state.size();
  for (int i = 0; i < stateSize; i++) {
    if (state[i] == 0)
      ans.push_back(i);
  }

  // Compute size before loop
  int ansSize = ans.size();
  for (int i = 0; i < ansSize; i++) {
    // Compute size before inner loop
    int edgeSize = edge[ans[i]].size();
    for (int j = 0; j < edgeSize; j++) {
      int t = edge[ans[i]][j];
      state[t]--;
      if (state[t] == 0)
        ans.push_back(t);
    }
    ans.pop_front(); // Efficiently remove element from front
    ansSize = ans.size(); // Update ansSize for the outer loop
  }

  // Compute size before loop
  ansSize = ans.size();
  for (int i = 0; i < ansSize; i++) {
    cout << ans[i] << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations can lead to a slight increase in the complexity of the code, but they help to reduce memory usage and increase the overall running time of the program.
