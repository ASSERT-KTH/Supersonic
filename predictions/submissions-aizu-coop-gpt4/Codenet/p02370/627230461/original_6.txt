This program appears to be performing a topological sorting on a directed graph. The nodes of the graph are represented by integers, and the edges are represented by pairs of integers. The program reads in the edges from standard input, then computes the topological order and outputs it.

Here are some potential areas for optimization:

1. The `edge` vector is oversized: It is initialized with a size of 10001, which is not necessarily the number of vertices in the graph. You can initialize it with a size of `V` after reading the number of vertices.

2. Redundant loop for finding the first node: The loop over `state` to push initial nodes with in-degree 0 into `ans` can be integrated into the first loop where we read the edges and update `state`. This would save us one complete iteration over all nodes.

3. Using `vector::push_back` in the loop: This function may occasionally need to reallocate the vector's storage, which can be a time-consuming operation. If we know the final size of the vector in advance, we can avoid this by using `vector::reserve` function.

4. Using `vector<int>` for `ans`: It would be more efficient to use a deque for `ans` as we are appending and accessing elements from both ends.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int V, E;
  cin >> V >> E;
  
  // Initialize the edge list and state vector with the appropriate size
  vector<vector<int>> edge(V);
  vector<int> state(V, 0);

  // Reserve space for maximum possible size of ans
  deque<int> ans;
  ans.reserve(V);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
    int s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    edge[s].push_back(t);
    state[t]++;
    // As we update state, check if the current node's in-degree is zero
    if (state[s] == 0) ans.push_back(s);
  }
  
  for (auto i: ans) {
    for (auto t: edge[i]) {
      state[t]--;
      if (state[t] == 0)
        ans.push_back(t);
    }
  }

  for (auto i: ans) {
    cout << i << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we have not only improved memory usage by initializing the edge list with the correct size, but also reduced the number of iterations by integrating the loop for finding the initial nodes into the loop for reading the edges. We've also improved the efficiency of appending elements to `ans` by using a deque and reserving space in advance.
