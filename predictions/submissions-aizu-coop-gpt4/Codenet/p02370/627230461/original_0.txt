Code Analysis:
The code seems to be implementing the Kahn's algorithm for finding a topological sort of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The complexity of the part where it is preparing the answer is O(V+E) which is the best possible for this problem. However, there are some improvements that can be made in terms of memory usage and code readability.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The "edge" vector is initialized with a size of 10001 regardless of the value of V. This can lead to a lot of wasted memory if V is significantly smaller than 10001. We can initialize it with size V instead.
2. The use of cin and cout for input/output can be slow and may be replaced with faster alternatives like scanf/printf.
3. Iterating over containers using range-based for loops can make the code more readable and less error-prone.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int V, E;
  scanf("%d %d", &V, &E);
  vector<vector<int>> edge(V);
  vector<int> state(V, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
    int s, t;
    scanf("%d %d", &s, &t);
    edge[s].push_back(t);
    state[t]++;
  }
  vector<int> ans;
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
    if (state[i] == 0)
      ans.push_back(i);
  }
  for (auto i : ans) {
    for (auto j : edge[i]) {
      state[j]--;
      if (state[j] == 0)
        ans.push_back(j);
    }
  }
  for (auto i : ans) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. We initialize vector "edge" with size V which is the actual number of vertices in the graph. This saves memory when V is much smaller than 10001.
2. We replace cin and cout with scanf and printf for faster input/output.
3. We use range-based for loops to iterate over the "ans" and "edge[i]" vectors. This makes the code more readable and eliminates the need for explicit indexing, reducing the chances of off-by-one errors.

Trade-offs:
These optimizations do not have any significant trade-offs. The code complexity remains the same, and the optimizations only improve memory usage and running time. The use of scanf/printf over cin/cout might make the code slightly less readable for those more familiar with cin/cout, but the performance gain is usually worth it.
