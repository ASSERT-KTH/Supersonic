The above code seems to implement a topological sort algorithm. The topological sort is used for scheduling tasks from the given dependencies among tasks. In this case, it is used to find a vertex in a directed graph which has no incoming edges and output them in a sequence such that for every directed edge u -> v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

Let's start the optimization process:

**Code Analysis**
1. The program uses `std::vector` to store graph edges and states, which is not the most efficient data structure in terms of memory usage and speed. The size of vectors is not known at compile time, and they may lead to unnecessary reallocations.
2. The code uses nested loops to traverse the edges and update the states. This process can be optimized.
3. The code is not making use of any compiler optimizations or directives that can hint the compiler to optimize.

**Optimization Strategy**
1. Replace `std::vector` with `std::array` for `edge` and `state` arrays. The `std::array` is a container that encapsulates fixed size arrays and doesn't lead to dynamic memory allocation.
2. Use range-based loops for array traversal which are easier to read and less error-prone.
3. Utilize compiler optimization flags such as `-O2` or `-O3`.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**
1. Replace `std::vector` with `std::array`: The `std::array` is a better choice when the size is known at compile time. This change will reduce the dynamic memory allocations and speed up the program.
2. Use range-based loops: This will make the code more readable and less prone to off-by-one errors. It's also typically as fast as traditional loops.
3. Use compiler optimization options: The `-O2` or `-O3` compiler flags can optimize the program further by enabling various performance-improving transformations on the code.

**Trade-offs**
1. Using `std::array` requires knowing the size at compile time, which might not always be possible. In such cases, `std::vector` would be necessary.
2. Range-based loops are great for readability but can be less flexible than traditional loops.
3. Compiler optimization flags can greatly improve performance, but some transformations might lead to slightly different behavior in edge cases. For example, `-O3` enables aggressive loop transformations such as loop unrolling and fusion, but these might alter the program's behavior when dealing with floating-point numbers due to rounding errors.

**Optimized Code**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_NODES = 10001;

int main() {
  int V, E;
  cin >> V >> E;
  array<vector<int>, MAX_NODES> edge;
  array<int, MAX_NODES> state{};
  for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
    int s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    edge[s].push_back(t);
    state[t]++;
  }
  vector<int> ans;
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
    if (state[i] == 0)
      ans.push_back(i);
  }
  for (const auto& node : ans) {
    for (const auto& target : edge[node]) {
      --state[target];
      if (state[target] == 0)
        ans.push_back(target);
    }
  }
  for (const auto& node : ans) {
    cout << node << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

You can compile the code using g++ with `-O2` or `-O3` flag for more optimizations:
```bash
g++ -O2 main.cpp -o main
```
