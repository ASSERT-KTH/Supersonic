1. **Code Analysis**
The given code is a maze exploration algorithm. It uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the maze and then counts the number of visited cells. The DFS is executed on a 2D grid where '@' is the starting point, '.' are the free cells and '#' are the walls.

2. **Optimization Strategy**
   1. **Avoid unnecessary function calls:**
   The DFS function is called multiple times within a loop. Each function call involves a certain overhead, such as creating a new stack frame. We can inline the DFS function to remove this overhead. However, this might increase the code size and complexity.

   2. **Avoid branching:**
   The DFS function checks whether a cell is out of bound or not. Instead of checking this every time, we can pad the maze with an extra layer of wall cells ('#'). This way, the DFS will naturally stop when it hits the wall, eliminating the need for out-of-bound checks.

   3. **Use bitwise operations:**
   The DFS function checks whether a cell is a wall or an empty space. We can replace these checks with bitwise operations, which are faster than comparison operations.

   4. **Compiler optimizations:**
   We can use compiler flags like -O2 or -O3 to enable various compiler optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, etc.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**
   1. **Inlining the DFS function:**
   ```
   #define INLINE_DFS(y, x) \
       do { \
           if (mp[y][x] != '#') { \
               mp[y][x] = ' '; \ 
               INLINE_DFS(y + 1, x); \
               INLINE_DFS(y - 1, x); \
               INLINE_DFS(y, x + 1); \
               INLINE_DFS(y, x - 1); \
           } \
       } while(0)
   ```
   Here, we have defined a macro to inline the DFS function. This will remove the overhead of function calls. However, this may increase the code size and complexity.

   2. **Padding the maze with wall cells:**
   We can pad the maze with an extra layer of wall cells ('#') so that we don't need to check if a cell is out of bound or not. The DFS will naturally stop when it hits the wall.

   3. **Replacing comparisons with bitwise operations:**
   We can replace the comparison operations with bitwise operations because bitwise operations are faster than comparison operations. For example, instead of using 'if (mp[y][x] == '#')', we can use 'if (mp[y][x] & '#')'.

   4. **Using compiler optimizations:**
   We can use the compiler flag -O2 or -O3 to enable various compiler optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, etc.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**
```c++
#include <cstdio>
#define rep(i, x) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(x); ++i)
#define INLINE_DFS(y, x) do { if (mp[y][x] != '#') { mp[y][x] = ' '; INLINE_DFS(y + 1, x); INLINE_DFS(y - 1, x); INLINE_DFS(y, x + 1); INLINE_DFS(y, x - 1); } } while(0)
char mp[22][24];
int H, W;
int main() {
  while (scanf("%d %d", &W, &H), H || W) {
    int sy, sx;
    rep(i, H + 2) rep(j, W + 2) mp[i][j] = '#';
    rep(i, H) rep(j, W) {
      scanf("\n%c", &mp[i + 1][j + 1]);
      if (mp[i + 1][j + 1] == '@')
        sy = i + 1, sx = j + 1, mp[i + 1][j + 1] = '.';
    }
    INLINE_DFS(sy, sx);
    int cnt = 0;
    rep(i, H) rep(j, W) if (mp[i + 1][j + 1] == ' ') cnt++;
    printf("%d\n", cnt);
  }
}
```
Here, we have implemented the optimizations discussed above. The code is padded with wall cells to remove the need for out-of-bound checks. The DFS function is inlined to remove the overhead of function calls. However, these changes increase the code size and complexity. Also, remember to compile the code with -O2 or -O3 flag for additional compiler optimizations.
