Code Analysis:
The given code is a simple Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm implemented in C++. After reading the input grid, it starts to DFS from a certain point and fills visited cells with spaces. After DFS, it counts the number of space-filled cells.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The program reads the input grid cell by cell, which is inefficient. We can read an entire row at once.
2. While counting the number of space-filled cells, the program traverses the entire grid again which is unnecessary. We can maintain a counter that increments every time we visit a new cell in the DFS function.
3. The DFS function checks for boundary conditions and cell conditions in every invocation. This can be optimized by checking the conditions before making the recursive call.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The first optimization is to read the entire row at once. This reduces the number of I/O operations, leading to faster input reading. 
2. The second optimization is to maintain a global counter that increments every time we visit a new cell in the DFS function. This avoids the need to traverse the entire grid again to count the space-filled cells, reducing the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n). 
3. The third optimization is to check for boundary conditions and cell conditions before making the recursive call in the DFS function. This ensures that the DFS function is only called when necessary, reducing the number of function calls and thus the runtime.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, x) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(x); ++i)
int dx[] = {-1, 1, 0, 0}, dy[] = {0, 0, -1, 1};
char mp[20][22];
int H, W, cnt;

void dfs(int y, int x) {
  // Mark the cell as visited
  mp[y][x] = ' ';
  cnt++; // Increment the counter

  // Explore the neighboring cells
  rep(i, 4) {
    int nx = x + dx[i], ny = y + dy[i];
    if (ny >= 0 && ny < H && nx >= 0 && nx < W && mp[ny][nx] != '#' && mp[ny][nx] != ' ')
      dfs(ny, nx);
  }
}

int main() {
  while (scanf("%d %d", &W, &H), H || W) {
    int sy, sx;
    cnt = 0; // Reset the counter

    // Read the entire row at once
    rep(i, H) {
      scanf("%s", mp[i]);
      rep(j, W) {
        if (mp[i][j] == '@') {
          sy = i, sx = j, mp[i][j] = '.';
        }
      }
    }

    dfs(sy, sx);
    printf("%d\n", cnt);
  }
}
```
The optimized code reduces the number of I/O operations, reduces the time complexity of counting the number of visited cells, and reduces the number of unnecessary calls to the DFS function, making it more efficient.
