Code Analysis:
The given code is a simple implementation of the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. The program reads a 2D map from input, starts from a specified point, and tries to traverse all possible paths. The DFS function is recursive in nature and can potentially cause stack overflow for large inputs. Furthermore, the DFS function is called multiple times in a loop, which can lead to repetitive and redundant computations.

Optimization Strategy:

1. **Eliminate Redundant Computations**: The DFS function is called multiple times from within a loop. If the map does not change between these calls, these computations are redundant and can be optimized.

2. **Optimize Recursive Calls**: Recursive calls lead to increased stack usage and can cause stack overflow for large inputs. Converting the recursive DFS to an iterative version using a data structure such as a stack can help optimize this.

3. **Optimize Data Structure**: The map is stored in a 2D array, which is not cache-friendly. Using a linear array (1D array) to store the map can lead to better cache utilization, which can speed up the program.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: Use compiler-level optimizations such as -O3 and -march=native to allow the compiler to make code optimizations.

Step-by-step Explanation:

1. **Eliminate Redundant Computations**: Currently, the DFS function is called for every cell in the 2D array. We can optimize this by marking visited cells and avoiding revisiting them in future DFS calls.

2. **Optimize Recursive Calls**: We can convert the recursive DFS into an iterative one using a stack data structure. This will reduce stack usage and can prevent potential stack overflow issues.

3. **Optimize Data Structure**: Convert the 2D array into a 1D array to increase cache efficiency. This can be done by storing the elements in a row-major or column-major order.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: Compiler flags like -O3 can perform optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, etc. Similarly, -march=native can generate code optimized for the host processor.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

#define rep(i, x) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(x); ++i)

const int dx[] = {-1, 1, 0, 0};
const int dy[] = {0, 0, -1, 1};

char mp[440];
bool visited[440];
int H, W;

void dfs(int y, int x) {
    stack<pair<int, int>> stk;
    stk.push({y, x});

    while (!stk.empty()) {
        auto [y, x] = stk.top(); stk.pop();
        if (y < 0 || y >= H || x < 0 || x >= W || mp[y*W+x] == '#' || visited[y*W+x])
            continue;
        visited[y*W+x] = true;

        rep(i, 4) stk.push({y + dy[i], x + dx[i]});
    }
}

int main() {
    while (scanf("%d %d", &W, &H), H || W) {
        int sy, sx;
        fill(visited, visited+440, false);

        rep(i, H) rep(j, W) {
            scanf("\n%c", &mp[i*W+j]);
            if (mp[i*W+j] == '@')
                sy = i, sx = j, mp[i*W+j] = '.';
        }

        dfs(sy, sx);

        int cnt = count(visited, visited+440, true);
        printf("%d\n", cnt);
    }
}
```
This code performs the same functionality as the original but is more efficient in terms of memory usage and computational complexity. The trade-off here is that the code is slightly more complex due to the additional data structures and operations.
