The given C++ program seems to be implementing a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm within a 2D grid. It starts from a specific entry point, marked by the '@' symbol, and tries to explore as much as it can until it hits an obstacle, marked by the '#' symbol. The DFS function recursively traverses the grid and marks visited cells as ' '. The main() function reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself from the input, starts the DFS, and then counts the number of visited cells. 

Here are some areas that might benefit from optimization:

1. The use of recursive DFS: This could potentially cause a stack overflow for large inputs. Iterative version using stack can be more optimal in terms of memory usage.

2. Unnecessary computations: The counting of ' ' in the grid can be done while performing the DFS, rather than doing it separately later.

3. Array bounds checking: The program checks whether the current position is within the bounds of the grid at each DFS step. This might be unnecessary as we're guaranteed that the DFS starts from a valid position and doesn't move outside the grid.

4. Use of macros: The code uses the macro rep(i, x) to create a for loop. Macros can make the code harder to understand and debug. 

Now, let's propose an optimized version of this code:

1. We'll replace the recursive DFS with an iterative version using a stack. This will avoid potential stack overflow issues and make the code more memory efficient.
   
2. We'll count the number of visited cells (' ') during the DFS instead of doing it separately later. This will avoid an unnecessary traversal of the grid.

3. We'll remove the array bounds checking from the DFS. As long as the initial position is valid and the grid is surrounded by '#', the DFS will not go outside the bounds.

4. We'll replace the macro rep(i, x) with regular for loops to make the code easier to understand and debug.

Here's an optimized version of the code:

```C++
#include <cstdio>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

int dx[] = {-1, 1, 0, 0}, dy[] = {0, 0, -1, 1};
char mp[20][22];
int H, W;

void dfs(int y, int x) {
  int cnt = 0;
  stack<pair<int, int>> stk;
  stk.push({y, x});
  while (!stk.empty()) {
    pair<int, int> top = stk.top();
    stk.pop();
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
      int ny = top.first + dy[i], nx = top.second + dx[i];
      if (mp[ny][nx] != '#' && mp[ny][nx] != ' ') {
        mp[ny][nx] = ' ';
        stk.push({ny, nx});
        ++cnt;
      }
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", cnt);
}

int main() {
  while (scanf("%d %d", &W, &H), H || W) {
    int sy, sx;
    for (int i = 0; i < H; ++i)
      for (int j = 0; j < W; ++j) {
        scanf("\n%c", &mp[i][j]);
        if (mp[i][j] == '@')
          sy = i, sx = j, mp[i][j] = '.';
      }
    dfs(sy, sx);
  }
}
```
This optimized version of the code should have the same functionality and output as the original code, but it is more memory efficient and avoids unnecessary computations.
