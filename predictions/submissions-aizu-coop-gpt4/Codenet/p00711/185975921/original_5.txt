The provided code is a C++ program that reads a 2D grid from input and recursively performs a depth-first search (DFS) to fill the grid spaces. The DFS starts from a given start point '@', and it stops when it hits a wall '#' or a space ' '. It then counts the number of spaces ' ' in the grid. This problem is very similar to the "Flood Fill" problem in computer graphics.

Given that the code is already quite optimized, very few changes can be made to improve its efficiency. However, there are a few small potential improvements:

1. **Utilizing Compiler Optimizations:** Modern compilers, like GCC and Clang, allow for optimization flags that can have a significant impact on performance. For example, the `-O3` flag in GCC enables several optimization features that can potentially speed up the program.

2. **Avoiding Multiple Calls to DFS:** Currently, the DFS function is called four times for each direction of movement (up, down, left, and right). By using a loop inside the DFS function, we can iterate over the four directions, reducing the number of DFS calls.

3. **Avoiding Global Variables:** The current code uses global variables, which is generally not a good practice in larger programs due to potential naming conflicts and difficulties in tracking their changes. However, in this specific case, shifting these variables to local scope might not yield a significant performance improvement but would make the code cleaner.

4. **Using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`**: This line is used to unsync the C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams. By default, all standard streams are synced, which can cause performance issues, especially when we perform I/O operations in a loop. But this is specific to C++ streams, since we are using scanf/printf (C standard I/O functions), it will not give any performance benefit.

5. **Inline DFS Function:** The DFS function is small and called multiple times. Inlining it can eliminate the function call overhead.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#define rep(i, x) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(x); ++i)
int dx[] = {-1, 1, 0, 0}, dy[] = {0, 0, -1, 1};

// Making dfs inline to avoid function call overhead
inline void dfs(int y, int x, int H, int W, char mp[20][22]) {
  if (y < 0 || y >= H || x < 0 || x >= W || mp[y][x] == '#' || mp[y][x] == ' ')
    return;
  mp[y][x] = ' ';
  rep(i, 4) dfs(y + dy[i], x + dx[i], H, W, mp);
}

int main() {
  while (true) {
    int H, W, sy, sx, cnt = 0;
    char mp[20][22];
    scanf("%d %d", &W, &H);
    if (H == 0 && W == 0) break;
    rep(i, H) rep(j, W) {
      scanf("\n%c", &mp[i][j]);
      if (mp[i][j] == '@')
        sy = i, sx = j, mp[i][j] = '.';
    }
    dfs(sy, sx, H, W, mp);
    rep(i, H) rep(j, W) if (mp[i][j] == ' ') cnt++;
    printf("%d\n", cnt);
  }
}
```

Remember to compile this code with optimizations enabled (`-O3` flag for GCC or Clang). It's important to note that these changes are minor and the performance gain might be negligible or even non-existent on modern hardware. The code was already quite efficient.
