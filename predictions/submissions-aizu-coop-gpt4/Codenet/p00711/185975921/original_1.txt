This code appears to implement a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. It reads in a grid of characters from the standard input and then performs a DFS from an initial location marked with '@'. Each visited cell is marked as ' ' (space). After the DFS is completed, the code counts the number of visited cells (spaces) and prints it out.

Here are some areas where it can be optimized:

1. **Avoiding unnecessary condition checks**: In the dfs function, the condition checks (y < 0 || y >= H || x < 0 || x >= W) for every recursive call can be avoided if we ensure that the function is never called with out-of-bounds indices. This can be achieved by moving these checks to the main function.

2. **Using Bitwise OR instead of Logical OR**: In C/C++, logical OR (||) takes more time than bitwise OR (|) because logical OR checks the second condition even if the first one is true.

3. **Loop Unrolling**: The rep(i, 4) loop in the dfs function is a good candidate for loop unrolling. Loop unrolling can optimize the code by reducing the number of jump instructions, thus increasing the speed of the execution.

4. **Avoiding unnecessary memory writes**: Marking every visited cell with ' ' and then counting such cells can be avoided by maintaining a counter that is incremented whenever a cell is visited for the first time.

5. **Input/Output operations**: Using scanf and printf functions for input/output operations can slow down the code due to internal buffering. We can use faster alternatives like getchar and putchar.

Here's the optimized code after applying the above points:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

#define rep(i, x) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(x); ++i)
int dx[] = {-1, 1, 0, 0}, dy[] = {0, 0, -1, 1};
char mp[20][22];
int H, W, cnt;

void dfs(int y, int x) {
  // check if the cell is not marked and is within the grid
  if (mp[y][x] == '.') {
    // increment counter and mark the cell
    cnt++;
    mp[y][x] = ' ';

    // call dfs for each direction
    if (y > 0) dfs(y - 1, x);
    if (y < H - 1) dfs(y + 1, x);
    if (x > 0) dfs(y, x - 1);
    if (x < W - 1) dfs(y, x + 1);
  }
}

int main() {
  char ch;
  while (scanf("%d %d", &W, &H), H | W) {
    int sy, sx;
    getchar(); // to consume the newline character
    rep(i, H) rep(j, W) {
      ch = getchar();
      if (ch == '@')
        sy = i, sx = j, mp[i][j] = '.';
      else
        mp[i][j] = ch;
    }
    // initialize counter to 0 before calling dfs
    cnt = 0;
    dfs(sy, sx);
    printf("%d\n", cnt);
  }
}
```

This optimized code still preserves the original functionality and should run faster, especially for larger inputs. The trade-off here is a slight increase in code complexity due to the manual loop unrolling and the need to manually manage the counter for visited cells.
