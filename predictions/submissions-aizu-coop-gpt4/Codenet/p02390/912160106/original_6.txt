This is a fairly simple C++ program that takes an input of seconds and converts it to the format of hours, minutes, and seconds. The code is pretty straightforward and there isn't much computation involved, which means there's not much room for performance optimization. However, there are still a few small changes we can make to optimize the code slightly.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use the modulus operator (%) instead of subtraction: This will eliminate the need for the extra calculation and assignment in the lines `is = is - h * 3600;` and `is = is - m * 60;`. The modulus operator (%) gives the remainder of the division which is exactly what we want.

2. Combine declaration and initial assignment: In C++, it's more efficient to combine the declaration and initial assignment of a variable. We will do this for the `h`, `m`, and `s` variables.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int seconds;
  cin >> seconds;
  int hours = seconds / 3600;
  int minutes = (seconds % 3600) / 60;
  int remaining_seconds = (seconds % 3600) % 60;
  cout << hours << ":" << minutes << ":" << remaining_seconds << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

The above code performs the same function as the original code, but with some minor optimizations for efficiency. The code still accepts an input of seconds and then converts it to a time format of hours, minutes, and seconds. The main difference is the use of the modulus operator (%) to eliminate unnecessary calculations and assignments, and the combination of declaration and initial assignment of variables.
