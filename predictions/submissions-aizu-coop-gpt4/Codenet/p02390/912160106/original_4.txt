1. Code Analysis:
The provided C++ program reads an integer from the user, which represents the number of seconds, and then converts this number into hours, minutes, and seconds. It then prints out the converted time. The code is simple and straightforward, with no obvious performance bottleneck or inefficient memory usage. 

However, the code does have unnecessary variable assignments and redundancy in calculations, which can be optimized.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. Remove unnecessary variable assignments. The code creates a separate variable 'is' to store the input seconds. This variable is not necessary and its usage can be replaced with the input variable itself.
   2. Use modular operation instead of subtraction for calculating remaining seconds. This will eliminate the need for extra subtraction operations and make the code more readable.
   3. The code divides the input number twice to get hours and then minutes. This can be optimized to reduce the number of division operations.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. The input variable 'is' is removed and its usage is replaced with the input variable itself. This reduces the number of variables and makes the code cleaner.
   2. The subtraction operations used to calculate the remaining seconds are replaced with modular operations. This makes the code more readable and eliminates the need for extra subtraction operations.
   3. The number of division operations is reduced by calculating the hours and minutes in one step. This makes the code more efficient by reducing the number of operations.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int seconds;
  cin >> seconds;

  int h = seconds / 3600;
  seconds %= 3600;

  int m = seconds / 60;
  seconds %= 60;

  cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << seconds << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized code maintains the functionality of the original code while reducing the number of operations and making the code cleaner and more efficient.
