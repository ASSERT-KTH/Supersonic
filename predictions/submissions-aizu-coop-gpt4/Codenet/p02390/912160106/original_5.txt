1. Code Analysis:
The given code reads an integer from the input (representing the total number of seconds) and converts it to the equivalent time in hours, minutes, and seconds. The code doesn't seem to have any major performance bottlenecks, inefficient memory usage, or sections that might benefit from heavy optimization. However, it has repeated subtraction operations that could be simplified.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Use modulus operator instead of subtracting hours and minutes from the total number of seconds.
    2. Avoid using an extra variable for the input seconds. Instead, use the same variable for calculations.

3. Step-by-step Explanation:
    1. Modulus Operation: The current code calculates the hours by dividing the total seconds by 3600 and then subtracts the calculated hours from total seconds. The same process is repeated for minutes. We can instead use the modulus operator (%) to get the remaining seconds after calculating hours and minutes. The modulus operation is faster and more efficient than the subtraction operation.
    2. Avoid Extra Variable: The code uses an extra variable 'is' to store the input seconds. We can use the variable 's' to store the input and perform the calculations, reducing the memory usage.

Trade-offs: These optimizations do not seem to have any significant trade-offs, as they simplify the code and improve its efficiency without adding complexity.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int h, m, s;
  cin >> s;
  h = s / 3600;
  s %= 3600; // Use modulus operator to get the remaining seconds
  m = s / 60;
  s %= 60; // Use modulus operator to get the remaining seconds
  cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << s << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code maintains the same functionality as the original code while slightly improving its performance by using the modulus operation instead of subtraction. It also reduces memory usage by eliminating an extra variable.
