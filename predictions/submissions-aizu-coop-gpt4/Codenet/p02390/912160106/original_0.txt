Code Analysis:

The given piece of code converts a given amount of time in seconds to the format hours:minutes:seconds. The code is quite straightforward, and there are no complex data structures or recursive calls that could lead to performance issues. That said, there are a couple of areas in this code that can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Redundant Computations: The code contains redundant operations in the form of multiple divisions and multiplications which can be reduced.

2. Compiler Optimization: Compiler flags can be used to optimize the code further.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Redundant Computations: The code is currently performing a division and a multiplication operation to calculate hours and minutes and then subtracting the result from the original time. Instead, we can use the modulus operation to directly calculate the remaining time, which will save us from performing the multiplication and subtraction operations.

2. Compiler Optimization: We can tell the compiler to optimize the code by using the -O3 flag. This flag tells the compiler to use various code optimization techniques like loop unrolling, function inlining etc. This will not change the code itself, but will change the way the binary is generated which will lead to faster execution time.

Trade-offs:

The changes made are minimal and do not affect the readability or complexity of the code. Also, using the O3 flag for compiler optimization may increase the size of the binary, but it will make the execution faster.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int total_seconds;
  cin >> total_seconds;

  int hours = total_seconds / 3600;
  total_seconds %= 3600;
  
  int minutes = total_seconds / 60;
  total_seconds %= 60;

  cout << hours << ":" << minutes << ":" << total_seconds << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

To compile the optimized code with the O3 flag, you would use the following command line instruction (assuming g++ as the compiler):

`g++ -O3 main.cpp -o main`

This command tells the compiler to optimize the code with O3 level and compile the main.cpp file into an executable named 'main'.
