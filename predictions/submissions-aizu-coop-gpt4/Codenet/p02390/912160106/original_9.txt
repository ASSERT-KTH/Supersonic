**1. Code Analysis:** 
The given C++ program is a simple conversion of a given input of seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds. The code is already quite efficient, with a time complexity of O(1). However, we can still make a few tweaks to improve the code's readability and efficiency slightly.

**2. Optimization Strategy:**
A. Inefficient data structures:
There are no data structures used in this program.

B. Redundant computations:
The code is recalculating the seconds left over after converting to hours and again after converting to minutes. We can improve this by using the modulus operator (%) to find the remainder after division, eliminating the need for subtraction.

C. Loops or recursive calls:
There are no loops or recursive calls in this program.

D. Compiler optimizations:
There are no particular parts of the code that would significantly benefit from compiler optimizations or pragma directives.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation:**
A. Using the Modulus Operator:
The modulus operator gives the remainder of a division operation. We can use it to avoid subtraction operations and simplify the code. This change will not greatly improve performance but will make the code cleaner and easier to read.

**4. Optimized Code Block:**
Below is the optimized code with comments explaining the changes made:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int inputSeconds;
  cin >> inputSeconds;

  int hours = inputSeconds / 3600; // calculate hours
  inputSeconds %= 3600; // update inputSeconds with remaining seconds after calculating hours

  int minutes = inputSeconds / 60; // calculate minutes
  inputSeconds %= 60; // update inputSeconds with remaining seconds after calculating minutes

  // output the result
  cout << hours << ":" << minutes << ":" << inputSeconds << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```
