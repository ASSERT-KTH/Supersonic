Code Analysis:
The given C++ program takes an integer as input representing the total number of seconds and converts it into hours, minutes, and seconds. The program is quite simple and does not appear to have any significant performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usage.

However, there are a couple of places where the code can be optimized for better performance:

1. Redundant Computations: The variable 'is' is updated multiple times, which leads to additional subtraction operations. For example, 'is = is - h * 3600;' and 'is = is - m * 60;'. These operations can be avoided by using the modulo operation instead of subtracting.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use Efficient Computations: Replace the subtraction operations with the modulo operation. This will eliminate the need to update the variable 'is' multiple times, reducing the number of operations and thus improving the performance.

Here is the step-by-step explanation of the optimization:

1. Replace subtraction operations with modulo operations: The modulo operation gives the remainder of the division of two numbers. By using modulo, we can directly get the remaining seconds after dividing the input seconds into hours and minutes. This will avoid additional subtraction operations and thus improve performance.

Trade-offs: There are no significant trade-offs in this optimization. The code complexity remains the same and the performance is improved by reducing the number of operations.

Optimized Code Block:

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int is;
  int h, m, s;
  cin >> is;
  h = is / 3600;
  // Use modulo operation to get the remaining seconds after dividing into hours
  is = is % 3600;
  m = is / 60;
  // Use modulo operation to get the remaining seconds after dividing into minutes
  s = is % 60;
  cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << s << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized code follows the same logic as the original code but avoids redundant subtraction operations by using modulo operations. This reduces the number of operations and thus improves performance.
