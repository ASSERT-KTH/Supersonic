Code Analysis:
The given C++ program takes an integer input representing the total number of seconds and converts it into hours, minutes, and remaining seconds. 

The potential bottleneck in this code is the unnecessary storage and computation operations for the variable 'is'. The operations performed on 'is' are simple and negligible in terms of computational complexity, but they can be optimized to reduce the number of operations and memory usage.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Instead of storing the result of the division and the remainder in two separate steps, we can use the modulus operator (%) to directly compute the remainder. This reduces the number of operations performed and hence the computation time.

2. We can eliminate the need to reassign the 'is' variable after each computation. This saves storage operations and reduces memory usage.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. For calculating the hours, we perform 'is / 3600' and then subtract 'h * 3600' from 'is'. This can be simplified by using the modulus operation. The modulus operation 'is % 3600' directly gives us the remaining seconds after subtracting the hours, eliminating the need for an extra subtraction operation.

2. We perform a similar operation for minutes. Instead of dividing by 60 and then subtracting 'm * 60' from 'is', we can simply use 'is % 60' to get the remaining seconds.

Trade-offs:
The optimization process does not entail any major trade-off. The computation and code complexity remain almost the same, but the number of operations and memory usage are reduced.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int is;
  int h, m, s;
  cin >> is;
  h = is / 3600;
  is %= 3600; // Use modulus operation to directly compute the remainder
  m = is / 60;
  is %= 60; // Use modulus operation to directly compute the remainder
  cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << is << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, the functionality and output remain the same as the original code, but the number of operations and memory usage are reduced. The optimized code is also well-commented to make it easily understandable.
