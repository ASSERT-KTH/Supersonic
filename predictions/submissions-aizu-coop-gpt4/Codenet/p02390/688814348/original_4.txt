Code Analysis: 

The code segment is quite small and involves a simple task. However, there is still some optimization that could be done. The program reads an integer representing a number of seconds (S) from the user, then it calculates and prints the equivalent time in hours, minutes, and seconds. The time is calculated by dividing and taking the modulus of S by 3600 and 60.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Identify inefficient data structures: There are no data structures used in this code.

2. Highlight redundant computations: The program computes `S % 3600` twice which is redundant and can be improved.

3. Loops or recursive calls to optimize: There are no loops or recursive calls in this code.

4. Compiler optimizations or pragma directives: There are no specific sections where compiler optimization would significantly improve the performance in this case.

Step-by-step Explanation:

The main optimization that can be made in this case is to eliminate the redundant computation of `S % 3600`. This can be done by storing the result in a variable and using it in both places where it's needed. This reduces the amount of computation and thus improves performance. The trade-off is very minimal in this case, as we are only adding a single variable, which does not significantly increase code complexity or memory usage.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int S;
  cin >> S;
  int remainder = S % 3600;
  cout << S / 3600 << ":" << remainder / 60 << ":" << remainder % 60 << endl;
}
```
In the optimized code, we calculate `S % 3600` only once and store the result in the variable `remainder`. We then use `remainder` in the calculations for minutes and seconds, thus eliminating the need to perform the same computation twice.
