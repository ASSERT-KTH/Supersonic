This code snippet takes an integer `S` as input, representing a total number of seconds, and outputs the equivalent time in hours, minutes, and seconds. 

There are not many opportunities for optimization in this short program, as it's already quite efficient. However, there is one small potential improvement: the calculation `(S % 3600)` is performed twice, which is redundant. 

Optimization Strategy: 

1. Store the result of `(S % 3600)` in a variable and use that variable in the code, avoiding the need to compute it twice. This will save a small amount of computation time.


Optimized Code Block:

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int S;
  cin >> S;
  int remainder = S % 3600;
  cout << S / 3600 << ":" << remainder / 60 << ":" << remainder % 60 << endl;
}
```

In this optimized code, `remainder` is used to hold the result of `(S % 3600)` so that the program only calculates it once. This can reduce the computation time, especially when the input number `S` is large. 

Overall, the performance gain from this optimization would be minimal, as the original code is already quite efficient. However, it's a good practice to avoid redundant computations when possible. 

This optimized code performs the exact same function as the original code, but with slightly less computational overhead.
