1. Code Analysis:
The provided code is implementing a form of depth-first search (DFS) algorithm, where the algorithm is exploring all possible paths down to a certain depth 'd'. In each recursive call, the code is checking whether the current 'mid' value is between 'T-E' and 'T+E'. If it is, the function returns 1, otherwise 0. If 'd' is not zero, the code makes more recursive calls to explore deeper levels. 

However, there are some potential performance bottlenecks:

- The recursion depth can be high, leading to a large number of recursive function calls.
- The code does not take advantage of any potential overlapping sub-problems. 

2. Optimization Strategy:
The major optimization strategy here is to use Dynamic Programming to optimize the recursive function calls. 

Below are detailed steps:

- Memoization: This involves storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again. This can be achieved using a map data structure where the keys are the arguments of the function and the value is the result of the function. Before making a recursive function call, the code should first check if the result for the given arguments is already available in the map. If it is, the code should just return the stored result instead of making another function call.

- Loop Unrolling: This involves modifying the code to execute multiple iterations of a loop in a single iteration. It reduces the overhead caused by the loop control mechanism (incrementing the loop variable, checking the loop condition, etc.). However, in this case, there does not seem to be any loop that can be unrolled.

- Replacing Recursion with Iteration: Generally, iterative solutions perform better than recursive solutions in terms of memory usage because they don't require additional space on the call stack for each recursive call.

- Compiler Optimizations: These optimizations can be done using compiler flags, such as -O2 or -O3 in GCC.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

- Memoization: By storing the results of previous computations, we can avoid unnecessary computation. This is especially beneficial in our case where the same function could be called multiple times with the same arguments due to recursion.

- Compiler Optimizations: These optimizations can be done using compiler flags, such as -O2 or -O3 in GCC. They can help to optimize the code further by performing optimizations like inlining functions, removing dead code, optimizing arithmetic operations, etc.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int K, R, L;
double P, E, T;
unordered_map<double, unordered_map<double, unordered_map<int, double>>> memo;

double dfs(int d, double l, double r) {
  if(memo.find(l) != memo.end() && memo[l].find(r) != memo[l].end() && memo[l][r].find(d) != memo[l][r].end())
    return memo[l][r][d];

  double mid = (l + r) / 2;
  if (!d)
    return (T - E < mid && mid < T + E) ? 1 : 0;
  if (r < T - E || T + E < l)
    return 0;
  if (mid >= T)
    memo[l][r][d] = (1.0 - P) * dfs(d - 1, l, mid) + P * dfs(d - 1, mid, r);
  else
    memo[l][r][d] = (1.0 - P) * dfs(d - 1, mid, r) + P * dfs(d - 1, l, mid);

  return memo[l][r][d];
}

int main() {
  cin >> K >> L >> R >> P >> E >> T;
  printf("%.9f\n", dfs(K, L, R));
  return 0;
}
```
Note: Be careful with the precision when using memoization with floating point numbers.
