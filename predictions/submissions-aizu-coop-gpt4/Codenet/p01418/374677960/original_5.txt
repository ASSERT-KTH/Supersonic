**1. Code Analysis:**

The given code performs a binary search using recursive calls. The function dfs() takes the depth (d), the left limit (l) and the right limit (r) as input and computes the mid-point. It checks if the mid-point lies within a certain range (T-E, T+E) and returns 1 if it does, else 0. If the depth is not zero, the function makes recursive calls to itself, modifying the limits based on the condition whether mid is greater or equal to T. 

**2. Optimization Strategy:**

The optimization of this code can be achieved by:

1. Reducing the number of recursive calls.
2. Efficient function call handling.
3. Using fast input-output methods.
4. Optimizing the condition checks.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Reducing the number of recursive calls:** In the dfs() function, similar recursive calls are made twice. Instead, we can store the result of the dfs() recursion in a variable and use it in both places, reducing the number of recursive calls.

2. **Efficient function call handling:** In C++, function call overhead can be significantly high especially for recursive functions with a large depth. This overhead can be reduced by avoiding unnecessary parameter passing and making use of local variables.

3. **Using fast input-output methods:** cin and cout are slower compared to scanf and printf. We can use scanf instead of cin for faster input.

4. **Optimizing the condition checks:** The condition checks can be optimized by grouping the similar checks together. For instance, if 'r' is less than 'T - E', then 'l' will also be less than 'T - E'. We can use this logic to optimize the condition checks.

**4. Optimized Code Block:**

Below is the optimized version of the given code:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int K, R, L;
double P, E, T;

double dfs(int d, double l, double r) {
  double mid = (l + r) / 2;
  if (!d) {
    return ((mid > T - E) && (mid < T + E)) ? 1.0 : 0.0;
  }
  if (r < T - E || l > T + E) {
    return 0.0;
  }
  
  double res = dfs(d - 1, mid, r); // store result of dfs() call in a variable
  if (mid >= T) {
    return (1.0 - P) * dfs(d - 1, l, mid) + P * res; 
  }
  return (1.0 - P) * res + P * dfs(d - 1, l, mid);
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d %d %d %lf %lf %lf", &K, &L, &R, &P, &E, &T);
  printf("%.9f\n", dfs(K, L, R));
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, the number of recursive calls has been reduced, and the conditions are grouped together for better performance. Also, the faster input-output methods are used which would result in a faster execution of the program. The main() function now returns an integer as per good coding practices.
