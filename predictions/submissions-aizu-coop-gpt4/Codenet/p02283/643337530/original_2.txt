1. Code Analysis:

The given code represents a binary search tree (BST) with basic operations including insertion, inorder traversal, and preorder traversal. The main code reads a sequence of commands from the input and executes them. The commands can be either "insert" followed by a number to insert into the BST, or "print" to print the contents of the BST in inorder and preorder sequences.

2. Optimization Strategy:

The code is generally efficient for a BST. However, some improvements can be made to further improve the performance:

    A. Use `new` and `delete` in C++ instead of `malloc` and `free`.
    B. Use `iostream` for all input/output operations for consistency.
    C. Avoid global variables where possible.
    D. Use `nullptr` instead of `NIL` to represent the end of a tree.
    E. Use `std::unique_ptr` to manage the memory of Node objects automatically.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    A. In C++, it is recommended to use `new` and `delete` for memory allocation and deallocation. They are type-safe, call constructors and destructors, and can be overloaded if needed, which `malloc` and `free` cannot do. This can lead to cleaner and safer code.

    B. The code is mixing `cstdio` and `iostream` for input/output operations. It is better to stick with one for consistency, and `iostream` is more idiomatic in C++. This change will not significantly affect performance, but it will make the code cleaner and more consistent.

    C. Global variables can lead to code that is hard to understand and debug. It's better to encapsulate them in a class or pass them as arguments to functions where needed. This won't impact performance but can make the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

    D. `nullptr` is the new null pointer constant introduced in C++11. It is safer and more type-aware than `NULL`.

    E. `std::unique_ptr` is a smart pointer that retains sole ownership of an object through a pointer and destroys that object when the `unique_ptr` goes out of scope. No two `unique_ptr` instances can manage the same object. This can help manage the memory of Node objects automatically, preventing memory leaks.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>

struct Node {
  int key;
  std::unique_ptr<Node> right, left;
  Node* parent = nullptr;
  
  Node(int k) : key(k), right(nullptr), left(nullptr), parent(nullptr) {}
};

class BST {
private:
  std::unique_ptr<Node> root;

public:
  void insert(int k) {
    Node* y = nullptr;
    Node* x = root.get();
    auto z = std::make_unique<Node>(k);
    while (x != nullptr) {
      y = x;
      if (z->key < x->key) {
        x = x->left.get();
      } else {
        x = x->right.get();
      }
    }
    z->parent = y;
    if (y == nullptr) {
      root = std::move(z); // tree was empty
    } else if (z->key < y->key) {
      y->left = std::move(z);
    } else {
      y->right = std::move(z);
    }
  }

  void inorder(Node* u) {
    if (u == nullptr)
      return;
    inorder(u->left.get());
    std::cout << " " << u->key;
    inorder(u->right.get());
  }

  void preorder(Node* u) {
    if (u == nullptr)
      return;
    std::cout << " " << u->key;
    preorder(u->left.get());
    preorder(u->right.get());
  }

  void print() {
    inorder(root.get());
    std::cout << "\n";
    preorder(root.get());
    std::cout << "\n";
  }
};

int main() {
  BST bst;
  int n;
  std::string command;
  std::cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> command;
    if (command == "insert") {
      int x;
      std::cin >> x;
      bst.insert(x);
    } else if (command == "print") {
      bst.print();
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
