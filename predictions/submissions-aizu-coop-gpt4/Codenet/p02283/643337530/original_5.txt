The given code is a binary search tree implementation in C++. It has functions for inserting elements and for performing in-order and pre-order traversals. The main function executes commands from the user to insert elements into the tree and print the elements of the tree in in-order and pre-order.

Let's analyze the code and identify areas for optimization.

1. **Code Analysis:**

   - The "insert" function uses dynamic memory allocation using "malloc" which is a C style memory allocation. In C++, "new" keyword should be used instead of "malloc" as it does type checking and calls the constructor if any.
   - The inserted Node's "parent" is not set to NIL when it's the root node.
   - There is no destructor or function to free the dynamically allocated memory which could lead to memory leaks.
   - The "inorder" and "preorder" functions use recursive calls which can be expensive for large trees.
   - The "scanf" and "cin" are mixed in the code for input. It's better to stick to one for consistency and because mixing them can cause issues due to buffering.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**

   - Replace "malloc" with "new" for dynamic memory allocation.
   - Set Node's "parent" to NIL when it's the root node.
   - Implement a destructor or a function to free the dynamically allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.
   - Implement iterative versions of "inorder" and "preorder" functions.
   - Use only "cin" for input instead of mixing "scanf" and "cin".

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

   - Replace "malloc" with "new": Using "new" instead of "malloc" in C++ provides the advantage of type checking and it also calls the constructor of the object (if any). This is a safer way to do dynamic memory allocation in C++.
   - Set Node's "parent" to NIL when it's the root node: This is a small fix to maintain consistency in the Node properties.
   - Implement a destructor or a function to free the dynamically allocated memory: Memory management is crucial for performance. By implementing a function to free the memory, we ensure that we don't have any memory leaks which could consume unnecessary memory resources.
   - Implement iterative versions of "inorder" and "preorder" functions: Iterative versions of these functions would have a lower overhead than their recursive counterparts, especially for large trees.
   - Use only "cin" for input: This is more of a best practice than a performance optimization. It's better to use "cin" for input in C++ for consistency and to avoid potential issues with buffering when "scanf" and "cin" are mixed.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
  int key;
  Node *right, *left, *parent;
};

Node *root, *NIL;

void insert(int k) {
  Node *y = NIL;
  Node *x = root;
  Node *z = new Node;
  z->key = k;
  z->left = NIL;
  z->right = NIL;
  while (x != NIL) {
    y = x;
    if (z->key < x->key) {
      x = x->left;
    } else {
      x = x->right;
    }
  }
  z->parent = y;
  if (y == NIL) {
    root = z;
    root->parent = NIL;
  } else {
    if (z->key < y->key) {
      y->left = z;
    } else {
      y->right = z;
    }
  }
}

void inorder(Node *u) {
  stack<Node*> stk;
  while (u != NIL || !stk.empty()) {
    while (u != NIL) {
      stk.push(u);
      u = u->left;
    }
    u = stk.top();
    stk.pop();
    cout << " " << u->key;
    u = u->right;
  }
}

void preorder(Node *u) {
  if (u == NIL)
    return;
  stack<Node*> stk;
  stk.push(u);
  while (!stk.empty()) {
    Node* temp = stk.top();
    stk.pop();
    cout << " " << temp->key;
    if(temp->right)
      stk.push(temp->right);
    if(temp->left)
      stk.push(temp->left);
  }
}

void deleteTree(Node* node) {
  if (node == NIL)
    return;
  deleteTree(node->left);
  deleteTree(node->right);
  delete node;
}

int main() {
  int n, x;
  string com;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> com;
    if (com == "insert") {
      cin >> x;
      insert(x);
    } else if (com == "print") {
      inorder(root);
      cout << "\n";
      preorder(root);
      cout << "\n";
    }
  }
  deleteTree(root);
  return 0;
}
```
The above code has the same functionality as the original code with the optimizations incorporated. We have used "new" for dynamic memory allocation, set the root's parent to NIL, implemented an iterative version of in-order and pre-order traversal functions, used only "cin" for input, and added a function to delete the tree and free up the memory.
