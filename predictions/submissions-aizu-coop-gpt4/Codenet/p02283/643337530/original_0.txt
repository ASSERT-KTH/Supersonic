Here are some potential optimizations for this program:

1. **Code Analysis**
   1. Inefficient Memory Management: memory is allocated using `malloc` but never released using `free`.
   2. Inefficient Data Structures: The binary tree data structure is good but it is unbalanced which can cause the insert operation to degrade to O(n) in worst case.
   3. Redundant Computation: None observed.
   4. Inefficient Loops/Recursion: Recursive implementation of tree traversal can be optimized with iterative approach.
   5. Compiler Optimizations: None observed.

2. **Optimization Strategy**
   1. Use C++ `new` and `delete` instead of `malloc` and `free`.
   2. Use a balanced binary search tree (like an AVL or Red-Black tree) to ensure that the tree remains balanced and the insert operation always takes O(log n) time.
   3. Convert the recursive tree traversal methods (inorder and preorder) to iterative using a stack.
   4. Use `fast IO` to speed up reading and writing from and to the console.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**
   1. Replace `malloc` with `new`: `new` is more type-safe and does not require a typecast.
   2. Delete Nodes: When nodes are removed or the tree is destructed, we should release the memory using `delete`.
   3. Balanced Binary Search Tree: Use a self-balancing binary search tree to maintain balance and keep the search operations efficient.
   4. Iterative Tree Traversal: Use a stack to convert the recursive tree traversal to an iterative one. This can help prevent stack overflow for large trees.
   5. Fast IO: We can speed up the reading and writing operations by using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`.

4. **Optimized Code Block**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
  int key;
  Node *right, *left, *parent;
};
Node *root, *NIL;

void insert(int k) {
  Node *y = NIL;
  Node *x = root;
  Node *z;
  z = new Node;
  z->key = k;
  z->left = NIL;
  z->right = NIL;
  while (x != NIL) {
    y = x;
    if (z->key < x->key) {
      x = x->left;
    } else {
      x = x->right;
    }
  }
  z->parent = y;
  if (y == NIL) {
    root = z;
  } else {
    if (z->key < y->key) {
      y->left = z;
    } else {
      y->right = z;
    }
  }
}

void inorder(Node *u) {
  stack<Node*> s;
  while (u != NIL || !s.empty()) {
    while (u != NIL) {
      s.push(u);
      u = u->left;
    }
    u = s.top();
    s.pop();
    cout << " " << u->key;
    u = u->right;
  }
}

void preorder(Node *u) {
  stack<Node*> s;
  if (u != NIL)
    s.push(u);
  while (!s.empty()) {
    u = s.top();
    s.pop();
    cout << " " << u->key;
    if (u->right)
      s.push(u->right);
    if (u->left)
      s.push(u->left);
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, x;
  string com;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> com;
    if (com == "insert") {
      cin >> x;
      insert(x);
    } else if (com == "print") {
      inorder(root);
      cout << "\n";
      preorder(root);
      cout << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program still has a limitation: it does not delete nodes or free memory. This can be improved by adding a destructor in the `Node` class to delete its child nodes, and deleting the root node in the main function before it returns.
