**Code Analysis:** The given code is a basic implementation of binary search tree (BST) in C++. It supports insertion of nodes and printing the BST in both in-order and pre-order traversals. The `insert` function inserts a node into the BST; `inorder` and `preorder` functions print the BST in in-order and pre-order formats respectively.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Memory Allocation**: In the `insert` function, a new node is being created using the `malloc` function. While this works, it's not idiomatic C++ and doesn't allow for object initialization in the same way `new` does. We can replace `malloc` with `new` for memory allocation which also initializes the object. This would provide performance improvement.

2. **Input Streaming**: In the main function, `scanf` is used for integer input while `cin` is used for string input. We should stick to one input method for consistency and performance. It's better to use `cin` for all inputs as it's the C++ standard.

3. **Unnecessary Global Variables**: The `root` and `NIL` are global variables which can lead to issues in larger codebases. These can be moved to the main function and passed as parameters to the insert and print functions.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: We can hint the compiler to inline the smaller functions `inorder` and `preorder`. These functions are called recursively, and function call overhead can be avoided if these are inlined. This can be done by using the `inline` keyword.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
  int key;
  Node *right, *left, *parent;
};

Node* insert(Node* root, Node* NIL, int k) {
  Node *y = NIL;
  Node *x = root;
  Node *z = new Node;
  z->key = k;
  z->left = NIL;
  z->right = NIL;
  while (x != NIL) {
    y = x;
    if (z->key < x->key) {
      x = x->left;
    } else {
      x = x->right;
    }
  }
  z->parent = y;
  if (y == NIL) {
    root = z;
  } else {
    if (z->key < y->key) {
      y->left = z;
    } else {
      y->right = z;
    }
  }
  return root;
}

inline void inorder(Node *u, Node* NIL) {
  if (u == NIL)
    return;
  inorder(u->left, NIL);
  cout << " " << u->key;
  inorder(u->right, NIL);
}

inline void preorder(Node *u, Node* NIL) {
  if (u == NIL)
    return;
  cout << " " << u->key;
  preorder(u->left, NIL);
  preorder(u->right, NIL);
}

int main() {
  int n, i, x;
  string com;
  Node *root = nullptr, *NIL = nullptr;
  cin >> n;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> com;
    if (com == "insert") {
      cin >> x;
      root = insert(root, NIL, x);
    } else if (com == "print") {
      inorder(root, NIL);
      cout << "\n";
      preorder(root, NIL);
      cout << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. Replaced `malloc` with `new` in the `insert` function. This is a more C++ way of doing things and allows for automatic object initialization.

2. Replaced `scanf` with `cin` in the main function. This is a more idiomatic way of handling input in C++.

3. Moved the `root` and `NIL` variables from global scope to the main function. They are now passed as arguments to the `insert`, `inorder` and `preorder` functions. This prevents potential conflicts and issues in larger codebases.

4. Added `inline` keyword to the `inorder` and `preorder` functions. This hints the compiler to inline these functions, reducing function call overhead and potentially improving performance.
