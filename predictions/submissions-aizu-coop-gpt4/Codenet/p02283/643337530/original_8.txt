Code Analysis:

This code implements a binary search tree (BST) in C++. It contains insert, inorder, and preorder methods for the BST. The insert method adds a new node to the tree, and the inorder and preorder methods print the tree's nodes in their respective orders. The main function reads commands from the standard input and performs the corresponding operations.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use of Inefficient Data Structures: The data structure used here is a binary search tree, which is fine as long as the input is not sorted. However, if the input is sorted, the tree will be skewed, leading to poor performance. We can't do much about this without changing the data structure completely, so we'll leave it as is.

2. Redundant Computations: There aren't any redundant computations in this code.

3. Optimizing Loops and Recursion: Both the inorder and preorder functions use recursion. Recursion can be heavy on the stack and can be slower than iteration, especially for large inputs. Therefore, we can optimize these functions by replacing recursion with iteration using a stack.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations are usually done by passing certain flags to the compiler at the time of compiling the code. They can greatly improve the performance of the code. However, since we don't have information about the compiler used, we won't suggest any compiler optimizations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace Recursion with Iteration: Recursion can be heavy on the stack and can be slower than iteration, especially for large inputs. Therefore, we can optimize the inorder and preorder functions by replacing recursion with iteration using a stack.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
  int key;
  Node *right, *left, *parent;
};

Node *root, *NIL;

void insert(int k) {
  Node *y = NIL;
  Node *x = root;
  Node *z;
  z = (Node *)malloc(sizeof(Node));
  z->key = k;
  z->left = NIL;
  z->right = NIL;
  while (x != NIL) {
    y = x;
    if (z->key < x->key) {
      x = x->left;
    } else {
      x = x->right;
    }
  }
  z->parent = y;
  if (y == NIL) {
    root = z;
  } else {
    if (z->key < y->key) {
      y->left = z;
    } else {
      y->right = z;
    }
  }
}

void inorder(Node *root) {
  stack<Node*> st;
  Node *curr = root;

  while (curr != NIL || !st.empty()) {
    while (curr !=  NIL) {
      st.push(curr);
      curr = curr->left;
    }
    curr = st.top();
    st.pop();

    printf(" %d", curr->key);

    curr = curr->right;
  }
}

void preorder(Node *root) {
  if (root == NIL) {
    return;
  }

  stack<Node*> st;
  st.push(root);

  while (!st.empty()) {
    Node *node = st.top();
    printf(" %d", node->key);
    st.pop();

    if (node->right != NIL) {
      st.push(node->right);
    }
    if (node->left != NIL) {
      st.push(node->left);
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n, i, x;
  string com;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> com;
    if (com == "insert") {
      scanf("%d", &x);
      insert(x);
    } else if (com == "print") {
      inorder(root);
      printf("\n");
      preorder(root);
      printf("\n");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have replaced the recursive inorder and preorder functions with iterative ones. This should improve the performance of the code for large inputs.
