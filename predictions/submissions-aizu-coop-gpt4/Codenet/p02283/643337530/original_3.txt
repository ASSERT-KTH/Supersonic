1. Code Analysis:
The given code is a simple binary search tree (BST) implementation in C++. It performs two operations: insert and print. The insert operation adds a new node to the BST while the print operation does an inorder and preorder traversal of the BST and prints the elements. The code is straightforward and there is no apparent performance issue or memory inefficiency. However, there are some points where we can make improvements.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    A. Use of smart pointers instead of raw pointers.
    B. Replace malloc with new operator.
    C. Use of C++ I/O instead of C-style I/O.
    D. Code readability and maintenance can be improved by using classes and objects.
    
3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    A. Smart Pointers: In C++, smart pointers are used to manage the lifetime of objects which are dynamically allocated. When we use raw pointers, we need to manually manage memory, which can lead to issues like memory leaks, dangling pointers, etc. By using smart pointers, we can avoid these issues as they automatically deallocate memory when they go out of scope.
    B. new vs malloc: In C++, new operator should be preferred over malloc as new initializes the object and is type safe.
    C. C++ I/O: C++ I/O (cin, cout) is generally considered safer and more convenient to use compared to C-style I/O (scanf, printf). It is also more compatible with other C++ features like std::string.
    D. Classes and Objects: The code can be made more organized and easy to understand by encapsulating the Node structure and related functions into a BST class.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>

class Node {
public:
    int key;
    std::shared_ptr<Node> left, right, parent;
};

class BST {
private:
    std::shared_ptr<Node> root;
    std::shared_ptr<Node> NIL;

public:
    void insert(int k) {
        std::shared_ptr<Node> y = NIL;
        std::shared_ptr<Node> x = root;
        auto z = std::make_shared<Node>();
        z->key = k;
        z->left = NIL;
        z->right = NIL;
        while (x != NIL) {
            y = x;
            if (z->key < x->key) {
                x = x->left;
            } else {
                x = x->right;
            }
        }
        z->parent = y;
        if (y == NIL) {
            root = z;
        } else {
            if (z->key < y->key) {
                y->left = z;
            } else {
                y->right = z;
            }
        }
    }
    void inorder(std::shared_ptr<Node> u) {
        if (u == NIL)
            return;
        inorder(u->left);
        std::cout << " " << u->key;
        inorder(u->right);
    }
    void preorder(std::shared_ptr<Node> u) {
        if (u == NIL)
            return;
        std::cout << " " << u->key;
        preorder(u->left);
        preorder(u->right);
    }
    void print() {
        inorder(root);
        std::cout << "\n";
        preorder(root);
        std::cout << "\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    int n, x;
    std::string com;
    BST tree;
    std::cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> com;
        if (com == "insert") {
            std::cin >> x;
            tree.insert(x);
        } else if (com == "print") {
            tree.print();
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
The above code maintains the functionality of the original program but has better memory management due to the use of smart pointers and is easier to understand due to the use of classes. It also uses new to allocate memory, which is safer than malloc, and uses C++ style I/O which can handle more data types, including C++ strings.
