1. Code Analysis:

This code represents a binary search tree (BST). It includes operations for inserting elements and for performing preorder and inorder tree traversals. The performance bottlenecks in this code are not very pronounced, as BST operations generally have good time complexity. However, there are a few aspects that can be optimized.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    A. Data Structures: The BST is implemented using a 'Node' struct with pointers to left, right, and parent nodes. While this is a standard implementation, the 'parent' pointer is not used in the provided code and can be removed to save memory.

    B. Redundant Computations: There are no redundant computations in the given code.

    C. Loops or Recursive Calls: The insert function has a while loop for finding the position to insert the new node. However, this loop is necessary and cannot be optimized without changing the tree structure. The preorder and inorder functions are recursive, which is standard for tree traversals. There are no obvious optimizations here.

    D. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling or function inlining are not applicable here because there are no heavy loops or small, frequently called functions.

3. Step-by-step Explanation:

    A. Removing unused 'parent' pointer: This pointer is allocated memory for each node, but it is not used in the code. Removing it will save memory. The trade-off is that if future code changes need to traverse from a node to its parent, the 'parent' pointer will have to be reintroduced.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
  int key;
  Node *right, *left; // Removed unused parent pointer
};

Node *root, *NIL;

void insert(int k) {
  Node *y = NIL;
  Node *x = root;
  Node *z;
  z = (Node *)malloc(sizeof(Node));
  z->key = k;
  z->left = NIL;
  z->right = NIL;
  while (x != NIL) {
    y = x;
    if (z->key < x->key) {
      x = x->left;
    } else {
      x = x->right;
    }
  }
  if (y == NIL) {
    root = z;
  } else {
    if (z->key < y->key) {
      y->left = z;
    } else {
      y->right = z;
    }
  }
}

void inorder(Node *u) {
  if (u == NIL)
    return;
  inorder(u->left);
  printf(" %d", u->key);
  inorder(u->right);
}

void preorder(Node *u) {
  if (u == NIL)
    return;
  printf(" %d", u->key);
  preorder(u->left);
  preorder(u->right);
}

int main() {
  int n, i, x;
  string com;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> com;
    if (com == "insert") {
      scanf("%d", &x);
      insert(x);
    } else if (com == "print") {
      inorder(root);
      printf("\n");
      preorder(root);
      printf("\n");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version, the 'parent' pointer is removed from the 'Node' struct to save memory. The rest of the code remains the same, as there are no other obvious performance bottlenecks or optimization opportunities.
