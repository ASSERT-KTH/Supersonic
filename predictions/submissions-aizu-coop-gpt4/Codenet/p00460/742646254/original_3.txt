1. Code Analysis: The provided program seems to be a C++ implementation of a dynamic programming solution. It seems to solve a combinatorics problem involving summation with modulo operation. The primary performance issue of this code is that it uses three nested loops, which can lead to a high time complexity, particularly when the inputs are large. 

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Redundant Computations: The first optimization strategy that we can apply is to reduce unnecessary computations. We notice that the code is unnecessarily recalculating the value of `N*N` in every iteration of the outer-most loop. We can calculate it once and store the result.

B. Compiler Optimizations: We can also use the `-O3` compiler optimization flag to instruct the compiler to perform optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and others that can lead to a speedup in the execution of the code.

C. Memory Usage: The variables `dp` array uses a large amount of memory. To optimize this, we can reduce the size of the array if the problem constraints allow. This would need to be verified with problem constraints.

D. Parallelization: If the problem constraints and system allow, we can use OpenMP to parallelize the inner loops. However, this may lead to race conditions and should be done carefully.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Redundant Computations: Calculate `N*N` once and store the result in a variable. This reduces the number of multiplications performed and thus improves the performance of the code.

B. Compiler Optimizations: Using the `-O3` compiler flag, we can speed up the code's execution. However, this might make the code more complex and harder to debug.

C. Memory Usage: Reducing the size of the `dp` array can save memory. However, it's necessary to ensure that the array is still large enough to hold all the necessary values.

D. Parallelization: Parallelizing the inner loops can significantly speed up the execution of the code, especially on multi-core systems. However, we must ensure that no race conditions occur, as this would lead to incorrect results. 

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define REP(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < (int)b; i++)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define all(c) (c).begin(), (c).end()
#define zero(a) memset(a, 0, sizeof a)
#define minus(a) memset(a, -1, sizeof a)
#define watch(a) { cout << #a << " = " << a << endl; }
template <class T1, class T2> inline bool minimize(T1 &a, T2 b) {
  return b < a && (a = b, 1);
}
template <class T1, class T2> inline bool maximize(T1 &a, T2 b) {
  return a < b && (a = b, 1);
}
typedef long long ll;
int const inf = 1 << 29;
int dp[55][3030];
int main() {
  int const MOD = 100000;
  for (int N, M, S; cin >> N >> M >> S && (N | M | S);) {
    int NN = N * N;
    rep(i, 55) rep(j, 3030) dp[i][j] = 0;
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    REP(add, 1, M + 1) {
      for (int currIndex = NN; currIndex >= 1; currIndex--) {
        for (int currSum = add; currSum <= S; currSum++) {
          (dp[currIndex][currSum] += dp[currIndex - 1][currSum - add]) %= MOD;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << dp[NN][S] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
