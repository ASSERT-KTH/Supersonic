1. **Code Analysis:**

   The provided C++ program is a dynamic programming problem. It calculates the number of ways to choose `N*N` numbers from `1` to `M`, such that their sum equals `S`. Here are a few points to note:

   - The program uses a dynamic programming table `dp[55][3030]` to store the number of ways for each index and sum pair.
   - The dp table is initialized with `0` except for `dp[0][0]` which is initialized as `1`.
   - The program iteratively calculates the solution for each index and sum pair by adding the number of ways of the previous index and (current sum - add).
   - The result is obtained from `dp[N*N][S]` and output to the console.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**

   The program is essentially well-optimized for the problem at hand. It uses dynamic programming to solve the problem in polynomial time, which is the best time complexity we can achieve for this kind of problem. However, we can still make a few improvements in terms of code clarity, readability, and minor performance improvements:

   - Remove unnecessary macros and includes.
   - Use descriptive variable and function names.
   - Use standard library functions where possible.
   - Use `std::vector` instead of C-style array for dynamic size handling.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

   - **Remove unnecessary macros and includes:** The program includes `bits/stdc++.h` which is a GCC specific library that includes almost all C++ standard libraries. It's generally discouraged to use this include because it includes a lot of unnecessary code and can slow down the compilation time. Instead, we should only include the libraries that we need. In this case, we only need `iostream` and `vector`.

   - **Use descriptive variable and function names:** Good code should be self-explanatory. We should use descriptive names for variables and functions to make the code more readable and maintainable. For example, we can rename `N` to `numCount`, `M` to `numRange`, `S` to `targetSum`, and `dp` to `ways`.

   - **Use `std::vector` instead of C-style array:** `std::vector` is a safer and more flexible alternative to C-style arrays. It can dynamically handle the size and provide useful member functions. It also better integrates with other C++ standard libraries.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

const int MODULO = 100000;

int main() {
  int numCount, numRange, targetSum;
  while (std::cin >> numCount >> numRange >> targetSum && (numCount || numRange || targetSum)) {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> ways(numCount * numCount + 1, std::vector<int>(targetSum + 1, 0));
    ways[0][0] = 1;

    for (int add = 1; add <= numRange; ++add) {
      for (int currIndex = numCount * numCount; currIndex >= 1; --currIndex) {
        for (int currSum = add; currSum <= targetSum; ++currSum) {
          (ways[currIndex][currSum] += ways[currIndex - 1][currSum - add]) %= MODULO;
        }
      }
    }

    std::cout << ways[numCount * numCount][targetSum] << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that, due to the nature of the problem, even after the above optimizations, the time complexity of the program remains the same. The major improvement here is in the code clarity and readability.
