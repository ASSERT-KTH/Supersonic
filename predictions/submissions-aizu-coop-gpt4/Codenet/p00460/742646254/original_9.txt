1. Code Analysis:

This program is a dynamic programming (DP) solution to a problem (not fully described in the code). It calculates combinations of numbers that sum up to a certain value. The main computation is done inside a triply nested loop, which is a potential point of optimization.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    A. As the main computation is done inside a triply nested loop, one can consider parallelizing the computation. OpenMP is a good choice for this purpose as it can easily parallelize for-loops.

    B. The ‘dp’ 2D array is initialized to 0 at the start of every test case. Instead of using two nested loops to do this, memset can be used which is faster.

    C. The macro `REP` and `rep` can be replaced with regular for-loops for better code readability. Macros can lead to unexpected results if not used carefully and can make debugging difficult.

    D. Using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;` is bad practice as it includes more files than needed which can slow down the compile time and using namespace std can lead to naming conflicts.

    E. Instead of using `typedef`, you can use `using` for aliasing which is more modern and offers more functionality.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    A. Parallelize the computation: The outer two loops can be parallelized using OpenMP. This is because each iteration of the loop can be done independently. This will speed up the computation as multiple threads will be doing the computation at the same time.

    B. Use memset to initialize the array: Instead of using two nested loops to initialize the array to 0, memset can be used which is faster.

    C. Replace macros with for-loops: Macros can lead to unexpected results and make the code less readable. So, it is better to replace the macros with for-loops.

    D. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;`: It's better to include only the required files and not use `using namespace std;` to avoid naming conflicts.

    E. Use `using` instead of `typedef`: `using` is more modern and offers more functionality.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <omp.h>

using ll = long long;
const int inf = 1 << 29;
int dp[55][3030];

template <class T1, class T2>
inline bool minimize(T1& a, T2 b) {
    return b < a && (a = b, true);
}

template <class T1, class T2>
inline bool maximize(T1& a, T2 b) {
    return a < b && (a = b, true);
}

int main() {
    const int MOD = 100000;
    int N, M, S;
    while (std::cin >> N >> M >> S && (N | M | S)) {
        std::memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));  // Faster array initialization
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        // Parallelize outer two loops
        #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2)
        for (int add = 1; add <= M; ++add) {
            for (int currIndex = N * N; currIndex >= 1; --currIndex) {
                for (int currSum = add; currSum <= S; ++currSum) {
                    dp[currIndex][currSum] = (dp[currIndex][currSum] + dp[currIndex - 1][currSum - add]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        std::cout << dp[N * N][S] << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This code should be faster than the original code due to the parallelization of the outer two loops. However, it should be noted that parallelization comes with a cost of creating and managing threads. So, it's beneficial only when the computation inside the loops is heavy, which is the case here.

The trade-off here is that the code complexity has increased slightly due to the addition of OpenMP directives for parallelization. Also, this code might not run correctly on a system that doesn't support OpenMP.
