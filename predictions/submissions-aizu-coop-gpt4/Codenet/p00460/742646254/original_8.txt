Code Analysis:
This code is a dynamic programming problem which calculates how many ways there are to select numbers so that their sum equals a given sum. The performance bottleneck is the nested loops in the main function. The time complexity is O(N^2 * M * S), which can be a huge number if N, M, and S are large.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Efficient Data Structures: The 2D array dp is used to store intermediate results for dynamic programming. This is a reasonable choice as it allows constant time access and update to each element. Therefore, no change is proposed for the data structure.

2. Redundant Computations: There are no apparent redundant computations found in the code.

3. Loops/Recursive Calls: There are nested loops, which is the main source of inefficiency. However, due to the nature of the problem, it's unavoidable to iterate over N, M, and S.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Using compiler optimizations can improve the performance of the code. For example, using the -O3 option for gcc or clang can enable all compiler optimizations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Data Structures: The data structure used in this code is efficient for the problem at hand, so no changes are required here. 

2. Redundant Computations: There are no redundant computations in the code, so no optimization is needed in this area.

3. Loops/Recursive Calls: The nested loops in the code are the main source of inefficiency. However, the loops are essential for the algorithm to work, so they cannot be eliminated or simplified.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations can help improve the performance of the code. You can use the -O3 option when compiling the code to enable all compiler optimizations. This option can make the code run faster, but it may also increase the size of the generated binary.

Trade-offs: Using compiler optimizations can make the code run faster, but it can also make the code more difficult to debug. Also, it may not always lead to a significant improvement in performance.

Optimized Code Block:

The optimized code is identical to the original code, but it should be compiled with the -O3 option to enable all compiler optimizations.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define REP(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < (int)b; i++)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define all(c) (c).begin(), (c).end()
#define zero(a) memset(a, 0, sizeof a)
#define minus(a) memset(a, -1, sizeof a)
#define watch(a)                                                               \
  { cout << #a << " = " << a << endl; }
template <class T1, class T2> inline bool minimize(T1 &a, T2 b) {
  return b < a && (a = b, 1);
}
template <class T1, class T2> inline bool maximize(T1 &a, T2 b) {
  return a < b && (a = b, 1);
}
typedef long long ll;
int const inf = 1 << 29;
int dp[55][3030];
int main() {
  int const MOD = 100000;
  for (int N, M, S; cin >> N >> M >> S && (N | M | S);) {
    rep(i, 55) rep(j, 3030) dp[i][j] = 0;
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    REP(add, 1, M + 1) {
      for (int currIndex = N * N; currIndex >= 1; currIndex--) {
        for (int currSum = add; currSum <= S; currSum++) {
          (dp[currIndex][currSum] += dp[currIndex - 1][currSum - add]) %= MOD;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << dp[N * N][S] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Compile the program with -O3 option:

```bash
g++ -O3 program.cpp
```
