The given C++ code is a dynamic programming solution to a problem, and it seems to be already optimized in terms of logic. However, there are still some points that can be optimized further.

Here are the optimization strategies that can be applied:

1. **Avoiding unnecessary 'cin' and 'cout':** These are slower than 'scanf' and 'printf'. This might not make a big difference, but when dealing with large amounts of I/O in a tight loop, it can add up.

2. **Avoiding global variables:** Global variables are slower to access due to them being in the heap. It is better to make them local to the function if possible.

3. **Avoiding unnecessary macros:** Macros like 'rep(i, n)' is an overkill for a simple for loop. It is better to use a simple for loop.

4. **Avoiding unnecessary template functions:** The template functions 'minimize' and 'maximize' are not used, and can be removed.

5. **Avoiding unnecessary includes:** The '#include <bits/stdc++.h>' includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which can slow down the compilation time. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

6. **Optimizing the loops:** The innermost loop can be optimized by calculating the lower bound of 'currSum' instead of always starting from 'add'.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    const int MOD = 100000;
    vector<vector<int>> dp(55, vector<int>(3030, 0));

    int N, M, S;
    while (cin >> N >> M >> S && (N | M | S)) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 55; ++i) {
            fill(dp[i].begin(), dp[i].end(), 0);
        }
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        for (int add = 1; add <= M; ++add) {
            for (int currIndex = N * N; currIndex >= 1; --currIndex) {
                for (int currSum = max(add, currIndex*add); currSum <= S; ++currSum) {
                    (dp[currIndex][currSum] += dp[currIndex - 1][currSum - add]) %= MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        cout << dp[N * N][S] << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code preserves the functionality of the original code, but with some performance improvements. The changes are minimal and the code is understandable.
