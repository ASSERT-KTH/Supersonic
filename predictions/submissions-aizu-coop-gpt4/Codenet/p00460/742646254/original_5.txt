After analyzing the given code, here are my observations:

- The code is using a 2D array for dynamic programming, which is efficient for this kind of problem.
- The `memset` function is being used to initialize the `dp` array to zero before its use. This operation can be costly in terms of time complexity.
- There are nested loops in the code, which also consume significant time.
- The macros used in the code may be confusing for other developers, which can be a drawback in terms of code readability and maintainability.
- The code uses standard template library (STL) which can sometimes lead to slower execution times, as STL is not always optimized for performance.
- The code uses the `mod` operator frequently, which can be computationally expensive.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimizations:

1. **Optimize Array Initialization**: Instead of using `memset` to initialize the `dp` array, we can initialize the array directly in the declaration statement using an initializer list.
2. **Loop Unrolling**: We can unroll the inner loop to reduce the loop overhead and potentially increase instruction-level parallelism.
3. **Minimize the use of mod operator**: The mod operator is computationally expensive. We can minimize its use by performing the mod operation only when the `dp` array values exceed `MOD`.
4. **Replace Macros with Functions**: Macros can be confusing and can lead to errors. We can replace them with inline functions for better readability and maintainability.
5. **Avoid using STL**: Instead of using `cin` and `cout`, we can use `scanf` and `printf` for faster input and output operations.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

typedef long long ll;
const int inf = 1 << 29;
const int MOD = 100000;
const int MAXN = 55;
const int MAXS = 3030;
int dp[MAXN][MAXS];

inline bool minimize(int &a, int b) {
  return b < a && (a = b, true);
}

inline bool maximize(int &a, int b) {
  return a < b && (a = b, true);
}

inline void add(int &a, int b) {
  a += b;
  if (a >= MOD) a -= MOD;
}

int main() {
  int N, M, S;
  while (scanf("%d %d %d", &N, &M, &S) != EOF && (N || M || S)) {
    for(int i=0; i<MAXN; i++)
      for(int j=0; j<MAXS; j++)
        dp[i][j] = 0;

    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int add = 1; add <= M; add++) {
      for (int currIndex = N * N; currIndex >= 1; currIndex--) {
        for (int currSum = add; currSum <= S; currSum += 4) {
          add(dp[currIndex][currSum], dp[currIndex - 1][currSum - add]);
          if (currSum + 1 <= S) add(dp[currIndex][currSum + 1], dp[currIndex - 1][currSum + 1 - add]);
          if (currSum + 2 <= S) add(dp[currIndex][currSum + 2], dp[currIndex - 1][currSum + 2 - add]);
          if (currSum + 3 <= S) add(dp[currIndex][currSum + 3], dp[currIndex - 1][currSum + 3 - add]);
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", dp[N * N][S]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note that there is a trade-off between performance and code readability when we unroll loops, as it can make the code less readable. Also, replacing `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` may make the code less idiomatic for C++ programmers.
