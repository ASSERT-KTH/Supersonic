This program seems to be a dynamic programming solution to a problem. As a C/C++ developer with focus on performance tuning, let's get into the optimization strategy.

**Code Analysis:**

The most time-consuming part of this program is the triple nested loop that updates the dp matrix. The program iterates over every possible sum of values (up to S) for every possible number of values (up to N * N) for every possible value (up to M). This results in a time complexity of O(N^2 * M * S).

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Efficient Data Structures:** The data structure used here is a 2D array which is efficient for this use case. Therefore, no change is required in this aspect.

2. **Redundant Computations:** As the loop is the main part of computation here and all computations are necessary, no redundancy is found.

3. **Loop Optimization:** The inner loop can be optimized by removing the unnecessary computations. The dp[currIndex][currSum] needs to be updated only if currSum - add >= 0, otherwise it will refer to a negative index which is not defined.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** We can use the -O3 optimization flag which enables all compiler optimizations.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. We add a check in the innermost loop to calculate the dp only when currSum - add >= 0. This would reduce the number of unnecessary computations, thus improving the performance.
2. Use the -O3 optimization flag. This enables all the optimization flags in the compiler, leading to a faster executing code.

**Trade-offs:**

1. The optimization does not add any significant complexity to the code. The updated condition in the loop is easy to understand and does not change the code significantly.
2. Using the -O3 optimization flag might lead to larger binary size.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define REP(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < (int)b; i++)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define all(c) (c).begin(), (c).end()
#define zero(a) memset(a, 0, sizeof a)
#define minus(a) memset(a, -1, sizeof a)
#define watch(a)                                                               \
  { cout << #a << " = " << a << endl; }
template <class T1, class T2> inline bool minimize(T1 &a, T2 b) {
  return b < a && (a = b, 1);
}
template <class T1, class T2> inline bool maximize(T1 &a, T2 b) {
  return a < b && (a = b, 1);
}
typedef long long ll;
const int inf = 1 << 29;
int dp[55][3030];
int main() {
  const int MOD = 100000;
  for (int N, M, S; cin >> N >> M >> S && (N | M | S);) {
    rep(i, 55) rep(j, 3030) dp[i][j] = 0;
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    REP(add, 1, M + 1) {
      for (int currIndex = N * N; currIndex >= 1; currIndex--) {
        for (int currSum = add; currSum <= S; currSum++) {
          if(currSum - add >= 0) { // Avoid undefined behaviour
            (dp[currIndex][currSum] += dp[currIndex - 1][currSum - add]) %= MOD;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    cout << dp[N * N][S] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Remember to compile this code with `-O3` flag for further optimizations.
