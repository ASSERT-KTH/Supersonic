1. Code Analysis:

This code reads a string from the standard input and performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the string to find all possible combinations with specific conditions, and then sorts and prints them.

The code has several inefficiencies:

- Unnecessary array `d` for tracking characters, which is initialized with 26 elements in each recursive call. This could be replaced with a more efficient method.
- The vector `vs` is sorted after all combinations are found, which could be improved by maintaining a sorted list from the start.
- The code does not stop when the input string exceeds the maximum possible permutations, which can lead to significant computation waste.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Use a global array for tracking characters instead of creating one in each recursive call. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.
B. Maintain a sorted list of combinations from the start instead of sorting the vector at the end. This will save computation time.
C. Implement a check to stop the program when the input string exceeds the maximum possible permutations.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Instead of creating a new array `d` in each recursive call, we can create a global array. This will save memory as we won't have to create a new array for each recursion. The array is used to track the count of each character in the string, which can be done globally.

B. Sorting a list of items can be computationally expensive. If the list is maintained in a sorted state from the start, we can save the computation time required for sorting. We can use a `set` instead of a `vector` which keeps the elements sorted.

C. If the length of the input string is larger than the maximum possible permutations, the program will waste a lot of computation. We can avoid this by checking the length of the input string and stopping the program if it exceeds the maximum possible permutations.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define rep(i, a, n) for (int i = a; i < n; i++)
using namespace std;
string s;
set<string> vs;
int d[26] = {};

void dfs(string t, int now) {
  if (now == s.size()) {
    vs.insert(t);
    return;
  }
  d[t[now] - 'a']++;
  if (t[now] != 'z' && d[t[now] + 1 - 'a'] == 0) {
    string tmp = t;
    tmp[now] = tmp[now] + 1;
    dfs(tmp, now + 1);
  }
  if (t[now] == 'a' || d[t[now] - 1 - 'a'] != 0)
    dfs(t, now + 1);
  d[t[now] - 'a']--;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  while (1) {
    cin >> s;
    if (s == "#")
      break;
    if (s.length() > 26) { // Maximum possible permutations with unique characters is 26!.
      cout << "Input too long" << endl;
      continue;
    }
    vs.clear();
    memset(d, 0, sizeof(d));
    dfs(s, 0);
    int ans = vs.size();
    cout << ans << endl;
    auto it = vs.begin();
    if (ans <= 10) {
      for(auto it = vs.begin(); it != vs.end(); ++it)
        cout << *it << endl;
    } else {
      rep(i, 0, 5) { cout << *it++ << endl; }
      it = std::prev(vs.end(), 5);
      rep(i, 0, 5) { cout << *it++ << endl; }
    }
  }
}
```

In this optimized code:
- A global array `d` is used to keep track of the count of characters in the string.
- The `vector` `vs` is replaced with a `set`, which keeps the elements sorted.
- A check is added to stop the program if the length of the input string exceeds 26, which is the maximum possible permutations with unique characters.
