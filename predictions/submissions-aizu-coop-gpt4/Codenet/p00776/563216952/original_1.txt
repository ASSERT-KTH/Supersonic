Analysis:

This C++ program appears to perform a depth-first search (DFS) on a given string, generating a list of all possible strings that can be formed by incrementing the ASCII value of each character in the original string, if possible. The number of generated strings and some of them are then displayed. The key issues in this code from a performance standpoint are:

1. Excessive use of string copying: In the current implementation, each recursive call to the `dfs` function involves copying the string. This can be a significant performance overhead, especially if the input strings are large.
2. Inefficient data structure: The use of a `vector<string>` to store all possible strings can consume a lot of memory as all the possible strings are stored simultaneously.
3. Unnecessary computations: The code computes the frequency of characters in each string for every recursive call, which is not optimal.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use references to avoid unnecessary string copying: Instead of creating a new copy of the string for every recursive call of the `dfs` function, we can pass the string by reference and change it back after the recursive call.
2. Use a set instead of a vector to store the strings: This will eliminate the need for sorting the vector and checking for duplicate values.
3. Compute the frequency of characters only once: We can use a global array to store the frequency of characters in the string and update it in each recursive call.

Let's write the optimized code now:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

string s;
set<string> vs;
int d[26] = {};

void dfs(string& t, int now) {
  if (now == s.size()) {
    vs.insert(t);
    return;
  }
  if (t[now] != 'z' && d[t[now] + 1 - 'a'] == 0) {
    d[t[now] - 'a']--;
    t[now] = t[now] + 1;
    d[t[now] - 'a']++;
    dfs(t, now + 1);
    d[t[now] - 'a']--;
    t[now] = t[now] - 1;
    d[t[now] - 'a']++;
  }
  if (t[now] == 'a' || d[t[now] - 1 - 'a'] != 0) {
    dfs(t, now + 1);
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  while (1) {
    cin >> s;
    if (s == "#")
      break;
    vs.clear();
    memset(d, 0, sizeof(d));
    dfs(s, 0);
    int ans = vs.size();
    cout << ans << endl;
    if (ans <= 10) {
      for (const string& str : vs) {
        cout << str << "\n";
      }
    } else {
      auto it = vs.begin();
      for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        cout << *it << "\n";
        ++it;
      }
      it = prev(vs.end(), 5);
      for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        cout << *it << "\n";
        ++it;
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code has the same functionality as the original one but is more efficient in terms of memory usage and running time. It avoids unnecessary string copying and frequency computation, and uses a set instead of a vector to store the strings, which eliminates the need for sorting.
