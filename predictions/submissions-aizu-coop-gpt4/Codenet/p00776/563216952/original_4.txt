Code Analysis:
The given code is a C++ program that reads strings from standard input one by one until it reads "#". For each string, it generates all unique substrings by incrementing the characters and then sorts them. It then prints the number of unique substrings and the first and last five substrings if there are more than ten unique substrings otherwise, it prints all of them.

Here are some potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies:

1. The dfs function is invoked recursively and for each call, a new string is created. This can slow the program down and increase memory usage. 

2. The program uses a vector to store all substrings before sorting them. This can be memory-intensive for large strings. 

3. The dfs function uses an array to count the number of occurences of each character. This array is re-initialized for each recursive call, leading to redundancy. 

4. The program uses a lot of string manipulations, which are generally slow.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Modify the dfs function to use a reference to the string instead of creating a new one for each recursive call.

2. Use a set instead of a vector to store the substrings. This will keep the substrings sorted and avoid duplicates, reducing the need for sorting and memory usage.

3. Use a global array to count the number of occurrences of each character. This will eliminate the need for re-initialization for each recursive call.

4. Minimize string manipulations by using character arrays instead of strings.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define rep(i, a, n) for (int i = a; i < n; i++)
using namespace std;

set<string> substrings;
char str[26];
int count[26];

void dfs(int now) {
  if (now == strlen(str)) {
    substrings.insert(string(str));
    return;
  }
  if (str[now] != 'z' && count[str[now] + 1 - 'a'] == 0) {
    str[now] = str[now] + 1;
    dfs(now + 1);
    str[now] = str[now] - 1;
  }
  if (str[now] == 'a' || count[str[now] - 'a'] != 0)
    dfs(now + 1);
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  while (1) {
    cin >> str;
    if (strcmp(str, "#") == 0)
      break;
    substrings.clear();
    memset(count, 0, sizeof(count));
    dfs(0);
    int num = substrings.size();
    cout << num << endl;
    if (num <= 10) {
      for (const string &substring : substrings) {
        cout << substring << endl;
      }
    } else {
      auto it = substrings.begin();
      rep(i, 0, 5) {
        cout << *it++ << endl;
      }
      it = substrings.end();
      rep(i, 0, 5) {
        cout << *--it << endl;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this optimized code, the string manipulations are minimized by using character arrays instead of strings. The dfs function is modified to use a reference to the string instead of creating a new one for each recursive call. The substrings are stored in a set instead of a vector, which keeps them sorted and avoids duplicates, reducing the need for sorting and memory usage. A global array is used to count the number of occurrences of each character, eliminating the need for re-initialization for each recursive call.
