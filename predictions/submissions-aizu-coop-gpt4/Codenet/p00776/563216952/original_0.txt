Let's identify the potential areas of optimization in the code:

1. **Data Structures:** The program uses a vector to store the computed strings. This is a reasonable choice, but the usage of vector could be improved by reserving memory upfront if we have an estimate of its size.

2. **Redundant Computation:** The program calculates the frequency of characters in each step of recursion which is redundant and can be optimized.

3. **Recursion:** The dfs function is recursive, which can be a bottleneck on larger inputs. We might be able to improve performance by minimizing the recursion depth or by using an iterative approach.

4. **Sorting and Output:** The program sorts the entire vector of strings before output. If we can keep the vector sorted as we add elements, we can avoid this step.

5. **Compiler Optimizations:** The program could potentially benefit from compiler optimizations, such as function inlining.

Here's the optimization strategy:

1. **Data Structures:** We can't predict the size of the vector so reserving memory upfront isn't possible here.

2. **Redundant Computation:** Instead of recalculating the frequency of characters at each recursive call, we can maintain a global array that keeps track of this. 

3. **Recursion:** Minimizing recursion depth is challenging here without changing the logic of the program. However, we can use tail recursion to optimize the performance.

4. **Sorting and Output:** Instead of storing all strings and sorting them later, we can use a priority queue of fixed size to hold the 5 smallest and 5 largest strings. This way, we avoid sorting and store less data.

5. **Compiler Optimizations:** We can use the inline keyword to suggest the compiler to inline the dfs function.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define rep(i, a, n) for (int i = a; i < n; i++)
using namespace std;

string s;
priority_queue<string, vector<string>, greater<string>> minHeap;
priority_queue<string> maxHeap;
int f[26];

inline void dfs(string& t, int now) {
  if (now == s.size()) {
    if (minHeap.size() < 5) {
      minHeap.push(t);
    } else if (t < minHeap.top()) {
      minHeap.pop();
      minHeap.push(t);
    }
    if (maxHeap.size() < 5) {
      maxHeap.push(t);
    } else if (t > maxHeap.top()) {
      maxHeap.pop();
      maxHeap.push(t);
    }
    return;
  }
  if (t[now] != 'z' && f[t[now] + 1 - 'a'] == 0) {
    t[now]++;
    f[t[now] - 'a']++;
    dfs(t, now + 1);
    f[t[now] - 'a']--;
    t[now]--;
  }
  if (t[now] == 'a' || f[t[now] - 1 - 'a'] != 0)
    dfs(t, now + 1);
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  while (1) {
    cin >> s;
    if (s == "#")
      break;
    while (!minHeap.empty()) minHeap.pop();
    while (!maxHeap.empty()) maxHeap.pop();
    memset(f, 0, sizeof(f));
    dfs(s, 0);
    cout << minHeap.size() + maxHeap.size() << endl;
    vector<string> ans;
    while (!minHeap.empty()) {
      ans.push_back(minHeap.top());
      minHeap.pop();
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < ans.size(); i++) {
      cout << ans[i] << endl;
    }
    ans.clear();
    while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
      ans.push_back(maxHeap.top());
      maxHeap.pop();
    }
    for (int i = ans.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      cout << ans[i] << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The code complexity has increased slightly but it should perform better because it avoids sorting and only keeps track of 10 strings at most.
