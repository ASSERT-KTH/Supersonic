Code Analysis:
The provided program reads a string and creates all possible unique strings by manipulating the characters within a certain rule set. The program then sorts these strings and, depending on the number of strings generated, outputs either all of them or the first and last five. The potential performance bottlenecks are:

1. The dfs function: This function is called recursively and might lead to a significant number of calls, especially for long strings.
2. The sorting of the strings: Depending on the number of generated strings, this operation might be costly.
3. The use of the vector vs to store all generated strings: This causes memory consumption to grow with the number of generated strings, which might be inefficient for large inputs.

Optimization Strategy:

A. Optimization of data structures:
1. Use a set instead of a vector: A set automatically maintains unique elements in sorted order, which would eliminate the need for sorting the strings manually.

B. Reducing redundant computations:
1. Avoid unnecessary string copying: In the current DFS function, a new string is created at every function call.

C. Optimize loops/recursions:
1. Optimize the DFS function: Use string references instead of value passing to avoid string copying.

D. Compiler optimizations:
1. Use O3 compiler optimization level: This level of optimization includes inline substitution, loop unrolling, and other optimizations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Use a set instead of a vector:

The main reason to switch from a vector to a set is to eliminate the need for sorting. Sorting can be a significant performance drain, especially with long strings. Sets automatically maintain the order of elements, so no manual sorting is needed.

B. Avoid unnecessary string copying:

In the existing DFS function, a new string is created for every function call, which can be avoided by passing a reference instead.

C. Optimize the DFS function:

By using a reference to the string instead of passing the string by value, the number of string copies can be significantly reduced. This results in more efficient memory usage and faster execution.

D. Use O3 compiler optimization level:

This level of optimization includes inline substitution, loop unrolling, and other optimizations. It can lead to significant performance gains at the expense of longer compilation times and potentially larger executable sizes.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define rep(i, a, n) for (int i = a; i < n; i++)
using namespace std;
string s;
set<string> vs;
bool f[26];

void dfs(string &t, int now) {
  if (now == s.size()) {
    vs.insert(t);
    return;
  }
  int d[26] = {};
  rep(i, 0, now) d[t[i] - 'a']++;
  if (t[now] != 'z' && d[t[now] + 1 - 'a'] == 0) {
    t[now] = t[now] + 1;
    dfs(t, now + 1);
    t[now] = t[now] - 1;
  }
  if (t[now] == 'a' || d[t[now] - 'a'] != 0)
    dfs(t, now + 1);
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  while (1) {
    cin >> s;
    if (s == "#")
      break;
    vs.clear();
    dfs(s, 0);
    int ans = vs.size();
    cout << ans << endl;
    if (ans <= 10) {
      for (auto &str : vs) { cout << str << endl; }
    } else {
      auto it = vs.begin();
      rep(i, 0, 5) { cout << *it++ << endl; }
      it = vs.end();
      rep(i, 0, 5) { cout << *--it << endl; }
    }
  }
}
```
This optimized code passes the string by reference in the dfs function, reducing the number of string copies. The vector of strings has been replaced with a set, eliminating the need for manual sorting. The final output loop has been adjusted to work with a set.
