Code Analysis:

The code reads strings from standard input and performs depth-first search (DFS) to generate all possible string combinations by adjusting the alphabet positions of the characters. It then counts and displays these combinations based on certain conditions. 

Potential bottlenecks:

1. The function `dfs` is called recursively, which can have a high computational cost for large inputs.
2. Sorting the vector `vs` could be expensive for large numbers of elements.
3. There are a couple of loops that could be optimized.
4. The use of `std::vector` for storing combinations is not optimal for memory usage.

Optimization Strategy:

1. For the data structure storing the combinations, `std::vector` is not memory efficient. We might consider using a `std::set` instead. `std::set` automatically sorts the elements and avoids duplicates, which could save us computational time.

2. The computation of `d` array inside every recursion in DFS is redundant. We can optimize this by calculating it once and passing it as a parameter.

3. The function `dfs` can be optimized by avoiding creating copies of the string `tmp` in every call. We could pass the string by reference instead.

4. The code `tmp[now] = tmp[now] + 1;` is not clear. It seems to be incrementing the ASCII value of the character at index `now`. We should clarify this with a comment.

5. In the main function, the output process can be optimized by avoiding sorting the entire vector if we only need to print the first five and last five elements.

6. The `rep` macro used for loops can be replaced with range-based loops for more readability and less chance of off-by-one errors.

7. Compiler optimizations like `-O2` or `-O3` flag can be used to allow the compiler to perform automatic optimizations.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

string s;
set<string> st;
bool f[26];

// the function now receives d as a parameter and t is passed by reference
void dfs(string &t, int now, int d[26]) {
  if (now == s.size()) {
    st.insert(t);
    return;
  }
  
  if (t[now] != 'z' && d[t[now] + 1 - 'a'] == 0) {
    // incrementing the ASCII value of the letter in the string
    t[now]++;
    dfs(t, now + 1, d);
    t[now]--; // undo the change for the next recursion
  }
  if (t[now] == 'a' || d[t[now] - 'a'] != 0)
    dfs(t, now + 1, d);
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);

  while (cin >> s, s != "#") {
    st.clear();
    int d[26] = {};
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) d[s[i] - 'a']++;
    dfs(s, 0, d);
    
    int ans = st.size();
    cout << ans << endl;

    auto it = st.begin();
    if (ans <= 10) {
      for (const auto &str : st) {
        cout << str << endl;
      }
    } else {
      for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++, it++) {
        cout << *it << endl;
      }
      for (it = prev(st.end(), 5); it != st.end(); it++) {
        cout << *it << endl;
      }
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
