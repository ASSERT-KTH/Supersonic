After analyzing the code, it seems that the program is designed to take three integer inputs, and check if they are in ascending order. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise "No". Although the code is already quite simple, there are a few potential optimizations that could be made:

1. Code Analysis: The only potential performance hit in this code could be the conditional check and printing to the console, which are both relatively cheap operations. There isn't any complicated computation or memory-heavy operations being performed.

2. Optimization Strategy: 
    A. The line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` doesn't do anything and should be removed. 
    B. The `printf` statements could be combined into a single ternary operation. 
    C. The `return (0);` statement is not necessary in modern C/C++. The compiler adds it automatically at the end of the `main` function.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation: 
    A. The line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` is a no-operation in C/C++. It seems to be a misplaced constraint. It should be removed to avoid confusion.
    B. By using a ternary operator in the print statement, the code becomes cleaner and slightly faster. It eliminates the need for two separate print statements.
    C. In modern C/C++, the `return 0;` at the end of main is not necessary. The C/C++ standard guarantees that the main function will return 0 if control reaches the end without encountering a return statement.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
  printf("%s\n", (a < b && b < c) ? "Yes" : "No");
}
```

This optimized code performs the same functionality as the original code but is cleaner and potentially slightly faster. Note that the performance gain from these optimizations is likely to be negligible, as the original code was already quite simple and efficient.
