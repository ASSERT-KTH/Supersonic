Here's the analysis of the provided code:

1. Code Analysis:
   This is a simple C program that accepts three integer inputs from the user. It then checks if the numbers are in ascending order. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise, it prints "No".

The line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` doesn't serve any purpose in the code and should be removed. It seems like an attempt to limit the input range, but it doesn't work in C. 

In terms of performance, this short program doesn't have any glaring inefficiencies. It's quite simple and straightforward, with no complex operations, loops, or data structures. 

2. Optimization Strategy:
   In the context of this program, optimization can be approached from a code clarity and error prevention perspective, rather than performance. This includes:
   1. Removing the unneeded line.
   2. Adding error checking for the `scanf` function to ensure that the expected number of inputs were read.

3. Step-by-step Explanation:
   1. First, the line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` is removed. In C, this line does not limit the input to the range 0-100 as it might seem. It's a comma expression that ultimately evaluates to `c <= 100`, the rest is discarded. Since it serves no purpose, it's removed.
   2. The `scanf` function returns the number of inputs it successfully read. This can be used to add a simple error check. If `scanf` doesn't return 3, then not all inputs were read and an error message can be printed. This isn't exactly a performance optimization, but it improves the robustness of the program. 

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int a, b, c;
  
  if(scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c) != 3) {
    printf("Error: Expected 3 inputs\n");
    return 1;
  }
  
  if (a < b && b < c) {
    printf("Yes\n");
  } else {
    printf("No\n");
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

In this code, the unnecessary line has been removed, and an error check has been added after the `scanf` call. If `scanf` doesn't successfully read 3 integers, the program prints an error message and returns 1, indicating an error occurred.
