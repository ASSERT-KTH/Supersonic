This simple C program reads in three integers and checks if they are in ascending order. If they are, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, "No". The program is already fairly efficient, but there are a few minor improvements we can make.

1. Code Analysis:
   - The statement `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` has no effect on the code. It seems like the developer tried to limit the values of a, b, and c to the range [0, 100], but this is not the correct way to do it in C. This line can be safely removed.
   - The variables a, b, and c are declared but not initialized before use. This can lead to undefined behaviors in some environments, although most compilers will automatically initialize them to 0.
   - The standard library function `scanf` could potentially fail if the input is not an integer. This is an edge case, but for robustness it would be good to handle this case.
   
2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Remove the ineffective statement `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;`.
   - Initialize the variables a, b, and c to zero.
   - Handle the potential failure of `scanf`.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   - Removing `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;`: This statement has no effect and can lead to confusion, so we remove it to clean up the code.
   - Initializing variables: We initialize a, b, and c to zero to avoid undefined behavior.
   - `scanf` failure: To handle the potential failure of `scanf`, we check its return value. If it is not equal to the expected number of inputs (3 in this case), we exit the program with a failure status code.

Here is the optimized code block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
  int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0;
  
  if (scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c) != 3) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Invalid input\n");
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  }

  if (a < b && b < c) {
    printf("Yes\n");
  } else {
    printf("No\n");
  }

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

Note:
- This optimized code is more robust and easier to understand, but it may be slightly more complex due to the added error handling.
- The optimized code maintains the same functionality and output as the original code.
- This optimization does not include any compiler-specific optimizations or pragmas, because the program is simple and any potential gains would be minimal.
