Code Analysis:

The given C program takes three integers as input and checks if they are in increasing order. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". The possible performance bottlenecks and inefficient usage are:

1. The line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` is meaningless in C. This neither sets a range for the variables nor constrains their input. It is an unnecessary line that should be removed.

2. The conditional check `a < b && b < c` is straightforward and efficient for this purpose. It doesn't seem to have any scope for further optimization.

Optimization Strategy:

The overall code is very simple and doesn't have complex data structures, loops, or recursive calls that usually require optimization. However, the code can be cleaned up and made more readable.

1. Remove the unnecessary line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;`.

2. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` can be declared while taking input to make the code more concise.

3. As this is a simple program, compiler optimization flags won't make a significant difference. Still, you can consider using `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flags if you're concerned about performance.

Optimized Code Block:

Here's the optimized version of your code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
  
  if (a < b && b < c) {
    printf("Yes\n");
  } else {
    printf("No\n");
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code maintains the same functionality as the original, but it's cleaner and more readable. The changes are minimal, and they don't alter the logic of the program. The comments are omitted in the optimized version because the code is self-explanatory.
