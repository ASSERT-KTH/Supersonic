Code Analysis:

The given code snippet is fairly simple. It reads three integers from standard input (stdin), checks if they are in increasing order, and prints "Yes" if they are and "No" otherwise.

Here are some observations:

1. The line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` serves no purpose in the code. It's not assigning values to the variables a, b, and c, nor is it performing a useful check on their values. It should be removed.

2. There is no error checking for the scanf() call. In a real-world program, it would be important to ensure that the input is valid and that the scanf() call succeeded.

3. The program uses the `printf()` function to output its results. While this is not inherently a problem, it's worth noting that `printf()` is a relatively expensive operation, in terms of performance, because it involves system calls. If the program needed to output many results quickly, it would be more efficient to use a method that avoids system calls, such as writing to a memory buffer.

Optimization Strategy:

Given the simplicity of the program, there isn't much scope for optimization. But here are a few steps that can be taken:

1. Remove the redundant line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;`.

2. Add error checking for the scanf() call.

3. Replace multiple printf() calls with a single one.

Step-by-step Explanation:

1. The line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` does not affect the code's execution, so it can be safely removed.

2. Adding error checking after the scanf() call is a good practice to ensure that valid input was received. If scanf() fails, an error message should be printed, and the program should exit with a non-zero status code.

3. Instead of having two separate calls to printf(), one for "Yes\n" and one for "No\n", a single call can be made. This can be done by using the ternary operator to choose the correct string based on the condition. This change won't noticeably improve performance for this program, but it simplifies the code and could make a difference in a program that prints many results.

Optimized Code Block:

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
  int a, b, c;
  if (scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c) != 3) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: Invalid input\n");
    return 1;
  }
  printf("%s\n", (a < b && b < c) ? "Yes" : "No");
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code is slightly more robust than the original because it checks the result of scanf(). It's also a bit simpler because it uses a single printf() call instead of two. However, there are no major performance gains to be had from these changes due to the simplicity of the original program.
