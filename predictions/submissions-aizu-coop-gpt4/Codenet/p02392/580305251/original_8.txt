The given code is a simple C program that reads three numbers and checks if they are ordered in an ascending manner. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". 

Although the code is generally performant, there are some minor improvements that can be made.

### Code Analysis:
The line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` doesn't actually perform any bounds check as might be intended. In C/C++, the comma operator ',' has the lowest precedence of all operators (except for assignment operators). The left expression (0 <= a) is evaluated as true or false and the result is discarded. Then the right expression (c <= 100) is evaluated and its result becomes the value of the whole expression. This line doesn't affect 'a', 'b' or 'c' at all.

### Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary line: The line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` is unnecessary and can be removed.

2. Use fgets and sscanf for input: The scanf function can be a source of potential errors and inefficiencies. We can use fgets to read the entire line and sscanf to parse the input. This gives us more control and error checking ability.

3. Error Checking: The current code does not perform any error checking on the input. We should add checks to ensure that the input is valid.

### Step-by-step Explanation:

1. Removing the unnecessary line: The line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` doesn't do what it seems to be intended for and can be safely removed.

2. Using fgets and sscanf: The fgets function reads an entire line of input, including the newline character. We can then use sscanf to parse this input. This allows us to handle input more efficiently and perform error checking.

3. Adding error checking: We should check if the sscanf function was able to parse 3 integers from the input. If not, we can print an error message and return an error code.

### Optimized Code Block:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

#define BUFFER_SIZE 256

int main(void) {
    int a, b, c;
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];

    if (fgets(buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, stdin) == NULL) {
        printf("Error reading input\n");
        return 1;
    }

    if (sscanf(buffer, "%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c) != 3) {
        printf("Invalid input. Please enter three integers\n");
        return 1;
    }

    if (a < b && b < c) {
        printf("Yes\n");
    } else {
        printf("No\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This optimized code removes the unnecessary line and replaces the scanf function with fgets and sscanf. It also adds error checking to ensure that the input is valid. The functionality and output of the code remain the same as the original.
