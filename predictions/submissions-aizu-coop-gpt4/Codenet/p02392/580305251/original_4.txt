The code provided is a simple C program that takes three integers as input and checks if they are in ascending order. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". Here are the steps taken to optimize the given code:

1. Code Analysis: 

The code has no apparent performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usage. The program is already quite efficient. However, the line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` does nothing, and it should be removed.

2. Optimization Strategy:

Since the program is already straightforward and does not contain any complex data structures, loops, or recursive calls, there isn't much room for optimization. The only thing that can be improved is the redundant line of code that needs to be removed.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation: 

The code has a line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` that does not serve any purpose and is not limiting or checking the values of variables a, b, or c in any way. Removing this line will not impact the functionality of the program but will make the code cleaner.

There are no trade-offs in this optimization as it does not impact the code complexity or performance.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
  if (a < b && b < c) {
    printf("Yes\n");
  } else {
    printf("No\n");
  }
  return (0);
}
```
In this optimized code, the redundant line of code has been removed. The functionality and output of the original code are preserved. The code remains understandable and maintains its original simplicity.
