This is a very basic program that reads three integer values from the user (a, b, and c) and checks if they are in ascending order. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

This code is already quite efficient and doesn't have any obvious performance bottlenecks. However, we can make a few minor optimizations to improve the code's performance even further:

1. **Reduce the number of calls to printf**: The current code calls printf twice - once to print "Yes" or "No", and once to print a newline character. We can reduce this to a single call by including the newline character in the first printf call.

2. **Use getchar instead of scanf for user input**: The scanf function is generally slower than getchar because it has to parse the format string and perform type checking. Since we only need to read integers, we can use getchar instead.

Here's the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  a = getchar() - '0';
  getchar(); // remove white space
  b = getchar() - '0';
  getchar(); // remove white space
  c = getchar() - '0';

  if (a < b && b < c) {
    printf("Yes\n");
  } else {
    printf("No\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Note: The above optimization works well for single digit integer inputs between 0 and 9. For multi-digit integer inputs or integers beyond a single digit, using scanf would be more suitable, as getchar would not be able to read these correctly. 

Overall, these minor optimizations should help to reduce the runtime of the program slightly, although the difference would be negligible for such a small program.
