The provided code is a simple C program that reads three integers from the input and checks if they are in ascending order. If they are, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". Given the simplicity of the code, there isn't much scope for performance optimization. However, there are a few minor changes that could be made for good practice, although they won't have any noticeable impact on the program's performance.

Here are the proposed changes:

1. Use of `puts()` over `printf()`: Instead of `printf()`, we can use the `puts()` function for printing newline terminated strings. The `puts()` function automatically appends a newline character, unlike `printf()`. It is a bit faster because it doesn't need to parse the format string.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);
  if (a < b && b < c) {
    puts("Yes");
  } else {
    puts("No");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note, these changes will not have any significant impact on the performance for this particular code, but are rather programming practices that are beneficial for larger programs. The initial code is efficient as is and does not contain any major performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usage.
