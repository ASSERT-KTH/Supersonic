The given C program is simple and efficient in its current form. It reads three integers from the standard input, checks if they are in increasing order, and outputs "Yes" if they are or "No" if they're not.

Here are some minor optimizations:

1. Unnecessary Flush: In C, the `printf` function automatically flushes the output buffer when it encounters a newline character (`\n`). Therefore, if the program prints "Yes" or "No" and then a newline in two separate `printf` calls, the output buffer is flushed twice, which can be a bit inefficient. By combining these into a single `printf` call, the output buffer will only need to be flushed once.

2. Return Value: The return value of `scanf` is not checked in the code. `scanf` returns the number of successfully scanned items, so it is good practice to check if the values were correctly read. However, if the input is guaranteed to be valid, this check may be omitted for performance reasons.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  if(scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c) == 3) {
    if (a < b && b < c) {
      printf("Yes\n");
    } else {
      printf("No\n");
    }
  } else {
    fprintf(stderr, "Invalid input\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the following changes were made:

1. The two `printf` calls were combined into a single one to reduce the number of buffer flushes.
2. The return value of `scanf` is checked to ensure that three integers were successfully scanned. If not, the program outputs an error message to stderr. This check can be omitted if the input is always valid.

The trade-off here is a slight increase in code complexity for a potential (albeit small) increase in efficiency. The functionality and output of the original code remain the same.
