This is a very simple C program that checks if three numbers are in ascending order. Performance tuning is usually not necessary for such simple programs, however, in the spirit of the task, let's consider some points.

Code Analysis:
1. The program takes three numbers as input.
2. It checks if the numbers are in ascending order.
3. If the numbers are in ascending order, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

Optimization Strategy:
1. Since scanf and printf are system calls which are expensive in terms of time, we could reduce the number of calls to these functions.
2. The condition in the if statement could be simplified to reduce computation.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Instead of two separate calls to printf to print the result and the newline character, we can combine these into a single call.
2. In the if statement, we can simplify the condition by using the logical OR operator (||) instead of logical AND (&&). This way, as soon as one condition fails, the program won't check the rest, reducing computation time.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);
  
  // Simplify the condition and reduce number of printf calls
  if (a >= b || b >= c) {
    printf("No\n");
  } else {
    printf("Yes\n");
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we have decreased the number of calls to printf from two to one. Also, by simplifying the condition, we have potentially reduced computation time by avoiding unnecessary comparisons. However, the benefit of these optimizations in such a simple program would be negligible. 

It's important to note that optimization should be considered only when necessary. Over optimizing code can lead to increased complexity and decreased readability, which should be avoided in most cases. In complex programs, optimization can indeed lead to significant performance improvements, but in a simple program like this, the difference would be hardly noticeable.
