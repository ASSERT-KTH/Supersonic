This is a simple program that checks if three integers are in increasing order. Given the simplicity of the program, there's not much room for running time optimization. However, we can slightly optimize the code by minimizing I/O operations and streamline the decision-making logic.

Here are the steps to optimize this code:

1. **Minimize I/O Operations:** According to C's standard I/O library, every I/O operation is costly in terms of performance. In the original code, two separate printf statements are used - one for printing "Yes" or "No", and one for printing a newline. We can merge these two into a single printf statement, reducing the overhead of function calls.

2. **Streamline Decision-making Logic:** The if-else structure is used in the original code to decide whether to print "Yes" or "No". This can be simplified by using the conditional (ternary) operator (?:), which can improve code readability and potentially offer a slight performance boost.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);
  printf("%s\n", (a < b && b < c) ? "Yes" : "No");
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the program performs the same function but with slightly improved performance and readability. The trade-off is that developers less familiar with the ternary operator may find the code slightly harder to understand. However, given its widespread use in the C language, this should not typically pose a problem.
