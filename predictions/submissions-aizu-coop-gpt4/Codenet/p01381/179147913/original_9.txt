Code Analysis:
The code consists of a main function that reads two integers from the standard input in an infinite loop. The first integer, `n`, is used to create an array `p` of size `n+2`, and the second integer, `k`, is used as a limit for a loop. If `n/2` is less than `k`, it prints "-1" and continues to the next loop iteration. Otherwise, it fills the array `p` with some values and then prints a pair of elements from `p`, shifted by `i` and wrapped around `n`, `k` times.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Array `p` is created on each iteration of the `while` loop. This can be optimized by using dynamic memory allocation (for example, with `new` in C++) and reusing the same memory if the new size is the same or smaller than the old one.

2. The array `p` is filled with values in a loop that runs `n` times. This computation could be moved inside the second loop to avoid unnecessary computations when `k` is 0.

3. The second loop prints `n-1` pairs of numbers `k` times. This can be optimized by reducing the number of calls to `printf`. For example, by using `std::cout` and string formatting to concatenate all the pairs for each `k` and print them in a single call.

4. The modulo operation is computationally expensive. We can avoid it by using an if condition to check if the index is within the range.

5. Compiler optimizations: We can use `-O3` compiler flag for full optimization.

Optimization Steps:
1. Move the declaration of array `p` outside the `while` loop and use dynamic memory allocation. Check the size of `n` on each iteration and only allocate new memory if `n` is larger than the current size.

2. Move the computation of `p` values inside the second loop and only compute them if `k` is not 0.

3. Instead of calling `printf` for each pair, concatenate all the pairs into a single string and print them with a single call to `cout`.

4. Replace the modulo operation with an if condition to check if the index is within the range.

5. Use `-O3` compiler flag when compiling the code.

Here is the optimized code:
```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL); 

  int n, k;
  vector<int> p;
  while (cin >> n >> k) {
    if (n / 2 < k) {
      cout << "-1\n";
      continue;
    }
    p.resize(n + 2);
    p[0] = 0;
    if (k != 0) {
      for (int i = 1; i < n; i += 2) {
        p[i] = i / 2 + 1;
        p[i + 1] = n - p[i];
      }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      string output;
      for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
        int a = p[j] + i;
        if (a >= n) a -= n;
        a++;
        int b = p[j + 1] + i;
        if (b >= n) b -= n;
        b++;
        output.append(to_string(a) + " " + to_string(b) + "\n");
      }
      cout << output;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the code should be faster and use less memory than the original. However, it is also slightly more complex due to string formatting and dynamic memory allocation. The `-O3` compiler flag can be used for further optimization.
