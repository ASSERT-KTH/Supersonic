Code Analysis:

The code reads pairs of integers from the standard input and performs operations based on those numbers. It creates an array of integers, computes some numbers based on the input, and prints out pairs of numbers. There are multiple for-loops performing calculations and printing operations which could be potential performance bottlenecks. The code also uses variable-length arrays which are not standard in C++ and could lead to inefficient memory usage.

Optimization Strategy:

1. The use of printf() for output might be slower than using cout due to the formatting overhead. Replacing printf() with cout can potentially provide a performance boost.

2. The array p[] is initialized in every iteration of the outer while-loop. If the size of array is large, this could lead to significant overhead. To avoid this, we could move the declaration of the array outside of the while-loop and only resize it when necessary.

3. The calculations inside the inner-most loop can be simplified or pre-calculated to reduce the amount of computation needed.

4. Use of '\n' instead of endl for newline. The endl not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output buffer every time, which can slow down the program. Using '\n' instead can potentially improve performance.

5. Avoiding integer division when possible, as it is a relatively expensive operation.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace printf() with cout: cout is generally faster than printf() because it doesn't have the overhead of formatting. However, this might make the code slightly more complex due to the different syntax of cout.

2. Move the declaration of the array p[] outside of the while-loop: This can avoid unnecessary initialization of the array, which can be expensive for large arrays. The downside is that we need to ensure that the array is properly resized and that old values do not interfere with the new ones.

3. Simplify or pre-calculate calculations inside the inner-most loop: This can reduce the amount of computation needed, which can improve performance. The downside is that the code might become slightly more complex.

4. Use '\n' instead of endl for newline: The endl not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output buffer every time, which can slow down the program. Using '\n' instead can potentially improve performance.

5. Avoid integer division when possible: Integer division is a relatively expensive operation. If it can be replaced with a cheaper operation such as bit shifting, it can improve performance. However, this might slightly increase the complexity of the code.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // boost performance when using cin and cout
  int n, k;
  vector<int> p; // dynamic array to avoid unnecessary initializations
  while (cin >> n >> k) {
    if (n / 2 < k) {
      cout << "-1\n";
      continue;
    }
    if (p.size() < n + 2) // resize the array only if necessary
      p.resize(n + 2);
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i += 2) {
      p[i] = i / 2 + 1;
      p[i + 1] = n - p[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
        int a = (p[j] + i) % n + 1;
        int b = (p[j + 1] + i) % n + 1;
        if (j != 0)
          cout << '\n'; // use '\n' instead of endl to avoid unnecessary buffer flushes
        cout << a << ' ' << b;
      }
      cout << '\n'; // print a newline at the end of each block
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
