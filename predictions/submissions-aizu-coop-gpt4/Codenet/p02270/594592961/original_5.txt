1. Code Analysis:
   The given code is reading an integer array `W` of size `n` and an integer `k` from the input. Then it calculates the sum of elements in `W` and divides it by `k`, rounding up to the nearest integer. It keeps incrementing `P` until all elements of `W` can be loaded within `k` tracks. If an item in `W` is larger than `P`, or if the current sum of the items on a track exceeds `P`, then it returns false.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. Avoid passing large data structures (like vectors) by value: In the `IsAllLoaded` function, the vector `W` is passed by value, which creates a new copy of the vector in memory. This results in unnecessary memory consumption and a waste of CPU cycles.
   2. Avoid global recalculation: The sum of the vector `W` is recalculated in every iteration of the while loop inside the `Calc` function. This operation has a time complexity of O(n) and it's done in each iteration, while the sum stays the same.
   3. Avoid unnecessary computations: The `P++` operation is executed in every iteration of the while loop, even if it's clear that the condition will not be met.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Pass `vector<int> W` by reference in `IsAllLoaded` function: This allows the function to directly refer to the original vector, instead of creating a new copy. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.
   2. Calculate the sum of `W` only once and store it in a variable: This avoids the unnecessary computation of sum in every iteration.
   3. Use binary search to find the optimal `P`: This can significantly reduce the number of iterations and thus improve the overall performance.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> Input(const int n) {
  vector<int> W;
  W.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int w;
    cin >> w;
    W.push_back(w);
  }
  return W;
}

bool IsAllLoaded(int P, const vector<int>& W, int k) {
  int TrackIndex = 0;
  int CurrentSum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < W.size(); i++) {
    if (W[i] > P) {
      return false;
    }
    if (CurrentSum + W[i] > P) {
      TrackIndex++;
      if (TrackIndex == k) {
        return false;
      }
      CurrentSum = 0;
    }
    CurrentSum += W[i];
  }
  return true;
}

int Calc(const vector<int>& W, int k) {
  int Sum = accumulate(W.begin(), W.end(), 0);
  int left = *max_element(W.begin(), W.end());
  int right = Sum;
  while (left < right) {
    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
    if (IsAllLoaded(mid, W, k)) {
      right = mid;
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  return left;
}

int main() {
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  vector<int> W = Input(n);
  int P = Calc(W, k);
  cout << P << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Each modification in the code was made to optimize memory usage and performance. However, it's worth noting that the binary search approach might be a little harder to understand for beginners compared to the original brute-force solution.
