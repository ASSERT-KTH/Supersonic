1. Code Analysis:

The provided code seems to be for a problem where we are given a set of weights, and we have to distribute them among 'k' tracks such that the maximum load on any track is minimized. 

The main bottlenecks in the code are:

- The `IsAllLoaded` function is called in a loop in the `Calc` function, and each time it processes all elements of the input vector. This is inefficient and could be a performance issue for large input vectors.
- The `IsAllLoaded` function also uses pass-by-value for the vector, which means a new copy of the vector is created each time the function is called. This could lead to increased memory usage.
- In the `Calc` function, we start from the average weight and increment one by one until we find the minimum possible maximum load. This is a linear approach and can be optimized.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Inefficient data structures: The usage of vector is fine in this code.
B. Redundant computations: The computation of total sum in `Calc` function could be done once in main and passed to other functions.
C. Recursive calls or loops: Binary search could be used in `Calc` function to minimize the maximum load, instead of incrementing one by one.
D. Compiler optimizations: Not required for this code.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

Let's start optimizing the code:

- Compute the total sum of weights once in the main function and pass it to other functions.
- Change the `IsAllLoaded` function to pass-by-reference to avoid creating a new copy of the vector each time the function is called.
- Instead of incrementing 'P' one by one in the `Calc` function, use a binary search approach. Start with 'low' as the maximum element in the array and 'high' as the sum of all elements. The mid value gives the average, check if all elements can be loaded with 'mid' as the maximum load. If yes, try to minimize it, else increase it.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

vector<int> Input(const int n) {
    vector<int> W(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> W[i];
    }
    return W;
}

bool IsAllLoaded(int P, const vector<int>& W, int k) {
    int TrackIndex = 0;
    int CurrentSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < W.size(); i++) {
        if (W[i] > P) {
            return false;
        }
        if (CurrentSum + W[i] > P) {
            TrackIndex++;
            if (TrackIndex == k) {
                return false;
            }
            CurrentSum = 0;
        }
        CurrentSum += W[i];
    }
    return true;
}

int Calc(vector<int>& W, int k, int Sum) {
    int low = *max_element(W.begin(), W.end());
    int high = Sum;
    int result = high;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if (IsAllLoaded(mid, W, k)) {
            result = mid;
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<int> W = Input(n);
    int Sum = accumulate(W.begin(), W.end(), 0);
    int P = Calc(W, k, Sum);
    cout << P << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
The optimized code has a better time complexity due to the binary search approach and uses less memory as it avoids unnecessary copying of the vector.
