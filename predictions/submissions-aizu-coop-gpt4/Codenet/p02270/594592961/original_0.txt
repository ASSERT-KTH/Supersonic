Let's break down the optimization steps one by one:

1. **Code Analysis**: The code reads a list of weights from the user, calculates the sum of all weights, and then tries to divide the weights across a given number of trucks (`k`). The function `IsAllLoaded` checks if a given maximum load (`P`) is enough to load all weights into `k` trucks, while `Calc` calculates the minimum possible `P` that can satisfy the condition.

2. **Optimization Strategy**:

   A. The function `Input` uses `vector::push_back` to add elements to the vector `W`. This might cause multiple reallocations if the vector's capacity is exceeded. We can avoid this by using `vector::reserve`.

   B. The function `IsAllLoaded` is called multiple times with the same vector `W` in `Calc`. Each call involves traversing the entire vector. We could try to reduce the number of calls to `IsAllLoaded`.

   C. The function `Calc` uses a linear search to find the minimum `P`. We can optimize this to a binary search because if a `P` can load all weights, any `P' > P` can also load all weights.

   D. The vector `W` is passed by value to `IsAllLoaded` and `Calc`, which involves copying the entire vector. This can be avoided by passing the vector by reference.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:

   A. In the function `Input`, after reading `n`, we can call `W.reserve(n)` before the loop. This allocates enough memory for `n` elements at once, avoiding reallocations during the loop.

   B. Instead of incrementing `P` by 1 in `Calc`, we can use a binary search between `P` and `Sum` to find the minimum `P` that returns `true` from `IsAllLoaded`. This reduces the number of calls to `IsAllLoaded` from `O(n)` to `O(log n)`.

   C. In `Calc`, we change the while loop to a binary search. We set `left` to `P` and `right` to `Sum`. While `left < right`, we set `mid` to `(left + right) / 2` and call `IsAllLoaded(mid, W, k)`. If it returns `true`, we set `right` to `mid`. Otherwise, we set `left` to `mid + 1`. Finally, we return `left`.

   D. We change `vector<int> W` to `const vector<int>& W` in the parameter list of `IsAllLoaded` and `Calc`. This avoids copying the vector when the functions are called.

4. **Optimized Code Block**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> Input(const int n) {
  vector<int> W;
  W.reserve(n);  // avoid multiple reallocations
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int w;
    cin >> w;
    W.push_back(w);
  }
  return W;
}

bool IsAllLoaded(int P, const vector<int>& W, int k) { // avoid copying W
  int TrackIndex = 0;
  int CurrentSum = 0;
  int i = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < W.size(); i++) {
    if (W[i] > P) {
      return false;
    }
    if (CurrentSum + W[i] > P) {
      TrackIndex++;
      if (TrackIndex == k) {
        return false;
      }
      CurrentSum = 0;
    }
    CurrentSum += W[i];
  }
  return true;
}

int Calc(const vector<int>& W, int k) { // avoid copying W
  int Sum = accumulate(W.begin(), W.end(), 0);
  int left = (Sum + k - 1) / k, right = Sum;
  while (left < right) {
    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
    if (IsAllLoaded(mid, W, k)) {
      right = mid;
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  return left;
}

int main() {
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  vector<int> W = Input(n);
  int P = Calc(W, k);
  cout << P << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
