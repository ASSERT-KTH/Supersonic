Let's start by analysing the code.

This code takes two inputs: 'n' which is the size of the vector and 'k' which seems to represent a limit. It then inputs 'n' values into a vector 'W'. The function 'Calc' calculates a sum 'P' which is the smallest possible integer such that all elements of vector 'W' can be grouped into 'k' groups where each group's sum is less than or equal to 'P'.

The performance bottleneck of this code is in the function 'IsAllLoaded'. This function is called multiple times in the 'Calc' function until it returns true. In the worst case scenario, this function can have a time complexity of O(n^2) since it iterates over all elements in the vector 'W' and is called n times in the 'Calc' function.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient data structures: The vector 'W' is being passed by value to the function 'IsAllLoaded'. This creates a copy of the vector each time the function is called which can be quite inefficient when dealing with large vectors. Instead, the vector should be passed by reference to avoid unnecessary copying.

2. Redundant computations: The sum of all elements in the vector 'W' is calculated in each iteration of the while loop in the 'Calc' function. This sum can be calculated once outside the loop and reused.

3. Loop optimization: The while loop in the 'Calc' function iterates until the 'IsAllLoaded' function returns true. Instead of incrementing 'P' by 1 in each iteration, a binary search approach can be used to find the minimum 'P' which can significantly reduce the number of iterations.

4. Compiler optimizations: Compiler optimization flags like '-O2' or '-O3' can be used when compiling the code to optimize it even further.

Step by Step Explanation:

1. Pass the vector 'W' by reference to the function 'IsAllLoaded'. This avoids unnecessary copying of the vector and reduces memory usage.

2. Calculate the sum of the vector 'W' once outside the while loop in the 'Calc' function and reuse it in each iteration.

3. Replace the while loop in the 'Calc' function with a binary search approach to find the minimum 'P'. This reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

4. Use compiler optimization flags like '-O2' or '-O3' when compiling the code. These flags enable various performance optimizations by the compiler.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

vector<int> Input(const int n) {
    vector<int> W;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int w;
        cin >> w;
        W.push_back(w);
    }
    return W;
}

bool IsAllLoaded(int P, const vector<int>& W, int k) { // pass vector by reference
    int TrackIndex = 0;
    int CurrentSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < W.size(); i++) {
        if (W[i] > P) {
            return false;
        }
        if (CurrentSum + W[i] > P) {
            TrackIndex++;
            if (TrackIndex == k) {
                return false;
            }
            CurrentSum = 0;
        }
        CurrentSum += W[i];
    }
    return true;
}

int Calc(vector<int>& W, int k) { // pass vector by reference
    int Sum = accumulate(W.begin(), W.end(), 0);
    int P_min = *max_element(W.begin(), W.end());
    int P_max = Sum;
    while (P_min < P_max) { // binary search for minimum P
        int P_mid = P_min + (P_max - P_min) / 2;
        if (IsAllLoaded(P_mid, W, k)) {
            P_max = P_mid;
        } else {
            P_min = P_mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return P_min;
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<int> W = Input(n);
    int P = Calc(W, k);
    cout << P << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Note: Remember to compile the code with optimization flags like '-O2' or '-O3'.
