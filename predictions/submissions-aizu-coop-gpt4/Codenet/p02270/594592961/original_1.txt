Code Analysis:
The given code calculates the minimum load capacity (P) for a set of trucks so that all the trucks can carry the given load (W) without exceeding their capacity. It receives two inputs: the number of loads (n) and the number of trucks (k). The code then reads the weights of the loads and calculates the minimum load capacity (P) for the trucks.

Potential performance bottlenecks include:

1. The `IsAllLoaded()` function conducts a linear scan of the weight vector (W) for each possible value of P until it finds a suitable one. This can lead to a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, which is inefficient especially for larger inputs.

2. In `Input()` function, the use of `push_back()` for adding elements to the vector can lead to repeated memory reallocation if the vector needs to expand, which is inefficient.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use binary search to speed up the search for the minimum P in the `Calc()` function. This will lower the time complexity to O(n log n).

2. Reserve space in the vector in the `Input()` function to prevent repeated memory reallocation.

3. Pass the vector by reference in the `IsAllLoaded()` function to avoid unnecessary copying.

4. Use `cin.tie(NULL)` and `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to speed up input/output operations.

Optimized Code Block:
Here is the optimized version of the given code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> Input(const int n) {
  vector<int> W;
  W.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int w;
    cin >> w;
    W.push_back(w);
  }
  return W;
}

bool IsAllLoaded(int P, const vector<int>& W, int k) {
  int TrackIndex = 0;
  int CurrentSum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < W.size(); i++) {
    if (W[i] > P) {
      return false;
    }
    if (CurrentSum + W[i] > P) {
      TrackIndex++;
      if (TrackIndex == k) {
        return false;
      }
      CurrentSum = 0;
    }
    CurrentSum += W[i];
  }
  return true;
}

int Calc(vector<int>& W, int k) {
  int Sum = accumulate(W.begin(), W.end(), 0);
  int left = *max_element(W.begin(), W.end());
  int right = Sum;
  while (left < right) {
    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
    if (IsAllLoaded(mid, W, k))
      right = mid;
    else
      left = mid + 1;
  }
  return right;
}

int main() {
  cin.tie(NULL);
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  vector<int> W = Input(n);
  int P = Calc(W, k);
  cout << P << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, I used binary search in the `Calc()` function to find the minimum P, which dramatically improves the time complexity. I also made minor changes to the `Input()` and `IsAllLoaded()` functions to improve efficiency.
