The given C++ program appears to be a binary search implementation for a problem where we have to find the minimum capacity of 'k' trucks such that all 'n' items can be transported. Each item has a certain weight and a truck can carry multiple items as long as the total weight does not exceed its capacity. The objective is to minimize the maximum weight that a truck has to carry.

To optimize this program, we can consider the following steps:

1. **Inefficient Data Structure**: The program uses an array to store the weights of the items. Arrays are not inefficient per se, but we can replace this with a vector for automatic memory management and easier manipulation. However, in this case, the switch may not provide any significant performance improvement, so we'll keep it as is.

2. **Redundant Computations**: The binary search part seems to be efficiently implemented without any redundant computations. However, we can optimize the 'check' function by removing the inner while loop and replacing it with a more efficient logic.

3. **Loops/Recursion Optimization**: The 'check' function can be optimized. Currently, it goes through each item and checks if it can fit in the current truck capacity. If it fits, it adds the item to the truck and moves to the next item, otherwise, it considers the next truck. This process is repeated 'k' times. Instead, we can calculate the total number of trucks required for a given capacity in one pass.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: Compiler optimizations can be done using pragma directives or flags. However, such optimizations are generally used for computationally heavy programs. In this case, it won't provide much benefit, so we skip it.

Now let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int check(int N[], int n, int k, int w) {
  int trucks = 1;
  int current_weight = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (N[i] > w) {
      return n + 1;
    }
    if (current_weight + N[i] <= w) {
      current_weight += N[i];
    } else {
      current_weight = N[i];
      trucks++;
    }
  }
  return trucks;
}

int main() {
  int MAX_W = 1000000000;
  int n, k;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);
  int N[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &N[i]);
  }
  int left = 0;
  int right = MAX_W;
  while (left < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    int required_trucks = check(N, n, k, mid);
    if (required_trucks <= k) {
      right = mid;
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  cout << right << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In the 'check' function, we initialize 'trucks' to 1 and 'current_weight' to 0. For each item, if its weight is more than the capacity 'w', we return 'n+1' which indicates that 'w' is not a valid capacity. If the weight of the current item and 'current_weight' is less than or equal to 'w', we add the item to the current truck. Otherwise, we start a new truck and add the item to it.

In the main function, we modify the binary search to check if the number of required trucks for capacity 'mid' is less than or equal to 'k'. If it is, we update 'right' to 'mid', otherwise, we update 'left' to 'mid + 1'. The minimum valid capacity is 'right' at the end of the binary search. The optimized code should have a better performance since it reduces the number of iterations in the 'check' function.
