1. Code Analysis:
The given code is a C++ program that implements a binary search algorithm to find the minimum weight capacity of a truck required to transport all the items. The weight of each item is stored in an array N and the truck makes at most 'k' trips. The check function is used to find out how many items can be transported for a given weight capacity 'w'. The binary search is used to find the minimum 'w'.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   A. Inefficient Data Structure: The array 'N' seems to be the optimal choice for this scenario. No other data structure would provide significant benefits.
   
   B. Redundant Computations: The binary search is implemented efficiently and there are no redundant computations here.
   
   C. Loops and Recursive Calls: The loops and recursive calls are also implemented efficiently. No optimization needed here.
   
   D. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations can be used to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. For instance, we can use the '#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")' directive to enable the highest level of optimization.

3. Step-by-step Explanation:
   A. Since there are no inefficient data structures, redundant computations, or inefficient loops in the given code, no changes are required in these aspects.
   
   B. A possible optimization here is to add compiler directives. By adding '#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")', we instruct the compiler to optimize the code as much as possible. This can yield performance improvements by allowing the compiler to perform optimizations like function inlining, loop unrolling, and vectorization.
   
   C. Even though compiler optimizations can increase the speed of the program, they can also increase the size of the generated binary and can make debugging more difficult since the optimized code may not closely correspond to the source code.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")

int check(int N[], int n, int k, int w) {
  int i = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
    int s = 0;
    while (s + N[i] <= w) {
      s += N[i];
      ++i;
      if (i == n)
        return n;
    }
  }
  return i;
}

int main() {
  int MAX_W = 1000000000;
  int n, k;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);
  int N[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &N[i]);
  }
  int left = 0;
  int right = MAX_W;
  while (left < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    if (check(N, n, k, mid) == n) {
      right = mid;
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  cout << right << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Note: This code is already optimized and the compiler optimization directive is just an additional step that may improve performance, but it is not guaranteed as it depends on the specific hardware and compiler used.
