1. Code Analysis:

The code appears to be an algorithm for solving a variant of the bin-packing problem. The function `check` tries to fill `k` bins with items of certain weights, without exceeding the weight `w` for any bin. The main function uses binary search to find the smallest value of `w` that can accommodate all weights.

In terms of performance, there are not many glaring inefficiencies in the code. However, the dynamic allocation of the array `N` could be optimized if we know an upper limit for `n`.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    A. Use static allocation for array `N` if an upper limit for `n` is known. This will save the overhead of dynamic memory allocation.
    
    B. Avoid unnecessary integer division in the binary search. Right now, the mid-point is calculated as `(left + right) / 2`, which involves an integer division operation. However, this can be optimized to `left + (right - left) / 2` to avoid the division operation.
    
    C. Use faster I/O methods. The `scanf` and `printf` functions are faster than `cin` and `cout`.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    A. If we know an upper limit for `n`, we can statically allocate an array `N` of that size. This reduces the overhead of dynamic memory allocation, but at the cost of potentially wasting some memory if `n` is usually much less than the upper limit.
    
    B. Integer division is slower than addition and subtraction. By changing the calculation of the mid-point to `left + (right - left) / 2`, we avoid the division operation, which can improve performance. However, this optimization is very minor and is unlikely to have a noticeable effect on performance unless `n` and `k` are very large.
    
    C. The `scanf` and `printf` functions are generally faster than `cin` and `cout`, because they have less overhead. This can improve the speed of the program, especially if the number of I/O operations is large.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#define MAX_N 1000000
#define MAX_W 1000000000

int check(int N[], int n, int k, int w) {
  int i = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
    int s = 0;
    while (s + N[i] <= w) {
      s += N[i];
      ++i;
      if (i == n)
        return n;
    }
  }
  return i;
}

int main() {
  int n, k;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);
  int N[MAX_N];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &N[i]);
  }
  int left = 0;
  int right = MAX_W;
  while (left < right) {
    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
    if (check(N, n, k, mid) == n) {
      right = mid;
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", right);
  return 0;
}
```

This code assumes that `n` will not exceed `MAX_N`. If this is not a valid assumption, then dynamic allocation should be used for array `N`.
