Code Analysis: 

The given code is a C++ program to solve a binary search problem. The key operation is the 'check' function. It checks if a given limit 'w' can fit all elements of array 'N' into 'k' groups. The 'main' function uses this check function in a binary search between 0 and a maximum value to find the minimum limit that can fit all elements into 'k' groups. 

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. The 'check' function is called multiple times with the same arguments except for 'w'. But it always starts from the beginning of array 'N'. This is redundant and can be optimized.
2. The array 'N' is allocated on the stack, which could lead to a stack overflow for large 'n'. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a global variable to keep track of the starting point for the next 'check' function. This way we avoid redundant checking from the beginning of the array.
2. Allocate the array 'N' on the heap to avoid potential stack overflow.
3. Use 'std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)' to turn off synchronization between C and C++ standard streams. This can speed up I/O operations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Declare a global variable 'start' and initialize it to 0. In the 'check' function, start from 'start' instead of 0. If 'check' returns 'n', meaning all elements fit, reset 'start' to 0. Otherwise, update 'start' to the returned value.
2. Allocate the array 'N' dynamically on the heap.
3. Add 'std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)' at the beginning of 'main' to speed up I/O operations.

Trade-offs: 
1. Using a global variable can make the code harder to understand and maintain. But in this case, it helps avoid redundant computations and improves performance.
2. Dynamic memory allocation can increase the complexity of the code and potential runtime errors. But it avoids stack overflow for large 'n'.
3. Turning off synchronization between C and C++ standard streams can cause issues if both are being used. But in this case, only C++ streams are used.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int start = 0;

int check(int N[], int n, int k, int w) {
  int i = start;
  for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
    int s = 0;
    while (s + N[i] <= w) {
      s += N[i];
      ++i;
      if (i == n)
        return n;
    }
  }
  return i;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

  int MAX_W = 1000000000;
  int n, k;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);
  
  int* N = new int[n]; // dynamic allocation
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &N[i]);
  }
  
  int left = 0;
  int right = MAX_W;
  
  while (left < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    int checked = check(N, n, k, mid);
    
    if (checked == n) {
      right = mid;
      start = 0; // reset start
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
      start = checked; // update start
    }
  }
  
  cout << right << endl;
  
  delete[] N; // free memory
  return 0;
}
```
