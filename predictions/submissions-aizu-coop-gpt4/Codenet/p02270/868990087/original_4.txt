1. Code Analysis:
    - The code seems to be an implementation of the binary search algorithm to determine the optimal value of 'w' (maximum load) for a set of loads 'N' divided among 'k' trucks. 
    - The 'check' function calculates the maximum number of loads that can be carried by 'k' trucks, each with a maximum capacity of 'w'. If all loads 'N' can be carried, it returns 'n' (the total number of loads); otherwise, it returns the number of loads that can be carried.
    - The binary search is implemented in the 'main' function, where 'w' is gradually adjusted until the optimal value is found.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    A. Data Structures: The code seems to be using appropriate data structures, i.e., arrays. The size of the array is defined at runtime, which is generally not good practice in C++. However, in this case, it does not affect performance significantly.
    B. Redundant Computations: The operation "(left + right) / 2" may potentially lead to integer overflow. A safer alternative would be "left + (right - left) / 2".
    C. Loops and Recursive Calls: The loops seem to be necessary for the problem at hand. However, the 'while' loop in the 'check' function might be optimized.
    D. Compiler Optimizations: For performance-sensitive code, certain compiler flags such as '-O2' or '-O3' for GCC might be beneficial.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    A. Changing the computation of 'mid' to avoid potential integer overflow: This is a common issue when dealing with large numbers. The computation 'left + (right - left) / 2' is safer and avoids potential overflow which might lead to incorrect results.
    B. Optimizing the 'while' loop in the 'check' function: Currently, the loop iterates until the sum 's' plus the next load exceeds 'w'. Instead of checking each load one by one, we can estimate the number of loads using division and update 'i' and 's' accordingly. This reduces the number of iterations, especially when 'N[i]' is much smaller than 'w'.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Optimized check function
int check(int N[], int n, int k, int w) {
  int i = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
    int s = 0;
    // Optimization: Reduce number of iterations by estimating number of loads
    while (i < n && s + (n - i) * N[i] <= w) {
      s += N[i];
      ++i;
    }
    if (i == n)
      return n;
  }
  return i;
}

int main() {
  int MAX_W = 1000000000;
  int n, k;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);
  int N[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &N[i]);
  }
  int left = 0;
  int right = MAX_W;
  while (left < right) {
    // Optimization: Avoid potential integer overflow
    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
    if (check(N, n, k, mid) == n) {
      right = mid;
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  cout << right << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the optimization in the 'check' function assumes the array 'N' is sorted. If not, the original 'while' loop should be used. Also, the compiler flags '-O2' or '-O3' can be used during compilation for better optimization.
