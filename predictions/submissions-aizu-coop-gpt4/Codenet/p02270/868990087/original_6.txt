The provided code is a solution to the binary search problem. The primary performance bottleneck in the code lies in the `check()` function, where it leverages a while loop inside a for loop. This can potentially lead to a high time complexity, especially when both `n` and `k` are large. 

## Optimization Strategy:
1. Use Binary Search: The primary optimization strategy is to adopt a more efficient algorithm or data structure. In this case, Binary Search can be used to find the minimum weight that can be loaded on `k` trucks. Binary Search will significantly reduce the time complexity from O(n*k) to O(n log k).

2. Reduce unnecessary calls to the `check()` function: The `check()` function is called multiple times in the while loop of the `main()` function. By optimizing this function and avoiding unnecessary calls, we can significantly improve the performance of the program.

3. Avoid dynamic arrays: The program currently uses a dynamic array `N[n]` that is allocated on the stack. This can be inefficient and might lead to stack overflow for large inputs. Using `std::vector` would be safer and more efficient.

## Optimized Code Block

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

bool check(const vector<int>& N, int k, int mid) {
    int sum = 0;
    int count = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < N.size(); ++i) {
        if (N[i] > mid) return false;
        sum += N[i];
        if (sum > mid) {
            sum = N[i];
            ++count;
        }
    }
    return count <= k;
}

int main() {
    int MAX_W = 1000000000;
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<int> N(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> N[i];
    }
    int left = *max_element(N.begin(), N.end());
    int right = MAX_W;
    while (left < right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (check(N, k, mid)) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    cout << right << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code is optimized by using a binary search to find the minimum weight that can be loaded on `k` trucks. The `check()` function is also improved by reducing unnecessary computations and calls, and by using `std::vector` instead of dynamic arrays. The optimized code maintains the same functionality as the original program, but with improved performance.
