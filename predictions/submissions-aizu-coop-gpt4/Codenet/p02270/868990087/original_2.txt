The presented C++ program seems to be a solution to a binary search problem. The main goal is to find a minimum value which satisfies a certain condition checked by the `check` function.

Here are some optimization strategies:

1. **Compiler Optimizations:** Use compiler flags for optimizing the code. `-O3` is a commonly used optimization level that can optimize your code for speed. You can compile your code with g++ -O3 for maximum optimizations.

2. **Avoiding Dynamic Array:** In the code, a variable-length array `N[n]` is used. Though this is allowed in C99 and as an extension in some C++ compilers, it's not a standard C++ feature and can lead to inefficient memory usage. Instead, you can use `std::vector` which is a dynamic array provided by C++ standard library.

3. **I/O Optimization:** The `scanf` and `printf` functions are generally faster than cin and cout in C++. So, for the sake of performance, use `scanf` and `printf`.

4. **Avoiding Division:** Division is generally slower than other arithmetic operations. In the `mid` calculation, instead of dividing by 2, you can use bit shifting to speed it up.

The following is the optimized version of the code with the above suggestions:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int check(vector<int>& N, int n, int k, int w) {
  int i = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
    int s = 0;
    while (s + N[i] <= w) {
      s += N[i];
      ++i;
      if (i == n)
        return n;
    }
  }
  return i;
}

int main() {
  int MAX_W = 1000000000;
  int n, k;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);
  
  vector<int> N(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &N[i]);
  }

  int left = 0;
  int right = MAX_W;
  while (left < right) {
    int mid = left + ((right - left) >> 1); //bit shift instead of division
    if (check(N, n, k, mid) == n) {
      right = mid;
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", right);
  return 0;
}
```
This code is more efficient than the original one due to the optimizations listed above. The logic of the code and the outcome of the program remain the same.
