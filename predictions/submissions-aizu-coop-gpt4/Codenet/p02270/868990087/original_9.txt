1. Code Analysis:
The code is using a binary search algorithm to find the minimum total weight that can be carried in 'k' trucks such that all 'n' weights are carried. The weights are read from the standard input.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. The code is well-written and there is not much scope for optimization. However, the function `check()` is called with the same set of weights in every iteration of the binary search, which is unnecessary.
    2. Each time `check()` is called, it performs the same calculations on the weights. Instead, we can store the results of the calculations in a lookup table and refer to it in the binary search, reducing the redundant computations.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Initialize an array `lookup[]` of size 'n' to store the minimum total weight required to carry the first 'i' weights. The elements of `lookup[]` should be initialized to 0.
    2. Fill up `lookup[]` by calling `check()` for each 'i' from 1 to 'n'. The result of `check(N, i, k, w)` will be stored in `lookup[i]`.
    3. In the binary search, instead of calling `check()`, refer to `lookup[]`. If `lookup[mid]` is less than or equal to 'w', then `right = mid`, else `left = mid + 1`.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int check(int N[], int n, int k, int w) {
  int i = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
    int s = 0;
    while (s + N[i] <= w) {
      s += N[i];
      ++i;
      if (i == n)
        return n;
    }
  }
  return i;
}

int main() {
  int MAX_W = 1000000000;
  int n, k;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);
  int N[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &N[i]);
  }
  // Initialize and fill up the lookup table
  int lookup[n+1];
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    lookup[i] = check(N, i, k, MAX_W);
  }
  int left = 0;
  int right = MAX_W;
  while (left < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    // Refer to the lookup table instead of calling check()
    if (lookup[mid] <= MAX_W) {
      right = mid;
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  cout << right << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The complexity of the code still remains O(n log n). The improvement is in the constant factors, not in the Big-O notation. The optimized code makes fewer function calls and performs fewer computations, which can significantly speed up the program for large inputs. However, this optimization increases memory usage by O(n), which is a reasonable trade-off for the improved runtime.
