Code Analysis:
The provided code is a C program that solves a binary search problem related to allocation of packets to tracks. The main performance bottleneck in this program is the canAlloc function, which is called multiple times during the binary search in the main function. The function checks whether it is possible to allocate a given number of packets to different tracks without exceeding a certain capacity. It iterates over all packets every time it is called which results in a complexity of O(n log n).

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structure: The data structure used in the code are arrays which are efficient for this problem, therefore no change is required.
2. Redundant Computation: There is no redundant computation in the code.
3. Optimizing Loops/Recursive Calls: The main optimization would be to reduce the number of times the canAlloc function is called by optimizing the binary search operation.
4. Compiler Optimizations: Using the 'restrict' keyword with pointers can give hints to the compiler for potential optimizations. But since pointers are not used here, this optimization is not applicable.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Binary Search Optimization: In the binary search, the computation of the middle value (long mid = (low + upp) / 2) can sometimes result in overflow errors. This can be avoided by using a different formula for mid: low + ((upp - low) / 2).

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX_PACKET 100000
int num_packet;
int num_track;
int weight[MAX_PACKET];
bool canAlloc(long capacity);
int main(void) {
  int i;
  scanf("%d %d", &num_packet, &num_track);
  int max_weight = 0;
  long sum_weight = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < num_packet; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &weight[i]);
    if (weight[i] > max_weight) {
      max_weight = weight[i];
    }
    sum_weight += weight[i];
  }
  long low = max_weight;
  long upp = sum_weight;
  while (low < upp) {
    long mid = low + ((upp - low) / 2); // Avoid potential overflow
    if (canAlloc(mid)) {
      upp = mid;
    } else {
      low = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%ld\n", low);
  return 0;
}

bool canAlloc(long capacity) {
  long i = 0;
  long alloced_in_one = 0;
  int track_id = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < num_packet; i++) {
    if (alloced_in_one + weight[i] <= capacity) {
      alloced_in_one += weight[i];
    } else {
      alloced_in_one = weight[i]; // Start counting from current weight[i]
      if (++track_id == num_track) {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```

The optimized code changes are minimal but effective in avoiding potential overflow errors during binary search computation. The functionality and output of the original code are preserved.
