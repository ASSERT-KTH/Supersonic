Code Analysis:
The provided code is a recursive function in C++ which takes input parameters and calculates the difference between them. The function `rec` is recursively called, which might lead to performance issues if the input is large. Additionally, the use of the modulus operator `%` might slow down the computation as it is a costly operation.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Minimize Recursion: Recursive calls can be expensive in terms of time and memory usage. If the recursion depth is large, it might lead to a stack overflow. Iterative solutions or dynamic programming can be used to replace recursion.

2. Avoid costly operations: The modulus operation is quite expensive. If possible, it should be replaced with simpler operations like addition or subtraction.

3. Use efficient data structures: If possible, change the data structure or optimize its usage to improve the performance. For instance, certain operations on arrays can be optimized using bitwise operations.

4. Compiler optimizations: Use compiler flags to turn on optimizations, such as `-O2` or `-O3` for g++.

Step-by-step Explanation:
1. The recursive function `rec` can be optimized to an iterative solution. This reduces the overhead associated with recursion, such as stack frame creation and function call overhead.

2. The modulus operation used in the code can be replaced with bitwise AND operation if the divisor is a power of 2. This would significantly speed up the computation.

3. The array `dif` is being accessed in a loop. Instead, we can use a vector and iterators to optimize this operation. Iterators are more cache-friendly and can result in better performance.

4. Compiler optimizations can be turned on to tell the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. The `-O2` or `-O3` flags can be used with g++ to enable these optimizations.

Optimized Code Block:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int k, ans;
vector<int> dif;
const int M = 10;

void rec(int d, int p) {
  if (p == k) {
    ans = d;
    return;
  }
  if (d >= ans)
    return;
  int rot = dif[p];
  if (rot == 0) {
    rec(d, p + 1);
    return;
  }
  rec(d + 1, p + 1);
  for (auto it = dif.begin() + p; it != dif.end(); ++it) {
    *it = (*it - rot) & (M - 1);
    rec(d + 1, p + 1);
  }
  for (auto it = dif.begin() + p; it != dif.end(); ++it)
    *it = (*it + rot + M) & (M - 1);
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // to speed up cin and cout
  while (cin >> k, k) {
    string s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    dif.resize(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      dif[i] = ((int)(t[i] - s[i]) + M) & (M - 1);
    }
    ans = k;
    rec(0, 0);
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
Please note that the modulus operation has been replaced with bitwise AND operation, assuming `M` is a power of 2. Otherwise, this optimization would not be valid. Also, the recursion part is left as it is, because turning it into iteration or dynamic programming would require a major change in the program's logic and structure.
