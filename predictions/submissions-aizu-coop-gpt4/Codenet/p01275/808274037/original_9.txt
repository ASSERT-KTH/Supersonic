1. Code Analysis:
   The code is a C++ program that calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into another, where an operation is defined as incrementing or decrementing a character. The task is done recursively, this may lead to performance issues and unnecessary repeated calculations.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   A. Using dynamic programming or memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
   B. Avoiding unnecessary mod operations in the recursive calls, as they are costly.
   C. Reducing the number of recursive calls by combining the operations.

3. Step-by-step Explanation:
   A. Dynamic Programming: The recursive function is invoked with the same parameters multiple times, which leads to repeated calculations. We can use a technique like dynamic programming or memoization to store the results of the function for a specific set of parameters and reuse them when needed.
   B. Mod Operations: The mod operation is costly. It is used in the recursive function to adjust the value of the array `dif`. Instead, we can adjust the value of `dif` only when it's necessary.
   C. Reducing Recursive Calls: Instead of calling the recursive function in the loop, we can call it once after the loop ends. This will reduce the number of recursive calls.
   
4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
 
int k, ans;
vector<int> dif;
vector<vector<int>> dp;
const int M = 10;

int rec(int d, int p) {
  // Check if we've already calculated this state
  if (dp[d][p] != -1)
    return dp[d][p];
    
  if (p == k) {
    ans = d;
    return dp[d][p] = d;
  }
  
  if (d >= ans)
    return dp[d][p] = ans;
    
  int rot = dif[p];
  
  if (rot == 0)
    return dp[d][p] = rec(d, p + 1);
  
  int res = rec(d + 1, p + 1);
  
  for (int i = p; i < k; i++)
    dif[i] = (dif[i] - rot + M) % M;
    
  res = min(res, rec(d + 1, p + 1));    
  
  for (int i = p; i < k; i++)
    dif[i] = (dif[i] + rot) % M;
    
  return dp[d][p] = res;
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> k, k) {
    string s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    
    dif = vector<int>(k);
    dp = vector<vector<int>>(k+1, vector<int>(k+1, -1));
    
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
      dif[i] = ((int)(t[i] - s[i]) + M) % M;
      
    ans = k;
    rec(0, 0);
    
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

In this optimized version, we introduce a dp matrix to store the results of the states we've already calculated. This helps us to avoid re-calculating the same states again and again, thereby improving the performance. We also reduce the number of recursive calls inside the loop. This also contributes to the performance gain. The downside is the additional space needed for the dp matrix, but given the constraints, this is acceptable.
