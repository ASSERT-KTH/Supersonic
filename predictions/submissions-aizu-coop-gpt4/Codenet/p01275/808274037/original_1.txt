Code Analysis:
This code takes two strings as input and calculates the difference between corresponding characters in the two strings. It then attempts to find the minimum number of operations required to convert the first string into the second, where each operation is a rotation of a subset of characters.

There are several areas in this code where performance can be improved:

1. There's a redundant call to the recursive function `rec()` inside the second for-loop in `rec()`. This is called on every iteration of the loop, when it could be called just once after the loop.

2. The mod operation is generally slow and is performed multiple times in the code. We can try to minimize the usage.

3. The code uses recursion which can be expensive, especially for large inputs. We can attempt to convert the recursion to iteration.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Eliminate redundant function calls: The recursive function `rec()` is called multiple times in the loop when it should be called just once.

2. Minimize usage of expensive operations: The mod operation is slower than basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and it's used quite a bit in the code. We can try to reduce the usage of the mod operation.

3. Convert recursion to iteration: Recursion can be more expensive than iteration in terms of both time and space complexity. We could attempt to convert the recursive calls into an iterative process.

Optimization Steps:

1. Eliminate the redundant call to `rec()` inside the loop. This call should be made only once after the loop since it doesn't depend on the loop variable.

2. Reduce the usage of the mod operation. For the line `dif[i] = (dif[i] - rot) % M;`, we can calculate the mod operation once for `rot` before the for-loop and use it inside the loop.

3. Convert the recursive calls to an iterative process. This step can be a bit complex as it might require a significant change in the logic of the code. It might also increase the code complexity, but it should help in improving the performance.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int k, ans;
int dif[12];
const int M = 10;

void rec(int d, int p) {
  if (p == k) {
    ans = d;
    return;
  }
  
  if (d >= ans)
    return;
  
  int rot = dif[p];
  if (rot == 0) {
    rec(d, p + 1);
    return;
  }
  
  rec(d + 1, p + 1);
  
  rot = rot % M; // Compute mod once before the loop.
  for (int i = p; i < k; i++) {
    dif[i] = (dif[i] - rot);
  }
  
  rec(d + 1, p + 1); // Moved outside the loop.
  
  rot = (rot + M) % M;
  for (int i = p; i < k; i++)
    dif[i] = (dif[i] + rot) % M;
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> k, k) {
    string s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      dif[i] = ((int)(t[i] - s[i]) + M) % M;
    }
    
    ans = k;
    rec(0, 0);
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
Please note that converting the recursion to iteration might significantly increase the complexity of the code. If the input size is not large and performance is not a critical issue, it might be better to keep the recursion for the sake of code readability and simplicity.
