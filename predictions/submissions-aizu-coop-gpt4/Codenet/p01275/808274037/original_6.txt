The above program is a C++ program that uses recursion to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to convert one string to another, where an operation is defined as changing a character to its next character in the sequence 0-9.

1. Code Analysis:

The function `rec` is a recursive function that generates all possible combinations of operations and updates `ans` with the minimum number of operations found. The recursive function `rec` is called multiple times with the same arguments which leads to unnecessary computations.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Memoization: We can use a technique called memoization to store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again.
    2. Avoid unnecessary computations: The current code is recalculating the same `dif` values in each recursive call. We can avoid these unnecessary computations by calculating these values once and reusing them.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Memoization: We can use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` would store the result of the function `rec` when called with arguments `i` and `j`. Before making a recursive call, we check if the result is already stored in `dp`. If yes, we use the stored result. Otherwise, we calculate the result and store it in `dp`. This would reduce the time complexity from exponential to polynomial.
    2. Avoid unnecessary computations: We can calculate the `dif` values once in the main function before calling `rec` and reuse them in each recursive call. This would reduce the number of computations.

Here's the optimized code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int k, ans;
vector<int> dif;
const int M = 10;
vector<vector<int>> dp;

int rec(int d, int p) {
  if (p == k) {
    return d;
  }
  if (d >= ans)
    return ans;
  if (dp[d][p] != -1)
    return dp[d][p];
  int rot = dif[p];
  if (rot == 0) {
    return dp[d][p] = rec(d, p + 1);
  }
  int res = rec(d + 1, p + 1);
  for (int i = p; i < k; i++) {
    dif[i] = (dif[i] - rot + M) % M;
    res = min(res, rec(d + 1, p + 1));
  }
  for (int i = p; i < k; i++)
    dif[i] = (dif[i] + rot + M) % M;
  return dp[d][p] = res;
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> k, k) {
    string s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    dif = vector<int>(k, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      dif[i] = ((int)(t[i] - s[i]) + M) % M;
    }
    ans = k;
    dp = vector<vector<int>>(ans + 1, vector<int>(k, -1));
    ans = rec(0, 0);
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

4. Optimized Code Block: The changes include:
    1. Added a 2D vector `dp` to store the results of the recursive function `rec`.
    2. Changed the return type of `rec` to `int` and updated the function to return the result instead of updating `ans` directly.
    3. Added a condition to check if the result of `rec` is already stored in `dp`.
    4. Updated the main function to initialize `dif` and `dp` before calling `rec`.
