Code Analysis:
The provided C++ code is a simple implementation of Depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The code uses matrices to represent the graph and arrays to keep track of visited nodes.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. The 2D array (matrix) G[101][101] is used to represent the graph. This method of representing a graph has a time complexity of O(n^2), which can be a major bottleneck if the graph is sparse (has fewer edges).
2. The DFS algorithm is recursive in nature and thus, can lead to a stack overflow if the depth of recursion is too high.
3. The color array is initialized in a separate loop before the DFS, which can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use an adjacency list instead of a matrix to represent the graph, which will reduce the time complexity to O(n + m) where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges.
2. Use an iterative version of DFS using a stack to avoid stack overflow due to recursion.
3. Initialize the color array during graph input, reducing the number of iterations.
4. Use fast input/output techniques to speed up the reading and writing process.

Optimization Steps:
1. Replace the 2D array with an adjacency list: The adjacency list is a more efficient way of representing a graph as it takes less space and time if the graph is sparse. We can use a vector of vectors to represent the adjacency list.
2. Replace the recursive DFS with an iterative one: This will prevent stack overflow if the depth of the graph is too high. We can use a stack to implement the iterative DFS.
3. Initialize the color array during graph input: This reduces the number of iterations as we don't need a separate loop to initialize the color array.
4. Use fast I/O techniques: Using cin and cout can be slower when dealing with a large amount of data. We can use faster I/O techniques such as scanf and printf instead.

Trade-offs:
1. Using an adjacency list instead of a matrix may increase the complexity of the code but it offers better performance in terms of time and space complexity.
2. The iterative version of DFS may also increase the complexity of the code but it avoids the stack overflow issue with recursion.
3. Fast I/O techniques may make the code less readable but they significantly increase the speed of input and output operations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

      d[i] = ++t;
      color[i] = GRAY;
      while (!S.empty()) {
        int u = S.top();
        if (!G[u].empty()) {
          int v = G[u].back();
          G[u].pop_back();
          if (color[v] == WHITE) {
            S.push(v);
            d[v] = ++t;
            color[v] = GRAY;
          }
        } else {
          S.pop();
          f[u] = ++t;
          color[u] = BLACK;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cout << i << " " << d[i] << " " << f[i] << endl;
  }

int main() {
  int i, j, k, e;
  cin >> n;
  G.resize(n + 1);
  do {
    cin >> i >> e;
    G[i].resize(e);
    for (j = 0; j < e; j++) {
      cin >> k;
      G[i][j] = k;
