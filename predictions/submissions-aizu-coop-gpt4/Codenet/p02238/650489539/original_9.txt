Code Analysis:

The given C++ program is implementing a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm on a graph. The vertices of the graph are labeled from 1 to n. The adjacency matrix of the graph is stored in the two-dimensional array G[101][101]. The color of each vertex is stored in the array color[101], and the discovery and finishing times are stored in the arrays d[101] and f[101] respectively.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient data structures: The adjacency matrix G, which stores the graph, is a two-dimensional array with a fixed size of 101x101. This is a waste of memory if the number of vertices n is much less than 101. A more efficient alternative is to use a vector of vectors to represent the adjacency matrix, which allows the size to be specified at runtime.

2. Redundant or unnecessary computations: The condition (i == next && G[i][i] > 0) in the search_loop function seems redundant as it would only be true if the graph has self-loops, which is not common. This condition can be removed to simplify the code.

3. Loops or recursive calls: The DFS algorithm is inherently recursive, but there are two loops in the dfs function that iterate over all vertices. These loops can be combined into one to reduce the number of iterations.

4. Compiler optimizations: The compiler can be instructed to optimize the code for speed with the -O2 or -O3 flags. Additionally, the use of 'pragma' directives could be considered to utilize parallel computing if the hardware supports.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the two-dimensional array G with a vector of vectors. This reduces memory usage by allowing the size of the adjacency matrix to be specified at runtime.

2. Remove the condition (i == next && G[i][i] > 0) in the search_loop function. This simplifies the code and may slightly improve performance by eliminating a condition check.

3. Combine the two loops in the dfs function into one. This reduces the number of iterations, which can improve performance if the number of vertices is large.

4. Compile the code with the -O2 or -O3 flag to optimize it for speed. This can result in significant performance improvements, but it may make the code harder to debug.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define WHITE 0
#define GRAY 1
#define BLACK 2

vector<vector<int>> G;
vector<int> color, d, f;
int n, t;

void search_loop(int i) {
  d[i] = ++t;
  color[i] = GRAY;
  for (int next = 1; next <= n; ++next) {
    if (G[i][next] > 0 && color[next] == WHITE) {
      search_loop(next);
    }
  }
  f[i] = ++t;
  color[i] = BLACK;
}

void dfs() {
  t = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    color[i] = WHITE;
    if (color[i] == WHITE) {
      search_loop(i);
    }
    cout << i << " " << d[i] << " " << f[i] << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  int i, j, k, e;
  cin >> n;
  G.resize(n+1, vector<int>(n+1, 0));
  color.resize(n+1, 0);
  d.resize(n+1);
  f.resize(n+1);
  do {
    cin >> i >> e;
    for (j = 1; j <= e; j++) {
      cin >> k;
      G[i][k] = 1;
    }
  } while (i < n);
  dfs();
  cin >> n;
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimized code assumes that the graph does not have self-loops. If self-loops are possible, additional checks are needed.
