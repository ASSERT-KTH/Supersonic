1. Code Analysis:
The given code is a simple implementation of the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm, where it initializes a 2D `G` matrix to represent a graph, a `color` array to store the status of each node, and two arrays `d` and `f` to capture discovery and finishing times of each node, respectively. 

It initializes the graph, reads the edges, and then performs the DFS. Finally, it prints the discovery and finishing times for each node.

Potential performance bottlenecks and areas for improvement:
- The outer loop in `search_loop()` function checks all nodes, regardless of whether they are connected to the current node or not.
- The graph is represented as a 2D array, which is not memory efficient for sparse graphs.
- All nodes are checked for DFS, regardless of whether they are already visited or not.
- The condition `if (i == next && G[i][i] > 0)` seems unnecessary.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Use adjacency list representation of the graph instead of a 2D array.
    2. Remove unnecessary condition in `search_loop()`.
    3. Remove unnecessary loop in `dfs()`.
    4. Use `std::vector` instead of raw arrays for better memory management and safety.
    5. Change loop order in `main()` to avoid unnecessary checking.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Adjacency List: In memory-conscious applications, an adjacency list is more efficient when the graph is sparse (i.e., the number of edges is far less than the number of vertices squared). It also makes the DFS traversal more efficient as we only iterate over the neighbors of a node, not all nodes.
    2. Unnecessary condition: The condition `if (i == next && G[i][i] > 0)` in `search_loop()` is not needed. If a node has an edge to itself, it will be considered in the DFS in the same iteration, there's no need to break the loop.
    3. Unnecessary loop: In `dfs()`, we can merge the two loops into one. Since all nodes are initially white, we can set them gray and perform DFS in the same loop.
    4. Use of `std::vector`: While this won't improve performance, it is a safer alternative to raw arrays and automatically manages memory. It also provides more functionality than raw arrays.
    5. Loop order: In `main()`, we can read the edges directly into the adjacency list. This will make the code cleaner and reduce the need for multiple loops.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define WHITE 0
#define GRAY 1
#define BLACK 2

vector<vector<int>> G;
vector<int> color;
vector<int> d, f;
int t = 0;

void search_loop(int i) {
  d[i] = ++t;
  color[i] = GRAY;
  for (auto next: G[i]) {
    if (color[next] == WHITE) {
      search_loop(next);
    }
  }
  f[i] = ++t;
  color[i] = BLACK;
}

void dfs(int n) {
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (color[i] == WHITE)
      search_loop(i);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << i+1 << " " << d[i] << " " << f[i] << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  int n, e, k;
  cin >> n;

  G.resize(n);
  color.resize(n, WHITE);
  d.resize(n);
  f.resize(n);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> e;
    for (int j = 0; j < e; j++) {
      cin >> k;
      G[i].push_back(k-1);
    }
  }

  dfs(n);
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code follows the same DFS logic as the original code but uses a more efficient graph representation and removes unnecessary conditions and loops. The result is a cleaner, more efficient DFS implementation.
