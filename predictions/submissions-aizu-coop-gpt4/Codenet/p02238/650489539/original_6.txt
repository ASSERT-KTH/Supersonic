Code Analysis:
The given program is a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm implemented for an adjacency matrix representation of a direct graph. It uses a 2D array (G) to represent the graph, an array (color) to keep track of visited nodes, and two arrays (d and f) to keep track of the discovery and finishing time of each node. 

As for the potential performance bottlenecks, inefficient memory usage and sections of code that might benefit from optimization:

1. The 2D array (G) for the graph. It has a fixed size of 101x101, which can lead to wastage of memory space if the graph has far fewer nodes. 
2. The use of global variables that are accessed by multiple functions, which can lead to issues with concurrent access and synchronization in multi-threaded environments and generally considered a bad practice.
3. The 'search_loop' function is recursive and can lead to stack overflow for large graphs.
4. The input reading loop, which reads the graph edges, can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary iterations.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a more efficient data structure for the graph representation. An adjacency list can be used instead of an adjacency matrix, which will save memory if the graph is sparse.
2. Move global variables inside main function and pass them as parameters to functions.
3. Replace the recursion with an explicit stack to avoid stack overflow.
4. Optimize the input reading loop by using a while loop instead of a do-while loop.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the global 2D array (G) with an adjacency list. This will save memory as we only store the nodes that each node is directly connected to. This is beneficial when the graph is sparse (i.e., it has relatively few edges), which is often the case in real-world applications.
2. Move the global variables inside the main function. This prevents potential issues with access and synchronization in multi-threaded environments and is generally better practice. The variables can then be passed as parameters to the functions that need them. 
3. Replace the recursion in the 'search_loop' function with an explicit stack to avoid stack overflow. This is particularly important for large graphs, which may exceed the maximum stack depth.
4. In the input reading loop, replace the do-while loop with a while loop to avoid unnecessary iterations. The do-while loop always executes at least once, but in this case, we can avoid this by checking the condition at the start of each iteration.

Trade-offs:
The major trade-off in this optimization process is increased code complexity. Using an adjacency list instead of an adjacency matrix and replacing recursion with an explicit stack makes the code more complex and potentially harder to understand. However, these changes can significantly improve the performance and memory usage of the program, which is often a worthwhile trade-off in performance-critical applications.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#define WHITE 0
#define GRAY 1
#define BLACK 2

void search_loop(int i, vector<vector<int>>& G, vector<int>& color, vector<int>& d, vector<int>& f, int& t) {
    stack<int> s;
    s.push(i);
    while (!s.empty()) {
        i = s.top();
        if (color[i] == WHITE) {
            d[i] = ++t;
            color[i] = GRAY;
            for (int next : G[i]) {
                if (color[next] == WHITE) {
                    s.push(next);
                }
            }
        } else {
            s.pop();
            if (color[i] != BLACK) {
                f[i] = ++t;
                color[i] = BLACK;
            }
        }
    }
}

void dfs(int n, vector<vector<int>>& G) {
    vector<int> color(n+1, WHITE);
    vector<int> d(n+1), f(n+1);
    int t = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (color[i] == WHITE)
            search_loop(i, G, color, d, f, t);
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cout << i << " " << d[i] << " " << f[i] << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, i, e, k;
    cin >> n;
    vector<vector<int>> G(n+1);
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cin >> i >> e;
        G[i].resize(e);
        for (int j = 0; j < e; j++) {
            cin >> k;
            G[i][j] = k;
        }
    }
    dfs(n, G);
    return 0;
}
```
This optimized code replaces the adjacency matrix with an adjacency list and the recursion with an explicit stack. It also moves the global variables into the main function and passes them as parameters to the other functions. The input reading loop has also been optimized.
