The provided code block is a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for graph traversal implemented in C++. The code conducts the DFS and prints the discovery and finish times for each node.

Here is an analysis of the code:

1. Use of array for Graph representation: Although arrays are simple to use, they may not be efficient for sparsely populated graphs. The code uses an adjacency matrix (2D array) to represent the graph which can lead to wastage of memory if the graph is sparse (has fewer edges).

2. Redundant Initialization: The code initializes the entire graph to 0 which might be unnecessary.

3. Use of #define: The code uses #define for constants which is not recommended in C++. The constexpr keyword could be a better alternative.

4. The DFS algorithm: The DFS is implemented recursively which may lead to a stack overflow for larger graphs.

Here are the proposed optimizations:

1. Use an adjacency list: Instead of using a 2D array (adjacency matrix), we can use an adjacency list to represent the graph. This will save memory as we only store the neighbors for each node.

2. Avoid Redundant Initialization: We do not need to initialize the entire graph to 0. This operation is redundant.

3. Use constexpr: Instead of using #define, use the constexpr keyword to define constants. This is a better practice in modern C++.

4. Iterative DFS: To avoid potential stack overflow, we can implement an iterative version of DFS using a stack data structure.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

constexpr int WHITE = 0;
constexpr int GRAY = 1;
constexpr int BLACK = 2;

std::vector<std::vector<int>> G(101);
std::vector<int> color(101, WHITE);
std::vector<int> d(101), f(101);
int t;

void dfs(int u) {
  std::stack<int> S;
  S.push(u);
  d[u] = ++t;
  color[u] = GRAY;

  while (!S.empty()) {
    int v = S.top();
    S.pop();

    for (auto& next : G[v]) {
      if (color[next] == WHITE) {
        d[next] = ++t;
        color[next] = GRAY;
        S.push(next);
      }
    }

    f[v] = ++t;
    color[v] = BLACK;
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int u, e;
    std::cin >> u >> e;
    while (e--) {
      int v;
      std::cin >> v;
      G[u].push_back(v);
    }
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    if (color[i] == WHITE) {
      dfs(i);
    }
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    std::cout << i << " " << d[i] << " " << f[i] << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```
