**Code Analysis:**

The provided code is an implementation of the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for a graph represented as an adjacency matrix. The performance bottlenecks in this code are the use of array data structures and nested loops which makes the time complexity of the search algorithm O(n^2).

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Data Structures:** The graph is currently represented as an adjacency matrix which is not very efficient for sparse graphs as it uses O(n^2) space. If the graph is sparse, an adjacency list representation would be more efficient.

2. **Redundant Computations:** The initialization of the graph matrix and the color array could be optimized. Currently, these arrays are being initialized in a separate loop which is not necessary.

3. **Loops:** There are nested loops in the `search_loop` and `dfs` functions that iterate over the entire graph. These loops could potentially be optimized.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** Use of inline functions can provide hints to the compiler to inline the function if it deems appropriate.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Data Structures:** Convert the adjacency matrix to an adjacency list. This would reduce the space complexity from O(n^2) to O(n + m), where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges.

2. **Redundant Computations:** Initialize the graph matrix and the color array while reading the input. This would remove the need for separate loops just for initialization.

3. **Loops:** Optimize the loops in the `search_loop` and `dfs` functions to only iterate through the adjacent vertices of a vertex instead of all vertices.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** Mark the `search_loop` function as inline which could potentially increase the execution speed by reducing function call overhead.

**Trade-offs:** These optimization steps would make the code more complex and harder to understand. However, they would also greatly improve the performance and reduce the memory usage of the program.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define WHITE 0
#define GRAY 1
#define BLACK 2

vector<vector<int>> G(101);
int color[101];
int d[101], f[101], t;
int n;

inline void search_loop(int i) {
  d[i] = ++t;
  color[i] = GRAY;
  
  for (auto next : G[i]) {
    if (color[next] == WHITE) {
      search_loop(next);
    }
  }
  
  f[i] = ++t;
  color[i] = BLACK;
}

void dfs() {
  t = 0;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (color[i] == WHITE)
      search_loop(i);
  }
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cout << i << " " << d[i] << " " << f[i] << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  int i, j, k, e;
  
  cin >> n;
  
  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> i >> e;
    color[i] = WHITE;
    
    for (j = 1; j <= e; j++) {
      cin >> k;
      G[i].push_back(k);
    }
  }

  dfs();
  
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version of the code, we've replaced the adjacency matrix with an adjacency list to reduce space complexity, and we've also combined input reading with initialization to eliminate redundant computations. The search_loop function has been marked as inline to potentially speed up execution, and the loops in the search_loop and dfs functions have been optimized to only iterate through adjacent vertices.
