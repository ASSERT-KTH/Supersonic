This is a quite complex code and it includes various tasks such as geometric calculations, graphs, and binary search. It's not easy to identify potential performance issues just by looking at the code. However, following are certain areas which can be reviewed for performance improvement:

1. **Memory Usage**: The code uses several vectors and other STL containers, which are dynamically allocated and can be the source of high memory usage. We need to ensure that these containers are only as large as they need to be. The `reserve` function can be used to allocate memory in advance when the size is known, which can save time in reallocations. 

2. **Repeated Calculations**: There are several mathematical computations and function calls that are repeated in the code. We could store these results to avoid recalculating them. For example, in `geom` namespace, `outp`, `inp` and `norm` functions are being called multiple times with same parameters. Results of such calls can be saved and reused.

3. **Function Inlining**: Many small functions in the code that are called frequently can be inlined to reduce the overhead of function calls.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: The compiler can be given flags to optimize the code. For example, the `-O2` or `-O3` flags in g++ can be used.

5. **Efficient Data Structures**: Performance may be improved by using more efficient data structures. For example, replacing vectors with arrays if the size is fixed and known in advance, or using unordered_map instead of map for constant time lookup.

6. **Parallelism**: Parts of the code can potentially be parallelized to take advantage of multi-core processors.

7. **Avoid using `endl`**: Use "\n" instead of `std::endl` because `std::endl` causes unnecessary flushes which can be costly in terms of performance.

The proposed optimization strategy would be:

1. Identify the parts of the code that are most time-consuming. This can be done using profiling tools such as gprof or Valgrind.

2. Once the potential bottlenecks are identified, focus on those areas. Look for repeated calculations that can be avoided, and inefficient data structures that can be replaced.

3. Consider inlining small, frequently called functions and using compiler optimization flags.

4. Avoid unnecessary memory reallocations by using the `reserve` function on vectors where appropriate.

5. Identify potential areas for parallelism.

6. Replace `endl` with "\n".

7. Finally, after making changes, test the code to ensure the output is correct and that performance has improved.
