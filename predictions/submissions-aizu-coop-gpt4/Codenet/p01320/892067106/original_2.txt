The given code involves complex geometry operations which are used to solve a problem related to polygons. It includes a lot of mathematical computations and vector operations. There are also several loops and recursive calls, which could be a potential performance bottleneck.

Here are some optimization strategies:

1. Avoid Unnecessary Computations: There are computations that are being repeated inside loops. For example, the computation of `s.dir()` in function `check()` is a repeated computation. We could compute it once outside the loop and reuse the result inside the loop.

2. Use Efficient Data Structures: The code is using vectors for storing points and edges. Depending on the operations being performed on these vectors, other data structures like arrays or linked lists might be more efficient. 

3. Loop Unrolling: The code uses several loops which may benefit from loop unrolling. Loop unrolling can improve the performance by reducing the overhead of loop control instructions. However, this technique needs to be used judiciously as it can increase the size of the code and may lead to cache misses.

4. Avoid Function Calls Inside Loops: The code has several function calls inside loops, some of which can be avoided or moved outside the loop to improve performance.

5. Use Compiler Optimizations: Modern compilers offer various optimization flags that can automatically optimize the code for better performance. For example, the `-O2` or `-O3` flags in GCC can apply several optimization techniques to the code.

6. Parallel Processing: The code seems to be performing several independent computations in a loop, such as in the function `check()`. These computations could potentially be parallelized to improve performance, especially on multi-core systems.

7. Use of Constants: The code uses several mathematical constants. Declaring these constants `constexpr` can improve performance by ensuring they are evaluated at compile-time.

8. Tail Recursion: If a function is causing a significant performance hit, it can be optimized using tail recursion, where the recursive call is the last operation in the function. However, this does not seem to be applicable in this code snippet.

9. Inline Small Functions: Small functions like `sig()`, `less()`, etc. could be made inline to avoid overhead of function calls. 

10. Use of `auto`: In modern C++, `auto` can be used to automatically deduce the type of a variable from its initializer. This can make the code more readable and less prone to errors.

Given these strategies, I'll provide an optimized version of the code. Due to the complexity of the code, it's difficult to optimize the entire program in one go. However, the following example illustrates how to apply some of the mentioned strategies:

```cpp
//... (rest of the code)
bool check(const MSQ &temp, R r, const vector<P> &shoolack, int i, int j) {
  MSQ msq;
  L l = temp.segment(j);
  P gp = shoolack[i] - l[0] * r;
  temp.copy(r, gp, msq);
  vector<P> p;
  P b(-INF, -INF), u(+INF, +INF);
  REP(i, n) {
    L l2(shoolack[i], shoolack[i] + l.dir());
    int f = 0;
    P ll(INF, INF), rr(-INF, -INF);
    auto dir = msq.segment(j).dir();   // Calculate once and use it in the loop
    REP(j, m) {
      const S s = msq.segment(j);
      if (intersect(s, l2)) {
        if (sig(outp(dir, l2.dir()))) {   // Use pre-calculated dir
          const P q = crosspoint(s, l2) - l2[0];
          p.push_back(q);
          ll = min(ll, q);
          rr = max(rr, q);
        }
        f = 1;
      }
    }
    u = min(rr, u);
    b = max(ll, b);
    if (!f)
      return false;
  }
  FOR(q, p) {
    if (*q < b || u < *q)
      continue;
    if ([&]() {
          REP(i, n) if (!convex_contains(msq, gp, shoolack[i] + *q)) return 0;
          return 1;
        }())
      return true;
  }
  return false;
}
//... (rest of the code)
```

Here, I pre-calculated `s.dir()` once before the loop and used it inside the loop, which should reduce the number of computations.
