Looking at the code, it's primarily a geometric computation program involving complex numbers and geometric operations such as intersections and projections. The code includes a lot of different operations, which makes it difficult to pinpoint specific bottlenecks without knowing the typical use cases. However, it's possible to highlight a few general performance improvement strategies. 

1. **Code Analysis**

   The code is heavily based on template programming, which can lead to larger binary sizes. However, it's a common practice in C++ to increase code reusability and maintainability.
   
   The code makes use of C++ standard library functions, which are typically optimized. However, there might be some room for improvement in the custom functions and methods.

2. **Optimization Strategy**

    1. **Improve data structures**: The code frequently uses standard C++ container classes like `std::vector` and `std::set`. For some use-cases, a different data structure might be more performant. For instance, if there's a need to frequently check for the existence of an element, `std::unordered_set` (hash set) could be faster than `std::set`.
    
    2. **Avoid unnecessary computations**: For example, in the `convex_contains` function, the same subtraction `msq[a] - p` is computed twice. This can be avoided by storing the result in a variable and reusing it.
    
    3. **Optimize loops and recursion**: This code contains some nested loops which could be a potential performance bottleneck. However, without specific knowledge about the average sizes of the data structures, it's hard to propose specific optimizations.
    
    4. **Compiler optimizations**: Compiler optimizations can have a significant effect on the performance of the program. The `-O2` or `-O3` flags for the GCC compiler can often lead to significant speed-ups.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**

    1. **Data structures**: Evaluate if the use of `std::set` and `std::vector` is the most efficient choice in each case. If a data structure is frequently being searched to find if an element exists, consider using `std::unordered_set` instead.
    
    2. **Unnecessary computations**: Store the result of frequently repeated computations in variables. For example, in the `convex_contains` function, the expression `msq[a] - p` is computed twice. It could be stored in a variable to avoid the second computation.
    
    3. **Loops and recursion**: Without specific knowledge about the average size of the data structures involved, it's hard to propose specific optimizations for the loops.
    
    4. **Compiler optimizations**: Use the `-O2` or `-O3` GCC compiler flags to enable more aggressive optimizations during compilation.

4. **Optimized Code Block**

    Due to the complexity of the code and the need for specific knowledge about the use cases and data sizes, it's not feasible to provide an optimized version of the complete code. However, I can provide a small example modification for the `convex_contains` function, as follows:

```cpp
int convex_contains(const MSQ &msq, const P &g, const P &p) {
  const int n = msq.size();
  int a = 0, b = n;
  const P pg = p - g;
  while (a + 1 < b) {
    int c = (a + b) / 2;
    if (outp(msq[a] - g, pg) > 0 && outp(msq[c] - g, pg) < 0)
      b = c;
    else
      a = c;
  }
  b %= n;
  P diff = msq[a] - p;
  if (outp(diff, msq[b] - p) < -EPS)
    return 0;
  return 1;
}
```
In this function, I've eliminated the second computation of `msq[a] - p` by storing it in a variable `diff`.
