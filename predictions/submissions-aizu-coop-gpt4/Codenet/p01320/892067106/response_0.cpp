The code provided is a complex geometry-based program. It seems to be solving a geometric problem involving polygons, lines, and convex hulls. However, without any context or comments, it's hard to exactly know what the program does.

Here are some optimization strategies that could be applied:

1. **Unnecessary Header Files**: The program includes a large number of header files, many of which are not used at all. Including unnecessary headers can slow down the compilation time, and in some cases, increase the executable size. Remove unused headers to optimize import times.

2. **Redundant Function Calls**: Several function calls are redundant, with the same value being computed multiple times. In many places, the same value is computed in multiple places. The values that are computed multiple times should be stored in a variable and reused.

3. **Optimize Data Structures**: The program uses several data structures, including vectors, pairs, and sets. If these data structures are not the most efficient for the task at hand, performance could be improved by switching to a more appropriate data structure.

4. **Loop Unrolling**: In several places, the code uses for-loops. Some of these could be candidates for loop unrolling, which can increase performance by reducing the control overhead of the loop.

5. **Compiler Optimizations**: Various compiler optimizations could be used to speed up the code. For example, the `-O3` option with g++ performs several optimizations such as inline expansion, delayed branching, and vectorization.
