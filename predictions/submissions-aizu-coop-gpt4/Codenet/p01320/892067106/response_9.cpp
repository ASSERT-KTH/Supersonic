The provided code is a bit complex as it deals with geometric computations and mathematical concepts like complex numbers. It seems to be well-structured with a good use of classes, structures and function templates. However, it is not easy to identify specific bottlenecks without a deeper understanding of what the code is designed to do. Below are some general performance tips for C++ code:

1. **Avoiding Unnecessary Operations**: The code includes a significant number of mathematical operations. Checking whether these computations are necessary is one way to optimize the program. If there's a computation that is being executed many times and its result doesn't change, you could consider computing it once and storing the result.

2. **Minimize use of High-Level I/O Functions**: High-level I/O functions like `printf` and `scanf` can be slower due to the additional processing they do. Using low-level I/O functions can improve speed, but this should be done carefully as it might make the code less portable.

3. **Efficient Use of Data Structures**: The code uses several instances of STL containers (`vector`, `set`). Checking whether these data structures are the best for the task or whether they can be replaced with more efficient alternatives could help improve performance. 

4. **Avoiding Unnecessary Memory Allocation**: Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation operations are costly in terms of time. If possible, it is best to avoid them in critical parts of the code. The use of `push_back` function for vectors in several places in the code leads to dynamic memory allocation. 

5. **Compiler Optimizations**: Using compiler optimization flags can often lead to significant performance improvements. For instance, if using gcc, the `-O2` or `-O3` flags can be used to enable various performance optimization features.

6. **Parallelism**: If the problem is embarrassingly parallel, you could use multi-threading to run computations in parallel and reduce the total execution time. The C++11 standard provides support for multi-threading
