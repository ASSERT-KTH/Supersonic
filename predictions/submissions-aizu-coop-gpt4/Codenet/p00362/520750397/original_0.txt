This code seems to be a solution to some competitive programming problem, and it's written in a way to minimize the number of characters, rather than for readability or performance. As a consequence, it's quite difficult to understand and has several performance bottlenecks. Here are some strategies we can employ to optimize this code:

1. **Avoid `std::map` for adjacency list**: In this code, `std::map` is used to represent an adjacency list. However, `std::map` has a logarithmic time complexity for insertions, deletions and lookups, which makes it less suitable for large data sets. Instead, we can use `std::unordered_map` or `std::vector` of pairs to represent the adjacency list.

2. **Avoid unnecessary computations in recursion**: The functions `M`, `D` and `K` are recursive and perform several unnecessary computations. We can optimize this by minimizing the number of computations performed during recursion.

3. **Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`:** In competitive programming, it's common to use these commands to speed up the input and output operations.

4. **Avoid macros where possible**: The use of macros (`#define`) can make the code harder to read and debug. We should replace them with functions or constants.

5. **Use more meaningful variable and function names**: The single-letter variable and function names make the code hard to understand and debug. Using more meaningful names will make the code more readable and maintainable.

6. **Avoid using global variables**: Global variables can make the code hard to understand and debug, and can lead to unexpected behavior. We should try to minimize the use of global variables.

7. **Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`**: This header file includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which can increase the compilation time. We should only include the libraries that we need.

8. **Avoid using magic numbers**: Magic numbers are numbers that appear directly in the source code without any explanation. We should replace them with named constants to make the code more readable and maintainable.

9. **Use proper indentation and formatting**: Proper indentation and formatting can make the code more readable and easier to understand.

10. **Comment the code**: Comments can help other developers understand what the code is doing.

Please note that it's hard to provide an optimized version of the code without understanding what it's supposed to do. The optimization steps mentioned above are based on general programming best practices and might not be applicable in all situations.
