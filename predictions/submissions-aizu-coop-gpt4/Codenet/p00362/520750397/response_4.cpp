This code is quite complicated and dense, which makes it difficult to understand and therefore optimize. However, I will attempt to provide some suggestions to improve the performance.

First, let's focus on the code readability and structure, which will not only make it easier for us to understand the code and therefore optimize it, but also improve its maintenance in the future:

1. **Avoid using macro definitions and global variables:** The code is using macros and global variables excessively. This can lead to unintended side-effects and makes the code hard to read and maintain. Instead, use local variables where possible and avoid macros for complex expressions.

2. **Use meaningful variable and function names:** The single-letter variable and function names make the code hard to understand. By using more descriptive names, we can improve the readability of the code.

3. **Avoid using non-standard headers:** The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a GCC-specific header file and it includes a large number of standard C++ libraries. This is inefficient and not portable. Instead, you should only include the libraries that you need.

As for performance optimizations:

1. **Use appropriate data structures:** The code uses `std::map` which is a balanced binary search tree where each operation (insertion, deletion, search) takes `O(log n)` time. If the keys are simple integers, and a large number of keys are being used, it would be much faster to use a `std::unordered_map` (or even a simple array, if possible) where each operation takes approximately `O(1)` time.

2. **Avoid redundant computations:** The code computes the same expression `i & -i` multiple times. It would be more efficient to compute it once and store the result in a variable.

3. **Use `const` and `&` for objects passed to functions:** The heavy objects like `map` are being passed to functions without `const` and `&`, which means they are being copied each time. By passing them as references (`&`), we can avoid the copying. If we are not modifying them inside the function, we should also add `const` to ensure the function doesn't change the object.

4. **Use iterative functions instead of recursive where possible:** The function `D` and `K` are recursive and can be converted to iterative to save stack space.

5. **Make use of compiler optimizations:** If you are not already doing so, you can enable compiler optimizations by using the `-O2` or `-O3` flags when compiling the code.

Please note that the above changes could make the code longer and potentially more complex. However, the gain in performance and maintainability could be worth it.
