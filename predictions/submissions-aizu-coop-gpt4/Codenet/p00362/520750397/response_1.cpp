Firstly, this code currently uses a lot of macros and the variable names are not descriptive, which makes it difficult to understand and maintain. Moreover, macros are not type-safe and can lead to hard-to-find errors. 

Secondly, the program extensively uses bitwise operations and ternary operations in a complex way. This contributes to the lack of readability. While bitwise operations can be efficient, the way they're applied here does not seem to be aiming for any particular optimization.

Thirdly, the code uses global variables, which can lead to confusion and can be a source of bugs.

Fourthly, the use of `std::map` can be optimized. If the key-value pairs in the map are not needed to be sorted, an `std::unordered_map` should be used instead, as it offers average constant-time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.

Below are the steps for code optimization:

1. Replace macros with inline functions or just regular functions as needed. This will improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

2. Simplify complex operations and try to break them down into smaller, simpler steps. This may not directly lead to performance improvements, but it will make the code easier to understand and maintain.

3. Replace global variables with local variables where possible, and pass variables as function arguments where needed. This will make the code safer and easier to understand.

4. Replace `std::map` with `std::unordered_map` if the order of elements is not important. This can lead to significant performance improvements in some cases.

5. Replace `std::cin` and `std::cout` with `scanf` and `printf` respectively for faster input and output operations.

6. Make sure to place the most common case first in if-else or switch-case constructs. This is because most processors have branch prediction and will execute faster if the most common case is put first.

Please note that it's hard to optimize the code further without understanding the problem that it is solving. This code appears to be dealing with some kind of graph problem, but without more context, it's hard to suggest more specific optimizations.
