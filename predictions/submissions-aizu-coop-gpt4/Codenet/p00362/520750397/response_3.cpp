Firstly, this code is not very readable due to unconventional naming and use of macros. However, it seems to be highly optimized already, using bitwise operations and other performance techniques. Let's breakdown the code and propose some optimization strategies.

1. Code Analysis: 

The code appears to implement a tree-based data structure with various operations. It uses a map for tree edges and arrays for different attributes of nodes. The primary operations are adding edges, traversing the tree in a specific order, updating certain properties of nodes, and querying for some property along the path between two nodes.

There are several global variables used, which can lead to potential issues with memory management and multi-threading. The code is also quite dense and lacks comments, which makes it hard to understand and maintain.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Data Structures: 

The code uses a map for storing edges. This can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and look-up time. An adjacency list representation of the graph using a vector of lists may be more efficient. However, the map allows for quick checking of whether an edge exists, which might be necessary for this code.

B. Redundant Computations:

The functions M, S, D, and K perform several bitwise operations and computations that might be optimized. For example, the expressions 'i & -i' and 'f ^ f & -f' are used multiple times. Precomputing these values could improve performance.

C. Loops and Recursive Calls:

The recursive calls in functions D and K could potentially be optimized using tail recursion or iterative methods. However, tail recursion might not be applicable due to the presence of multiple recursive calls in the functions.

D. Compiler Optimizations:

The code already uses several bitwise operations and other low-level optimizations. Further compiler optimizations might not provide significant improvements.

3. Step-by-step Explanation:

Given the complexity of the code, it's challenging to provide a step-by-step explanation for potential optimizations without a clear understanding of the code's purpose. However, here are some general principles:

- Replace map with an adjacency list if possible. This reduces memory usage and potentially improves performance. However, this might require significant changes to the code and might not be applicable if the quick edge existence check provided by the map is necessary.

- Precompute values used multiple times, such as 'i & -i' and 'f ^ f & -f'. This can be done by adding extra variables and updating them whenever i or f changes.

- Convert recursive functions to iterative ones, if possible. This reduces the function call overhead and avoids potential stack overflow issues. However, this might not be applicable due to the presence of multiple recursive calls in the functions.

- Use local variables instead of global ones if possible. This improves readability and maintainability and avoids potential issues with multi-threading. However, this might require significant changes to the code.

Please note that without a clear understanding of the code's purpose, it's challenging to propose specific optimization steps. The existing code already uses several low-level optimizations and unconventional techniques to improve performance. These might make the code hard to understand and maintain, but they also make it highly efficient. The potential optimizations proposed here might not provide significant improvements in performance.
