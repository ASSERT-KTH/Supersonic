This code is quite complex, using a number of macros, bitwise operations, and ternary operators. Let's break it down and propose some optimizations.

1. **Code Analysis**

    - Macros `U`, `G`, `M` are used to reduce the code size, but they make the code more difficult to read and maintain. 
    - The code uses a map for `T[f]`, which is not the most efficient data structure for this task due to its O(log N) complexity for access.
    - The function `M(f)` is used recursively, which can lead to a high number of recursive calls in worst case scenarios.
    - The function `K(f)` is also used recursively and includes a ternary operator which makes the code harder to read.
    - The code doesn't use meaningful variable names, which makes it hard to understand what the code is trying to do.

2. **Optimization Strategy**

    1. Replace macros with properly named functions.
    2. Use an unordered_map instead of a map for `T[f]` to improve access time to O(1) average case.
    3. Replace recursion in `M(f)` and `K(f)` with iteration.
    4. Use more meaningful variable names to make the code easier to understand.
    5. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` to improve the performance of I/O operations.
    6. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output buffer.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**

   Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the code and the lack of context (i.e., what the code is intended to solve), it's difficult to provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the optimizations. However, here's a general idea:

    1. Replace Macros: For instance, the `U` macro can be replaced with a function that initializes an array of size `7 << 15` to 0. The `G` macro can be replaced with a function that calculates a certain value based on the input parameters. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.
    2. Replace Map: The STL map `T[f]` can be replaced with an unordered_map, which has an average complexity of O(1) for access and insertion operations, compared to O(log N) for map.
    3. Replace Recursion: The recursive function `M(f)` can be replaced with a loop. This can be done by keeping a stack of the elements to be processed and iteratively processing them until the stack is empty.
    4. Use Meaningful Variable Names: The variable names in the code are single letters, which makes it hard to understand what they represent. By renaming them to more meaningful names, the code will become easier to understand.
    5. Improve I/O Operations: By using `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`, we can speed up the I/O operations. This is because `cin` and `cout` are synchronized with `scanf` and `printf` by default, which we don't need in this case.
    6. Use '\n' instead of endl: `endl` not only adds a newline, but it also flushes the output buffer, which can slow down the program. Therefore, we can replace `endl` with '\n'.
