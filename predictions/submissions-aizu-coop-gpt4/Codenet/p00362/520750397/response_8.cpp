Based on the provided code, we can identify the following areas for optimization:

1. **Data Structures**: The map data structure used for `T` could be replaced with a more efficient one. Maps in C++ are implemented as Red-Black Trees, which have a time complexity of O(log n) for search, insert, and delete operations. On the other hand, unordered maps use hashing and have an average time complexity of O(1) for these operations. However, this is a trade-off, as unordered maps use more memory than maps.

2. **Loops and Recursion**: The recursive function `D` can be transformed into an iterative function using a stack. This will eliminate the overhead of recursive function calls and make the code more efficient. The function `K` can also be optimized by converting the recursive calls into iterative ones.

3. **Input/Output Operations**: The cin and cout operations are slow. We can speed up these operations by using scanf and printf instead, and by using '\n' instead of endl for line breaks.

4. **Memory Usage**: The use of the macro `U [7 << 15] = {}` and large arrays `P`, `E`, `Z`, `H`, `C`, `A`, `O`, `X`, and `B` can lead to high memory usage. If possible, these should be replaced with dynamic memory allocation or more efficient data structures. However, this requires a deeper understanding of the problem the code is solving, and might not be feasible without significantly rewriting the code.

5. **Compiler Optimizations**: Compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` can be used to automatically optimize the code. However, these optimizations are not always safe, and can sometimes lead to incorrect results.
