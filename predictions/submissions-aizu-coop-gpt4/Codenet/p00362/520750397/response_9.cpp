This code is an example of an extremely optimized code snippet, which aims for the fastest execution and the least memory usage, at the expense of readability and maintainability. Understanding and optimizing this code requires a deep understanding of computer architecture, data structures, and algorithms.

Here are some points to consider:

1. Code Analysis:
   The program uses bitwise operations and ternary operators extensively, which makes it hard to understand. The code uses a lot of global variables and macros, which is generally not recommended. It also uses a map of arrays, `T`, which could potentially be a performance bottleneck. 

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. Use arrays instead of maps where possible. Maps in C++ are slower compared to arrays because they are implemented as red-black trees. In this case, if the keys are largely contiguous, we could use an array instead of a map. 
   2. Simplify complex expressions. The code uses a lot of complex expressions and ternary operators, which make the code hard to understand and maintain.
   3. Use meaningful variable names. The single-letter variable names make it hard to understand what each variable is used for.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Analyze the `T` map to see if it can be replaced with an array. If the keys are largely contiguous, replacing the map with an array could improve performance.
   2. Break down complex expressions into simpler ones. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain, which in turn makes it easier to spot potential bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
   3. Replace single-letter variable names with more descriptive ones. This makes it easier to understand what each variable is used for, which can help in identifying potential optimization opportunities.

4. Optimized Code Block:
   Due to the complexity of this code and the lack of context, it's hard to provide an optimized version of it. However, here are some general guidelines:

   - Replace the `T` map with an array if possible.
   - Break down complex expressions into simpler ones.
   - Replace single-letter variable names with more descriptive ones.
