This code is quite complex and obfuscated. It's hard to understand what it does without any comments. However, we can still provide some general tips for optimization. 

1. Code Analysis:
    - The `#define` macros `U`, `G` are not clear and are used in an obfuscated way.
    - The usage of the global variables `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, etc. is not clear, and they could possibly be replaced by more localized variables.
    - The `map` data structure `T` is used for storing pairs of `long long` integers, which can be slow for large numbers of elements. An unordered map might be faster if the order is not important.
    - The recursive function `D` and `K` might cause stack overflow for large inputs.
    - The `for` loop inside `main()` function is complex and hard to understand. It might contain unnecessary computations.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - Replace `#define` macros with inline functions or constexpr for better readability and type safety.
    - Replace global variables with local variables if possible to reduce the risk of side effects.
    - Use `unordered_map` instead of `map` if the order is not important. An unordered map typically has constant-time complexity for insertions, deletions, and searches.
    - Convert recursive functions `D` and `K` to iterative versions to avoid stack overflow and reduce function call overhead.
    - Simplify the `for` loop inside `main()` function, and eliminate unnecessary computations if any.
