The given code is quite complex and lacks proper comments to understand the business logic. The code seems to be written in a way to save memory and time, but it is sacrificing readability and maintainability. 

The main potential performance bottlenecks identified:

1. Use of Recursive Function Calls: Recursive function calls can be heavy on the stack and can be expensive in terms of time complexity if the recursion depth is large. They also risk causing a stack overflow.

2. Use of map for storing data: Map in C++ is implemented using self-balancing binary search trees, which are generally slower than hash tables. It is slower in terms of access time compared to arrays, vectors, etc. 

3. The use of bitwise operators for mathematical operations can be inefficient in some cases and also reduces the readability of the code.

4. Use of macros: Macros are processed by preprocessor which makes debugging difficult. It also makes the code harder to read and understand.

With these points in mind, here are some potential optimization strategies:

1. Replace Recursive Calls with Iterative ones: Recursion might add additional overhead due to function calls and can lead to a stack overflow. Iterative approaches can be more efficient.

2. Use unordered_map instead of map: Unordered_map is implemented using hash table where keys are hashed into indices of a hash table so it provides constant time complexity O(1) on average for search, insert and delete operations.

3. Avoid using bitwise operators for mathematical operations: While bitwise operators might save a few cycles, they reduce the readability of the code and can potentially introduce bugs. 

4. Avoid using macros: Instead of macros, use const or inline functions. It's safer, easier to debug, and it respects the scope rules.

5. Use vector instead of array: Vectors are more dynamic and provide many built-in functions to handle different situations easily.
