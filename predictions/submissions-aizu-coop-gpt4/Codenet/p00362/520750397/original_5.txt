This code is quite complex and obfuscated. It's hard to understand what it does without any comments. However, we can still provide some general tips for optimization. 

1. Code Analysis:
    - The `#define` macros `U`, `G` are not clear and are used in an obfuscated way.
    - The usage of the global variables `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, etc. is not clear, and they could possibly be replaced by more localized variables.
    - The `map` data structure `T` is used for storing pairs of `long long` integers, which can be slow for large numbers of elements. An unordered map might be faster if the order is not important.
    - The recursive function `D` and `K` might cause stack overflow for large inputs.
    - The `for` loop inside `main()` function is complex and hard to understand. It might contain unnecessary computations.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - Replace `#define` macros with inline functions or constexpr for better readability and type safety.
    - Replace global variables with local variables if possible to reduce the risk of side effects.
    - Use `unordered_map` instead of `map` if the order is not important. An unordered map typically has constant-time complexity for insertions, deletions, and searches.
    - Convert recursive functions `D` and `K` to iterative versions to avoid stack overflow and reduce function call overhead.
    - Simplify the `for` loop inside `main()` function, and eliminate unnecessary computations if any.

Please provide the intended functionality and expected output of the code. This will help me to give more accurate suggestions. Also, the current code seems to be very complex and hard to read due to the lack of comments and obscure variable names. It'd be helpful if you can provide a cleaner version of the code or explanations for what each part of the code does.
