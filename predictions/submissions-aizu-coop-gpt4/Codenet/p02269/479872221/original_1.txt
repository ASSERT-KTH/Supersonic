The given C++ code seems to implement a hash table where the keys are DNA sequences represented as strings. The code defines the hash table `H` with `M=1020001` rows and `L=14` columns. The functions `getnum`, `getkey`, `h1`, `h2`, `insert`, and `find` are used to handle and manage the hash table. The main function reads commands from the input, and depending on the command, it either inserts a DNA sequence into the hash table or checks if a sequence is already present in the table. 

Although the code is functional, there are several areas that could be improved for better performance:

1. The `getnum` function can be optimized to avoid multiple if-else statements.
2. The `strcpy` and `strcmp` functions in `insert` and `find` can be replaced with more efficient alternatives.
3. The hash table `H` is a 2D array of characters. This might be inefficient memory-wise and cause cache misses due to non-locality. It could be replaced with a more efficient data structure.
4. The main function initializes the hash table in a separate loop. This could be done in the `insert` function itself, saving some time.
5. The insert and find functions calculate the same hash multiple times which is redundant and can be avoided.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace `getnum` function with a switch-case statement or a lookup table for better performance.
2. Replace `strcpy` and `strcmp` with C++ string functions which are typically more efficient.
3. Replace the 2D array `H` with a hash map with string keys and boolean values. This will reduce memory usage and potentially speed up the insert and find operations.
4. Initialize the hash map when inserting a new sequence.
5. Avoid recalculating hashes in insert and find functions by storing them.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

#define M 1020001
#define L 14

unordered_map<string, bool> H;

int getnum(char ch) {
  switch(ch){
    case 'A': return 1;
    case 'C': return 2;
    case 'G': return 3;
    case 'T': return 4;
    default: return 0;
  }
}

long long getkey(string word) {
  int sum = 0, p = 1;
  for (char ch: word) {
    sum += p * getnum(ch);
    p *= 5;
  }
  return sum;
}

bool insert(string str) {
  int key = getkey(str);
  if(H.find(str) != H.end()){
      return false;
  }else{
      H[str] = true;
      return true;
  }
}

bool find(string str) {
  if(H.find(str) != H.end()){
      return true;
  }else{
      return false;
  }
}

int main() {
  string com, word;
  int NumOfCom;
  cin >> NumOfCom;
  while (NumOfCom--) {
    cin >> com >> word;
    if (com[0] == 'i') {
      insert(word);
    } else {
      if (find(word)) {
        cout << "yes" << endl;
      } else {
        cout << "no" << endl;
      }
    }
  };
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should have significantly better performance than the original version. The memory usage is reduced by replacing the 2D array with an unordered_map, and the insert and find operations should be faster due to the efficient hash table operations provided by the STL. The code complexity is also slightly reduced. The trade-off is that the code now uses STL, which some might argue makes it less "pure" C++ and might have its own overheads, but generally, STL is well-optimized and is a standard part of C++, so it's typically recommended to use it when it provides an advantage.
