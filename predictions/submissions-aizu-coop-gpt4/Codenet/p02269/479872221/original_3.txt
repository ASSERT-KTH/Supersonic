1. Code Analysis:
The provided code seems to be implementing a hash table with open addressing (collision resolution by probing). The functions `insert` and `find` are using double hashing with `h1` and `h2` as hash functions. Due to the open addressing strategy, the code could experience performance degradation if the hash table becomes too full or if many collisions occur.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Use a standard library data structure: The code implements a custom hash table. However, C++ provides the `unordered_map` data structure that is essentially an optimized hash table. This could potentially improve both the readability and the performance of the code.
    2. Minimize redundant computations: The `getkey` function is being called twice for the same string in both the `insert` and `find` functions. This is unnecessary and can be optimized.
    3. Avoid multiple string comparisons and copies: The code is performing multiple `strcmp` and `strlen` operations. These can be costly and can be avoided by using C++ standard library string and container classes.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Use `unordered_map`: The C++ `unordered_map` is a built-in data structure that provides average constant-time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations. It uses a hash table internally and automatically handles collisions. This change will simplify the code and potentially improve performance.
    2. Minimize redundant computations: Call the `getkey` function once per string and store the result instead of calling it twice in the `insert` and `find` functions.
    3. Use C++ `std::string` and `std::pair`: The `std::string` class is more efficient and safer than C-style strings. The `std::pair` class can be used to store the string and its corresponding key, reducing the need for multiple string comparisons.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int getnum(char ch) {
  if (ch == 'A') return 1;
  else if (ch == 'C') return 2;
  else if (ch == 'G') return 3;
  else return 4;
}

long long getkey(const string& word) {
  int sum = 0, p = 1;
  for (char c : word) {
    sum += p * getnum(c);
    p *= 5;
  }
  return sum;
}

unordered_map<long long, string> hashTable;

void insert(const string& str) {
  long long key = getkey(str);
  hashTable[key] = str;
}

bool find(const string& str) {
  long long key = getkey(str);
  return hashTable.find(key) != hashTable.end();
}

int main() {
  int NumOfCom;
  cin >> NumOfCom;
  
  while (NumOfCom--) {
    string com, word;
    cin >> com >> word;
    
    if (com[0] == 'i') insert(word);
    else if (com[0] == 'f') {
      if (find(word)) cout << "yes" << endl;
      else cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  };
  
  return 0;
}
```

Note: Please be aware that changing the hash table implementation to `unordered_map` may have a trade-off in terms of memory usage, as `unordered_map` may use more memory than a simple array-based hash table. However, the potential performance improvements and increased code readability often make this a worthwhile trade-off.
