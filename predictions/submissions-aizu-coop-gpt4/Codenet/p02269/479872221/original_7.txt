Code Analysis:
This code seems to be implementing a Hash Map with separate chaining to resolve collision. The provided code includes a number of functions where the main potential performance bottlenecks could be:

1. The function getNum is called within getkey. It uses multiple conditional statements which can be optimized.

2. In both the insert and find functions, the same calculation (h1(key) + i * h2(key)) % M) is being performed in each iteration of the infinite loop. This redundant computation could be optimized.

3. The use of strcmp and strlen functions in conditional statements could potentially slow things down, as they require iterating over the strings.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The getnum function can be replaced with an array or a switch case to reduce the number of condition checks.
2. Redundant calculations can be moved out from loops or reduced.
3. The use of strcmp and strlen can be minimized or replaced with more efficient operations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace getnum function with an array for faster lookup.
    - Rationale: Looking up an array using an index is generally faster than a series of if-else checks.
    - Trade-offs: Slightly increased memory usage for the lookup array.

2. Move the calculation (h1(key) + i * h2(key)) % M out of the loop in both insert and find functions.
    - Rationale: Reducing redundant computation within loops improves performance.
    - Trade-offs: None.

3. Replace calls to strlen and strcmp with direct character comparison where possible.
    - Rationale: Direct character comparison is faster than calling a string function.
    - Trade-offs: This may make the code slightly less readable.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#define M 1020001
#define L 14
using namespace std;

char H[M][L];
int char_to_num[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}; // A=1, C=2, G=3, T=4

long long getkey(char word[]) {
  int sum = 0, p = 1, i;
  for (i = 0; word[i]; i++) {
    sum += p * char_to_num[word[i]-'A'];
    p *= 5;
  }
  return sum;
}
int h1(int k) { return k % M; }
int h2(int k) { return 1 + (k % (M - 1)); }

int insert(char str[]) {
  int key = getkey(str);
  for (int i = 0;; i++) {
    int h = (h1(key) + i * h2(key)) % M;
    if (H[h][0] == '\0') { // replace strlen with direct character check
        strcpy(H[h], str);
        return 1;
    }
    if (strcmp(H[h], str) == 0) { // 0 means the strings are equal
      return 0;
    }
  }
}

int find(char str[]) {
  int key = getkey(str);
  for (int i = 0;; i++) {
    int h = (h1(key) + i * h2(key)) % M;
    if (H[h][0] == '\0') { // replace strlen with direct character check
        return 0;
    }
    if (strcmp(H[h], str) == 0) { // 0 means the strings are equal
      return 1;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  char com[9], word[14];
  int NumOfCom;
  cin >> NumOfCom;
  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++)
    H[i][L] = '\0';
  while (NumOfCom--) {
    cin >> com >> word;
    if (com[0] == 'i') {
      insert(word);
    } else {
      cout << (find(word) ? "yes" : "no") << endl;
    }
  };
  return 0;
}
```
