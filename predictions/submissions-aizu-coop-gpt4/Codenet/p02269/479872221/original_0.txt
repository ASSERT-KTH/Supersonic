**Code Analysis**

The provided program seems to implement a simple string hash table with open addressing and double hashing for collision resolution. The hash table, `H`, is a 2D array of characters, where each row represents a slot in the hash table and each cell in the row stores a character of the string inserted into that slot. The program provides functions to insert a string into the hash table (`insert()`) and to check whether a string exists in the hash table (`find()`).

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:

1. The `getnum()` function uses a series of if-else statements to map characters to numbers. This can be inefficient, especially if the function is called repeatedly.

2. The `insert()` and `find()` functions perform a linear search through the hash table in case of collisions. This can be slow if the hash table is large and densely populated.

3. The use of `strcmp()` and `strlen()` functions inside the loops can be costly as they have to iterate over the whole string.

**Optimization Strategy**

1. Replace the if-else statements in `getnum()` with a more efficient mapping, such as a switch statement or a lookup table.

2. Use a more efficient data structure for the hash table. Instead of a 2D array of characters, we could use a 1D array of strings (`std::string`), which would simplify the `insert()` and `find()` functions and eliminate the need for string comparisons and copying.

3. Avoid repeatedly calculating the same values inside the loops. For example, the values of `h1(key)` and `h2(key)` do not change in each iteration, so they can be calculated once and stored in variables outside the loop.

4. Optimize string comparison by comparing string lengths before comparing the contents.

5. Make use of compiler optimizations. For instance, use the `-O2` or `-O3` flag when compiling the program to enable various performance optimizations.

**Step-by-step Explanation**

1. Replace the series of if-else statements in `getnum()` with a switch statement. This is more efficient because a switch statement can directly jump to the appropriate case, while if-else statements require checking each condition in sequence.

2. Replace the 2D array of characters with a 1D array of strings. This simplifies the `insert()` and `find()` functions and eliminates the need for string comparisons and copying. It also allows us to use the built-in functions of the `std::string` class, which are typically more optimized than their C counterparts.

3. Calculate the values of `h1(key)` and `h2(key)` once and store them in variables outside the loop. This avoids unnecessary recalculations in each iteration of the loop.

4. Before comparing two strings, check if their lengths are equal. If they are not, we can immediately conclude that the strings are different, avoiding the need to compare their contents.

5. Use the `-O2` or `-O3` flag when compiling the program. These flags enable various compiler optimizations, including function inlining, loop unrolling, and advanced optimizations like vectorization and inter-procedural optimizations.

**Optimized Code Block**

Here's the optimized version of the provided code. I've incorporated all the optimizations discussed above.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
#define M 1020001
vector<string> H(M, "");

int getnum(char ch) {
  switch (ch) {
    case 'A':
      return 1;
    case 'C':
      return 2;
    case 'G':
      return 3;
    default:
      return 4;
  }
}

long long getkey(const string& word) {
  int sum = 0, p = 1;
  for (char ch : word) {
    sum += p * getnum(ch);
    p *= 5;
  }
  return sum;
}

int h1(int k) { return k % M; }
int h2(int k) { return 1 + (k % (M - 1)); }

bool insert(const string& str) {
  int key = getkey(str);
  int h1_val = h1(key);
  int h2_val = h2(key);
  for (int i = 0;; i++) {
    int h = (h1_val + i * h2_val) % M;
    if (H[h] != str) {
      if (H[h].empty()) {
        H[h] = str;
        return true;
      }
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }
}

bool find(const string& str) {
  int key = getkey(str);
  int h1_val = h1(key);
  int h2_val = h2(key);
  for (int i = 0;; i++) {
    int h = (h1_val + i * h2_val) % M;
    if (H[h] != str) {
      if (H[h].empty()) {
        return false;
      }
    } else {
      return true;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  string com, word;
  int NumOfCom;
  cin >> NumOfCom;
  while (NumOfCom--) {
    cin >> com >> word;
    if (com[0] == 'i') {
      insert(word);
    } else {
      cout << (find(word) ? "yes" : "no") << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that in the optimized code, I replaced the C-style strings with C++ strings (std::string) and the 2D array with a vector of strings. Also, I've removed the redundant return statements and updated the function return types to match their actual return values. Always remember to compile with optimization flags for maximum performance.
