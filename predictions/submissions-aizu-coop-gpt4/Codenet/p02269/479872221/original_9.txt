Let's break down the optimization process into steps:

**Code Analysis**

The code implements a custom hash table, which maps string sequences of characters (representing DNA sequences) to numeric keys, and provides functions to insert elements and check their existence in the table.

Potential areas for optimization include:
1. The `getnum` function uses multiple if-else statements and can be optimized.
2. The `getkey` function has a for loop with constant re-calculation of `p` at each iteration.
3. Redundant memory usage in `H[M][L]`.
4. Multiple calls to `strcmp` and `strlen` in `insert` and `find` functions.
5. Inefficient handling of commands in the `main` function.

**Optimization Strategy**

1. Refactor `getnum` to use a switch statement or map for faster lookups.
2. Pre-compute the power of 5 values in `getkey`.
3. Use `std::unordered_map` in C++ STL instead of custom hash table to reduce memory usage and improve performance.
4. Reduce calls to `strcmp` and `strlen` by storing the result and reusing it.
5. Use if-else or switch statement for handling commands in `main`.

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Optimized Code Block**

1. The `getnum` function can be optimized by using a switch statement instead of multiple if-else statements. The switch statement has better performance as it uses a jump table internally.

    ```cpp
    int getnum(char ch) {
        switch (ch) {
            case 'A': return 1;
            case 'C': return 2;
            case 'G': return 3;
            case 'T': return 4;
            default: return 0;
        }
    }
    ```
   
2. The `getkey` function is calculating powers of 5 in each iteration, which is not efficient. We can pre-calculate these values using a lookup table.

    ```cpp
    int pow5[L] = {1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, 15625, 78125, 390625, 1953125, 9765625, 48828125, 244140625, 1220703125};
    long long getkey(char word[]) {
        int sum = 0, i;
        for (i = 0; word[i]; i++) {
            sum += pow5[i] * getnum(word[i]);
        }
        return sum;
    }
    ```
   
3. Instead of using a custom hash table, we can use `std::unordered_map` which is a built-in hash table available in C++ STL. It provides constant time insert and find operations on average.

    ```cpp
    unordered_map<string, bool> H;
    ```
   
4. We can reduce calls to `strcmp` and `strlen` by storing the result and reusing it.

    ```cpp
    int insert(char str[]) {
        if (H[str]) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            H[str] = true;
            return 1;
        }
    }
    int find(char str[]) {
        return H[str];
    }
    ```
   
5. We can use an if-else statement to handle commands in `main` function.

    ```cpp
    if (com[0] == 'i') {
        insert(word);
    } else if (com[0] == 'f') {
        cout << (find(word) ? "yes" : "no") << endl;
    }
    ```

The updated code is more efficient, uses less memory, and is easier to read and maintain. 

Please note: These optimizations are based on the assumption that we have sufficient memory to fit the hashtable in memory and the number of insert operations is not too high to cause a lot of collisions and rehashing in the `unordered_map`.
