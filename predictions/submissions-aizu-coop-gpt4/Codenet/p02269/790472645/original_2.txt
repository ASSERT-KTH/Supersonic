## Code Analysis

The provided code is a simple implementation of a DNA sequence dictionary. It reads sequences of base pairs (A, C, G, T) and assigns a unique number to each sequence using a hashing function. It then stores the hashed value in a dictionary. The user can insert a new sequence into the dictionary or find whether a sequence is in the dictionary.

1. The function `pow` calculates the power of a number, but it is not used anywhere in the code.
2. The function `dic_op` calculates the hashed value of a sequence.
3. The dictionary `dic` is a static array of size 90 million. This is a large amount of memory that may not be fully utilized, depending on the number of unique DNA sequences.
4. The `main` function reads the number of operations from the standard input. Then, for each operation, it reads the operation type and the DNA sequence, performs the operation and (in case of search) outputs the result.

## Optimization Strategy

1. Remove unused functions and variables to tidy up the code and reduce its size.
2. Use a dynamic data structure, like unordered_map, instead of a static array for the dictionary to manage memory more efficiently.
3. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf` and `puts` for better type safety and consistency.
4. Use `std::string` instead of `char` array for better safety and ease of use.
5. Use `switch` statement instead of multiple `if` statements to make the code more readable and possibly faster.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Remove the unused function `pow` and unused variable `j` in the `main` function. This reduces the size of the code and makes it easier to read and understand.

2. Replace the static array `dic` with an `unordered_map`. This dynamic data structure automatically manages memory, allocating and deallocating it as needed. It can potentially use much less memory than the static array, especially if the number of unique DNA sequences is significantly less than 90 million.

3. Replace `scanf` and `puts` with `std::cin` and `std::cout`. The former are C-style functions that do not have type checking, which can lead to bugs and vulnerabilities. The latter are C++ style functions that do have type checking, making them safer to use.

4. Replace `char` arrays with `std::string`. `std::string` is easier and safer to use than `char` arrays. It automatically manages memory and provides useful functions, like `std::string::substr`.

5. Replace multiple `if` statements with a `switch` statement. This makes the code more readable and possibly faster, as a `switch` statement can be optimized to a jump table by the compiler.

## Optimized Code Block

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

ll dic_op(const string& str) {
  ll f = 1;
  ll g = 0;
  for (char c : str) {
    switch (c) {
      case 'A': g += f; break;
      case 'C': g += f * 2; break;
      case 'G': g += f * 3; break;
      case 'T': g += f * 4; break;
    }
    f *= 5;
  }
  return g;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  unordered_map<ll, bool> dic;
  string opstr, str;
  
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> opstr >> str;
    switch (opstr[0]) {
      case 'i': dic[dic_op(str)] = true; break;
      case 'f': cout << (dic[dic_op(str)] ? "yes" : "no") << endl; break;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code is simpler, safer, and more efficient than the original code. It should use less memory, run faster, and be less prone to bugs and vulnerabilities.
