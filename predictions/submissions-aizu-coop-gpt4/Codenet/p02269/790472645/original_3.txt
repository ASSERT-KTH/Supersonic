## Step 1: Code Analysis

The given code appears to be a simple dictionary implementation. It reads a number of commands from the user and either inserts a string into the dictionary or checks if a string is already in the dictionary. 

The strings are converted into unique numerical identifiers using a function dic_op, which assigns a numerical value to each character in the string and then sums these values up. 

The dictionary is implemented as a very large static array of chars. The numerical identifier is used as an index into this array. If the value at the index is 1, the string is in the dictionary. If it is anything else, the string is not in the dictionary. 

## Step 2: Optimization Strategy

1. Unnecessary large static array: The dictionary is implemented as a very large static array which leads to inefficient memory usage. 

2. Redundant Loop: The loop in the function dic_op runs until it encounters a character that is not 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'. However, this is redundant because the length of the string is known in advance.

3. I/O operations: The use of scanf and puts functions for input/output operations can be optimized by using cin and cout with ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) to speed up the I/O operations. 

## Step 3: Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Replace the static array with an unordered_map: The static array uses a lot of memory, and most of it is likely wasted because not all possible indices will be used. An unordered_map will use memory much more efficiently because it only stores the elements that have been inserted. 

2. Limit the loop in the dic_op function: The function dic_op can be optimized by terminating the loop when it has processed all characters in the string.

3. Speed up I/O operations: I/O operations can be a bottleneck in C++. We can speed up I/O operations using cin and cout by adding the line ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) at the beginning of main().

## Step 4: Optimized Code Block

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

ll dic_op(char str[]) {
  ll j;
  ll f = 1;
  ll g = 0;
  for (j = 0; str[j] != '\0'; j++) {
    if (str[j] == 'A')
      g += f * 1;
    else if (str[j] == 'C')
      g += f * 2;
    else if (str[j] == 'G')
      g += f * 3;
    else if (str[j] == 'T')
      g += f * 4;
    f *= 5;
  }
  return g;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  unordered_map<ll, bool> dic;
  char opstr[7];
  char str[13];
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> opstr >> str;
    if (opstr[0] == 'i') {
      dic[dic_op(str)] = true;
    } else if (opstr[0] == 'f') {
      if (dic[dic_op(str)] == true)
        cout << "yes" << "\n";
      else
        cout << "no" << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we have replaced the large static array with an unordered_map, which only allocates memory for the elements that are actually inserted. We have also limited the loop in the dic_op function to only process the characters in the string, and we have sped up I/O operations using cin and cout by adding the line ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) at the beginning of main(). This will significantly reduce the memory usage and improve the running time of the program.
