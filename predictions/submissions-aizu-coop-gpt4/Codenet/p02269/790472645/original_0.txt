The code is mainly a dictionary operation program that takes in two strings, an operation ("i" for insert, "f" for find), and another string made up of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. The second string is converted to a unique int value via `dic_op` function and used as an index in `dic` array. If the operation is "i", we see that the index is marked as 1 (insert operation). If the operation is "f", it checks whether the index in the array is marked as 1 or not (find operation).

## Code Analysis:

The given code has a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The `pow` function is not used anywhere in the code, it can be removed.
2. The size of the `dic` array is very large (90000000). If the input string size is small, then most of the memory allocated for `dic` array will be wasted.
3. The `scanf` function is slower than `cin`. It's better to use `cin` for string inputs.
4. The variable `j` is incremented inside the find operation but is never used. This is an unnecessary operation.
5. In the `dic_op` function, we are calculating `f * 1`, `f * 2`, `f * 3`, and `f * 4` which can be simplified.
6. We are reading two strings in each operation, but the operation string `opstr` is always of size 2. It is better to read it as a char instead of a string.

## Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove the unused `pow` function.
2. Use a dynamic data structure like `unordered_map` instead of the large static array. This will save a lot of memory.
3. Replace `scanf` with `cin` for string inputs.
4. Remove the unnecessary increment operation of `j`.
5. Simplify the calculation in `dic_op`.
6. Read the operation as a char instead of string.

## Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#define REP(i, a, b) for (i = a; i < b; i++)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define MOD1 1000000007
#define MOD2 1000007
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef long double ld;

int dic_op(char str[14]) {
  int j;
  long long f = 1;
  long long g = 0;
  for (j = 0;; j++) {
    if (str[j] == 'A')
      g += f;
    else if (str[j] == 'C')
      g += f * 2;
    else if (str[j] == 'G')
      g += f * 3;
    else if (str[j] == 'T')
      g += f * 4;
    else
      break;
    f *= 5;
  }
  return g;
}

int main() {
  int i, j, k, l;
  int n;
  long ans = 0;
  unordered_map<int, bool> dic;
  char op;
  char str[13];
  cin >> n;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> op >> str;
    if (op == 'i') {
      dic[dic_op(str)] = true;
    } else if (op == 'f') {
      if (dic[dic_op(str)])
        puts("yes");
      else
        puts("no");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

## Explanation:

1. Removed the `pow` function as it is not used in the code.
2. Replaced the large static array with `unordered_map`. The `unordered_map` dynamically allocates memory and does not waste memory like the static array.
3. Replaced `scanf` with `cin` for string inputs to improve performance.
4. Removed the unnecessary increment operation of `j`.
5. Simplified the calculation in `dic_op`.
6. Read the operation as a char instead of string. This makes the code more efficient as we are not creating a string object for a single character.
