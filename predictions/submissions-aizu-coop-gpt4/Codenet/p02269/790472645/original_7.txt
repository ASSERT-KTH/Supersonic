1. Code Analysis:

The provided code seems to be a simple implementation of a dictionary (similar to a hash map) with certain operations. The main performance bottlenecks could arise from the following sections:

    - The pow function: Calculating power using a loop can be inefficient for large values of n.
    - The dic_op function: This function is repeatedly called with the same string values which can lead to redundant computation.
    - The dictionary: The size of the dictionary is statically defined and very large, which could lead to inefficient memory utilization.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Use bitwise shift operations to replace the pow function. This is faster and uses less memory.
B. Implement memoization in the dic_op function to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computation.
C. Instead of using a large array to store the dictionary, use a more memory-efficient data structure like std::unordered_map from the C++ Standard Library.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Bitwise Shift Operation: Bitwise shift operation (n >> 1) is equivalent to dividing n by 2. Similarly, (x << 1) is equivalent to multiplying x by 2. This is faster than traditional multiplication and division.

B. Memoization: This is a technique where you store the results of expensive function calls and reuse the results when the same inputs occur again. This could greatly reduce the time spent in the dic_op function if the same string is passed multiple times.

C. std::unordered_map: This is a hash table based data structure in C++ Standard Library which provides constant time complexity for search, insert and delete operations on average. This would be more efficient than using a large array and would minimize memory usage.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here's the optimized version of the provided program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;
typedef unsigned long long ull;

unordered_map<string, int> memo;

ull dic_op(char str[14]) {
  if (memo.find(str) != memo.end()) return memo[str];
  
  ull f = 1;
  ull g = 0;
  for (int j = 0; ; j++) {
    if (str[j] == 'A')
      g += f * 1;
    else if (str[j] == 'C')
      g += f * 2;
    else if (str[j] == 'G')
      g += f * 3;
    else if (str[j] == 'T')
      g += f * 4;
    else
      break;
    f <<= 1; 
  }
  memo[str] = g;
  return g;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  unordered_map<ull, bool> dic;
  char opstr[7];
  char str[13];
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> opstr >> str;
    if (opstr[0] == 'i') {
      dic[dic_op(str)] = true;
    } else if (opstr[0] == 'f') {
      if (dic[dic_op(str)])
        cout << "yes" << endl;
      else
        cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations will provide a significant performance boost, but they also introduce a little code complexity. The memoization technique might take extra memory for the map, but it saves redundant computations. Using std::unordered_map instead of array can consume more memory if the number of unique keys is significantly less than the size of the array. But it provides better average case time complexity and is more memory efficient when the number of keys is comparable to the size of the array.
