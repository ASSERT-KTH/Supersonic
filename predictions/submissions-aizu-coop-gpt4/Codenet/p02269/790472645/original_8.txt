Here is the analysis of the code and the optimization strategy:

**Code Analysis:**
1. The code is a dictionary operation module. It takes in a series of operations (insert or find) along with string arguments and performs the operations on an internal dictionary. The dictionary here is implemented as a character array, with the string arguments being hashed into unique indices.

2. The hashing function "dic_op" converts a string composed of A, C, G, T into a unique integer by assigning each character a unique integer (A = 1, C = 2, G = 3, T = 4) and then calculating the sum of the character values, each multiplied by the power of 5.

3. The "pow" function is unused and could be removed.

4. The macro `MOD1` is defined but not used in the code.

5. The character array `dic` of size 90,000,000 is static and thus occupies a large chunk of memory throughout the program lifecycle.

**Optimization Strategy:**
1. Replace the `dic` array implementation with a more memory-efficient data structure like `std::unordered_map`. This will considerably reduce the memory footprint, as only the required elements will be stored.

2. Remove unused elements from the code like the `pow` function and the `MOD1` macro.

3. Replace the usage of `scanf` with `std::cin` for consistency.

4. Replace `puts("yes")` and `puts("no")` with `std::cout << "yes\n"` and `std::cout << "no\n"` for consistency and to eliminate the need for `cstdio`.

5. The 'j' variable is incremented but never used, which can be removed.

**Optimized Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int dic_op(char str[14]) {
  int j;
  long long f = 1;
  long long g = 0;
  for (j = 0;; j++) {
    if (str[j] == 'A')
      g += f * 1;
    else if (str[j] == 'C')
      g += f * 2;
    else if (str[j] == 'G')
      g += f * 3;
    else if (str[j] == 'T')
      g += f * 4;
    else
      break;
    f *= 5;
  }
  return g;
}

int main() {
  int i;
  int n;
  unordered_map<int, bool> dic;
  char opstr[7];
  char str[13];
  cin >> n;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> opstr >> str;
    if (opstr[0] == 'i') {
      dic[dic_op(str)] = true;
    } else if (opstr[0] == 'f') {
      if (dic[dic_op(str)])
        cout << "yes\n";
      else
        cout << "no\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code:
1. The `unordered_map` named `dic` is used to store whether a string has been inserted or not. It takes the same integer keys as the original program, but only stores elements that have been inserted, thus reducing the memory usage.
2. The `scanf` and `puts` functions are replaced with `cin` and `cout`, providing a consistent interface for I/O operations.
3. The `pow` function and `MOD1` macro, which were not used in the original code, have been removed.
4. The variable 'j' which was incremented but never used, is also removed from the code.
5. The `dic` array is replaced by an `unordered_map`, providing a more efficient and memory-friendly data structure.
6. The dictionary values are now boolean, reflecting the presence or absence of a key, which is more intuitive and efficient as compared to characters.
7. The `unordered_map` will be automatically deallocated once its scope ends, ensuring no memory leaks.
