The given code seems to be implementing a simple hash table that supports two operations: insert and find. It uses a large static char array `dic` to store the hash table, and the hash function `dic_op` converts a string of characters into an index in the hash table. The possible performance issues with this code are:

1. **Memory Usage**: The size of the `dic` array is static and very large (90,000,000). This could lead to wastage of memory if only a small portion of the array is used.

2. **Hash Function**: The hash function `dic_op` uses a simple multiplication and addition operation to calculate the hash. This could lead to high collision rates if the input data is not uniformly distributed.

3. **Hash Table Implementation**: The hash table implementation in the `main` function does not handle collisions. If two different strings have the same hash, the second string will simply overwrite the first string in the hash table.

4. **String Comparison**: The operation string `opstr` is compared with a single character. This is inefficient and error-prone. It would be better to compare the entire string.

Here is the optimization strategy:

1. **Memory Usage**: Switch to a dynamic data structure like `std::unordered_map` in C++ STL. This hash table implementation automatically handles collision and only uses as much memory as needed.

2. **Hash Function**: Use the built-in hash function in `std::unordered_map`. This hash function is generally better at avoiding collisions than a simple multiply-and-add hash function.

3. **String Comparison**: Compare the entire string instead of a single character.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: Enable compiler optimizations using the `-O3` flag to allow the compiler to automatically optimize the code for speed. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` to speed up input/output operations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  unordered_map<string, bool> dic;
  int n;
  string opstr, str;

  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> opstr >> str;
    if (opstr == "insert") {
      dic[str] = true;
    } else if (opstr == "find") {
      if (dic.find(str) != dic.end())
        cout << "yes" << "\n";
      else
        cout << "no" << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code uses `std::unordered_map` to implement the hash table, which should lead to better memory usage and potentially faster runtime. It also uses full string comparisons instead of single character comparisons, which should be more robust and slightly faster. Finally, it enables compiler and IO optimizations, which should improve the overall performance of the code.
