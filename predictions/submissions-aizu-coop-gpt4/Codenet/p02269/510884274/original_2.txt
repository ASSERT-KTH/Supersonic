**Code Analysis**

This code uses an array to store the presence of a string. It calculates a hash for the string and uses that hash as an index in the array. If a string's hash is present in the array, it means that the string is present. If not, it means that the string is not present.

The potential performance bottlenecks are:

1. The size of the array: The array has a size of over 244 million. This is a massive amount of memory, especially if only a small number of strings are hashed. This may cause the program to run out of memory. 

2. The hash function: The hash function multiplies the current hash by 5 and adds a new value based on the current character in the string. This can be a slow operation, especially for long strings.

**Optimization Strategy**

Here are a few things that can be done to optimize the code:

1. Use a more efficient data structure: A `std::unordered_set` can be used instead of the array. This data structure uses a hash table for storing elements, which provides constant time complexity for search and insert operations. It's also more memory efficient because it only uses as much memory as it needs to store the elements.

2. Optimize the hash function: The hash function can be optimized by using bitwise operations, which are typically faster than multiplication and addition.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. Replace the array with an `std::unordered_set<string>`: This data structure is more memory efficient and provides faster operations. The trade-off is that the code will be slightly more complex because the `std::unordered_set` methods have to be used instead of simple array indexing.

2. Refactor the hash function: The hash function is not needed when using `std::unordered_set` because it has its own hash function for strings. This simplifies the code and improves performance.

**Optimized Code Block**

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

int n;
string ins, s;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  unordered_set<string> chk;
  cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> ins >> s;
    if (ins[0] == 'i') {
      chk.insert(s);
    } else {
      cout << (chk.find(s) != chk.end() ? "yes" : "no") << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Changes:

- The array `chk` has been replaced with the `unordered_set` `chk`.
- The `h` function has been removed because it's not needed.
- The `insert` method is used to insert the string into the `unordered_set`.
- The `find` method is used to check if a string is in the `unordered_set`.
