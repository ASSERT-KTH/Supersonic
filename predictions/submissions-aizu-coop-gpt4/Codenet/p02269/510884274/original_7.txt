1. **Code Analysis**: The given code is a simple implementation of a string hashing technique. The hash function `h()` transforms a string, representing a sequence of nucleotides, into an integer. The boolean array `chk` is used as a hash table to check the existence of a string. The code reads a number `n` and then performs `n` operations, each consisting of an instruction `ins` and a string `s`. If `ins` is 'i', it inserts the string `s` into the hash table; otherwise, it checks if `s` is in the hash table and prints 'yes' or 'no'. The main performance issue in this code is the potentially excessive memory usage, as the size of `chk` is fixed and very large - about 1.8GB.

2. **Optimization Strategy**:
    1. The array `chk` is too large for most purposes. A more space-efficient data structure like `unordered_set` can be used instead.
    2. The hash function `h()` seems to be properly optimized. However, it can be slightly improved by using a switch statement instead of multiple if-else statements, as switch is generally more efficient when comparing a variable to several constant values.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    1. Replace the boolean array `chk` with an `unordered_set<int>`. This will drastically reduce memory usage, as `unordered_set` only stores the elements that have been inserted, whereas the array `chk` reserves space for all possible hash values. Since the hash function generates unique values for each string, there will be no hash collisions and the `unordered_set` will work correctly.
    2. Replace the if-else statements in the hash function with a switch statement. This can improve performance since switch statements are usually implemented as jump tables, which allow for constant time comparisons.

4. **Optimized Code Block**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;
unordered_set<int> chk;
int n;
string ins, s;

int h(string s) {
  int ret = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); ++i) {
    ret *= 5;
    switch(s[i]) {
      case 'A':
        ret += 1;
        break;
      case 'C':
        ret += 2;
        break;
      case 'G':
        ret += 3;
        break;
      case 'T':
        ret += 4;
        break;
    }
  }
  return ret;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> ins >> s;
    if (ins[0] == 'i') {
      chk.insert(h(s));
    } else {
      cout << (chk.count(h(s)) ? "yes" : "no") << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code has the same functionality as the original code, but uses less memory and can be slightly faster due to the use of a switch statement. However, it's worth noting that the performance of the `unordered_set` depends on the quality of the hash function and the input data. In the worst case, if there are many hash collisions, the `unordered_set` could become slow. But given the hash function in this code, this is unlikely to happen.
