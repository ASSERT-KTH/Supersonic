Code Analysis:

The provided C++ program is designed to check whether a string is present in an array. The primary operations performed in this code are input and output operations, string handling, and hashing.

The major performance bottlenecks are:

1. Global array of booleans, `chk[244140624]`: This is a large memory allocation, which consumes about 1GB of memory. This could be replaced with a more efficient data structure.
2. The function `h(s)`: This function is used to hash the string. The hashing function is a potential bottleneck because it uses multiplication and addition operations inside a loop. 
3. The use of string comparison in `if` statements: This can be more expensive than integer or character comparisons.
4. The use of the `iostream` in I/O operations: It's known that `iostream` is slower than other I/O libraries like `cstdio`.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Instead of using a global array of booleans, we can use an unordered_set. An unordered_set in C++ is implemented using a hash table where keys are hashed into indices of a hash table so it provides constant time complexity for search, insert and delete operations on average.
2. The hashing function `h(s)` can be optimized by replacing the multiplication operation with a bitwise shift operation. The bitwise shift operation is faster than multiplication.
3. The use of string comparison in `if` statements can be replaced by character comparisons.
4. The use of `iostream` in I/O operations can be replaced with `cstdio` for faster I/O.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the global array with `unordered_set<int> chk;`. This reduces memory usage and provides constant time complexity for search, insert and delete operations on average.
2. In the `h(s)` function, replace `ret *= 5;` with `ret <<= 2; ret += ret;`. This uses bitwise shift operation which is faster than multiplication.
3. Replace string comparisons in `if` statements with character comparisons. For example, replace `if (ins[0] == 'i')` with `if (ins == "insert")`.
4. Replace the `iostream` library with `cstdio` for faster I/O. Replace `cin >> n;` with `scanf("%d", &n);`, `cin >> ins >> s;` with `scanf("%s %s", ins, s);`, and `cout << (chk[h(s)] ? "yes" : "no") << endl;` with `printf("%s\n", (chk.count(h(s)) ? "yes" : "no"));`.

Trade-offs:

While these optimizations improve the performance of the code, they do increase the complexity of the code slightly. The use of `unordered_set` and bitwise shift operations may not be as immediately understandable to some developers as the original code. However, these are standard techniques in C++ and are commonly used in performance-critical applications.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;
unordered_set<int> chk;
int n;
char ins[10], s[14];
int h(char* s) {
  int ret = 0;
  for (int i = 0; s[i] != '\0'; ++i) {
    ret <<= 2;
    ret += ret;
    if (s[i] == 'A')
      ret += 1;
    else if (s[i] == 'C')
      ret += 2;
    else if (s[i] == 'G')
      ret += 3;
    else if (s[i] == 'T')
      ret += 4;
  }
  return ret;
}
int main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  while (n--) {
    scanf("%s %s", ins, s);
    if (ins[0] == 'i') {
      chk.insert(h(s));
    } else {
      printf("%s\n", (chk.count(h(s)) ? "yes" : "no"));
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
