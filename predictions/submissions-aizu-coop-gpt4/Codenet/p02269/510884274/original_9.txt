This is a simple C++ program that accepts a series of 'insert' or 'find' operations as input, where each operation is associated with a DNA string composed of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. It then stores or checks the DNA string in an array. This program uses a hash function to convert the DNA string into an integer to be used as an index for the array. 

After analyzing the code, following inefficiencies were found:
1. The function h() calculates the hash value for a string, and it is called multiple times for the same string within a single iteration. This can be optimized.
2. The array 'chk' is very large and mostly unused, which is inefficient in terms of memory usage. A dynamic data structure that grows as needed would be more efficient.
3. The if-else chain in the hash function can be optimized using a lookup table.
4. Since the string 'ins' only checks the first character, we could limit the input to a single character instead of a string.

Here's a step-by-step optimization strategy:

1. Instead of calculating hash value for the same string multiple times, calculate it once and store it in a variable for later use.
2. Replace the array 'chk' with a dynamic data structure such as an unordered_set in the standard library, which is an implementation of a hash set. This will only store the hash values that are actually used, saving memory. 
3. Replace the if-else chain in the hash function with a lookup table. This would make the function more streamlined and efficient.
4. Limit the input 'ins' to a single character instead of a string.

Trade-offs:
- The use of an unordered_set instead of an array might potentially increase the runtime slightly due to the overhead of a more complex data structure. However, the increase in runtime would likely be negligible, and the memory savings would be significant for large inputs.
- The lookup table replaces the if-else chain, making the code cleaner but it requires an additional static data structure in memory.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

unordered_set<int> chk;
int n;
char ins;
string s;
int dna_values[128];

void initialize_dna_values() {
  dna_values['A'] = 1;
  dna_values['C'] = 2;
  dna_values['G'] = 3;
  dna_values['T'] = 4;
}

int h(string s) {
  int ret = 0;
  for (char c : s) {
    ret = ret * 5 + dna_values[c];
  }
  return ret;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL); // additional optimization to disconnect cin and cout
  initialize_dna_values();
  
  cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> ins >> s;
    int hash = h(s);
    if (ins == 'i') {
      chk.insert(hash);
    } else {
      cout << (chk.count(hash) ? "yes" : "no") << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version:
- The array 'chk' has been replaced with an unordered_set.
- The hash value for the string 's' is calculated only once and saved in the 'hash' variable.
- A lookup table 'dna_values' is used to replace the if-else chain.
- The input 'ins' is limited to a single character.
- The function initialize_dna_values() is used to fill the lookup table.
- We have used cin.tie(NULL) to disconnect cin and cout, which can potentially speed up I/O operations.
