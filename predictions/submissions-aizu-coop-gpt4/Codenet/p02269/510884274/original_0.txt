Code Analysis:
1. The code is trying to keep track of strings which are sequences of nucleotides ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in a boolean array. 
2. The function `h(s)` hashes each string into a unique integer which is then used as the index in the array. 
3. The 'i' command inserts a string into the array by marking its hashed value as true, and any other command checks if the string is in the array.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the boolean array with an unordered set. The array uses a large amount of memory, most of which is unused because the distribution of hashed values is not uniform. An unordered set is more memory-efficient as it only stores the elements that are inserted.
2. Convert the if-else chain in the `h(s)` function into a switch-case statement. This can potentially improve performance because the switch-case statement in some compilers can be optimized into a jump table, which has a constant lookup time.

Optimization Steps:
1. Include the `<unordered_set>` library and replace `bool chk[244140624]` with `unordered_set<int> chk`.
2. In the `h(s)` function, replace the if-else chain with a switch-case statement.

Trade-offs:
1. The use of an unordered set instead of an array might lead to slower access times because a hash table (which is what an unordered set is based on) has a worse cache locality compared to an array. However, this is a trade-off we're willing to make for the significant memory savings.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

unordered_set<int> chk;
int n;
string ins, s;

int h(string s) {
  int ret = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); ++i) {
    ret *= 5;
    switch (s[i]) {
      case 'A':
        ret += 1;
        break;
      case 'C':
        ret += 2;
        break;
      case 'G':
        ret += 3;
        break;
      case 'T':
        ret += 4;
        break;
    }
  }
  return ret;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> ins >> s;
    if (ins[0] == 'i') {
      chk.insert(h(s));
    } else {
      cout << (chk.find(h(s)) != chk.end() ? "yes" : "no") << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the code will use less memory and potentially run faster due to the optimized hashing function. The functionality remains the same as the original code.
