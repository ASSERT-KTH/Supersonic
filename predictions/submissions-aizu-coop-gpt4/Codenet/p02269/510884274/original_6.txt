Code Analysis:
This program uses a boolean array "chk" to store whether a string has been inserted before or not. It converts the string into an integer using a hashing function and uses this value as the index of the array. For each query, it checks if the corresponding index in the chk array is set to true or not. The size of the array, 244140624, seems arbitrary and the hashing function can potentially lead to hash collisions.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The boolean array "chk" is inefficient in memory usage since it has a large size, most of which might be unused. We can replace it with a more efficient data structure such as a hash set.
2. The hash function "h" is calculated every time we want to check or insert a string, even though it might be the same string. We can avoid this redundancy by storing the hash of the string after calculating it once.
3. The if-else statements in the hash function "h" can be optimized by using a map to store the values corresponding to the characters.

Optimization Steps:
1. Replace the chk array with a hash set: A hash set is a data structure that stores unique values. It provides constant time complexity for insertion and search operations. This would significantly reduce memory usage and improve performance.

2. Store the hash of the string: By storing the hash of the string in a variable, we can avoid calculating it multiple times. This would improve performance by reducing unnecessary computation.

3. Use a map in the hash function: Instead of using if-else statements, we can use a map to store the values corresponding to the characters. This would improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

Trade-offs: While these optimizations improve performance and memory usage, the code becomes slightly more complex. However, this complexity is minimal and the performance gains outweigh the increased complexity.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <map>
using namespace std;
unordered_set<int> chk;
map<char, int> values = {{'A', 1}, {'C', 2}, {'G', 3}, {'T', 4}};
int n;
string ins, s;
int h(string s) {
  int ret = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
    ret *= 5;
    ret += values[s[i]];
  }
  return ret;
}
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> ins >> s;
    int hash = h(s); // calculate the hash once
    if (ins[0] == 'i') {
      chk.insert(hash);
    } else {
      cout << (chk.count(hash) ? "yes" : "no") << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code performs the same operations as the original code but with improved performance and reduced memory usage.
