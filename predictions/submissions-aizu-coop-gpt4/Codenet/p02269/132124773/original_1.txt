The given code is a simple command interpreter program that reads an integer 'n' from the input, followed by 'n' commands. Each command is a string with either 'i' or 'd' followed by a word. If the command starts with 'i', the word is added to a dictionary. If the command does not start with 'i', the program checks if the word is in the dictionary and outputs either 'yes' or 'no'. 

Here are some potential optimizations:

1. **Data Structure Optimization**: The map data structure is used for storing the dictionary. Although map offers O(log n) complexity for search, insertion and deletion operations, we could use unordered_map which offers average time complexity of O(1) for these operations. unordered_map uses hash table, where keys are hashed into indices of a hash table so that the insertion is done at constant time complexity. 

2. **Avoiding Unnecessary String Comparison**: In the original code, the command string 'com' is checked for being equal to 'i' on each iteration. This comparison operation can be replaced by checking only the first character of the string which will be faster.

3. **Minimizing Console I/O**: Console I/O operations are often more time-consuming than memory read/write operations. The current code outputs 'yes' or 'no' for every check operation. If the number of check operations is large, this could slow down the program. Instead, we can store the result in a string and output once at the end. 

4. **Avoiding Unnecessary Dictionary Lookup**: In the original code, we are making two lookups in the dictionary: one for checking if the word exists and another for fetching the value. We can reduce this to a single lookup using `find` function.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  unordered_map<string, bool> Dic;
  string com, word, result;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> com >> word;
    if (com[0] == 'i') {
      Dic[word] = true;
    } else {
      if (Dic.find(word) != Dic.end()) {
        result += "yes\n";
      } else {
        result += "no\n";
      }
    }
  }
  cout << result;
  return 0;
}
```

In this version of the code, we use `unordered_map` instead of `map`, check only the first character of the command string, accumulate output in a string, and use `find` function to check if the word exists in the dictionary. All these changes can help to improve the performance of the code. However, the drawback is that the `unordered_map` could potentially use more memory than `map` if a bad hash function causes many collisions.
