**Code Analysis:**
The given code is a simple command interpreter for a dictionary. It reads a number 'n' representing the number of commands and then for each command it either inserts a word into the dictionary or checks if the word is present in the dictionary. The dictionary is implemented as a `std::map<string, bool>`.

The potential performance bottlenecks are:
1. `std::map` uses a red-black tree under the hood, which means each operation (insertion, deletion, search) takes O(log n) time. This could be a bottleneck if we have a large number of commands.

**Optimization Strategy:**
1. Data Structure: Instead of a `std::map`, we could use a `std::unordered_map` which provides average constant-time complexity for search, insert, and delete.

2. Redundant computation: There aren't any redundant computations in the code.

3. Loop Optimizations: The loop here is mainly for reading commands and it cannot be unrolled or optimized.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can't use compiler optimizations or pragma directives here.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. We replace `std::map` with `std::unordered_map`. This is because `std::map` operations like insert and find have a time complexity of O(log n) while `std::unordered_map` has an average time complexity of O(1) for the same operations. The trade-off here is that `std::unordered_map` may use more memory than `std::map` due to the need to maintain a hash table.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  unordered_map<string, bool> Dic;  // Changed to unordered_map
  string com, word;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> com >> word;
    if (com[0] == 'i')
      Dic[word] = true;
    else {
      if (Dic[word])
        cout << "yes" << endl;
      else
        cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
}
```

This version of the code performs the same function as the original but should run faster for large inputs due to the constant time complexity of operations in `std::unordered_map`.
