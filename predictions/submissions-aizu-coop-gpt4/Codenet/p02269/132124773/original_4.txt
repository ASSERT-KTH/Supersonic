1. **Code Analysis**: 
The given code reads a number 'n' from the input, and then it processes 'n' commands. Each command is composed of an action ('i' for insertion or 'f' for finding) and a word. The words are stored in a map named 'Dic', and when a find command is received, the code checks if the word is in the map and prints "yes" or "no" accordingly.

2. **Optimization Strategy**:
   1. The `std::map` data structure provides an ordered map implemented as a balanced binary search tree. This performs well in general, but for this specific case, an `unordered_map` could be a better choice as it provides average constant-time complexity for searches, insertions, and deletions. 
   2. The `std::endl` manipulator is used, which causes a flush operation on the output stream. It would be more efficient to use "\n" to print a newline without flushing the stream.
   3. The code reads the command as a string and checks the first character to determine the action. It would be more efficient to read the command as a character and switch on it.
   4. The map access operator [] is used, which creates an entry if it doesn't exist. It would be more efficient to use the `find` function to check if an entry exists.
   
3. **Step-by-step Explanation**:
   1. Replace `std::map` with `std::unordered_map`. This will improve the average case time complexity of insertions and lookups from O(log n) to O(1), where n is the number of elements in the map.
   2. Replace `std::endl` with "\n". This will prevent unnecessary flush operations on the output stream, which can be costly in terms of performance.
   3. Read the command as a character and use a switch statement to determine the action. This will eliminate the need to construct a string object for the command and will likely result in cleaner, more readable code.
   4. Use the `find` function instead of the access operator [] to check if a word is in the map. This will prevent the creation of unnecessary entries in the map and will likely result in more efficient code.

4. **Optimized Code Block**:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  unordered_map<string, bool> Dic;
  char com;
  string word;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> com >> word;
    switch(com) {
      case 'i':
        Dic[word] = true;
        break;
      case 'f':
        if (Dic.find(word) != Dic.end())
          cout << "yes\n";
        else
          cout << "no\n";
        break;
      default:
        break;
    }
  }
}
```
This version of the code should perform better than the original one while producing the same output. However, one trade-off is that the order of the elements in the map is no longer guaranteed, which is not an issue in this specific program.
