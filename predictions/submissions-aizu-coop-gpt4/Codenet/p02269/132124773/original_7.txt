1. Code Analysis:
   The code reads a command and a word from the standard input. If the command starts with 'i', the word is inserted in a map with the key being the word and value as true. If the command does not start with 'i', it checks if the word is in the map and prints 'yes' or 'no' accordingly.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. Data Structures: The map data structure used in C++ has a time complexity of O(log(n)) for insertions and searches in the worst case scenario. This can be improved by using an unordered_map, which has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertions and searches.
   2. String Comparison: Checking the first character of the command string can be made more efficient by using char comparison instead of string comparison using the operator[].
   3. I/O Optimization: The cin and cout operations can be optimized by disabling synchronization with the C libraries and untie the cin/cout streams.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Replace `map<string, bool>` with `unordered_map<string, bool>`. The unordered_map in C++ uses a hash table for implementation which allows constant time complexity for insertion and access on average.
   2. Replace `com[0] == 'i'` with `com.front() == 'i'`. This is slightly faster and more efficient because it avoids the overhead of the operator[].
   3. Add `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);` after the main function starts. The function `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams which can make the I/O operations faster. `cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);` unties the cin and cout streams, which can further optimize the I/O operations.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // Optimizing I/O operations
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  unordered_map<string, bool> Dic; // Using unordered_map instead of map
  string com, word;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> com >> word;
    if (com.front() == 'i') // Using char comparison instead of string comparison
      Dic[word] = true;
    else {
      if (Dic[word])
        cout << "yes" << endl;
      else
        cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
}
```

Trade-offs: While the code is now more efficient in terms of time complexity, the unordered_map uses a hash table for storage which can use more memory than a map. In addition, the hash table can become inefficient if there are many collisions. But in general, this optimized code will be faster for large inputs.
