Code Analysis:
The code is a simple dictionary program. It reads an integer 'n' from the input, which represents the number of operations. Then it reads 'n' pairs of string inputs where the first string represents the command and the second string represents a word. If the command is 'i', it inserts the word into the dictionary. If the command is not 'i', the program checks if the word is in the dictionary and prints 'yes' if it is and 'no' if it isn't.

Optimization Strategy:
The program is quite efficient, but there are still a few points that can be optimized:

1. `std::map` Data Structure: `std::map` is a balanced binary tree and has logarithmic time complexity for insertion and lookup operations. We can use `std::unordered_map` which is a hash table and provides constant time complexity for these operations, on average.

2. String Comparison: We are comparing the first character of the command string to determine the operation. It would be faster to compare characters instead of creating a new string object for the command.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace `std::map` with `std::unordered_map`: This change is straightforward. It improves performance because `std::unordered_map` has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertions and lookups, which is faster than `std::map`'s O(log n).

2. Compare Characters Instead of Strings: By using character comparison, we can avoid creating a new string object, which would require memory allocation and deallocation. This saves time and memory.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  unordered_map<string, bool> Dic;
  char com;
  string word;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> com >> word;
    if (com == 'i')
      Dic[word] = true;
    else {
      if (Dic[word])
        cout << "yes" << endl;
      else
        cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code performs the same function as the original, but it is more efficient in terms of time complexity and memory usage. The changes made are minimal and do not alter the functionality of the code. The code is also quite readable and understandable.
