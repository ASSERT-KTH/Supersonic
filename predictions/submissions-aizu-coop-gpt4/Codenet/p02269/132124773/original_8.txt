Code Analysis:
The provided code is a simple C++ program that uses a map data structure to store string keys. The user inputs a series of commands and corresponding words. If the command begins with 'i', the program inserts the word into the map. If the command does not begin with 'i', the program checks if the word is in the map and outputs "yes" or "no" accordingly.

Performance Bottlenecks:
1. Use of map: The C++ map is a sorted associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys. It's implemented as a self-balancing binary search tree. The time complexity for searching a key-value pair in map is logarithmic. However, in this case since we just need to check if a key exists or not, we can use an unordered_map which has an average time complexity of O(1) for search, insert and delete operations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use of unordered_map: As explained above, using unordered_map instead of map would reduce the time complexity of our operations from O(log N) to O(1).

2. Use of '\n' instead of endl: In C++, endl causes flushing of the output buffer every time it is called. Flushing the buffer unnecessarily increases the running time of the program. We can use '\n' instead.

Step-by-step Explanation:
1. Replacing map with unordered_map: unordered_map in C++ is an associative container with O(1) time complexity for search, insert and delete operations on average. This is faster than a map which has a time complexity of O(logN). This will significantly speed up our program if we have a large number of inputs.

2. Replacing endl with '\n': In C++, endl causes the output buffer to flush. This can make our code run slower, especially when we are printing a large amount of data. Using '\n' instead of endl will speed up our program.

Trade-offs:
1. While unordered_map provides faster access times, it uses more memory than a regular map.

Optimized Code Block:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  unordered_map<string, bool> Dic;
  string com, word;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> com >> word;
    if (com[0] == 'i')
      Dic[word] = true;
    else {
      if (Dic[word])
        cout << "yes" << '\n';
      else
        cout << "no" << '\n';
    }
  }
}
```
In the optimized code, a map is replaced with an unordered_map, and endl is replaced with '\n' to improve performance.
