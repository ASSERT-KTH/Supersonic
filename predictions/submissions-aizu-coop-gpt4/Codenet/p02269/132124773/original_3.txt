1. Code Analysis:
The provided code reads a series of commands from the input. Each command consists of a string followed by a word. If the string starts with 'i', the word is inserted into a map. Otherwise, the program checks if the word is in the map and prints 'yes' if it is and 'no' if it isn't. The map is used to store words and perform lookup operations. This is a simple implementation, but it can be optimized.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. The map in C++ is generally implemented as a Red-Black Tree, which gives a time complexity of O(log(n)) for insertion and lookup. An unordered_map, on the other hand, is implemented using a Hash Table, which provides an average time complexity of O(1) for both these operations. Therefore, using unordered_map instead of map can potentially speed up the program.
    2. The program reads a string (command) and checks only its first character. This can be optimized by reading a character instead of a string.
    3. The use of 'endl' flushes the buffer every time it is used. This can be slower when there are many output operations. Using '\n' instead of 'endl' can speed up the output.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Change the data structure from map to unordered_map: This provides a better average time complexity for insertions and lookups (O(1) vs O(log(n))).
    2. Read a character instead of a string for the command: This reduces the amount of unnecessary data read from the input, saving time.
    3. Use '\n' instead of 'endl' to print the output: 'endl' flushes the output buffer, which can be slow. Using '\n' instead can speed up the output.

Here are the trade-offs:
    - By using an unordered_map, we are trading off worst-case performance for a better average-case performance. In the worst case, the hash function could cause all entries to collide and create a linked list, leading to O(n) complexity. However, this is unlikely with a good hash function and random data.
    - Reading a single character instead of a string for the command makes it necessary for the input to be formatted correctly. If a string is entered instead of a single character, the program may not function as expected.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  unordered_map<string, bool> Dic;
  char com;
  string word;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> com >> word;
    if (com == 'i')
      Dic[word] = true;
    else {
      if (Dic[word])
        cout << "yes\n";
      else
        cout << "no\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized code maintains the original functionality while potentially improving the performance.
