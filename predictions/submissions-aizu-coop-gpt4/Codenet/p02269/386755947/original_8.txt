Code Analysis:
This C++ program appears to deal with DNA sequences. It has a main function that reads an integer 'n' and then goes into a loop, reading pairs of strings 's' and 'str'. If 's' is equal to "i", it converts the string 'str' into an integer using the function 'c' and stores true in the boolean array 'd' at the index equal to the integer. If 's' is not equal to "i", it checks if the index corresponding to 'str' in 'd' is true and outputs "yes" if true and "no" if false.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Efficient Data Structures: The use of a boolean array 'd' of size 33554432 seems unnecessary and memory-wasting. We could use a std::unordered_set<int> instead. This data structure provides average constant-time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.

2. Redundant Computations: There seems to be no redundant computation in the program.

3. Loop Optimization: The loop in the 'c' function can be slightly optimized by removing the declaration of 'i' outside the loop.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The compiler can automatically optimize the code for better performance when the appropriate flags are set during compilation, such as -O2 or -O3.

Optimization Explanation:
1. Efficient Data Structures: By using a std::unordered_set<int> instead of a bool array, we avoid reserving memory for 33554432 boolean values. The unordered_set is a hash table, which only allocates memory for the elements it actually contains. This leads to less memory usage and faster lookup times.

2. Loop Optimization: Declaring 'i' inside the loop increases readability and does not affect performance.

3. Compiler Optimizations: The use of compiler flags like -O2 or -O3 can lead to performance improvements. These flags instruct the compiler to perform optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, and other performance-enhancing transformations.

Trade-offs: The use of std::unordered_set might increase the complexity of the code a bit due to the use of C++ STL. However, the benefit in terms of memory usage and speed is significant.

Optimized Code Block:
```
#include <cstdio>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;
unordered_set<int> d;
char k[128];
int c(char str[12]) {
  int ans = str[0];
  for (int i = 1; str[i] != '\0'; i++) {
    ans <<= 2;
    ans += k[str[i]];
  }
  return ans;
}
int main() {
  k['A'] = 0;
  k['C'] = 1;
  k['G'] = 2;
  k['T'] = 3;
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  char s[7], str[12];
  while (n--) {
    scanf("%s %s", s, str);
    if (s[0] == 'i')
      d.insert(c(str));
    else
      puts(d.count(c(str)) > 0 ? "yes" : "no");
  }
  return 0;
}
