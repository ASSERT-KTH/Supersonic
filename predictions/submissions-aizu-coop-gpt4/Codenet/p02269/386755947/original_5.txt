Code Analysis:
This program is a simple dictionary implemented with a direct-addressing table to store strings of DNA sequences made up of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. The table is indexed by a hash function, which converts the string into an integer. The dictionary supports insertion (with the 'i' command) and querying (with 'f' command).

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. Memory Consumption: The table 'd' is quite large (33,554,432 entries), which could lead to high memory usage. However, as it is a boolean array, each entry only takes up one byte, making the total memory usage about 32MB. This is likely acceptable for modern systems, but may not be for systems with less memory.

2. Hash Function: The hash function 'c' is called for every operation. It processes the string character by character, which could be a potential bottleneck if the string is very long or if the operation count is very high.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: The data structure used here, a direct-addressing table, is efficient in this case because it provides constant time complexity for both insertion and query operations. No change is required.

2. Redundant or Unnecessary Computations: There is no redundant computation as such, but the hash function is called for every operation, which could be optimized.

3. Loops or Recursive Calls: The loop inside the hash function is a potential candidate for optimization. It iterates over the string for each operation. Loop unrolling could be used to speed up this operation.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Modern compilers already perform a great deal of optimization. However, we can use pragma directives to hint the compiler to further optimize certain parts of the code.

Optimization Step:
1. Loop Unrolling in Hash Function: Loop unrolling is a technique that reduces the overhead of loop control instructions by executing the loop body multiple times in each loop iteration. In this case, we can unroll the loop in the hash function, processing two characters at a time instead of one. This will halve the number of iterations and reduce the overhead of incrementing the loop counter and checking the loop condition.

Trade-offs: This optimization will slightly increase the complexity of the code, as we now have to handle the case where the string length is odd. However, the performance gain from halving the number of loop iterations is likely to outweigh this increase in complexity.

Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
bool d[33554432];
char k[128];
int c(char str[12]) {
  int ans = str[0], i = 1;
  // Process two characters at a time
  for (; str[i] != '\0' && str[i+1] != '\0'; i += 2) {
    ans <<= 4;  // Shift by 4 because we are processing two characters
    ans += (k[str[i]] << 2) + k[str[i+1]];  // Add the values of the two characters
  }
  // If the string length is odd, process the remaining character
  if (str[i] != '\0') {
    ans <<= 2;
    ans += k[str[i]];
  }
  return ans;
}
int main() {
  k['A'] = 0;
  k['C'] = 1;
  k['G'] = 2;
  k['T'] = 3;
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  char s[7], str[12];
  while (n--) {
    scanf("%s %s", s, str);
    if (s[0] == 'i')
      d[c(str)] = true;
    else
      puts(d[c(str)] ? "yes" : "no");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code block unrolls the loop in the hash function, processing two characters at a time. This reduces the number of loop iterations by half, speeding up the hash function and potentially improving the overall performance of the program.
