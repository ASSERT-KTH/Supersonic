The code operates on a series of inputs, each consisting of an operation ("i" or a different string) and a string of characters. If the operation is "i", the code converts the string to an integer using a specific encoding and inserts it into a boolean array. If the operation is not "i", the code checks if the converted string is in the array and prints "yes" or "no" accordingly.

1. Code Analysis:
   The main performance bottlenecks in this code are the array lookup, the string-to-integer conversion, and the string comparison in the conditional statement. The array size is 33554432, which might cause a lot of cache misses. The function `c` is called repeatedly, possibly with the same string, which wastes computation.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   a. Inefficient data structures: The large boolean array is inefficient and can be replaced with a hash table or set, which can reduce the space cost and speed up the search.
   b. Redundant computations: The function `c` is called repeatedly for the same string, which is inefficient. We can cache the results to avoid unnecessary computations.
   c. Loops: The loop in the function `c` can be unrolled to speed up the conversion.
   d. Compiler optimizations: Use the `-O3` optimization flag when compiling the code.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   a. Replace the large boolean array with a set: The std::unordered_set in C++ provides constant time complexity on average for search, insert, and delete operations. This change will also reduce the memory usage because only the inserted elements are stored.
   b. Cache the results of the function `c`: We can use a map to store the results of previous calls to `c`. Before computing `c(str)`, we first check if `str` is in the map.
   c. Unroll the loop in `c`: This can be done manually or by using the `-funroll-loops` compiler flag. This reduces the overhead of loop control and increases the speed of the conversion.
   d. Use the `-O3` optimization flag: This enables all optimization flags, including `-funroll-loops`.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
unordered_set<int> d;
unordered_map<string, int> cache;
char k[128];

int c(const char* str) {
  // Check the cache first
  auto it = cache.find(str);
  if(it != cache.end())
    return it->second;

  // Not in cache, compute it
  int ans = str[0], i = 1;
  for (i; str[i] != '\0'; i++) {
    ans <<= 2;
    ans += k[str[i]];
  }

  // Store the result in cache
  cache[str] = ans;
  
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  k['A'] = 0;
  k['C'] = 1;
  k['G'] = 2;
  k['T'] = 3;
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  char s[7], str[12];
  while (n--) {
    scanf("%s %s", s, str);
    if (s[0] == 'i')
      d.insert(c(str));
    else
      puts(d.count(c(str)) ? "yes" : "no");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Compile the code with the `-O3` flag to further optimize the performance:

```
g++ -O3 -o optimize optimize.cpp
```
