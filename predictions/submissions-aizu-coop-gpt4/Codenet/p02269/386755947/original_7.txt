Code Analysis:
This program is a simple implementation of a hash table using an array of boolean values. It reads a series of commands from the standard input. Each command is either 'i' (for insert) followed by a string, or 'q' (for query) followed by a string. The strings are then converted into integers using the function 'c', and these integers are used as indices into the array 'd'. If the command is 'i', the corresponding index in 'd' is set to 'true', and if the command is 'q', it checks whether the corresponding index in 'd' is 'true' or 'false' and prints 'yes' or 'no' respectively.

The function 'c' converts a string into an integer by initializing the integer with the ASCII value of the first character in the string, and then for each subsequent character, it shifts the integer two bits to the left and adds the integer value associated with that character ('A' corresponds to 0, 'C' to 1, 'G' to 2, and 'T' to 3).

Optimization Strategy:
1. The most obvious inefficiency in this code is in the function 'c'. The loop variable 'i' is initialized to 1 before the loop, and then the loop begins by checking 'i', which is unnecessary. It can be initialized directly in the loop.
2. The for loop in the function 'c' can be optimized by using pointer arithmetic instead of array indexing. Pointer arithmetic is generally faster than array indexing.
3. The 'puts' function is a high-level function and its performance is worse than 'printf'.
4. The 'scanf' function is used to read the strings from the standard input. However, 'scanf' is known to be slower than other input methods. We can replace it with 'getchar'.
5. The size of the array 'd' is fixed and very large. This can lead to inefficient use of memory if the number of elements is significantly less than the size of the array. However, as the size of the array is determined by the maximum possible value that can be returned by the function 'c', it cannot be reduced without changing the functionality of the program.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Initialize the loop variable 'i' directly in the for loop in the function 'c'. This reduces the number of instructions in the program, improving its performance.
2. Replace array indexing with pointer arithmetic in the function 'c'. Pointer arithmetic is generally faster because it involves only one addition operation, while array indexing involves an addition and a multiplication.
3. Replace 'puts' with 'printf'. 'printf' is a lower-level function and therefore generally faster than 'puts'.
4. Replace 'scanf' with 'getchar'. 'getchar' is a lower-level function and therefore generally faster than 'scanf'.
5. Unfortunately, the size of the array 'd' cannot be reduced without changing the functionality of the program. However, if the program is used in a context where the number of elements is significantly less than the size of the array, it may be worth considering other data structures, such as a hash table with linked lists for collision resolution, which would use memory more efficiently.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
bool d[33554432];
char k[128];
int c(char *str) {
  int ans = *str++;
  while (*str != '\0') {
    ans <<= 2;
    ans += k[*str++];
  }
  return ans;
}
int main() {
  k['A'] = 0;
  k['C'] = 1;
  k['G'] = 2;
  k['T'] = 3;
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  char s[7], str[12];
  while (n--) {
    char cmd = getchar();
    scanf("%s", str);
    if (cmd == 'i')
      d[c(str)] = true;
    else
      printf(d[c(str)] ? "yes\n" : "no\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
