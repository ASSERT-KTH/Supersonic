Analysis:
The provided code appears to implement the Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting on a directed graph. The algorithm builds up a list of nodes in topological order by repeatedly removing nodes that have no incoming edges and removing their outgoing edges from the graph.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient data structures: The 'next' vector is used as a stack where elements are added to the end and removed from the end. This is inefficient because erasing the last element in a vector requires rearranging all the other elements. A more efficient alternative is to use a stack or deque which supports efficient addition and removal of elements at the end.

2. Redundant computations: The 'flag' variable is set to true whenever 'next' has more than one element. However, this is redundant as the flag can be set to true as soon as 'next' has more than one element for the first time. Moreover, the flag is not used anywhere else in the code apart from the end, for printing, so its computation can be moved there.

3. Loops or recursive calls: The loop where 'tar' is assigned the value of the last element in 'next' can be optimized by using a stack or deque instead of a vector, as mentioned above.

4. Compiler optimizations: The compiler can be hinted to unroll loops where the number of iterations is fixed and small, such as the loop where 'i' ranges from 0 to 'n'. However, in this case, 'n' is not a compile-time constant, so loop unrolling may not be applicable.

5. Memory usage: Using an array instead of a vector for 'ans' can reduce memory usage as the size of 'ans' is known to be 'n'.

Optimization Steps:
1. Replace 'next' vector with a stack: This will avoid the need to erase the last element from a vector, which is an expensive operation. A stack is a more appropriate data structure for this use-case.
2. Compute 'flag' at the end: Move the computation of 'flag' to the end of the program where it is used. This avoids unnecessary computation of 'flag' during each iteration of the loop.
3. Use an array for 'ans': Since the size of 'ans' is known to be 'n', an array can be used instead of a vector. This reduces memory usage.

Trade-offs:
The trade-off in this optimization is the increased complexity due to the use of a stack instead of a vector. However, this is justified by the significant improvement in performance.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;
#define FOR(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
#define REP(i, n) FOR(i, 0, n)
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
int n, m;
vector<int> edge[5000];
int cnt[5000];
int main() {
  cin >> n >> m;
  REP(i, m) {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    a--;
    b--;
    edge[a].push_back(b);
    cnt[b]++;
  }
  int ans[5000];
  stack<int> next;
  REP(i, n) if (cnt[i] == 0) next.push(i);
  REP(i, n) {
    int tar = next.top();
    ans[i] = tar + 1;
    next.pop();
    REP(j, edge[tar].size()) {
      int to = edge[tar][j];
      if (--cnt[to] == 0)
        next.push(to);
    }
  }
  REP(i, n) printf("%d\n", ans[i]);
  if (next.size() > 1)
    puts("1");
  else
    puts("0");
  return 0;
}
