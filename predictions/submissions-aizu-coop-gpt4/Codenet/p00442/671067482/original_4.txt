The given code is solving a topological sort problem on a directed graph. The program first reads the graph from the input, then it uses the Kahn's algorithm to find a topological order of vertices. The order is then printed to the output. At the end, it outputs '1' if there is more than one topological sort order, otherwise it outputs '0'.

The program has some spots where it can be optimized:

1. It uses `vector<int> next` to maintain vertices with no incoming edges. This is inefficient because removing an element from the end of a vector is an O(1) operation, but the size of this vector is checked in every iteration which results in O(n) complexity. A better data structure to use here would be `deque<int>`, which supports fast front and back insertion and removal.

2. It uses the `vector<int> ans` to store the topological order, and then it prints the order. This is not necessary as we can print the order directly in each iteration without storing it.

3. It uses the `scanf` to read the graph edges which is slower than `cin` for small inputs. Since `cin` and `cout` are used already in the program, it's better to use `cin` for consistency and potentially better performance.

4. It checks the flag at the end to determine if there is more than one topological order. But this flag is not correctly set in the loop. It should be set if we have more than one vertex with no incoming edges at any iteration.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>
using namespace std;
#define FOR(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
#define REP(i, n) FOR(i, 0, n)
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
int n, m;
vector<int> edge[5000];
int cnt[5000];
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // to improve the performance of cin
  cin.tie(NULL); // to untie cin and cout
  cin >> n >> m;
  REP(i, m) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    a--;
    b--;
    edge[a].push_back(b);
    cnt[b]++;
  }
  bool flag = false;
  deque<int> next;
  REP(i, n) if (cnt[i] == 0) next.push_back(i);
  REP(i, n) {
    int tar = next.back();
    next.pop_back();
    printf("%d\n", tar + 1);
    if (next.size() > 1)
      flag = true;
    REP(j, edge[tar].size()) {
      int to = edge[tar][j];
      if (--cnt[to] == 0)
        next.push_back(to);
    }
  }
  if (flag)
    puts("1");
  else
    puts("0");
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code is more efficient due to the use of `deque` instead of `vector` for storing vertices with no incoming edges. It also saves memory by not storing the topological order in a separate vector. It also fixes the bug with the flag checking for the existence of multiple topological orders.
