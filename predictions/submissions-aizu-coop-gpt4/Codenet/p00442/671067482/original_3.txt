After analyzing the code, we can propose several optimizations:

1. Code Analysis:
    - The code reads a graph from the input, where `n` is the number of vertices, `m` is the number of edges, and each of the following `m` lines represents an edge from `a` to `b`.
    - Each vertex `b` reachable from vertex `a` is stored in `edge[a]`, and the in-degree of each vertex `b` is stored in `cnt[b]`.
    - The code then performs a topological sort on the graph.
    - If a cycle is detected during the topological sort, the flag is set to true.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - Use `std::deque` instead of `std::vector` for the `next` variable. This is because `std::deque` provides an efficient way to remove elements from the front, while `std::vector` does not.
    - Remove the flag variable and instead check whether a cycle occurred by comparing the size of `ans` to `n` after the topological sort.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    - Replace `std::vector<int> next;` with `std::deque<int> next;`. This changes the data structure of `next` to a double-ended queue, which allows efficient removal of elements from the front. This is used to efficiently get and remove the next vertex with an in-degree of 0 during the topological sort.
    - Replace `int tar = next[next.size() - 1];` with `int tar = next.front();` and `next.erase(next.end() - 1);` with `next.pop_front();`. These changes use the efficient removal of elements from the front provided by `std::deque`.
    - Remove `bool flag = false;` and `if (next.size() > 0) flag = true;`. These lines are unnecessary because we can check whether a cycle occurred by comparing the size of `ans` to `n` after the topological sort.
    - Replace `if (flag) puts("1"); else puts("0");` with `if (ans.size() < n) puts("1"); else puts("0");`. This checks whether a cycle occurred by comparing the size of `ans` to `n` after the topological sort.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <deque>
using namespace std;
#define FOR(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
#define REP(i, n) FOR(i, 0, n)
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
int n, m;
vector<int> edge[5000];
int cnt[5000];
int main() {
  cin >> n >> m;
  REP(i, m) {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    a--;
    b--;
    edge[a].push_back(b);
    cnt[b]++;
  }
  vector<int> ans;
  deque<int> next;
  REP(i, n) if (cnt[i] == 0) next.push_back(i);
  while (!next.empty()) {
    int tar = next.front();
    next.pop_front();
    ans.push_back(tar + 1);
    REP(j, edge[tar].size()) {
      int to = edge[tar][j];
      if (--cnt[to] == 0)
        next.push_back(to);
    }
  }
  REP(i, ans.size()) printf("%d\n", ans[i]);
  if (ans.size() < n)
    puts("1");
  else
    puts("0");
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code maintains the functionality of the original code and improves its efficiency by using a more suitable data structure and removing unnecessary operations.
