This program is implementing the Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting. It reads data from the standard input to form a directed graph and then outputs a topological sort of the graph if it exists.

The primary performance bottlenecks are:
1. The use of `vector<int> next` for storing vertices with no incoming edge. It's inefficient because elements are always removed from the end, and new elements are added to the end. This can be improved using a more efficient data structure like a queue or deque which has O(1) time complexity for add and remove operations.
2. The use of `scanf` and `printf` for input and output. Although these functions are generally faster than `cin` and `cout`, they are still slower than using direct system calls like `read` and `write`.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace `vector<int> next` with `queue<int> next` to improve time complexity of add and remove operations to O(1).
2. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `read` and `write` to speed up input and output operations.
3. Since we are using `queue<int> next`, we do not need to keep checking `if (next.size() > 0)` to set the flag. We can set the flag once we add any node to the queue after the first node.
4. We can avoid using `REP(i, ans.size())` for printing the answer. Instead, we can print the node as soon as it is processed.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unistd.h>
using namespace std;
#define FOR(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
#define REP(i, n) FOR(i, 0, n)
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
int n, m;
vector<int> edge[5000];
int cnt[5000];
int main() {
  read(0, &n, sizeof(n));
  read(0, &m, sizeof(m));
  REP(i, m) {
    int a, b;
    read(0, &a, sizeof(a));
    read(0, &b, sizeof(b));
    a--;
    b--;
    edge[a].push_back(b);
    cnt[b]++;
  }
  queue<int> next;
  REP(i, n) if (cnt[i] == 0) next.push(i);
  bool flag = false;
  REP(i, n) {
    int tar = next.front();
    next.pop();
    char buffer[10];
    sprintf(buffer, "%d\n", tar + 1);
    write(1, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    if (!next.empty())
      flag = true;
    REP(j, edge[tar].size()) {
      int to = edge[tar][j];
      if (--cnt[to] == 0)
        next.push(to);
    }
  }
  if (flag)
    write(1, "1\n", 2);
  else
    write(1, "0\n", 2);
  return 0;
}
```

It's worth noting that using direct system calls like `read` and `write` can be less flexible and more error-prone than using standard library functions like `scanf` and `printf`. However, in this case, it can provide a significant speedup.
