**Code Analysis:**

The given code seems to implement a topological sorting algorithm on a directed graph. The nodes with zero incoming edges are added to the 'next' vector, and then removed one by one as they are processed. Every time a node is processed, it is added to the 'ans' vector and all nodes it points to have their incoming edge count reduced.

**Potential Bottlenecks:**

1. The use of `next.erase(next.end() - 1);`. Erasing the last element of a vector is expensive as it requires shifting all other elements.

2. The use of `vector<int> ans;`. The size of vector 'ans' is known beforehand (it is 'n'), hence we can avoid dynamic resizing of the vector which is expensive.

3. The use of `scanf` and `printf` mixed with `cin` and `cout` in the same program can cause synchronization issues and slow down the program.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. Replace `next.erase(next.end() - 1);` with an index that keeps track of the next node to be processed. This will allow us to avoid the expensive erase operation.

2. Preallocate the size of the 'ans' vector to avoid dynamic resizing.

3. Use only `scanf` and `printf` for input/output operations to avoid synchronization overhead.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define FOR(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
#define REP(i, n) FOR(i, 0, n)
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
int n, m;
vector<int> edge[5000];
int cnt[5000];
int main() {
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  REP(i, m) {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    a--;
    b--;
    edge[a].push_back(b);
    cnt[b]++;
  }
  vector<int> ans(n); // preallocate size
  bool flag = false;
  vector<int> next;
  REP(i, n) if (cnt[i] == 0) next.push_back(i);
  int index = 0; // keep track of next node to be processed
  REP(i, n) {
    int tar = next[index++]; // use index to get next node
    ans[i] = tar + 1;
    if (index < next.size())
      flag = true;
    REP(j, edge[tar].size()) {
      int to = edge[tar][j];
      if (--cnt[to] == 0)
        next.push_back(to);
    }
  }
  REP(i, ans.size()) printf("%d\n", ans[i]);
  if (flag)
    puts("1");
  else
    puts("0");
  return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. We replaced `next.erase(next.end() - 1);` with an index 'index' that keeps track of the next node to be processed. This avoids the expensive erase operation and improves performance.

2. We preallocated the size of the 'ans' vector to 'n' to avoid dynamic resizing, which can be expensive.

3. We replaced all `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` to avoid the synchronization overhead that occurs when these two types of I/O functions are mixed in the same program. This can provide a significant speedup in cases where a lot of I/O operations are performed.

**Trade-offs:**

The optimized code is a bit more complex due to the use of the 'index' variable. However, the performance gains from the optimizations are likely to outweigh this slight increase in complexity.
