Code Analysis:
The program appears to be implementing the Kahn's algorithm for Topological Sorting. The main computation is done in the for loop where the nodes with no incoming edges are added to the 'next' vector and removed when processed. For each removed node, all the nodes it points to have their incoming edge count decreased and are added to 'next' vector if they have no more incoming edges. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The 'next' vector is used as a stack where elements are added to the end and removed from the end. However, each removal operation requires shifting all elements. A more efficient data structure would be a deque, which allows constant time insertion and removal from both its ends.

2. Redundant Computations: The size of 'next' vector is computed multiple times, even when it's not necessary. This can be avoided by using the empty() function instead of size() > 0, and by storing the size before the removal operation.

3. Loop Optimizations: The inner loop iterating over the edges can be made more efficient using C++11 range-based for loop, which simplifies the syntax and potentially improves performance by allowing the compiler to optimize the iteration.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Using fast I/O functions such as getchar_unlocked(), putchar_unlocked() instead of scanf(), printf() could significantly improve the speed of I/O operations.

Step-by-step Explanation:

1. Use deque instead of vector for 'next'. This would allow constant time insertion and removal from the ends, improving performance.

2. Use empty() function instead of size() > 0 for checking if 'next' is empty. This avoids unnecessary computation of size.

3. Use range-based for loop for iterating over the edges. This simplifies the syntax and can potentially improve performance by allowing the compiler to better optimize the loop.

4. Use fast I/O functions such as getchar_unlocked(), putchar_unlocked() instead of scanf(), printf() for faster I/O operations. This could greatly improve performance for large inputs.

    ans.push_back(tar + 1);
    next.pop_back();
    flag = !next.empty();
    
    for (int to : edge[tar]) {
      if (--cnt[to] == 0)
        next.push_back(to);
    }
  }
  
  for (int i : ans) printf("%d\n", i);
  
  puts(flag ? "1" : "0");
