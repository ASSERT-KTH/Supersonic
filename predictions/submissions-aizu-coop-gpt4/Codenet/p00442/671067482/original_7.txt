This C++ program implements the Kahn's algorithm for Topological sorting. The optimization of this program can be carried out in the following stages:

**1. Code Analysis:**

The program reads a graph's edges, builds an adjacency list, increments a counter for each node to which an edge is directed, and then uses Kahn's algorithm to perform topological sorting. There are a few areas where this program could be optimized:

- The use of `vector<int> next;` to keep track of the nodes with no incoming edges is inefficient. A more efficient data structure would be a queue.
- The use of `next.erase(next.end() - 1);` is inefficient as it takes O(n) time to erase the last element. If we change `next` to be a queue, we can use `pop()` which operates in constant time.
- The `vector<int> ans;` can be removed and replaced with direct printing of the result. This will reduce memory usage.

**2. Optimization Strategy:**

A. Switch `vector<int> next;` to `queue<int> next;`

B. Replace `next.erase(next.end() - 1);` with `next.pop();`

C. Remove `vector<int> ans;` and print results directly.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

A. By changing `vector<int> next;` to `queue<int> next;` we can take advantage of the queue's FIFO property and avoid the time complexity of erasing the last element in a vector.

B. We replace `next.erase(next.end() - 1);` with `next.pop();` to reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(1).

C. By removing `vector<int> ans;` and printing results directly, we reduce memory usage as we don't have to store the sorted elements.

**4. Optimized Code Block:**
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;
#define FOR(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
#define REP(i, n) FOR(i, 0, n)
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
int n, m;
vector<int> edge[5000];
int cnt[5000];

int main() {
  cin >> n >> m;
  REP(i, m) {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    a--;
    b--;
    edge[a].push_back(b);
    cnt[b]++;
  }

  bool flag = false;
  queue<int> next;
  REP(i, n) if (cnt[i] == 0) next.push(i);
  REP(i, n) {
    int tar = next.front();
    next.pop();
    printf("%d\n", tar + 1);
    if (!next.empty())
      flag = true;
    REP(j, edge[tar].size()) {
      int to = edge[tar][j];
      if (--cnt[to] == 0)
        next.push(to);
    }
  }
  
  if (flag)
    puts("1");
  else
    puts("0");
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code maintains the functionality of the original program but operates more efficiently.
