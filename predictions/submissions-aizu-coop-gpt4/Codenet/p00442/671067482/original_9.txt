Analysis:
This C++ program performs a topological sort on a directed graph. The graph is represented by an adjacency list (the `edge` array of vectors), and it has `n` vertices and `m` edges. There are some inefficient parts in the code that we can optimize:

1. The `next` vector is being used as a stack, where elements are inserted at the end and removed from the end. However, `next.erase(next.end()-1)` is an O(n) operation, which can be replaced with a constant-time operation.
2. The `flag` variable is set to true if `next.size() > 0` after the current vertex is removed. This is unnecessary as we are already checking `next.size()` in the `if` condition, and we can simply set `flag` to true right before we remove an element.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use `next` as a stack instead of a vector.
2. Move the `flag` update inside the `if` condition for checking `next.size() > 0`.

Step 1: Use `next` as a stack instead of a vector.
Rationale: Removing the last element of a vector is an O(n) operation, where n is the number of elements. If we use a stack, removing the last element becomes an O(1) operation, which is more efficient.
Trade-off: Slightly more complex code due to the use of an additional data structure.

Step 2: Move the `flag` update inside the `if` condition for checking `next.size() > 0`.
Rationale: Avoiding unnecessary operations can improve performance.
Trade-off: No significant trade-offs.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;
#define FOR(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
#define REP(i, n) FOR(i, 0, n)
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
int n, m;
vector<int> edge[5000];
int cnt[5000];
int main() {
  cin >> n >> m;
  REP(i, m) {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    a--;
    b--;
    edge[a].push_back(b);
    cnt[b]++;
  }
  vector<int> ans;
  bool flag = false;
  stack<int> next;  // Change next to stack
  REP(i, n) if (cnt[i] == 0) next.push(i);
  REP(i, n) {
    int tar = next.top();  // use top() instead of next[next.size() - 1]
    ans.push_back(tar + 1);
    next.pop();  // use pop() instead of next.erase(next.end() - 1)
    if (!next.empty())  // use empty() instead of next.size() > 0
      flag = true;  // move flag update inside if condition
    REP(j, edge[tar].size()) {
      int to = edge[tar][j];
      if (--cnt[to] == 0)
        next.push(to);
    }
  }
  REP(i, ans.size()) printf("%d\n", ans[i]);
  if (flag)
    puts("1");
  else
    puts("0");
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized code now uses `stack` for `next`, and uses `top()` and `pop()` for accessing and removing the last element, respectively. The `flag` variable is updated inside the `if` condition for checking `next` is not empty.
