After analyzing the provided code, it seems like this is a C++ program that performs topological sorting on a directed graph and checks if the sorted order of nodes is a valid topological order or not. Here are the primary optimization points:

1. Code uses `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a lot of unnecessary libraries leading to increased compilation time. We should only include the libraries that we need.

2. The code uses `#define` directives for simple operations, which makes the code harder to read and does not provide any significant optimization. We should replace these with inline functions or use the operations directly.

3. The code uses `long long` for all int variables, which can use more memory than necessary. It would be better to use `int` where possible and only use `long long` where larger values are needed.

4. The code uses a `map` data structure to check if an edge exists between two nodes. This can be inefficient as map operations have a complexity of O(log n). We can use an adjacency matrix instead, which would allow us to check the existence of an edge in O(1) time.

5. The `tsort` function uses a `stack` and a `vector` to store the sorted order of nodes. We can optimize this by only using a `vector`.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cstdio>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

typedef pair<int, int> P;

const int inf = 1e9 + 7;
const int INF = 1e18 + 7;

class t_sort {
public:
  int n;
  vector<int> ans, deg;
  vector<vector<int>> G;
  void init(int N) {
    n = N;
    deg.resize(n);
    G.resize(n);
  }
  void add_edge(int from, int to) {
    G[from].push_back(to);
    deg[to]++;
  }
  void tsort() {
    queue<int> q;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) if (deg[i] == 0) q.push(i);
    while (!q.empty()) {
      int v = q.front();
      q.pop();
      ans.push_back(v);
      for (int i = 0; i < G[v].size(); i++) if (--deg[G[v][i]] == 0) q.push(G[v][i]);
    }
  }
};

vector<vector<bool>> adjMatrix;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
  t_sort t;
  t.init(n);
  adjMatrix.resize(n, vector<bool>(n, false));
  for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int x, y;
    scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);
    x--;
    y--;
    t.add_edge(x, y);
    adjMatrix[x][y] = true;
  }
  t.tsort();
  vector<int> ans = t.ans;
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) printf("%d\n", ans[i] + 1);
  int res = 1;
  for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if (adjMatrix[ans[i]][ans[i + 1]] == false)
      res = 0;
  }
  printf("%d\n", res == 1 ? 0 : 1);
  return 0;
}
```
This code still performs the same task as before, but optimizes memory usage and performance by using appropriate data types, simplifying operations, and choosing better data structures.
