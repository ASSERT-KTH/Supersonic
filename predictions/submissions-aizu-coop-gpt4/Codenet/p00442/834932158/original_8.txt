Analyzing this code, it is a C++ program that implements a topological sort on a directed graph. The code accepts a set of edges as input and outputs the vertices in topologically sorted order, followed by an integer "0" if the given sequence is a topological sort order and "1" otherwise. 

Here are several points for optimization:

1. Unnecessary use of `std::map` to store edges: The time complexity of accessing an element in a `std::map` is O(log n), which can be costly if there are many edges. Alternatively, we can use an adjacency matrix or adjacency list if the graph is sparse. 

2. The function `tsort()` uses a `std::stack` to store vertices with no incoming edges. We can consider using a `std::queue` to achieve the same effect with potentially less overhead.

3. The use of `long long` for most variables may be unnecessary and could slightly increase memory usage and computation time. If the inputs are guaranteed to be within the range of `int`, it would be better to use `int`.

4. The code uses `std::vector::push_back` frequently, which can cause performance issues if the vector needs to resize often. It would be better to reserve space for the vector in advance if the size is known.

5. The macro definitions at the beginning of the code can be confusing and obfuscate the code's functionality. Replacing these with standard C++ syntax can make the code easier to read and understand.

6. The input is read using `scanf()`, which is slower compared to `std::cin`.

Optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 1e5 + 7;
vector<int> G[MAX_N];
vector<int> ans;
int deg[MAX_N];
bool edge[MAX_N][MAX_N];

void add_edge(int from, int to) {
    G[from].push_back(to);
    deg[to]++;
}

void tsort(int n) {
    queue<int> q;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) if (deg[i] == 0) q.push(i);
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int v = q.front();
        q.pop();
        ans.push_back(v);
        for(int i = 0; i < G[v].size(); i++) if (--deg[G[v][i]] == 0) q.push(G[v][i]);
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int x, y;
        cin >> x >> y;
        x--; y--;
        add_edge(x, y);
        edge[x][y] = 1;
    }

    tsort(n);

    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) cout << ans[i] + 1 << '\n';

    int res = 1;
    for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (edge[ans[i]][ans[i + 1]] == 0)
            res = 0;
    }
    cout << (res == 1 ? 0 : 1) << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, I have replaced the `std::map` with an adjacency matrix `edge[][]` for faster access times. The `std::stack` in `tsort()` is replaced with a `std::queue` for potentially less overhead. I have also replaced the `long long` variables with `int` where possible to reduce memory usage and computation time.

For easier readability, I have replaced the macro definitions with standard C++ syntax. Input is now read using `std::cin` with synchronization disabled for faster input. 

Finally, I have replaced the class `t_sort` with a set of standalone functions, which makes the code easier to understand and less complex. The `std::vector` `ans` and `deg` are now global variables, which removes the need to pass them around as function parameters.
