1. **Code Analysis**:

This code implements a topological sort on a directed graph using a depth-first search algorithm. The graph is represented by a set of edges stored in the `t_sort` class and a map `mp`. The code reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` from the input, initializes the graph, and adds edges by reading pairs of vertices. After performing the topological sort, the code checks if the resulting order is a valid topological order by checking if every consecutive pair of vertices in the order forms an edge in the original graph.

2. **Optimization Strategy**:

The code is already quite optimized, but there are a few areas where we can improve:

    2.1 **Using vector instead of map**: The map `mp` is used to store edges and later check their existence. Checking for existence in a map is an O(log n) operation. This can be optimized by using a 2D vector, which allows for O(1) access.

    2.2 **Removing unnecessary operations**: The code checks if the order of vertices is a valid topological order. This is unnecessary because the algorithm implemented guarantees a valid topological sort if one exists.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:

    3.1 **Using vector instead of map**: We replace the map `mp` by a 2D vector `edge`. This vector has `n` rows and `n` columns, and `edge[i][j]` is `true` if and only if there is an edge from `i` to `j`. To initialize `edge`, we replace `mp[P(x, y)] = 1;` by `edge[x][y] = true;`. To check the existence of an edge, we replace `mp[P(ans[i], ans[i + 1])] == 0` by `!edge[ans[i]][ans[i + 1]]`.

    3.2 **Removing unnecessary operations**: We remove the loop that checks if the order of vertices is a valid topological order. This operation is unnecessary because the algorithm implemented guarantees a valid topological order if one exists. This also allows us to remove the variable `res`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define repi(i, m, n) for (int i = m; i < n; i++)
#define rep(i, n) repi(i, 0, n)
#define pb(x) push_back(x)
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<vi> vvi;
const int inf = 1e9 + 7;
const int INF = 1e18 + 7;

class t_sort {
public:
  int n;
  vi ans, deg;
  vvi G;
  void init(int N) {
    n = N;
    deg.resize(n);
    G.resize(n);
  }
  void add_edge(int from, int to) {
    G[from].pb(to);
    deg[to]++;
  }
  void tsort() {
    stack<int> st;
    rep(i, n) if (deg[i] == 0) st.push(i);
    while (!st.empty()) {
      int v = st.top();
      st.pop();
      ans.pb(v);
      rep(i, G[v].size()) if (--deg[G[v][i]] == 0) st.push(G[v][i]);
    }
  }
};

signed main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%lld%lld", &n, &m);
  t_sort t;
  t.init(n);
  vvi edge(n, vi(n, false));
  rep(i, m) {
    int x, y;
    scanf("%lld%lld", &x, &y);
    x--; y--;
    t.add_edge(x, y);
    edge[x][y] = true;
  }
  t.tsort();
  vi ans = t.ans;
  rep(i, n) printf("%lld\n", ans[i] + 1);
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the code should be more efficient because it replaces a map by a vector and eliminates an unnecessary operation.
