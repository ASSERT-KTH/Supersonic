Code Analysis:
The given code is for a directed graph where each node is topologically sorted. The code checks if the sorted nodes form a directed path in the graph. The topological sort is implemented using a stack. The code is using a map to store the edges of the graph and uses a vector to store the sorted nodes. The code has a lot of macros and typedefs that might confuse the reader.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: The map data structure is not the best choice here since we are only storing edges of the graph. A 2D vector can be used instead of the map which would be more efficient in terms of memory usage and access time.

2. Redundant Computations: The code is checking if an edge exists from node i to node i+1 for all nodes in the topologically sorted list. This is a redundant computation since it's already guaranteed by the topological sort.

3. Loop Optimization: The loop used in the tsort() method for reducing the degree of each node can be optimized by using an iterator instead of accessing each element by its index.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The code can be optimized further by using compiler optimizations like -O2 which performs most of the optimization that doesn't involve a space-speed tradeoff.

Step-by-step Explanation:

1. Replace the map with a 2D vector:
    Rationale: The map data structure is not required here. It's more efficient to use a 2D vector to store the edges of the graph, both in terms of memory usage and access time. 
    Trade-off: The code will be slightly more complex, but the performance improvement is worth it.

2. Remove redundant computation:
    Rationale: The check if an edge exists from node i to node i+1 for all nodes in the topologically sorted list is redundant, as this is already guaranteed by the topological sort.
    Trade-off: None, as this is a redundant computation.

3. Optimize the loop in tsort():
    Rationale: Accessing each element by its index in a vector is slower than using an iterator. This loop can be optimized by using an iterator instead.
    Trade-off: The code will be slightly more complex, but the performance improvement is worth it.

4. Use compiler optimization:
    Rationale: Using compiler optimization like -O2 will perform most of the optimization that doesn't involve a space-speed tradeoff.
    Trade-off: None, as this optimization doesn't affect the code.

Optimized Code:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

typedef vector<int> vi;

// Topological sort class
class t_sort {
public:
  int n;
  vi ans, deg;
  vector<vi> G, edges;
  
  void init(int N) {
    n = N;
    deg.resize(n);
    G.resize(n);
    edges.resize(n, vi(n));
  }
  
  void add_edge(int from, int to) {
    G[from].push_back(to);
    deg[to]++;
    edges[from][to] = 1;
  }
  
  void tsort() {
    stack<int> st;
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) if (deg[i] == 0) st.push(i);
    while (!st.empty()) {
      int v = st.top();
      st.pop();
      ans.push_back(v);
      for(auto it = G[v].begin(); it != G[v].end(); it++) {
        if (--deg[*it] == 0) st.push(*it);
      }
    }
  }
};

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  int n, m;
  cin>>n>>m;
  
  t_sort t;
  t.init(n);
  
  for(int i=0; i<m; i++) {
    int x, y;
    cin>>x>>y;
    x--; y--;
    t.add_edge(x, y);
  }
  
  t.tsort();
  
  for(int i=0; i<n; i++) cout<<(t.ans[i] + 1)<<"\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```

This code will work faster due to the optimizations mentioned above.
