1. Code Analysis:
   The provided code is a C++ program that performs topological sorting on a directed graph. The code uses a depth-first search algorithm to find a linear ordering of vertices in the graph. It reads a series of edges from the standard input, adds them to the graph, performs the sorting, and then prints the result. It also checks if the resulting order of vertices is a valid topological sorting and prints a boolean result.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   A. Reducing unnecessary computations:
       - The map mp is being used to check if an edge exists between two vertices. However, this information is already present in the adjacency list G. We can avoid using the map and look up the adjacency list instead.
   
   B. Optimizing data structures:
       - The adjacency list is implemented as a std::vector of vectors. If the graph is sparse, this can lead to a lot of wasted space. An alternative could be to use a std::vector of std::list or std::vector of std::set.
       - The map mp is a heavy data structure with a relatively high overhead. This overhead can be reduced by using a more lightweight data structure, such as a std::unordered_map or even a std::vector, if the range of the keys is known and limited.

   C. Compiler optimizations:
       - The code can benefit from compiler optimizations such as -O2 or -O3 which perform loop unrolling, function inlining and other optimizations.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   A. Reducing unnecessary computations:
       - Remove the map mp and use the adjacency list G to check if an edge exists between two nodes. This reduces the space complexity and the time complexity of the operation since looking up the adjacency list is faster than map lookup.

   B. Optimizing data structures:
       - Change the adjacency list from a vector of vectors to a vector of lists. This saves space if the graph is sparse.
       - Change the map mp to an unordered_map or a vector. This reduces the overhead of the map which can improve the speed of the program.
       
   C. Compiler optimizations:
       - Add compiler flags like -O2 or -O3 to enable compiler optimizations. These can significantly speed up the execution of the program.

#define rep(i, n) repi(i, 0, n)

    rep(i, n) if (deg[i] == 0) st.push(i);
    while (!st.empty()) {
      int v = st.top();
      st.pop();
      ans.push_back(v);
      for (int i : G[v]) if (--deg[i] == 0) st.push(i);  // simpler loop syntax
    }
  }
};
signed main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);  // additional speedup
  cin.tie(0);
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  t_sort t;
  t.init(n);
  rep(i, m) {
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    x--;
    y--;
    t.add_edge(x, y);
  }
  t.tsort();
  vector<int> ans = t.ans;
  rep(i, n) cout << ans[i] + 1 << '\n';
  int res = 1;
  rep(i, n - 1) {
    // check if ans[i + 1] is in the adjacency list of ans[i]
    if (find(t.G[ans[i]].begin(), t.G[ans[i]].end(), ans[i + 1]) == t.G[ans[i]].end())
      res = 0;
  }
  cout << (res == 1 ? 0 : 1) << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
Note: Be aware of potential trade-offs. While the optimized code can be faster and use less memory, it might be slightly more complex due to the usage of std::list and std::find. Furthermore, adding compiler optimization flags might make debugging harder as the compiled code can be significantly different from the source code.
