Code Analysis:

The above code seems to implement a variant of the min-cost max-flow algorithm on a graph to solve a scheduling problem. It's difficult to pin down exact bottlenecks without profiling the code on a given dataset, but there are a few areas in the code where potential optimization opportunities can be identified.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: In this code, the map data structure is used. Map is certainly useful when you need to access elements by key, but in scenarios where the keys are integers and are not sparse, array or vector can be a better option in terms of performance. Arrays or vectors provide O(1) access time compared to O(log n) in map. The f[i][0] and f[i][1] can be replaced with 2D vectors if the keys are not sparse.

2. Redundant Computations: The same computation is performed repeatedly inside the loop in the `augment` function. The expression `e.capa - e.flow` is used twice in the loop. It can be computed once and stored in a temporary variable to remove the redundancy.

3. Loops and Recursive Calls: There is a nested loop in the `augment` function, where the inner loop traverses through all the edges of a vertex. It seems difficult to further optimize this part without altering the algorithm. 

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler options such as -O2 or -O3 can be used to enable a series of optimizations at the compilation level.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replacing map with vector: This is an improvement because vectors offer constant time access and can be faster than maps when the keys are integers and are not sparse. The trade-off here is that vectors use more memory when the keys are sparse. 

2. Removal of Redundant Computations: By storing the result of `e.capa - e.flow` in a temporary variable, we can avoid calculating it twice. This change will speed up the code execution. The trade-off here is a slight increase in memory usage.

3. Compiler Optimizations: Using compiler optimization flags such as -O2 or -O3 enables a series of optimizations at the compilation level, such as loop unrolling, function inlining, etc., which can help improve the performance of the program. The trade-off is that the debug information can be lost and it becomes difficult to debug optimized code.

Optimized Code Block:

```
// The rest of the code remains the same

template <class T, class U>
pair<T, U> augment(int n, vector<edge<T, U>> *G, int s, int t, U *pot) {
  // The rest of the code remains the same
  while (!Q.empty()) {
    // The rest of the code remains the same
    rep(i, G[u].size()) {
      edge<T, U> &e = G[u][i];
      T capacity_remaining = e.capa - e.flow; // Store the result in a temporary variable
      U cost2 = cost + e.cost + pot[u] - pot[e.v];
      if (capacity_remaining > 0 && cost2 < d[e.v]) { // Use the stored result
        d[e.v] = cost2;
        pre[e.v] = e.rev;
        Q.push(make_pair(-cost2, e.v));
      }
    }
  }
  // The rest of the code remains the same
}

// The rest of the code remains the same

```

Note: The code is assuming that the keys of the map are not sparse. If the keys are sparse, then using a map would be a better choice. Also, ensure to compile the program with optimization flags such as -O2 or -O3 to enable compiler-level optimizations.
