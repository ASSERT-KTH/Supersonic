This program implements a solution for a train scheduling problem using the Primal-Dual method for minimum-cost maximum-flow problems. That being said, there are several areas where the program can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Avoid Unnecessary Copying of Objects: Functions like `augment` and `primal_dual` accept the graph G, a vector of edge structures, as a pointer. Instead, consider passing these by reference to avoid unnecessary copying of objects.

2. Use Arrays Instead of Maps for Fixed-Size Data: The `f` object is a 2D map array which is used to store the vertices of the graph. Since the size of the array is known in advance (100x2), consider replacing this map array with a fixed-size 2D array. This can potentially reduce the overhead incurred due to map operations.

3. Avoid Unnecessary Computations: The program is repeatedly using the operation `e.capa - e.flow` in the `augment` function. Instead of computing this every time, consider storing the result in a variable and reusing it.

4. Avoid Frequent Memory Allocation and Deallocation: The resize function is used multiple times in the code. Instead of frequently resizing the vectors, consider reserving an upper limit of memory for the vectors using the reserve function.

5. Optimize Recursion and Loops: In the `augment` function, there's a while loop that could be optimized by using a 'break' statement as soon as the target node is found instead of traversing the entire graph.

Optimized Code Block:

Here is an optimized version of the code considering the above optimization strategies:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (n); i++)
using namespace std;
const int V_MAX = 6000;
const int CAPA_INF = 1 << 29;
const int COST_INF = 1 << 29;
template <class T, class U> struct edge {
  int v, rev;
  T capa;
  U cost;
  T flow;
};
template <class T, class U>
void add_directed_edge(vector<edge<T, U>> *G, int u, int v, T capa, U cost) {
  G[u].push_back((edge<T, U>){v, G[v].size(), capa, cost, 0});
  G[v].push_back((edge<T, U>){u, G[u].size() - 1, 0, -cost, 0});
}
template <class T, class U>
pair<T, U> augment(int n, vector<edge<T, U>> &G, int s, int t, U *pot) {
  static int pre[V_MAX];
  static U d[V_MAX];
  rep(u, n) d[u] = (u == s ? 0 : COST_INF);
  bool ok = false;
  priority_queue<pair<U, int>> Q;
  Q.push(make_pair(0, s));
  while (!Q.empty()) {
    int u = Q.top().second;
    U cost = -Q.top().first;
    Q.pop();
    if (cost < d[u])
      continue;
    if (u == t)
      ok = true;
    break; // Break as soon as target node is reached
    rep(i, G[u].size()) {
      edge<T, U> &e = G[u][i];
      U cost2 = cost + e.cost + pot[u] - pot[e.v];
      T flowCapaDiff = e.capa - e.flow; // Avoid repeated computation
      if (flowCapaDiff > 0 && cost2 < d[e.v]) {
        d[e.v] = cost2;
        pre[e.v] = e.rev;
        Q.push(make_pair(-cost2, e.v));
      }
    }
  }
  // Remaining augment function code...
}
template <class T, class U>
pair<T, U> primal_dual(int n, vector<edge<T, U>> &G, int s, int t) {
  // Remaining primal_dual function code...
}
struct train {
  int t1, t2, cost;
};
int main() {
  // Replaced map with a fixed-size 2D array for 'f' object
  int f[100][2][100];
  for (int n; scanf("%d", &n), n;) {
    vector<train> T[99];
    rep(i, n - 1) {
      int m;
      scanf("%d", &m);
      T[i].reserve(m); // Reserve memory instead of resizing
      // Remaining main function code...
    }
    // Remaining main function code...
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this optimization is mostly theoretical, and the actual performance gain may vary depending on the specific compiler, hardware, and input data used.
