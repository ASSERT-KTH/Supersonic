The provided code is a simple C++ program that prints out the multiplication table from 1x1 to 9x9. It's a straightforward program that uses two nested loops to perform the task. However, there are a few potential areas for performance optimization:

1. Redundant console output calls: In the current implementation, `cout` is used four times per iteration to print each part of the multiplication statement. This could be optimized by combining these into a single `cout` call, which will reduce the overhead of calling `cout` multiple times.

2. Use of endl: The `endl` manipulator not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output buffer. In this code, the buffer is flushed on every iteration of the inner loop, which is unnecessary and can slow down the program. We can replace `endl` with `'\n'` which will just insert a newline without flushing the buffer.

Here's how we can implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << '\n';
    }
  }
  cout << flush; // flush the output buffer after all print operations are done
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code does exactly the same thing as the original one, but it does so more efficiently by minimizing the number of `cout` calls and avoiding unnecessary output buffer flushes. This will result in a faster program execution, especially when dealing with larger multiplication tables. 

The trade-off here is minimal. The code complexity remains the same, and there is no loss in readability or functionality. By reducing the number of calls to `cout` and removing the extra buffer flushes, the program becomes more efficient without sacrificing anything.
