Code Analysis:
The given program is a simple C++ code that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. There are no major performance bottlenecks, inefficient memory usage, or unnecessary computations in the given code since it is a straightforward nested loop structure. However, there are minor optimizations that we could apply to slightly improve the performance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Reduce the number of std::cout operations: Each std::cout operation can be quite costly in terms of performance. Here each inner loop operation involves four cout calls. We can reduce this to a single std::cout operation per loop iteration by concatenating the output string.

2. Use '\n' instead of endl: The std::endl not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output stream buffer, which can slow down the program. If we don't need to flush the buffer immediately, we can replace endl with '\n'.

Optimization Steps:
1. Concatenate Output String: We will form a single string for output in each iteration of the inner loop. This can be done by using the to_string function to convert the integers to strings and then concatenating them with the required characters ('x', '=', '\n').

2. Replace endl with '\n': This is a straightforward replacement in the code.

Trade-offs:
This optimization increases the complexity of the program slightly, as we need to convert integers to strings and then concatenate them. However, the performance gain from reducing the number of std::cout operations and avoiding unnecessary buffer flushes outweighs this increase in complexity.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      cout << to_string(i) + "x" + to_string(j) + "=" + to_string(i * j) + '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized code has the same functionality as the original code but uses fewer std::cout operations and avoids unnecessary buffer flushes, thus potentially improving performance.
