Code Analysis:
The provided code is a simple C++ program that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. It has two nested loops, which iterate over each pair of numbers from 1 to 9 and print the product of the pair. The performance of this program is relatively good given its simplicity and the limited range of numbers it operates on. However, there are some minor improvements that can be made.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient data structures: The program does not use any data structures, so this point is not applicable here.

2. Redundant or unnecessary computations: There are no redundant computations per se, but the same multiplication is performed and printed every time the program is run. This is not a problem for a small multiplication table, but if the range were larger, it could be more efficient to store the results of the multiplications in a table and print them from there.

3. Loops or recursive calls: The loops in this program are straightforward and don't have any obvious optimization opportunities.

4. Compiler optimizations or pragma directives: The program is too simple to benefit from any advanced compiler optimizations or pragma directives.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. One of the performance issues in the provided code is the frequent output stream operations which are slower compared to other operations. A way to solve this is by using a single `cout` operation per iteration of the inner loop. This can be achieved by concatenating the strings and variables into one, and then printing the result.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      stringstream ss;
      ss << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << "\n";
      cout << ss.str();
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, a `stringstream` is used to concatenate the strings and variables into one string, which is then printed using a single `cout` operation. This reduces the number of output stream operations, which can improve performance. The trade-off here is slightly increased code complexity and an additional memory allocation for each iteration of the inner loop. However, for a program this simple, the performance gain from reducing output stream operations is likely to outweigh the cost of the additional memory allocations.
