The given code is a simple C++ program that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. It uses two nested loops to iterate over each combination of i and j from 1 to 9 and outputs the result of their multiplication. 

Although this program is simple and has no immediately obvious performance issues, there are still a few minor optimizations we can consider:

1. **Optimization Strategy**

    1. **Avoiding the use of std::endl**: std::endl forces a flush of the output buffer. This can be inefficient, especially in a nested loop where it's used repeatedly. Instead, we can use '\n' to create a new line without flushing the buffer.

    2. **Minimizing multiplications in the inner loop**: In the current implementation, multiplication is calculated for each iteration of the inner loop. We could maintain a running total of the multiplication to reduce this computation.
    
    3. **Using compiler optimizations**: Compilers like GCC or Clang support various optimization flags that can be used to improve the performance of the code. In our case, we could use the -O3 optimization level, which enables all compiler optimizations.

2. **Step-by-Step Explanation**

    1. **Avoiding the use of std::endl**: Instead of using std::endl, we will use '\n'. This change will improve performance because '\n' doesn't flush the output buffer, which is an expensive operation. However, the trade-off is that if the program crashes, the output may not be displayed correctly because it hadn't been flushed.

    2. **Minimizing multiplications in the inner loop**: Instead of multiplying i and j in each iteration of the inner loop, we can keep a running total of the multiplication and increment it by i in each iteration. The advantage of this approach is that it reduces the number of multiplications, which is a more expensive operation than addition. The trade-off is a slightly more complex code.

    3. **Using compiler optimizations**: By using the -O3 flag when compiling the program, we instruct the compiler to apply all optimization strategies it has, which can result in a significant improvement in performance. The trade-off is that the code may become harder to debug, and it might not behave exactly as written due to the compiler's optimizations.

3. **Optimized Code Block**

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    int running_total = i; // Initialize running total
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << running_total << '\n'; // Use '\n' instead of endl
      running_total += i; // Increment running total by i
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

To compile this program with -O3 optimization level, you can use the following command:

```
g++ -O3 -o output_file_name source_file_name.cpp
```

Remember to replace 'output_file_name' with the desired name of the output file and 'source_file_name.cpp' with the name of your source file.
