The provided code is a simple multiplication table generator that prints the product of two numbers ranging from 1 to 9. While the code is straightforward and doesn't have any glaring inefficiencies due to its simplicity, there are still some minor optimizations that can be done to improve its performance.

## Optimization Strategy:

1. Redundant Computation:
     The multiplication operation `i * j` is performed each iteration of the inner loop, which is redundant. We can optimize this by storing the result in a variable and printing that instead.

2. I/O Operations:
    The use of `endl` inserts a newline character and flushes the output buffer, which is an expensive operation. We can replace `endl` with a newline character `\n` to avoid unnecessary buffer flushes.

3. Compiler Optimizations:
    We can use compiler optimizations to further improve performance. The `-O3` flag in g++ compiler can be used, which enables all optimization flags.

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Redundant Computation:
   
    In the original code, the expression `i * j` is computed and directly embedded within each I/O operation. This computation can be optimized by storing the result in a variable, and reusing the value in the `cout` operation. This reduces the number of arithmetic operations performed in the loop.

2. I/O Operations:

    The `endl` function in C++ not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output buffer. This operation can be expensive, particularly inside a loop. By replacing `endl` with `\n`, we can still achieve the newline effect without the overhead of buffer flushing.

3. Compiler Optimizations:

    Using the `-O3` flag during compilation can lead to significant performance improvements. It enables all the optimization flags that do not involve a space-speed trade-off. It turns on flags like `-finline-functions`, `-funswitch-loops`, `-fpredictive-commoning`, `-fgcse-after-reload`, `-ftree-vectorize`, `-fvect-cost-model`, `-ftree-partial-pre`, `-fipa-cp-clone` and many others, which can result in a faster executable.

## Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      int product = i * j; // Store the product in a variable to avoid redundant computation
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << product << "\n"; // Replace endl with \n to avoid unnecessary buffer flushes
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Compile this code with the `-O3` flag for further optimizations:

```bash
g++ -O3 multiplication_table.cpp -o multiplication_table
```

Please note that the performance improvement from these optimizations may be negligible in this particular case due to the simplicity of the program. However, these principles can be quite beneficial when applied to larger, more complex programs.
