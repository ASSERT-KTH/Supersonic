Code Analysis:
The code is a simple nested loop program that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. The most noticeable inefficiency here is the frequent use of `cout` inside the nested loop. `cout` is a high-level operation and it is relatively slow due to the overhead of stream management and formatting. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Reducing the number of `cout` calls: Instead of using `cout` separately for each variable and string, we can concatenate all elements into a single string and then print it at once.
2. Using `'\n'` instead of `endl`: The `endl` manipulator not only adds a newline character, but also flushes the output stream, which is an expensive operation. We can replace it with `'\n'` to save some time when we don't need to flush the stream.
3. Using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This can potentially speed up `cin` and `cout` by not synchronizing them with the C-style standard streams (`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`). However, this should only be done when we're not mixing C and C++ style I/O in the program.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. We will create a string inside the inner loop and append all the elements we want to print to that string. This way, we only call `cout` once per cycle of the inner loop.
2. We will replace `endl` with `'\n'` to avoid unnecessary flush of the output stream.
3. We will add `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` at the beginning of `main` function to speed up `cin` and `cout`.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      string output = to_string(i) + "x" + to_string(j) + "=" + to_string(i * j) + '\n';
      cout << output;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This code should run faster than the original, especially when the size of the multiplication table is increased. However, note that the difference might be negligible in this particular example due to the small size of the table. The optimization would become more significant in a larger problem.
