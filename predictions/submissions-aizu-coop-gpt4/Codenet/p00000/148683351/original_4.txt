The given C++ program is a simple program that prints out the multiplication table for numbers between 1 and 9. It is already quite efficient in terms of time complexity (O(1) since the number of iterations is constant) and space complexity (O(1) since it does not use any extra space that grows with input). However, there are still a few optimizations that can be done to improve its performance:

1. Buffering the Output: Right now, the program performs a console output operation for each multiplication result. Console output is a relatively slow operation, so it would be more efficient to buffer the output and output it all at once, rather than one by one.

2. String Concatenation: Instead of using multiple console output operations to print the multiplication result and its operands, we can concatenate them into a single string and output it all at once. This should reduce the number of I/O operations.

3. Precomputing Results: Since the range of i and j is known (between 1 and 9), we can precompute the multiplication results and store them in an array. This way, we only have to perform the multiplications once, and can quickly look up the result when needed.

Here is the optimized code implementing the optimizations above:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string output = "";
    int results[10][10];

    // Precompute multiplication results
    for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
            results[i][j] = i * j;
        }
    }

    // Generate output string
    for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
            output += to_string(i) + "x" + to_string(j) + "=" + to_string(results[i][j]) + "\n";
        }
    }

    // Output the result
    cout << output;

    return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimizations here are micro-optimizations and the difference in performance might not be noticeable for this particular application due to its simplicity. However, in programs with larger data sizes or more complex computations, such optimizations can lead to significant performance improvements.
