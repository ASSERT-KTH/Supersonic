The given program is a simple one to print the multiplication table from 1 to 9. While it's already quite efficient, there are a few optimizations we can make:

1. **Avoiding Unnecessary Calls to std::endl**: std::endl not only inserts a new line, but also flushes the output buffer, which is a relatively expensive operation. We can replace it with a '\n' which just inserts a new line, without flushing the buffer.

2. **Using Fast I/O Operations**: The cin and cout operations are slower compared to printf and scanf. Even though in this case, the difference won't be noticeable because we're not performing a large number of I/O operations, it's a good practice to use the faster options when performance is a concern.

3. **Use of Constants**: The limits of the loops are constant and known before runtime. So, we can replace the magic numbers with const variables to make the code more readable and maintainable.

4. **Loop Unrolling**: While loop unrolling might seem like a good idea, in this case, it won't necessarily provide a performance boost. The reason for this is that the loops are already quite small (only 9 iterations). Loop unrolling is more beneficial for larger loops where the overhead of the loop control structure is significant compared to the body of the loop.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

const int START = 1;
const int END = 9;

int main() {
  for (int i = START; i <= END; ++i) {
    for (int j = START; j <= END; ++j) {
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we've replaced the use of std::cout with printf for faster I/O. We've also removed the calls to std::endl and replaced them with '\n' to avoid unnecessary buffer flushes. Finally, we've replaced the magic numbers in the loop conditions with constant variables for better readability and maintainability.
