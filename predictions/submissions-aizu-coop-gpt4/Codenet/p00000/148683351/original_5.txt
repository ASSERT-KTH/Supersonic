Code Analysis:
This code is a simple nested loop structure that prints out the multiplication table from 1 to 9. The primary optimization opportunity would be to decrease the number of calls to the standard output stream `cout`, which is a relatively expensive operation.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Reducing I/O Operations: Instead of performing multiple `cout` operations inside the inner loop, we can concatenate the output into a single string and print it once per iteration. This will significantly reduce the number of I/O operations, which are generally slow.

2. Compiler optimization: Using compiler flags that enable optimization can generally result in faster executables. In this case, the -O2 or -O3 optimization level flags would be appropriate, depending on the specific requirements and the compiler used.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Reducing I/O Operations: In the original code, there are four calls to `cout` in each iteration of the inner loop, resulting in a total of 4*9*9 = 324 calls. By concatenating the output into a single string, we can reduce this to just 9*9 = 81 calls, a significant reduction.

2. Compiler optimization: Modern compilers have a variety of optimization techniques at their disposal, from loop unrolling to function inlining and beyond. By enabling these optimizations, we can often achieve significant performance improvements without changing the code itself. However, this can sometimes result in larger executables or increased compilation times.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      ostringstream s;
      s << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j;
      cout << s.str() << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code reduces the number of I/O operations by concatenating the output into a single string before printing. It is a simple and effective optimization with minimal impact on the readability and maintainability of the code.
