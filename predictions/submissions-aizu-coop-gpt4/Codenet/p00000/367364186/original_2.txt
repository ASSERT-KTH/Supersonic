1. Code Analysis:

The provided code is a simple C/C++ program that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. It uses two nested for loops to iterate over the numbers 1 through 9 and prints the product of the current pair of numbers.

2. Optimization Strategy:

Given that this is a relatively simple program, there is not much scope for optimization. However, a few possible strategies could include:

A) Reducing the number of calls to printf, which is relatively expensive. We can achieve this by combining multiple print operations into a single one where possible.

B) Using more efficient data types. However, this point doesn't apply in this case as we are only using integers which is the best choice in this context.

C) Making use of compiler optimizations. The compiler can often optimize your code better than you can by hand. You can advise the compiler to focus on optimizing for speed, size, or a balance between the two.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A) Reducing printf calls:
The current code prints a new line for every multiplication result. This can be changed so that all multiplication results for a given 'i' are printed on the same line. This reduces the number of calls to printf.

B) Compiler optimizations:
In C/C++, the "-O2" flag can be used with the GCC or G++ compiler to optimize the code. This flag tells the compiler to perform nearly all supported optimizations that do not involve a space-speed trade-off.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    printf("%d", i);
    for (int j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      printf("x%d=%d ", j, i * j);
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Compiler command with optimization flag:

```cmd
gcc -O2 -o optimized_program optimized_program.c
```

Please note that compiler optimizations are not visible in the source code. They are applied by the compiler at the time of compiling the program into binary code. The optimization flag should be used when compiling the code to see the performance improvements.
