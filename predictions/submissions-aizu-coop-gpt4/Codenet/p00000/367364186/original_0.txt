Code Analysis:
The given code is a simple program that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. It has two nested loops: the outer loop runs from 1 to 9 (inclusive), and the inner loop does the same. For each pair of (i, j), it prints a multiplication statement to the console.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The code does not use any data structures, so there's nothing to optimize in this regard.

2. Redundant or Unnecessary Computations: The multiplication operation i * j is performed inside the printf function. This operation is performed repeatedly even for same values of i and j which is unnecessary computation.

3. Loops or Recursive Calls: The code uses two nested loops, each of which runs 9 times. This is a small number, so optimizing the loops (e.g., through loop unrolling) probably won't yield significant benefits. 

4. Compiler Optimizations or Pragma Directives: Given the simplicity of the code, there's not much scope for compiler optimizations or pragma directives.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

The key optimization here is to avoid redundant multiplication operations. For example, we already know that 2*3 is the same as 3*2, and similarly for other pairs of numbers. 

We can save these computations in an array as we calculate them for the first time. Then, if we need to do the same multiplication again, we can just look up the result in the array instead of doing the multiplication.

Trade-offs: Adding an array to store the results of multiplications adds a small amount of complexity to the code. However, the performance gain (especially for larger multiplication tables) would outweigh this added complexity.

Optimized Code Block:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int results[10][10] = { 0 }; // Initialize a 10x10 array to store multiplication results

  for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      if (results[i][j] == 0) // If the result hasn't been calculated yet
      {
        results[i][j] = i * j; // Calculate and store the result
        results[j][i] = results[i][j]; // Also store the result for the reversed pair (j, i)
      }

      printf("%d x %d = %d\n", i, j, results[i][j]); // Print the result from the array
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimization becomes more significant when the range of the multiplication table increases. For the current range (1-9), the performance gain might not be noticeable due to the overhead of accessing memory (array).
