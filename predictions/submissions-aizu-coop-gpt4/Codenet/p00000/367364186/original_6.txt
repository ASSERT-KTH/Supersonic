**Code Analysis**

The provided code is simple and straightforward, it prints the multiplication table up to 9x9. However, it uses two nested loops and performs multiple multiplications operations, which might be optimized.

**Optimization Strategy**

1. **Inefficient Computations:** The program repeatedly performs multiplication operation inside printf which may be optimized by storing the result in a variable. 

2. **Loop Unrolling:** The inner loop can be unrolled to reduce the overhead of loop control and improve the program speed. 

3. **Compiler Optimization:** We can utilize compiler optimization flags like `-O2` during compilation to enhance the performance of the code.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **Inefficient Computations:** We will store the result of the multiplication in a variable before printing. This will reduce computation inside printf statement.

2. **Loop Unrolling:** We will unroll the inner loop manually. Loop unrolling is a technique that attempts to optimize a program's execution speed by minimizing the overhead of loop control operations. However, it might increase the size of the binary file.

3. **Compiler Optimization:** Compiler optimizations like `-O2` can improve the performance by applying multiple optimization strategies like inlining, loop unrolling, vectorization etc.

**Trade-offs:** The downside of the above optimizations is that the code may become less readable, especially with loop unrolling. Also, unrolling increases the size of the binary file. However, these trade-offs are usually deemed acceptable when performance is a critical factor.

**Optimized Code Block**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j < 10; j+=8) {
      int res1 = i*j;
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, res1);

      int res2 = i*(j+1);
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j+1, res2);

      int res3 = i*(j+2);
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j+2, res3);

      int res4 = i*(j+3);
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j+3, res4);

      int res5 = i*(j+4);
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j+4, res5);

      int res6 = i*(j+5);
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j+5, res6);

      int res7 = i*(j+6);
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j+6, res7);

      int res8 = i*(j+7);
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j+7, res8);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Compile the code with `-O2` flag for compiler optimization.

```bash
gcc -O2 file_name.c
```
