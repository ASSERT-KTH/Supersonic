**1. Code Analysis**

The given C code is a simple program that prints the multiplication table for numbers between 1 and 9. This program employs two nested loops to generate the multiplication table and prints each result using the `printf` function. 

**2. Optimization Strategy**

The program is straightforward and doesn't have any prominent inefficiencies or performance bottlenecks. Yet, there are possible optimizations that can be made:

A. Optimize I/O Operations: The `printf` function is called in every iteration of the inner loop. However, I/O operations (like writing to the console) can be relatively slow compared to other operations.

B. Loop Unrolling: The inner loop can be unrolled to reduce the overhead of loop control instructions.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation**

A. Optimize I/O Operations: We can reduce the number of calls to `printf` by storing the result in a string and printing it once after generating the entire multiplication table. This approach will reduce I/O operations but will slightly increase memory usage due to the required string storage.

B. Loop Unrolling: Loop unrolling is a technique that reduces the overhead of loop control instructions by increasing the number of operations per loop iteration. In our case, we can unroll the inner loop as we know it iterates exactly 9 times.

**4. Optimized Code Block**

Here's the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024

int main() {
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE] = {0};
    char *ptr = buffer;

    for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
        ptr += sprintf(ptr, "%dx%d=%d  %dx%d=%d  %dx%d=%d  %dx%d=%d  %dx%d=%d  %dx%d=%d  %dx%d=%d  %dx%d=%d  %dx%d=%d\n", 
            i, 1, i*1,
            i, 2, i*2,
            i, 3, i*3,
            i, 4, i*4,
            i, 5, i*5,
            i, 6, i*6,
            i, 7, i*7,
            i, 8, i*8,
            i, 9, i*9);
    }

    printf("%s", buffer);

    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we defined a buffer to store the result of the multiplication table and a pointer to track the current position in the buffer. Inside the loop, we used the `sprintf` function to format the output string and store it in the buffer. We also unrolled the inner loop, reducing the loop control overhead. After generating the entire multiplication table, we print the result once with the `printf` function.

This optimization reduces the number of I/O operations and loop control instructions but trades off a slight increase in memory usage and code complexity.
