The given code is a simple C program that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. The two nested loops, running from 1 to 9, generate the variables `i` and `j` for each multiplication operation. The result is then printed. 

This code is already quite efficient given its simplicity. However, there are a few minor improvements that can be made:

1. **Move computation out from printf()**: The multiplication operation `i*j` can be computed and stored in a variable before the printf call. This can reduce the amount of operations within printf() which is a costly function.

2. **Use character array for storing the multiplication table**: Instead of printing the result directly, we can store the entire multiplication table in a character array and print the array at the end. This will reduce the number of printf calls, which are expensive in terms of CPU cycles.

3. **Using more efficient `sprintf()` for formatting**: Instead of `printf()`, we can use `sprintf()` to format the string and then print it, which is more efficient.

4. **Compiler optimization**: We can use compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` which can optimize the code for speed during compilation. 

Below is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  char table[1000] = {0}; // initialize a large enough array
  char buffer[20]; 

  for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      int product = i * j; // move multiplication out of printf
      sprintf(buffer, "%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, product); // use sprintf for formatting
      strcat(table, buffer); // concatenate the formatted string to the table
    }
  }
  
  printf("%s", table); // print the entire table at once
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the size of the `table` array may need to be adjusted based on the range of i and j. The size is set to 1000 here for the given range of i and j. If the range changes, you may need to adjust the size accordingly.

Lastly, the `-O2` or `-O3` flags can be used during compilation to further optimize the code. For example, to compile the code with the `-O3` flag using gcc, you would use the command `gcc -O3 filename.c`.
