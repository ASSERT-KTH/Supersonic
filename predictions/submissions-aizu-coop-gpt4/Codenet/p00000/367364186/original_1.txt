# Code Analysis
The given C program is a simple multiplication table generator. It uses two nested loops to calculate and print the product of two numbers from 1 to 9. This program has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the range (in this case, 9). The space complexity is O(1) as it does not use any additional memory space that grows with the input size.

# Optimization Strategy
1. **Redundant Computations:** The program performs repetitive multiplication operation in printf statement. This may not be a significant performance issue in this particular scenario, but it can be optimized by storing the result in a variable.
2. **Compiler Optimizations:** Using compiler flags can help optimize the program, although this is a small and simple program. The `-O3` optimization level (in gcc compiler) can be used which enables all `-O2` optimizations and also additional optimizations that may increase performance.
3. **Loop Unrolling:** However, in this particular case, the use of loop unrolling will not provide a significant improvement because the loop count is small (1 to 9) and the loop body is not complex. Furthermore, modern compilers can automatically apply loop unrolling if it is beneficial.
4. **IO Operations:** The printf function is an IO operation which is typically slow. However, in this case, it's unavoidable since the purpose of the program is to print the multiplication table.

# Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **Store Multiplication Result:** Store the multiplication result in a variable to avoid multiple computations. This will slightly enhance the performance.
2. **Compiler Optimizations:** Compile the program with `-O3` flag. This will give a hint to the compiler to perform more aggressive optimizations including inline functions, loop unrolling, vectorization and more.

# Trade-offs
The above optimizations will increase the performance of the program. However, it's important to note that the `-O3` optimization level might increase the size of the generated binary. The trade-off here is between the speed of the program and the size of the binary.

# Optimized Code Block
Here's the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      int product = i * j;  // Store the multiplication result
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, product);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This program should be compiled with `-O3` flag to get the maximum performance. For example, if you're using gcc, you can compile it like this: `gcc -O3 program.c`.
