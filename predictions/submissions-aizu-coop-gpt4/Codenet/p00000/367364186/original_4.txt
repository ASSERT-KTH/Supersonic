**1. Code Analysis:**

This program is a simple nested loop structure that prints the multiplication table from 1x1 to 9x9. It doesn't have any major performance issues due to its simplicity. However, there is one operation that can be optimized: the `printf` function call inside the inner loop.

**2. Optimization Strategy:**

The primary strategy here involves reducing the number of calls to the `printf` function. The `printf` function is a system call that is quite expensive in terms of computational resources. Every call to `printf` has a certain overhead associated with it, which can be avoided in our case by reducing the number of `printf` calls.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

- The code currently calls `printf` 81 times (for each combination of i and j from 1 to 9). We can reduce this number by building one large string in each outer loop iteration that contains all of the multiplication results for the current number, and then printing this string once. 

- We will use `sprintf` to append to our string in each iteration of the inner loop and then use `printf` to print the entire string once after the inner loop. 

- We are trading off a little more memory usage (for the string buffer) for a reduction in the number of system calls, which should result in a net performance gain.

**4. Optimized Code Block:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char buffer[400];
  for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    int offset = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      offset += sprintf(buffer + offset, "%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
    printf("%s", buffer);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version of code, we are building the output string for each 'i' and using `printf` only once for each 'i'. This reduces the number of `printf` calls from 81 to 9. The `sprintf` function is used to append to our string in each iteration of the inner loop. The `offset` variable is used to keep track of where in the buffer string the next `sprintf` should write to.

This version of the code should run faster than the original version due to the reduction in system calls, in exchange for slightly higher memory usage for the string buffer.
