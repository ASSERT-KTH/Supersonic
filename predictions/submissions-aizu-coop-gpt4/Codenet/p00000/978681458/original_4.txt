1. Code Analysis: 
The provided code block is a simple C program which prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9, using 2 nested for-loops. Each loop runs from 1 to 9, and for each pair of (i, j), it prints the multiplication in a formatted string. There are no obvious inefficiencies or performance bottlenecks in the code as it is quite straightforward.

2. Optimization Strategy:

Though the code is straightforward and doesn't have any glaring inefficiencies, there are still some aspects that can be optimized. These include:

   A. Unnecessary function calls: Each iteration of the inner loop calls the `printf` function, which is an expensive operation. This can be optimized by reducing the number of calls to the `printf` function.
   
   B. Loop Unrolling: The inner loop can be unrolled partially or fully to reduce the overhead involved in loop control. This can potentially increase the speed of the program.
   
3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   A. Reducing `printf` function calls: Instead of calling `printf` for every iteration of the inner loop, we can create a string for each outer loop iteration, and then print it once. This reduces the number of expensive I/O operations, leading to a performance improvement.
   
   B. Loop Unrolling: Loop unrolling involves rewriting the loop so that each iteration performs the task of multiple iterations of the original loop. This reduces the overhead of loop control (incrementing the counter and checking the end condition), but it does increase the size of the code. In this case, since we know that the loop runs exactly 9 times, we can fully unroll the inner loop, eliminating its control overhead.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized version of the code, incorporating the above-mentioned optimizations:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int i;
  char str[100];
  for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    sprintf(str, "%dx1=%d\n%dx2=%d\n%dx3=%d\n%dx4=%d\n%dx5=%d\n%dx6=%d\n%dx7=%d\n%dx8=%d\n%dx9=%d\n", 
            i, i*1, i, i*2, i, i*3, i, i*4, i, i*5, i, i*6, i, i*7, i, i*8, i, i*9);
    printf("%s", str);
  }
  return (0);
}
```

This code preserves the functionality of the original code, but it reduces the number of calls to `printf`, and it completely unrolls the inner loop, reducing loop control overhead. The trade-off is that the code is slightly more complex and verbose due to the expanded `sprintf` call, and the character array `str` uses more memory. However, the performance improvement from reduced I/O and loop control overhead should outweigh these drawbacks in most scenarios.
