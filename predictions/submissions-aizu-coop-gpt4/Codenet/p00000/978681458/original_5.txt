1. Code Analysis:
   The provided code is a simple C program that prints the multiplication table for numbers from 1 to 9. It consists of two nested loops, where the outer loop iterates over the numbers from 1 to 9 (inclusive), and the inner loop also does the same. For each pair of numbers (i, j), it prints the multiplication result. Since this is a simple and straightforward program, there isn't much scope for performance optimization as the code doesn't have any significant performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usage.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   However, there are still a few tweaks that we can make to slightly improve the performance:

    A. Compiler Optimization Flags: We can use compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` while compiling the code. These flags instruct the compiler to perform different kinds of optimizations like loop unrolling, vectorization etc.

    B. Reduce Function Calls: Multiple calls to `printf()` function can be relatively expensive. We can try to reduce them by storing the result in a string and printing it once.

    C. Use of Register Keyword: We can use the register keyword for variables `i` and `j` to store them in the register instead of RAM. This can help to speed up the program as accessing register is faster than accessing RAM.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   A. Compiler Optimization Flags: Using optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` while compiling the program can boost the performance. These flags enable various optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining and vectorization which can make the code run faster. However, these optimizations can sometimes make debugging difficult due to rearrangement of code and skipping of some function calls.
   
   B. Reduce Function Calls: In the given code, the `printf()` function is called 81 times (9*9). Function calls are expensive operations as they involve pushing and popping operations to the stack, register saving and loading, and jumps in the instruction set. By reducing the number of function calls, we can improve performance. However, this might slightly increase the complexity of the code.
   
   C. Use of Register Keyword: By defining `i` and `j` with the register keyword, we suggest to the compiler that these variables are frequently used and should be kept in the CPU register. This can speed up the execution as accessing register is faster than accessing RAM. However, modern compilers are smart enough to perform this optimization themselves.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  register int i, j;
  char buffer[500] = {0};
  char* ptr = buffer;

  for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      ptr += sprintf(ptr, "%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
  }

  printf("%s", buffer);

  return 0;
}
```

Compile this code using `-O2` or `-O3` flag to enable compiler optimizations. 

Please note that these optimizations will have a minor effect on this code due to its simplicity. For more complex programs, these techniques can have a significant impact on performance.
