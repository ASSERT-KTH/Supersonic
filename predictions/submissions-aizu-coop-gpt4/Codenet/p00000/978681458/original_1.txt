Code Analysis:
The given C program prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. It uses two nested loops to iterate over the range of numbers. The inner loop calculates the multiplication of the two numbers and prints it. The outer loop iterates over each number from 1 to 9, and the inner loop repeats this process for each number from 1 to 9.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. The main bottleneck in this program is the printf function inside the inner loop. This function is I/O bound and can slow down the program significantly if the range of numbers is large.
2. The multiplication operation inside the printf function is also a potential bottleneck because it is performed in each iteration of the inner loop.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use an array to store multiplication results: Instead of calculating the multiplication in each iteration, we can calculate all multiplication results beforehand and store them in an array. This way, we only need to perform the multiplication operation once for each pair of numbers.

2. Use fputs or puts instead of printf: The printf function is very powerful but also quite slow because it has to parse the format string. If we only need to print a string, the fputs or puts function can be faster.

Step by Step Explanation:

1. Create an array to store multiplication results: Before the loops, we create a 2D array of integers. Then we replace the printf function in the inner loop with a simple assignment operation that stores the multiplication result in the array.

2. Replace printf with fputs or puts: After the loops, we iterate over the array and print each multiplication result using the fputs or puts function. To do this, we need to convert each integer to a string using the snprintf function.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_NUM 10

int main(void) {
    int i, j;
    int results[MAX_NUM][MAX_NUM]; // 2D array to store multiplication results
    char buffer[50]; // Buffer to store string representation of each result

    // Calculate multiplication results
    for (i = 1; i < MAX_NUM; i++) {
        for (j = 1; j < MAX_NUM; j++) {
            results[i][j] = i * j;
        }
    }

    // Print multiplication results
    for (i = 1; i < MAX_NUM; i++) {
        for (j = 1; j < MAX_NUM; j++) {
            // Convert integer to string
            snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, results[i][j]);
            // Print string
            fputs(buffer, stdout);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The trade-off of this optimization is that it uses more memory to store the multiplication results. However, the memory usage is still quite low because we only store a small number of integers. The benefit is a significant reduction in the number of I/O operations and multiplication operations, which can lead to a noticeable speedup if the range of numbers is large.
