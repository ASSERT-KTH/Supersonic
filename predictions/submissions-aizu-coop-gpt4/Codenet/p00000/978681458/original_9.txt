The provided code is a simple C program that prints the multiplication table for numbers from 1 to 9. It is a simple, nested loop structure where each iteration performs a multiplication operation and prints the result. The code is already quite efficient given its simplicity. However, for the purposes of this exercise, we can still consider a few optimization techniques:

1. **Compiler Optimization:** We can use compiler optimization flags to instruct the compiler to optimize the code for us.

2. **Loop Unrolling:** Loop unrolling is a technique used to increase the speed of the program. It reduces the overhead of loop control instructions by executing the loop instructions multiple times without checking the loop condition. However, this might increase the size of the code, which is a trade-off.

3. **Using `puts` instead of `printf`:** The `printf` function is more resource-intensive than `puts` due to its formatting capabilities. Since we are simply printing strings, we can use `puts` to slightly improve performance.

Optimized Code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  char* table[81];
  int index = 0;
  
  for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      char buffer[20];
      sprintf(buffer, "%dx%d=%d", i, j, i*j);
      table[index] = buffer;
      index++;
    }
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 81; i++) {
    puts(table[i]);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we first generate all the strings needed and store them in an array. Then in a separate loop, we print them all using `puts`. This reduces the number of times we have to perform the I/O operation of printing, and groups all the `printf` operations together which could result in better cache utilization. However, this optimization strategy increases the memory usage of the program, which is a trade-off.

For compiler optimization, you can use `-O2` or `-O3` flags while compiling the code. This will perform all optimizations that do not involve a space-speed trade-off. For example, `gcc -O2 filename.c`.

However, keep in mind that these optimizations are quite minor and will likely not result in noticeable performance improvement given the simplicity of the original code. They are more appropriate for larger, more complex programs.
