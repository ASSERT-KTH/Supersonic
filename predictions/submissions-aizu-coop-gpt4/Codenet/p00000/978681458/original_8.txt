Code Analysis:
This is a simple C program that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. The program consists of two nested for loops. The outer loop iterates over the numbers 1 through 9 (inclusive), and the inner loop does the same. For each pair of numbers, the program prints a multiplication statement. The computation in this program is minimal and the memory usage is constant. 

Potential areas for optimization:

1. It's worth noting that C's printf function is known to be relatively slow, so reducing the number of calls to printf could potentially speed up the program.
2. Unrolling the inner loop to reduce the overhead of loop control.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Loop Unrolling: Instead of looping through each number from 1 to 9, we could manually print the multiplication for each number. This reduces the amount of loop control overhead, potentially improving performance.

2. Reducing printf calls: Instead of making a printf call for each multiplication, we could build a string that represents each line of the multiplication table, then print the table once per row. This would reduce the number of calls to the relatively slow printf function, which could potentially speed up the program.

Trade-offs: These optimizations may make the code more verbose and potentially harder to read. In addition, these optimizations will likely only offer a minor performance improvement, as the original code is relatively simple and not computationally intensive.

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int i;
    char line[50];
    for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
        sprintf(line, "%dx1=%d %dx2=%d %dx3=%d %dx4=%d %dx5=%d %dx6=%d %dx7=%d %dx8=%d %dx9=%d\n", 
                i, i*1, i, i*2, i, i*3, i, i*4, i, i*5, i, i*6, i, i*7, i, i*8, i, i*9);
        printf("%s", line);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This code reduces the number of loops and the number of calls to printf. However, note that the performance gain from this optimization may be very slight, as the original code was not particularly complex or inefficient.
