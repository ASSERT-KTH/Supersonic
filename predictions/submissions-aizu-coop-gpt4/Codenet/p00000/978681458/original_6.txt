This is a simple program that prints the multiplication table for numbers from 1 to 9. Given the simplicity of the task and the small size of the iteration, there isn't much room for optimization. However, there are a few small tweaks that can be made to improve performance slightly, mainly by reducing the number of computations and function calls.

Here is the optimization strategy:

1. Reducing function calls: In the nested loop, the `printf` function is called 81 times. We can reduce the number of function calls by concatenating the strings before sending them to `printf`.

2. Using less expensive operations: Inside the `printf` function, there is an integer multiplication operation. We can replace this with a less expensive operation, such as addition, by accumulating the result in a variable.

Optimization Steps:

1. Instead of computing `i * j` for each pair of numbers, we can use a variable `result` that is incremented by `i` in each iteration of the inner loop. This way, we replace a multiplication operation with an addition operation, which is generally less expensive.

2. Instead of printing the result immediately in each iteration of the inner loop, we can store the strings in a buffer using `sprintf`, and print the entire buffer after the loop. This reduces the number of `printf` calls from 81 to 1.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int i, j, result;
  char buffer[8192] = {0}; // Buffer to store the strings
  char *ptr = buffer; // Pointer to the current position in the buffer

  for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    result = i;
    for (j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      ptr += sprintf(ptr, "%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, result);
      result += i;
    }
  }

  printf("%s", buffer); // Print all strings at once

  return 0;
}
```

Note that this code assumes that the buffer is large enough to store all the strings, which is a reasonable assumption given the small size of the multiplication table. If this assumption does not hold, additional error-checking code would be needed to prevent buffer overflow. This is a trade-off between code complexity and performance.
