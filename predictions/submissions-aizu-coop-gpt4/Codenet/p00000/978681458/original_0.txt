The given code is a simple C program that prints out the multiplication table from 1 to 9. It is quite efficient already, but there are a few optimizations we can make to further improve its performance.

Here's the optimization strategy:

1. Precompute the multiplication results: The current code calculates the product `i * j` inside the inner loop. This is a bit inefficient, as the same multiplication operation is repeated many times. We can precompute the multiplication results before entering the loops, and store them in an array. This reduces the computation overhead inside the loop. 

2. Use putchar instead of printf: The printf function is quite heavy for our task of simply printing out characters. We can replace it with putchar, which is much faster. This requires us to convert the integers to strings beforehand.

3. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler flags to instruct the compiler to optimize the code. The `-O3` flag, for instance, enables all optimization levels.

Here are the step-by-step explanations of the optimizations:

1. Precomputing the multiplication results: Before entering the loops, we create an array to store the multiplication results. For every pair of `i` and `j`, we compute `i * j` and store the result in the array. This way, we only need to perform the multiplication operation once for each pair of `i` and `j`, instead of every time we enter the inner loop. This reduces computation time. The trade-off here is slightly increased memory usage.

2. Using putchar instead of printf: Inside the inner loop, we replace the printf function with putchar. This function is much faster because it simply writes a single character to the standard output, without the overhead of formatting the output like printf does. The trade-off here is that the code becomes a bit more complex because we need to manually convert the integers to strings and print them character by character.

3. Compiler optimizations: By using the `-O3` flag when compiling the code, we allow the compiler to optimize the code as much as possible. This can lead to significant performance gains, but the exact impact depends on the specific code and the compiler used.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int i, j;
  int results[10][10];
  
  // Precompute multiplication results
  for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      results[i][j] = i * j;
    }
  }
  
  char buffer[4];
  for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      // Convert i, j, and the result to strings
      sprintf(buffer, "%d", i);
      putchar(buffer[0]);
      putchar('x');
      sprintf(buffer, "%d", j);
      putchar(buffer[0]);
      putchar('=');
      sprintf(buffer, "%d", results[i][j]);
      
      // Print the result
      for (int k = 0; buffer[k] != '\0'; k++) {
        putchar(buffer[k]);
      }
      putchar('\n');
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
When compiling this code, use the `-O3` flag to let the compiler optimize it, like so: `gcc -O3 program.c`.

Please note, this optimization may seem unnecessary for such a small program, but it's useful to understand these techniques for larger, more complex programs where performance is a critical concern.
