1. Code Analysis:

The provided C/C++ code is a simple program that prints the multiplication table for numbers from 1 to 9. It uses two nested for-loops to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 9, and prints the multiplication of each pair of numbers. 

Potential performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usage in the current code are not quite relevant because the program is straightforward and simple. However, some minor improvements can be made to improve readability and maintainability.

2. Optimization Strategy:

The code is clean, but we can still make minor improvements. Our optimization strategy will focus on:

A. Efficient use of the printf function.
B. Making use of the const qualifier for variables that do not change.
C. Improving code readability by using better variable names.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Efficient use of printf: The printf function is used to print the multiplication table. Here, we are calling printf in each iteration of the inner loop. This is not directly a performance issue, but it is a good practice to reduce the number of I/O operations as much as possible. We can create a buffer and write our results into it and then print it to the output once.

B. Using const qualifier: The upper limits of for-loops are hardcoded as 10. These are not going to change within the program, so we can declare them as const integers. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.

C. Improving code readability: The variable names i and j do not provide any clue about what they are used for. This can be improved for better code readability. We can rename i and j to something more meaningful, e.g., multiplier and multiplicand.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Use meaningful variable names
    int multiplier, multiplicand;

    // Use const qualifier for variables that do not change
    const int LIMIT = 10;

    // Create a buffer to store the output
    char buffer[LIMIT*LIMIT*6]; // each entry will be "i*j=k\0"
    char* ptr = buffer;

    for (multiplier = 1; multiplier < LIMIT; multiplier++) {
        for (multiplicand = 1; multiplicand < LIMIT; multiplicand++) {
            // Write into the buffer instead of calling printf in each iteration
            ptr += sprintf(ptr, "%dx%d=%d\n", multiplier, multiplicand, multiplier * multiplicand);
        }
    }

    // Print the entire buffer at once
    printf("%s", buffer);

    return 0;
}
```

Please note that the performance improvement from these changes will be negligible for this specific case. However, these are good practices to follow for larger programs, where such improvements can lead to noticeable performance gains.
