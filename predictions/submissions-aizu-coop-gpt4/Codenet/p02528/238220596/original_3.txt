This program is implementing heap sort, a commonly used sorting algorithm. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) and is quite efficient. However, there are still a few points that we can optimize.

1. **Avoiding unnecessary computations:** 

   We see that the program is using bitwise shift operations, specifically left shift `<<`, to calculate twice the value of a number. While bitwise operations are faster than arithmetic operations, in modern compilers, they are optimized to the same level. Therefore, using a more understandable arithmetic operation will not affect the program's efficiency but will increase code readability.

2. **Using more efficient data structures:** 

   The program is using a static array to store the integers to be sorted. While this is not a problem itself, dynamic memory allocation using vectors can be more flexible and safer as it handles memory automatically.

3. **Compiler optimizations:** 

   Compiler optimizations can be used to further speed up the program. The `-O2` flag for GCC, for example, enables all optimization flags, which includes optimizations for code speed and reduction of code size.

4. **I/O stream optimization:**

   The program uses `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0)` and `std::cin.tie(0)`, which are used to untie C++ standard streams from their corresponding C standard streams and disable synchronization. These lines are used for speed optimization in competitive programming, but in real-world applications, it might cause issues. For our case, we can remove them without any significant performance loss.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

template <class T, class Compare>
void hsort(T& a, std::ptrdiff_t n, Compare cmp) {
  if (n < 2) {
    return;
  }
  using dif_t = std::ptrdiff_t;
  auto heapify = [&a](dif_t p, dif_t hpsz, Compare cmp) {
    dif_t c;
    while ((c = 2*p + 1) < hpsz) {
      if (c + 1 < hpsz && cmp(a[c], a[c + 1])) {
        ++c;
      }
      if (!cmp(a[p], a[c])) {
        break;
      }
      std::swap(a[p], a[c]);
      p = c;
    }
  };
  for (dif_t i = n / 2; i >= 0; --i) {
    heapify(i, n, cmp);
  }
  for (dif_t i = n - 1; i > 0; --i) {
    std::swap(a[0], a[i]);
    heapify(0, i, cmp);
  }
}

int main(void) {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> a[i];
  hsort(a, n, std::less<int>());
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cout << a[i] << ((i == n - 1) ? '\n' : ' ');
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we replaced static array with vector, arithmetic operations are used instead of bitwise operations, and eliminated unnecessary I/O stream optimization. The program functionality remains the same and it's easier to understand and maintain. The performance should be similar or even slightly better due to memory management improvements with vector.
