1. **Code Analysis**

The given C++ code is a heap sort implementation, which is an efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm. The heap sort algorithm works by first transforming the list into a max heap (a complete binary tree where each parent node is greater than or equal to its child node(s)). It then swaps the first element of the list with the final element and decreases the considered range of the list by one. After each swap, the heap property is reconstructed for the list.

2. **Optimization Strategy**

The heap sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it one of the efficient sorting algorithms. However, there are still areas where we can optimize this code:

    A. Memory Usage: The static array `a` with size 1,000,000 is a large memory allocation that might not be fully utilized. This is inefficient memory usage.

    B. Input/Output (I/O) operations: The current program uses cin and cout for input and output, which are not the fastest I/O operations in C++.

    C. Use of Templates: Although the use of templates provides flexibility, it may also introduce unnecessary overhead in certain scenarios where the data type is known.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**

    A. Memory Usage: Instead of declaring a static array of size 1,000,000, dynamically allocate the array depending on the input size `n`. This will help us save memory as we will only allocate what we need.

    B. I/O Operations: Instead of using cin and cout, use faster I/O methods, like scanf and printf. Although less safe and less flexible, these functions are faster and can help reduce the running time.

    C. Use of Templates: Since we know that the input data type is `int`, we can create a specific function for integer data type instead of using a template. This reduces the overhead introduced by templates.

4. **Optimized Code Block**
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>

void hsort(int* a, int n) {
    if (n < 2) {
        return;
    }

    auto heapify = [](int* a, int p, int hpsz) {
        int c;
        while ((c = (p << 1) + 1) < hpsz) {
            if (c + 1 < hpsz && a[c] < a[c + 1]) {
                ++c;
            }
            if (!(a[p] < a[c])) {
                break;
            }
            std::swap(a[p], a[c]);
            p = c;
        }
    };

    for (int i = n / 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        heapify(a, i, n);
    }
    for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; --i) {
        std::swap(a[0], a[i]);
        heapify(a, 0, i);
    }
}

int main(void) {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    int* a = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    }
    hsort(a, n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d%c", a[i], (i == n - 1) ? '\n' : ' ');
    }
    delete[] a;
    return 0;
}
```
Here, we have optimized memory usage by allocating memory dynamically based on the input size `n`, replaced cin/cout with scanf/printf for faster I/O operations, and removed the usage of templates since we are dealing with integers.
