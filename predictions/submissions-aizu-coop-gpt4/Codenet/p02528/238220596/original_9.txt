1. Code Analysis: 

This code is executing heap sort on an array of integers. The heap sort function is declared using a template to handle different types of data. It uses a custom comparison function for the sorting operation. The main function reads an array from the standard input, sorts it, and then prints the sorted array. It seems to be an efficient approach. However, we can still consider some micro-optimizations.

2. Optimization Strategy:

a. Using Static Array:
The code uses a static array of size 1,000,000 regardless of the actual input size. Allocating such a large array in memory can be inefficient when dealing with smaller inputs.

b. Unnecessary Calls to Heapify:
In the heap sort function, heapify is called for all array elements, including leaf nodes which are already heaps themselves. This can be avoided.

c. Redundant Comparison:
There is an unnecessary comparison in the heapify function that checks if the parent is not smaller than the largest child. This comparison can be avoided.

d. Loop Optimizations:
We can try to optimize the loops for better performance by using appropriate compiler optimizations and pragma directives.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

a. Using Dynamic Array:
Instead of using a static array, we can use a dynamic array with a size equal to the actual input size. This will reduce memory usage. However, dynamic memory allocation can be slower than static memory allocation. 

b. Avoiding Unnecessary Calls to Heapify:
We can start calling heapify from the first non-leaf node instead of the last element. The first non-leaf node can be found at index (n/2 - 1) in a zero-based index array. This will reduce the number of calls to heapify, thereby improving performance.

c. Avoiding Redundant Comparison:
We can reduce the comparison in the heapify function by removing the check if the parent is not smaller than the largest child. After swapping, the parent will definitely be larger than the child. Therefore, this comparison is not needed.

d. Loop Optimizations:
We can use the -O3 optimization flag during compilation to enable loop unrolling and other optimizations. However, we must be aware that this might increase the binary size.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

template <class T, class Compare>
void hsort(T a, std::ptrdiff_t n, Compare cmp) {
  if (n < 2) {
    return;
  }
  
  using dif_t = std::ptrdiff_t;
  
  auto heapify = [](T a, dif_t p, dif_t hpsz, Compare cmp) {
    dif_t c;
    while ((c = (p << 1) + 1) < hpsz) {
      if (c + 1 < hpsz && cmp(a[c], a[c + 1])) {
        ++c;
      }
      std::swap(a[p], a[c]);
      p = c;
    }
  };
  
  for (dif_t i = n / 2 - 1; i >= 0; --i) {    // Start from first non-leaf node
    heapify(a, i, n, cmp);
  }
  
  for (dif_t i = n - 1; i > 0; --i) {
    std::swap(a[0], a[i]);
    heapify(a, 0, i, cmp);
  }
}

template <class Iterator, class Compare>
void hsort(Iterator a0, Iterator aN, Compare cmp) {
  using dif_t = typename std::iterator_traits<Iterator>::difference_type;
  dif_t n = std::distance(a0, aN);
  hsort(a0, n, cmp);
}

template <class Iterator> 
void hsort(Iterator a0, Iterator aN) {
  using val_t = typename std::iterator_traits<Iterator>::value_type;
  hsort(a0, aN, std::less<val_t>());
}

int main(void) {
  using namespace std;
  cin.tie(0);
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  vector<int> a(n);   // Use dynamic array
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  
  hsort(a.begin(), a.end());
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cout << a[i] << ((i == n - 1) ? '\n' : ' ');
  
  return 0;
}
```
Compile the code with -O3 flag for further optimizations:
```bash
g++ -O3 main.cpp -o main
```
