1. Code Analysis:
This code reads an array of integers from the standard input, sorts it in increasing order, and then prints the sorted array. The primary performance bottleneck is the sort operation, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). Memory usage is efficient, with the array A[] requiring the most space.

2. Optimization Strategy:

   A. Inefficient data structures:
      The array A[] is appropriate for this task.

   B. Redundant computations: 
      None observed.

   C. Loops or recursive calls:
      The sorting operation can be optimized using a more efficient algorithm if any specific conditions apply to the input data. The print loop is already efficient.

   D. Compiler optimizations:
      Compiler optimizations can be applied using compiler flags.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   1. If the input data is known to have certain characteristics, a more efficient sorting algorithm can be used. For instance:
      - If the input data is nearly sorted, insertion sort could be faster.
      - If the range of the input data is known and small, counting sort could be used.

Here, since we don't have any additional information about the input data, we cannot apply these optimizations.

   2. The compiler can be instructed to optimize the code using flags such as `-O2` or `-O3` during compilation. These flags enable various performance optimizations in the compiler, such as loop unrolling and function inlining.

Trade-offs: Enabling compiler optimizations can make the code run faster, but it can also make the compiled program larger and possibly consume more memory. The optimizations performed by the compiler may also make the program harder to debug.

4. Optimized Code Block:

The code does not need any modification. The optimization can be done during the compilation process by using the appropriate flag. Here's an example:

```bash
g++ -O2 program.cpp
```

This command will instruct the g++ compiler to apply level 2 optimizations to the code. The original code remains the same:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
int main() {
  int n, i, f, A[1000001];
  for (scanf("%d", &n), i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", A + i);
  std::sort(A, A + n);
  for (i = f = 0; i < n; i++)
    printf(f ? " %d" : "%d", A[i]), f = 1;
  puts("");
}
```

Please note that the array `A[1000001]` is statically allocated on the stack, which can be problematic if the size of the array is very large. If you are working in an environment with limited stack size, consider dynamically allocating this array on the heap using `new int[n]` instead of `int A[1000001]`.
