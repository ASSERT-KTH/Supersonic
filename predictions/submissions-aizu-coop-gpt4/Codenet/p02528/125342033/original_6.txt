This is a simple C++ program that reads integers from the standard input, sorts them, and outputs them in ascending order. The program uses a static array of fixed size to store the input integers and the STL's `std::sort` function to sort the array.

Here are some potential optimization strategies:

1. Data structure: The program uses a static array `A` to store the input numbers. This can be inefficient if `n`, the number of inputs, is significantly less than the size of the array. A dynamically allocated array or a `std::vector` would use memory more efficiently.

2. I/O operations: The program uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output. These are relatively slow compared to C++ I/O streams like `cin` and `cout`. Moreover, if large amounts of data are being processed, using buffered I/O can speed things up.

3. Loop optimization: There are no obvious loop optimizations needed as there is no nested or complex looping. However, the way the output loop is written can be simplified and optimized.

4. Compiler optimizations: Compiler flags such as `-O3` can potentially improve performance.

Now, let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // Disables synchronization with C-style I/O, speeding up cin/cout
  std::cin.tie(nullptr); // Unties cin from cout, potentially speeding up cin

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::vector<int> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> A[i];

  std::sort(A.begin(), A.end());

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i != 0) std::cout << ' ';
    std::cout << A[i];
  }
  std::cout << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

Optimization details:

1. We replaced the static array `A` with a `std::vector` of size `n`, which uses memory more efficiently.

2. We disabled synchronization between C++ and C-style I/O, which can speed up `cin` and `cout`. We also untied `cin` from `cout`, which can also improve performance. We replaced `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`, which are more idiomatic in C++.

3. In the output loop, we now only print a space if `i != 0`, which simplifies the logic and removes the need for the variable `f`.

4. Compiler optimizations such as `-O3` can be applied when compiling the program, but are not shown in the code itself.

The trade-offs of these optimizations are minimal. The code is still simple and easy to understand, and the performance and memory usage are improved. The only potential downside is that the performance of C++ I/O streams can vary between different systems and compilers, so in some cases, `scanf` and `printf` might still be faster.
