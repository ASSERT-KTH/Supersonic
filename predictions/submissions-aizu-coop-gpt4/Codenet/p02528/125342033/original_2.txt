Here are some optimization strategies for the given code:

1. Code Analysis: 

The code reads integers from standard input into an array, sorts the array, and then prints out the sorted array. The key points of interest in the code from a performance perspective are the input/output operations and the sorting operation.

2. Optimization Strategy:

- Use Fast I/O: The use of scanf and printf for input/output operations can be quite slow. We could speed up the program by using faster I/O methods.

- Efficient Sorting: The sorting operation is a performance-critical part of the program. Here, the standard library's sort function is being used, which is implemented as an introsort (a hybrid of quicksort, heapsort, and insertion sort). This is generally a good choice for most use cases. However, if we know more about the properties of the input (for example, if the numbers to be sorted are small or the array is nearly sorted), we could potentially use a more efficient sorting algorithm.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

- Fast I/O: Instead of using scanf and printf, we can use getchar_unlocked (for input) and putchar_unlocked (for output). These functions are not thread-safe, but in a single-threaded program, they can be significantly faster than their thread-safe counterparts. 

- Efficient Sorting: For the sorting operation, we will keep using std::sort, as it is a good general-purpose sorting algorithm. If the properties of the input were known in advance, we could potentially use a more efficient sorting algorithm.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
inline int getint() {
  int num = 0, c;
  while ((c = getchar_unlocked()) < '0' || c > '9');
  do {
    num = num * 10 + c - '0';
  } while ((c = getchar_unlocked()) >= '0' && c <= '9');
  return num;
}
inline void putint(int num) {
  if (num == 0) {
    putchar_unlocked('0');
  } else {
    char str[20]; 
    int i = 0;
    while (num > 0) {
      str[i++] = '0' + (num % 10);
      num /= 10;
    }
    while (--i >= 0) {
      putchar_unlocked(str[i]);
    }
  }
}
int main() {
  int n, i, f, A[1000001];
  n = getint();
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    A[i] = getint();
  std::sort(A, A + n);
  for (i = f = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (f)
      putchar_unlocked(' ');
    putint(A[i]);
    f = 1;
  }
  putchar_unlocked('\n');
}
```

In this version of the code, we have replaced scanf and printf with the getint and putint functions. These functions use getchar_unlocked and putchar_unlocked to quickly read and write integers. Note that these functions are not thread-safe and should not be used in multi-threaded programs.

The rest of the code remains the same, as the sorting operation is already quite efficient. The choice of sorting algorithm depends on the properties of the input, and without more knowledge about the input, std::sort is a good general-purpose choice.
