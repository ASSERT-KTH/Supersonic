This C++ program reads an array of integers, sorts it, and then prints the sorted array. Though the code is already quite optimized, a few tweaks can be made to further improve its performance.

1. Code Analysis:
    - The code reads an integer 'n' as the size of the array then reads 'n' integers as the array elements.
    - The code sorts the array using the `std::sort` function from the algorithm library.
    - The code then prints the sorted array. The 'f' flag is used to conditionally insert a space before the integer.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - Optimize I/O operations: C++ `scanf` and `printf` are slower than C-style I/O operations. We can use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams, which will speed up I/O operations.

3. Step by Step Explanation:
    - Using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: By default, `cin` and `cout` are synchronized with `scanf` and `printf`. This means that you can use both C and C++ style I/O operations interchangeably. However, this synchronization makes I/O operations slower. By disabling this synchronization using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`, we can make I/O operations faster. Note that after synchronization is disabled we should not mix C and C++ style I/O operations.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // disable synchronization
  cin.tie(NULL); // untie cin and cout

  int n, i, f;
  int A[1000001];
  
  cin >> n;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> A[i];

  std::sort(A, A + n);

  for (i = f = 0; i < n; i++)
    cout << (f ? " " : "") << A[i], f = 1;

  cout << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code uses `cin` and `cout` for I/O operations, which are faster than `scanf` and `printf` when synchronization is disabled. The idea is to minimize the time spent on I/O operations as they are generally slower compared to other operations. Note that we are not changing the logic of the code, just the I/O operations. The output of the program remains the same before and after the optimization.
