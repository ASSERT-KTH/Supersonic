Code Analysis:
The given code reads a series of integers from the standard input, sorts them, and then prints them to the standard output. The key steps in the program are:

1. Reading the input: This is done using the scanf function in a loop that runs n times. The time complexity of this operation is O(n).

2. Sorting the input: This is done using the sort function from the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). The time complexity of this operation is O(n log n).

3. Printing the output: This is done using a combination of the printf function and the puts function in a loop that runs n times. The time complexity of this operation is O(n).

Optimization Strategy:
The primary performance bottleneck in the code is the sorting operation, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). However, since the sort function from the STL is already highly optimized, there is little room for improvement in this area.

That said, there are a few minor optimizations that can be made to the code:

1. Use fast I/O methods: The C-style I/O functions (scanf and printf) are slower than their C++ counterparts (cin and cout), especially when ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) is set. We can replace the C-style I/O functions with the C++ ones to speed up the program.

2. Avoid unnecessary computations: In the loop that prints the output, a conditional operation is performed in every iteration to determine whether a space should be printed before the number. This operation can be avoided by always printing a space before the number, except for the first number.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Use fast I/O methods: We replace scanf and printf with cin and cout, and set ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) to make the I/O operations faster. This improves performance by reducing the time spent on I/O operations.

2. Avoid unnecessary computations: We modify the loop that prints the output to always print a space before the number, except for the first number. This avoids the need for a conditional operation in each iteration, thereby reducing the number of operations performed by the program.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> A[i];

  sort(A.begin(), A.end());

  cout << A[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    cout << " " << A[i];
  cout << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have also replaced the C-style array with a C++ vector for improved safety and convenience. Note that this change does not affect the performance of the program.
