The provided program seems to be calculating the maximum number of people that can be at lunch, dinner or morning at the same time. After analyzing the code, the main performance bottleneck is the nested loops in the main function where the program is iterating over the MORNING, LUNCH, and DINNER vector elements. These loops have a time complexity of O(n^3), which is quite inefficient for large inputs. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. **Nested Loop Optimization:** The algorithm can be optimized by reducing the time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n). This can be achieved by using a frequency counter or histogram method where for each person, the times at which they start or end morning, lunch, or dinner are recorded.

2. **Avoid Redundant Computations:** The code repeatedly performs the same calculation in the nested loops which is unnecessary and can be avoided. We can store the results of these calculations in an array.

3. **Efficient Data Structure:** The usage of vectors for MORNING, LUNCH, and DINNER can be replaced with arrays which will reduce the memory overhead associated with vectors.

4. **Compiler Optimization:** Use of compiler options like -O2 or -O3 can also help in speeding up the code execution.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
typedef long long int ll;
typedef unsigned long long int ull;
#define BIG_NUM 2000000000
#define MOD 1000000007
#define EPS 0.000000001
using namespace std;
struct Info {
  int morning_start, morning_end, lunch_start, lunch_end, dinner_start, dinner_end;
};
int calc(int hour, int minute) { return 60 * hour + minute; }
int main() {
  int N;
  scanf("%d", &N);
  Info info[N];
  int MORNING[24*60+1] = {0}, LUNCH[24*60+1] = {0}, DINNER[24*60+1] = {0}; // replace vectors with arrays
  int m_st_h, m_st_m, m_ed_h, m_ed_m, l_st_h, l_st_m, l_ed_h, l_ed_m, d_st_h, d_st_m, d_ed_h, d_ed_m;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d", &m_st_h, &m_st_m, &m_ed_h, &m_ed_m, &l_st_h, &l_st_m, &l_ed_h, &l_ed_m, &d_st_h, &d_st_m, &d_ed_h, &d_ed_m);
    info[i].morning_start = calc(m_st_h, m_st_m);
    info[i].morning_end = calc(m_ed_h, m_ed_m);
    info[i].lunch_start = calc(l_st_h, l_st_m);
    info[i].lunch_end = calc(l_ed_h, l_ed_m);
    info[i].dinner_start = calc(d_st_h, d_st_m);
    info[i].dinner_end = calc(d_ed_h, d_ed_m);
    // Use histogram method to record the time at which a person starts or ends lunch, dinner or morning
    for(int t = info[i].morning_start; t <= info[i].morning_end; t++) MORNING[t]++;
    for(int t = info[i].lunch_start; t <= info[i].lunch_end; t++) LUNCH[t]++;
    for(int t = info[i].dinner_start; t <= info[i].dinner_end; t++) DINNER[t]++;
  }
  int ans = 0;
  // Calculate the number of people at the same time for each time
  for(int t = 0; t <= 24*60; t++) {
    ans = max(ans, min({MORNING[t], LUNCH[t], DINNER[t]}));
  }
  printf("%d\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

The key optimizations are: 

1. Replacing the nested loops with a single loop that calculates the number of people at the same time for each time. This reduces the time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n).
2. Using arrays instead of vectors to reduce memory overhead.
3. Using a histogram method to avoid redundant calculations.
