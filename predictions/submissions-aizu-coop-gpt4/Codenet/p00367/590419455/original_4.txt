1. Code Analysis:
The code is a scheduling problem where each day is divided into 3 times: morning, lunch, and dinner. For each person, the start and end times for these 3 slots are stored and the goal is to find the maximum number of people that can attend all 3 slots.

The main performance issue lies in the triple nested loop, which checks for every combination of morning, lunch, and dinner times. For each combination, it compares the times with the schedule of each person. This leads to a time complexity of O(n^2), which is inefficient for larger inputs.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. The triple nested loop is not necessary and can be replaced with a single loop. The main idea is to keep track of the number of people available at each time slot. We can accomplish this by creating 3 maps, each corresponding to a time slot.
    2. We can also make use of the `lower_bound` function to find the number of people who can attend a particular time slot.
    3. The MORNING, LUNCH, and DINNER vectors can be turned into multiset data structures. This will allow us to use the `lower_bound` function effectively and remove the need to sort these vectors.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Replace the MORNING, LUNCH, and DINNER vectors with multisets. This automatically sorts the elements and allows us to use the `lower_bound` function.
    2. Replace the triple nested loop with a single loop. In each iteration, calculate the number of people who can attend all 3 slots by using the `lower_bound` function on the multisets. The `lower_bound` function returns the first element that is not less than the input, which in this case, would give the number of people who can attend a particular time slot.
    3. Keep track of the maximum number of people who can attend all 3 slots.

4. Optimized Code Block:
Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

struct Info {
    int mornint_start, morning_end, lunch_start, lunch_end, dinner_start,
        dinner_end;
};

int calc(int hour, int minute) { return 60 * hour + minute; }

int main() {
    int N;
    scanf("%d", &N);
    Info info[N];
    multiset<int> MORNING, LUNCH, DINNER;
    int m_st_h, m_st_m, m_ed_h, m_ed_m, l_st_h, l_st_m, l_ed_h, l_ed_m, d_st_h,
        d_st_m, d_ed_h, d_ed_m;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        scanf("%d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d", &m_st_h, &m_st_m, &m_ed_h,
              &m_ed_m, &l_st_h, &l_st_m, &l_ed_h, &l_ed_m, &d_st_h, &d_st_m,
              &d_ed_h, &d_ed_m);
        info[i].mornint_start = calc(m_st_h, m_st_m);
        info[i].morning_end = calc(m_ed_h, m_ed_m);
        MORNING.insert(info[i].mornint_start);
        MORNING.insert(info[i].morning_end);
        info[i].lunch_start = calc(l_st_h, l_st_m);
        info[i].lunch_end = calc(l_ed_h, l_ed_m);
        LUNCH.insert(info[i].lunch_start);
        LUNCH.insert(info[i].lunch_end);
        info[i].dinner_start = calc(d_st_h, d_st_m);
        info[i].dinner_end = calc(d_ed_h, d_ed_m);
        DINNER.insert(info[i].dinner_start);
        DINNER.insert(info[i].dinner_end);
    }

    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        int tmp = distance(MORNING.lower_bound(info[i].mornint_start), MORNING.upper_bound(info[i].morning_end)) * 
                  distance(LUNCH.lower_bound(info[i].lunch_start), LUNCH.upper_bound(info[i].lunch_end)) * 
                  distance(DINNER.lower_bound(info[i].dinner_start), DINNER.upper_bound(info[i].dinner_end));
        ans = max(ans, tmp);
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

This version of the code reduces the complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n), which is a significant improvement. The trade-off here is that the code complexity has increased slightly due to the use of `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` functions. However, this trade-off is acceptable considering the significant performance gain.
