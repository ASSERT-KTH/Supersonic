Code Analysis:
The provided code appears to be implementing a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm on a graph structure. The primary performance issues that stand out are:

1. Recursion: The DFS is implemented through a recursive function. While recursion can be a clean and intuitive way to implement DFS, it can also lead to performance issues, especially on large inputs, due to the overhead of function calls and potential stack overflows.

2. Redundant Computations: The code contains numerous redundant computations, such as repeated comparisons and assignments, which can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Iterative DFS: We can convert the recursive DFS into an iterative one using a stack, which would prevent potential stack overflows and reduce function call overhead.

2. Minimize Redundant Computations: We can minimize the number of comparisons and assignments by re-arranging the code and storing intermediate results.

3. Compiler Optimizations: Use of compiler flags like -O3 can instruct the compiler to optimize the code further.

Optimized Code:

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;
int n, b[2][100100], f[2][100100];
bool v[100100];
struct Node { int s, now, maxi, num; };
int dfs(int s, int now, int maxi, int num) {
  stack<Node> st;
  st.push({s, now, maxi, num});
  while (!st.empty()) {
    Node node = st.top();
    st.pop();
    v[node.now] = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
      if (!v[b[i][node.now]]) {
        if (node.maxi == f[i][node.now])
          node.num++;
        else if (node.maxi < f[i][node.now]) {
          node.maxi = f[i][node.now];
          node.num = 1;
        }
        if (b[i][node.now] == node.s)
          return node.num;
        st.push({node.s, b[i][node.now], node.maxi, node.num});
      }
    }
    if (node.maxi == f[1][node.s])
      return node.num + 1;
    else if (node.maxi < f[1][node.s])
      return 1;
    else
      return node.num;
  }
  return 0;
}
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false); // improve I/O performance
  cin.tie(NULL);
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> b[0][i] >> f[0][i] >> b[1][i] >> f[1][i];
      v[i] = false;
    }
    int ans = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (!v[i]) {
        v[i] = true;
        ans = (ans * dfs(i, b[0][i], f[0][i], 1)) % 10007;
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

This version converts the DFS to an iterative form, which should be more efficient and less prone to stack overflows. It also reduces redundant computations by storing intermediate results in the stack. The tradeoff here is increased code complexity and slightly more memory usage due to the additional stack. However, the benefits in terms of improved efficiency and robustness are likely to outweigh these drawbacks.
