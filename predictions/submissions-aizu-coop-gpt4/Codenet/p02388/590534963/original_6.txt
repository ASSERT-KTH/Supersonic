The provided code is a simple C++ program that takes an integer as input and outputs the cube of the input. Given the simplicity of the program, there's very little room for performance optimization. However, there are a few small changes we could consider for improving performance:

1. Code Analysis: The code is straightforward and has no performance bottlenecks. It reads an integer from standard input, calculates its cube, and writes the result to standard output.

2. Optimization Strategy: 
    1. Avoiding I/O operations: The current program reads input from the standard input and writes output to the standard output. These I/O operations can be slow. If there's a way to eliminate or reduce these operations, we could see a performance improvement. However, in this case, it's not possible as we need to get the input and provide the output.
    2. Efficient computation: Instead of multiplying the number three times, we could store the result of the first multiplication and use it in the second.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation: 
    1. Efficient computation: The original code performs the multiplication operation three times. This can be slightly optimized by performing the multiplication twice and storing the intermediate result. In the original code, if the compiler does not optimize it, the program will perform two multiplications every time. By storing the intermediate result, we will only perform two multiplications regardless of compiler optimization.

There are no trade-offs in this optimization as it doesn't increase code complexity. Moreover, this optimization does not depend on the compiler's optimization.

4. Optimized Code Block: 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int square = n * n;
  cout << square * n << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, we have added a new variable "square" to store the intermediate result of the first multiplication. We then use this variable in the second multiplication. This ensures that we only perform two multiplication operations, which could lead to a minor performance improvement. However, it's worth noting that modern compilers are very likely to perform this optimization automatically.
