The given code is a simple C++ program that calculates and prints the cube of an input integer. It is already quite efficient and doesn't offer much room for optimization as it only performs single multiplication operation. 

However, if we want to push for even a minor optimization, here's what you can do:

1. Use fast input/output to speed up the cin and cout operations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define FAST_IO ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);

int main() {
  FAST_IO
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  cout << n * n * n << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, the macro `FAST_IO` is defined. This macro unties cin from cout and sets the basefield of the stream `cin` to `NULL`. This means that cin and cout can work independently of each other, which can speed up input/output operations.

Also, I replaced `endl` with `'\n'`. `endl` not only inserts a newline, but it also flushes the output buffer. Flushing is an expensive operation in terms of time and is unnecessary in this context. So, we can replace `endl` with `'\n'` to save some time.

Please note that these optimizations provide very minor improvements and are usually only beneficial in competitive programming scenarios where large amounts of input and output are involved. In most practical applications, the original code would perform equally well. 

This optimization does not come with any trade-offs in terms of functionality or output, but it does slightly increase the complexity of the code. For a novice programmer, the `FAST_IO` macro might be difficult to understand.
