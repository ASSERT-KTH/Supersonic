Code Analysis:

The provided C++ code is a simple program that reads from the standard input an integer 'n' and outputs the cube of this integer.

Optimization Strategy:

In the code provided, there is not much scope for complex optimization because it's a simple and straightforward program. Still, some minor improvements can be made:

1. Using Fast Input/Output: 'cin' and 'cout' are slower compared to scanf() and printf(). So, we can use these latter methods to speed up the input/output operations. However, the difference in efficiency would be barely noticeable for small inputs.

2. Using Bitwise Operators: Instead of using multiplication, we can use left shift operator. But again, the compiler itself optimizes these multiplication operations to bitwise operations if possible. So, this change would not have a significant impact on this short code.

Step-By-Step Explanation:

1. Fast Input/Output: The 'cin' and 'cout' operations are slower compared to 'scanf' and 'printf'. While the difference wouldn't be too noticeable for small inputs, it could become apparent when dealing with larger inputs. The trade-off here is that 'scanf' and 'printf' are less type-safe compared to 'cin' and 'cout', and might lead to bugs if not used correctly.

2. Bitwise Operators: We can use the left shift operator to calculate the cube of 'n' instead of multiplication. This might be faster because bitwise operations are usually more efficient than mathematical operations. However, this could potentially make the code more complex and harder to understand for someone not familiar with bitwise operations.

Optimized Code Block:

```C++
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  printf("%d\n", (n << 1) * n);
  return 0;
}
```

Note: Here, the bitwise operator '<<' is used to perform the multiplication operation. The '<< 1' operation will multiply 'n' by 2. The result is then multiplied by 'n' to get the cube of 'n'. However, the compiler itself is likely to perform this optimization, so this change might not have a significant impact on the running time of the program.
