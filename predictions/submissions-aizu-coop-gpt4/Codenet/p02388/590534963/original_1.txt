The given code takes an integer input from the user and calculates the cube of that number. The code is quite straightforward and there's not much scope for optimization in terms of time and space complexity as both are O(1), i.e., constant.

However, there's a small change we could make to improve performance. Modern computers are much faster at addition and bit-shifting than at multiplication. So, we could replace the cube calculation (which involves two multiplications) with equivalent operations using bit-shift and addition. The cube of a number `n` can be calculated as `n*(n<<1) + n`.

This can potentially result in a minor performance boost, especially for larger inputs, as shifting bits is generally faster than multiplication. But remember, this might make the code less readable for people unfamiliar with bitwise operations.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  // Use bit-shift and addition instead of multiplication
  cout << (n * (n << 1)) + n << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

The trade-off here is between readability and a minor performance boost. If speed is not a critical factor and the code needs to be understood by people unfamiliar with bitwise operators, it might be better to stick with the original, slightly slower version.
