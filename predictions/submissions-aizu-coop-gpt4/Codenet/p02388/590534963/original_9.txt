The provided code is already pretty efficient, as it simply reads an integer from the user, calculates its cube, and prints the result. However, there are a few micro-optimizations that could be done to enhance its performance.

1. **Optimization Strategy:**

    1. **Avoiding Standard I/O Streams:** The `cin` and `cout` operations are slower compared to their counterparts in C (`scanf` and `printf`). They have additional overhead due to synchronization with C's stdio buffers. For small programs like this, the difference is not noticeable, but we can still use `scanf` and `printf` for a performance boost.
   
    2. **Optimizing the Power Computation:** Right now, the cube of a number is calculated using the multiplication operator three times (`n * n * n`). This is not a problem for a small program like this, but we can still optimize it by storing the square of the number in a separate variable and multiplying it by `n` to get the cube.

2. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

    1. **Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`:** The `scanf` and `printf` functions are faster than `cin` and `cout` due to less overhead. This change will make the I/O operations more efficient.
   
    2. **Modify the Power Computation:** Instead of calculating `n * n * n`, we can calculate `n * n` once, store it in a variable, and then multiply the result by `n`. This will reduce the number of multiplications from three to two.

3. **Optimized Code Block:**

```c++
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n); // using scanf instead of cin
  int square = n * n; // calculate n * n once
  printf("%d\n", square * n); // using printf instead of cout and calculating cube by multiplying square with n
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these changes offer negligible performance gains for this specific program and are more relevant for larger programs with more complex computations and I/O operations.
