The given code is a simple C++ program that reads an integer from standard input, calculates its cube (n^3), and writes the result to standard output.

Given the simplicity of the problem and the code, there is not much scope for performance optimization in this case. The program is already quite efficient in terms of time and space complexity. However, there is one small tweak that could be applied.

Using the pow function from the cmath library to calculate the cube of the number could be slower than using the multiplication operator, as it may involve more complex operations. However, the code is already using multiplication, so we do not need to change this.

The only possible optimization for this code could be to avoid storing the value of n. Instead, we could directly compute the cube in the same line where the input is read. This would save a small amount of memory. 

Here is the optimized code:

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cout << (std::cin >> n, n * n * n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this version, we read the value of n and directly calculate its cube in one line. The comma operator is used here to execute two expressions (std::cin >> n and n * n * n) in sequence and return the result of the second expression. This removes the need for a separate line to print the result. 

This is a minimal optimization and the trade-off is that the code becomes slightly harder to read. This kind of optimization might be more relevant in scenarios where memory is extremely constrained. In general cases, the original version of the code is more readable and thus more preferable.
