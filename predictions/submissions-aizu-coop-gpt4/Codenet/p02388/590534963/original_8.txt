The given code is a simple C++ program that reads an integer from the user and outputs the cube of that integer. 

This code is already quite efficient, but there is a small optimization that can be made with respect to compiler instructions. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use fast I/O techniques for reading and writing integers.
2. Use compiler optimizations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Fast I/O Techniques: In competitive programming, where time efficiency is crucial, cin and cout can be slower than scanf and printf. Also, we can use '\n' instead of endl, as endl always flushes the output buffer and thus slows down the program.

2. Compiler Optimizations: We can ask the compiler to add some optimizations using flags such as -O2 or -O3. These flags tell the compiler to focus on code optimization during the compilation process. 

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    // Use fast I/O operations
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("%d\n", n * n * n);
    return 0;
}
```

To compile the optimized code with g++, you would use the command: `g++ -O2 -o program program.cpp`

Here, `-O2` tells the compiler to perform all optimization steps. `-o program` names the output file "program". Finally, `program.cpp` is the name of your source file. 

Please note that this micro-optimization will not make a big difference in real-world applications. However, in a competitive programming context where large inputs are processed and time is of the essence, this can help.

Also, keep in mind that using scanf and printf can make the code harder to read and more prone to errors, as these functions do not perform type checking. This is a trade-off you need to consider.
