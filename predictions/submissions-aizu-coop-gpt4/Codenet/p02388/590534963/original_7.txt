The given code is a simple program that reads an integer input from the user and calculates its cube. The code is already quite efficient with a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(1). However, there is a tiny scope for optimization in the mathematical operation.

1. Code Analysis:
   The mathematical operation of calculating the cube of a number involves three multiplications. The multiplication operation is more costly than addition or subtraction in terms of CPU cycles.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   We can use a compiler optimization called "strength reduction" in this case. Strength reduction is an optimization where costly operations like multiplication or division are replaced with cheaper ones like addition or subtraction without changing the result.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   Instead of doing three multiplications to calculate the cube of a number, we can calculate the square of the number first and store it in a variable. We then multiply this squared result with the original number. This reduces one multiplication operation.

   Trade-offs: There are no significant trade-offs in this case. The code complexity remains the same and we save some CPU cycles by reducing one multiplication operation.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int nSquare = n * n; //calculate square of the number first
  cout << n * nSquare << endl; //multiply the squared result with the original number
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code will produce the same output as the original code but with one less multiplication operation.
