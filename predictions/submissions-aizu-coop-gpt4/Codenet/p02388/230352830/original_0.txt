Code Analysis:
The provided code is relatively simple. It reads an integer from the user, calculates the cube of the integer, and then prints the result. There isn't much room for optimization here in terms of algorithmic complexity or data structure usage, as the code is straightforward and performs a minimal set of operations.

However, a potential performance bottleneck can be the redundant multiplication operation. In the code, 'x * x * x' is used to calculate the cube of the number. This involves two multiplication operations, which can be reduced to one.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Reducing the number of multiplication operations: The cube of a number x can also be calculated by multiplying the number by its square. This means that we can calculate the square of the number once, store it in a variable, and then use this variable to calculate the cube. This way, we only need to perform one multiplication operation.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Calculate the square of the number: First, we calculate the square of the number by multiplying the number by itself. We store this result in a variable. This is a single multiplication operation.
2. Calculate the cube of the number: We then multiply the number by its square (stored in the variable from the previous step) to calculate the cube. Again, this is a single multiplication operation. Thus, we have reduced the number of multiplication operations from two to one.

Trade-offs:
In this case, there are no significant trade-offs. The optimization does not increase the code complexity, and it can potentially lead to a minor performance gain.

Optimized Code Block:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int x, square;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  square = x * x; // Calculate the square of the number
  printf("%d\n", x * square); // Calculate the cube using the square
  return 0;
}
```
Note: This optimization may not lead to a noticeable performance gain in this simple program. However, in a larger program, or in a program where this calculation is performed many times, it could lead to a significant performance improvement.
