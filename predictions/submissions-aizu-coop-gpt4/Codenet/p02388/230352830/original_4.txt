The given program is a simple C program that takes an integer input from the user and prints the cube of the number. This program is already highly optimized in terms of time and space complexity, as it only involves a single computation (cubing the number) and a single variable (to hold the user's input). However, there are still a few things we can do to make it more efficient.

1. **Code Analysis**:
   In this program, there is no clear performance bottleneck as such. The program simply reads an integer from the standard input, calculates its cube and prints the result. The memory usage is minimal, with only one integer variable `x` being used. There are no complex data structures, recursive calls, or nested loops that could potentially slow down the execution.

2. **Optimization Strategy**:
   As mentioned earlier, this program is already quite efficient, but there are a couple of things we could tweak.
   1. Instead of using the multiplication operator `*` three times, we could use it twice. This is because the multiplication operator is generally more computationally expensive than other arithmetic operations.
   2. We could make the program more robust by adding error checking for the `scanf()` function, to handle any potential input errors.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
   1. The `scanf()` function returns the number of items successfully read. We can use this to check if the input was successfully read. If not, we can print an error message and return with a non-zero status code.
   2. Rather than using `x * x * x` to calculate the cube of `x`, we can use `x * x` to calculate the square of `x` and store it in a temporary variable. Then we multiply the result by `x` to get the cube. This reduces the number of multiplications from three to two, which could lead to a minor performance gain.

4. **Optimized Code Block**:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int x;
  if (scanf("%d", &x) != 1) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: Invalid input\n");
    return 1;
  }
  
  int square = x * x;
  printf("%d\n", square * x);
  
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the program has the same functionality but with slightly improved efficiency and added error handling for invalid input. Please note that the performance gain from reducing the number of multiplications is negligible for small inputs but may be noticeable for large inputs or if the operation is performed many times.
