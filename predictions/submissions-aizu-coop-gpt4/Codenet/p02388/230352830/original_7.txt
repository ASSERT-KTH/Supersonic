This is a very simple C program that takes an integer as input, cubes it and prints the result. It is already quite efficient. However, there is one minor optimization that could be made:

Instead of computing `x * x * x` directly in the `printf` statement, we could calculate it beforehand and store it in a variable. This change could potentially lead to a small performance improvement because we are reducing the number of operations that the processor has to perform when executing the `printf` statement. The difference will be negligible for this simple program, but for more complex programs, such optimizations can make a difference.

Here's how we could implement this improvement:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  
  int cube = x * x * x;  // Compute the cube of x
  
  printf("%d\n", cube);  // Print the result
  return 0;
}
```

In this version of the program, we compute `x * x * x` and store the result in the variable `cube` before we print the result. This change reduces the number of operations that the processor has to perform when executing the `printf` statement. This is a minor optimization, but every little bit counts in performance-critical code.
