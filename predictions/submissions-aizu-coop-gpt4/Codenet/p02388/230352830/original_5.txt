The given code is a simple C program that takes an integer as input, calculates its cube and prints the result. The program is already efficient, but there is a minor optimization that can be made.

1. Code Analysis: The code reads an integer, calculates its cube by performing two multiplications, and then prints the result.

2. Optimization Strategy: The only optimization we can make here is to avoid recomputation of the value 'x*x'. We can store it in a variable and use it again for the cube calculation.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Computation of 'x*x' is done twice. This is a redundant computation. Instead, we can compute it once, store it in a variable and then use this variable for further computation.
    2. The trade-off here is very minimal. We are trading a small increment in memory usage for a decrease in computation. As multiplication is a more costly operation than memory access, this is a beneficial trade-off.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  int x_square = x * x;  // Calculate x^2 only once and reuse it.
  printf("%d\n", x_square * x);  // Use the stored x^2 value to compute x^3.
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version reduces the number of multiplications from 2 to 1, which can provide a performance boost, especially when dealing with larger numbers or when this computation is part of a larger, more complex program where it could be executed multiple times.
