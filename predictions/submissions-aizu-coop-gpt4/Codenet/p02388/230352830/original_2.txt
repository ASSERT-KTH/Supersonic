The given C program reads an integer from the standard input, calculates its cube, and prints the result to the standard output. The program is quite simple and doesn't contain any obvious performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usage. However, there are still a couple of small improvements that can be made to optimize the code for efficiency.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use multiplication assignment operator: Instead of using the multiplication operator twice to calculate the cube of a number, we can use the multiplication assignment operator (`*=`) to reduce the number of operations.

2. Store the result in a variable: By storing the result of the multiplication in a variable, we can potentially make the program more efficient by avoiding the need to calculate the cube of the number twice.

Optimized Code:

Here is the optimized version of the original program, with comments explaining the changes:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int x, cube;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  
  // Calculate the cube of x
  cube = x;
  cube *= x * x;  // Use multiplication assignment operator
  
  printf("%d\n", cube);
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The multiplication assignment operator (`*=`) is used to calculate the cube of `x`. This operation could be more efficient because it reduces the number of operations, potentially leading to faster execution time.

2. The result of the multiplication is stored in the variable `cube`. This change could make the program more efficient by avoiding the need to calculate the cube of the number twice, if the compiler doesn't optimize this itself.

These optimizations are quite minor and may not have a noticeable impact on the performance of the program, given its simplicity. However, they illustrate good programming practices that can lead to more significant performance gains in larger, more complex programs. 

The trade-offs of these optimizations are also minimal. The code is arguably a bit more complex due to the introduction of an additional variable and the use of the multiplication assignment operator, but this should not pose a significant problem for most developers.
