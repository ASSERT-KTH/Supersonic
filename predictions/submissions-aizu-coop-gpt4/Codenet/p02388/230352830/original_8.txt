Code Analysis:
The given code reads an integer from the user, cubed it, and then outputs the result. The primary operation, the cubing of a number, is a simple operation that isn't a performance issue.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: N/A. The program only uses a single integer variable.
2. Redundant or Unnecessary Computations: The cube of a number is calculated by multiplying the number by itself twice. This is not a redundant or unnecessary computation.
3. Loops or Recursive Calls: N/A. The program does not contain any loops or recursive calls.
4. Compiler Optimizations or Pragma Directives: The code is simple enough that any compiler optimizations would likely have negligible impact on performance.

Given the simplicity of the code, there is little scope for any significant performance optimizations. However, one minor potential optimization could be using bitwise shift operators to perform the multiplication, as some processors can perform bitwise operations faster than multiplication. This would only be applicable and beneficial if the input number is guaranteed to be a power of 2.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The existing multiplication can be replaced with bitwise shift operations for numbers that are powers of 2. Instead of calculating x*x*x, we would calculate x<<3, which effectively multiplies x by 8 (2^3). This could potentially be faster on certain processors. However, the benefit is likely to be negligible given the simplicity of the operation and the fact that modern compilers will likely optimize this multiplication anyway. Furthermore, this optimization is only applicable for inputs that are powers of 2. 

Optimized Code Block:

Please note that I am assuming that the input number is guaranteed to be a power of 2, otherwise, we can't optimize the multiplication by using bit shifting.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  printf("%d\n", x << 3); // This is equivalent to x*8 if x is a power of 2.
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:
The main trade-off of this optimization is that it makes the code less clear. The expression x * x * x is intuitively understood to be the cube of x, whereas the expression x << 3 is not immediately recognizable as the same operation. This can make the code more difficult to understand and maintain. Furthermore, the optimization is only applicable for certain inputs (powers of 2), which limits its usefulness.
