The given program is a simple C program that reads an integer from the standard input, calculates its cube, and prints it to the standard output. The program is already quite efficient, but there are a few minor changes that could be made to improve its performance slightly:

1. **Code Analysis:**
   - The program involves a single computation (cube of a number), which is straightforward and efficient.
   - The I/O operations (`scanf` and `printf`) are relatively expensive in terms of performance, but they are necessary for the program's functionality. 
   - For a very large input number, the multiplication operation can be slow. 

2. **Optimization Strategy:**
   - Use bitwise shift operators for the multiplication operation to calculate the cube of a number, as bitwise operations are faster than multiplication.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
   - The cube of a number 'n' can be calculated as (n * n * n). But for a large number, it can be slow. 
   - Instead, we can use left shift operator which is faster than multiplication operation.
   - The left shift operator '<<' shifts the bits of the number to the left and fills 0 on voids left as a result. So, (n << 1) will give us the double of the number. 
   - To calculate cube, we can use combination of shift and multiplication, like (n * n) << 1.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  printf("%d\n", (x*x) << 1);
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that this optimization will only be effective for large numbers and its impact will be minimal for small numbers. It may also lead to incorrect results if the number is too large to handle by integer datatype.
