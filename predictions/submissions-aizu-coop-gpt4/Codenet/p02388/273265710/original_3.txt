## Code Analysis
The given code is quite simple. It reads an integer input from the user and cubes this number (multiplies it by itself three times). The user input is validated to be between 0 and 100, inclusive. The cube operation is performed through a decrementing loop that multiplies a result variable by the input number three times.

## Optimization Strategy
1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The program doesn't use any complex data structures, so no optimizations are needed in this regard.
2. **Redundant Computations:** The cube operation is performed by using a loop. This is redundant, as the cube operation can be done directly (inputNum * inputNum * inputNum). This operation is simple enough that the overhead of the loop is likely greater than the computation itself.
3. **Loops:** The loop used for the cube operation can be eliminated entirely, as described above.
4. **Compiler Optimizations:** Since the input range is limited to 100, and the cube of 100 still fits into a 32-bit integer, we can use the `int32_t` type from the `cstdint` library, which may allow the compiler to make additional optimizations.

## Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **Rationale:** Eliminating the loop used for the cube operation will reduce the number of operations that the program has to perform. This should lead to a slight improvement in performance.
2. **Trade-offs:** This change should not increase the complexity of the code. In fact, it will make it more straightforward and easier to understand.

## Optimized Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint>
using namespace std;

void cubedNum(void) {
  int32_t inputNum = -1;
  while (1) {
    cin >> inputNum;
    if ((0 <= inputNum) && (inputNum <= 100)) {
      break;
    }
  }

  // we directly cube inputNum, no need for a loop
  int32_t result = inputNum * inputNum * inputNum;
  cout << result << endl;

  return;
}

int main(void) {
  cubedNum();
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates the redundant loop, making the code shorter and easier to understand, while also potentially improving performance.
