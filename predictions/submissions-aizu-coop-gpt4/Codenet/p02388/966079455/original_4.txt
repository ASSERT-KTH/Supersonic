This small piece of code is quite efficient as it stands. However, there are a few tiny optimizations we can make. 

1. Code Analysis: The program reads an integer from the standard input, cubes it, and prints the result to the standard output. 

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. Use of inefficient data structures: The program doesn't use any data structures. Hence, no optimization is required here.
   2. Redundant or unnecessary computations: There's a single computation (cubing the integer), which is necessary. Hence, no redundant computations to optimize.
   3. Loops or recursive calls: The program doesn't contain any loops or recursive calls to optimize.
   4. Compiler optimizations or pragma directives: Since the code is quite simple, there is no scope for any compiler directive based optimizations.

However, we can make the following optimizations:
   1. Reduce the scope of variables: In C++, it's a good practice to reduce the scope of variables as much as possible. In this case, we can declare `x` and `y` just before they are used.
   2. Use fast IO: For extremely large inputs and outputs, `cin` and `cout` can be slow. Replacing them with faster alternatives can improve runtime.
   3. Avoid flushing the output buffer unnecessarily: `std::endl` flushes the output buffer, which takes time. We can replace it with "\n" to avoid this.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Declare `x` and `y` just before they are first used. This reduces their scope, making the code a little bit cleaner.
   2. Replace `std::cin` and `std::cout` with `scanf` and `printf`, respectively, for faster input and output.
   3. Replace `std::endl` with "\n" to avoid flushing the output buffer.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  int y = x * x * x;
  printf("%d\n", y);
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations will likely have a negligible impact on runtime for this particular program, as it is quite simple. However, they can be more beneficial in larger, more complex programs.
