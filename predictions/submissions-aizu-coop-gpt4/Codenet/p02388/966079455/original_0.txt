This is a simple C++ program to calculate the cube of a user-defined number `x`. It reads an input integer, calculates its cube, and prints the result. The program itself is straightforward and doesn't have many performance issues due to its simplicity. However, there is a tiny optimization we can consider.

Code Analysis:
The only significant operation in this code is the calculation of the cube of `x`, which is done as `x * x * x`. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. One optimization could be to use bit-shifting operators instead of multiplication operators to calculate the cube. Bit-shifting is a more low-level operation and is typically faster than multiplication. However, this optimization may not lead to noticeable performance gains in this specific case, because modern compilers are quite smart and may already optimize these multiplication operations to bit-shifting operations behind the scenes. 

2. The use of the `endl` manipulator to print a newline character and flush the output buffer could be replaced with a simple `"\n"`, which does not flush the buffer. This is generally faster, although again, the difference may not be noticeable in this specific case.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace `x * x * x` with `x << 3`, which is equivalent to `x * 8`. This operation should be faster since bit-shifting is a more low-level operation than multiplication. However, keep in mind that the performance gain may not be noticeable because modern compilers are already very good at optimizing these kinds of operations.  
2. Replace `std::endl` with `"\n"`. This avoids flushing the output buffer, which is generally a slow operation. 

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int x, y;
  std::cin >> x;
  y = x << 3;
  std::cout << y << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Note: Although these optimizations theoretically improve performance, the gains are likely to be very minimal and perhaps even unnoticeable, given the simplicity of the original program. In real-world applications, the most effective optimizations usually come from improving the algorithmic complexity of the code, not from micro-optimizations like these.
