Code Analysis:
The given C++ code reads an integer `x` from the input, cubes it to get `y`, and then outputs `y`. The code is simple and there aren't many operations happening that could be considered performance bottlenecks.

However, the multiplication operation for calculating the cube could be optimized slightly. Also, the reading and writing operations can be tuned for a bit of performance improvement.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use bitwise shift operators instead of multiplication to calculate the cube.
2. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` to unsynchronize C++'s standard streams with their corresponding C streams. This will make I/O operations faster.
3. Use '\n' instead of `std::endl` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output buffer, which can slow down the program.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Bitwise Shift Optimization: We can replace the cube calculation `y = x * x * x` with `y = x << 3`. The left shift operator `<<` shifts bits to the left, effectively multiplying the number by 2 for each shift. However, we must be careful to first check if the number is small enough to not cause overflow. Because the number is cubed, we should ensure it's less than or equal to 1290 (since 1290^3 is approximately the max value for an int on most systems). If it's greater, we'll use the multiplication method to avoid erroneous results.
2. I/O Operations: By setting `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`, we disable the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. By default, these are synchronized to ensure a predictable order between C and C++ I/O operations, but if we're not mixing them, we can disable this for a performance gain.
3. Buffer Flushing: The `std::endl` not only inserts a newline character but also flushes the output buffer, which can slow down our program. Since we don't need to flush the buffer immediately, we can use '\n' instead.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int x, y;
  std::cin >> x;

  if(std::abs(x) <= 1290) {
    y = x << 3; // Faster than multiplication for smaller numbers
  } else {
    y = x * x * x; // Safe for larger numbers
  }

  std::cout << y << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```
Please note that, the optimization here might not significantly boost the performance as the original code is already quite efficient and the operations being optimized are not very expensive. However, in a larger codebase or more complex operations, these small optimizations can add up. It is always important to measure performance before and after optimization to ensure that the changes are indeed beneficial.
