The given C++ program reads an integer from the user, calculates the cube of the read integer, and then outputs it. 

This code is already quite efficient. It's a simple program that takes an integer as input, cubes it, and then prints the result. There is no loop or recursive call in this code. The only operation performed is one multiplication operation, which is quite efficient. 

However, there is a minor optimization that can be done to the multiplication operation to reduce the number of multiplications.

## Optimization Strategy
1. Reducing the number of multiplications: Currently, the program calculates the cube of the number by multiplying the number by itself twice (`x * x * x`). This requires two multiplication operations. We could reduce this to one multiplication operation by storing the result of `x * x` in a temporary variable and then multiplying this result by `x`.

## Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Reduce the number of multiplications: We can introduce a temporary variable to store the result of `x * x` and then multiply this by `x`. This will reduce the number of multiplications from two to one, which should improve performance, especially when dealing with large numbers. The trade-off is the slightly increased memory usage to store the temporary variable, but this should not be a significant issue in most cases.

## Optimized Code Block
Below is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int x, y;
  std::cin >> x;
  int temp = x * x;     // Store the result of x * x in a temporary variable
  y = temp * x;         // Now, multiply the result by x, reducing the number of multiplications
  std::cout << y << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Please note, this optimization might not be noticeable in this simple code and for small numbers, as multiplication operation is already quite efficient in modern processors. But the idea of reducing the number of operations is a good practice in performance tuning.
