Analysis:
The provided code block is a simple C++ program that reads an integer from the standard input, cubes it, and then prints the result. The primary operations here are input/output and a single arithmetic operation (cubing). The code doesn't have any obvious performance bottlenecks, inefficient memory usage, or any other areas that might benefit from major optimization. 

However, there are a couple of small improvements that could be made:

1. The current code does not check if the input provided by the user is valid. If the input is not a number, the behavior of the program is undefined, which is a potential source of errors.

2. A small performance improvement could be achieved by reducing the number of multiplication operations. The current code calculates the cube by performing two multiplications (x * x * x). This could be reduced to a single multiplication operation by storing the result of x * x in a variable and then multiplying this by x.

Optimized Code:

Here's how we could optimize this code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int x;
  // Check if the input is valid
  if (!(std::cin >> x)) {
    std::cerr << "Invalid input\n";
    return 1;
  }

  // Reduce the number of multiplications
  int x_square = x * x;
  int y = x_square * x;

  std::cout << y << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. A check is added to make sure the input is valid. If `std::cin >> x` fails (because the input is not a number), the program prints an error message and exits with a status code of 1. This makes the program more robust and prevents undefined behavior in case of invalid input.

2. The number of multiplication operations is reduced from two to one. Firstly, the square of x is calculated and stored in the variable `x_square`. Then, `x_square` is multiplied by x to get the cube. While this might not result in a significant performance improvement for single calculations, it could make a difference when cubing large numbers or when performing the operation multiple times.

Trade-offs:

The optimized code is slightly more complex than the original one due to the added input validation check. However, this additional complexity improves the robustness of the program and helps prevent potential errors. The reduction in the number of multiplication operations may not lead to a significant performance improvement in this particular case but is generally a good practice to follow, especially in more complex programs or when dealing with larger numbers.
