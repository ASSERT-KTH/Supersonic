The given C++ program is quite simple and efficient in nature. It takes an integer input from the user, calculates its cube and prints it. However, for the sake of the task, we can consider a minor optimization. The current program is using an arithmetic operation (multiplication) three times, which we can reduce to two times.

1. **Code Analysis:** 
    1. The program takes an integer as input, cubes it, and prints the result. 
    2. The cube is calculated by multiplying the number by itself twice.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**
    1. **Data Structures:** The program does not use any complex data structure, so no optimization is needed in this area.
    2. **Redundant Computations:** The cube is calculated by multiplying the number by itself twice. This computation is not redundant but can be optimized to reduce the number of multiplications.
    3. **Loops or Recursive Calls:** There are no loops or recursive calls in the program, so no optimization is needed in this area.
    4. **Compiler Optimizations:** The program is simple and does not require any specific compiler optimizations.
    
3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
    1. The only optimization we can apply here is to reduce the number of multiplications in the cube calculation.
    2. Instead of calculating `x * x * x`, we can calculate `(x * x) * x` which also results in the cube but reduces the number of multiplications to two.
    3. This optimization will not have a noticeable impact on the performance of this simple program, but it illustrates the concept of reducing computations.
    4. The trade-off here is negligible; we are simply changing the way the cube is calculated without affecting the functionality or the performance of the program in a noticeable way.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**
```c++
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int x, y;
  std::cin >> x;
  y = x * x; // Calculate x^2
  y = y * x; // Multiply x^2 by x to get x^3
  std::cout << y << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code performs the same function as the original, but with one fewer multiplication operation. It is important to note, though, that modern compilers are already very good at optimizing such cases. For instance, they might automatically convert `x * x * x` into `(x * x) * x` or even recognize that this is a cube operation and use a faster method if available.
