This is a very simple C++ program that reads an integer from the user, computes its cube, and prints it to the console. The code, in its current form, is already quite efficient, but we can still apply a few minor optimizations.

1. Code Analysis:
The program consists of three operations: reading an integer from the user, calculating the cube of the number, and printing the result. There are no apparent performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usage in this program. 

2. Optimization Strategy:
A. The program uses standard I/O operations, which are usually slower than their counterparts like scanf/printf. We can replace cin/cout with scanf/printf to get a slight improvement in I/O operations.
B. We can avoid the use of the extra variable 'y', and directly compute and print the result in the output statement.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
A. Replace cin/cout with scanf/printf: scanf and printf are a bit faster than cin and cout in terms of I/O operations. This is because cin/cout are overloaded with a lot of functionalities which make them slower. Although the difference won't be noticeable in this simple program, it's good to keep this in mind for larger programs with heavy I/O operations.
B. Avoid the use of the extra variable 'y': Instead of storing the result in an extra variable 'y', we can directly print the result. This avoids the extra memory allocation for 'y'.

Trade-offs: 
The use of scanf/printf over cin/cout can lead to less readable and less safe code, as scanf/printf don't perform type checking. However, in our scenario, as we are dealing with a simple integer, this should not be a problem.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
int main() {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  printf("%d\n", x * x * x);
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have replaced cin/cout with scanf/printf for faster I/O operations. Also, we have removed the extra variable 'y' and computed the cube directly in the printf statement.
