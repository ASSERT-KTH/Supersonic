Code Analysis:

The given code reads an integer from the user, cubes it, and then prints the result. While this is a simple program with no obvious performance issues, there is a small potential for optimization in the calculation of the cube of x.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Computations: The multiplication operation to calculate the cube of x is done in two steps, which can be optimized.

2. Compiler Optimization: The multiplication operation can be optimized by using a compiler optimization flag, like -O2 or -O3.

Optimization Steps:

1. Instead of calculating x * x * x, we can store the value of x * x in a temporary variable, and then multiply that by x. This reduces one multiplication operation.

2. When compiling the code, we can use the -O2 or -O3 optimization flags. These flags tell the compiler to optimize the code with respect to speed.

Trade-offs:

1. The optimization of the multiplication operation might make the code slightly less readable, as we're introducing an extra variable and an extra line of code. However, the performance gain from this optimization is minor, as modern compilers are usually able to optimize such computations by themselves.

2. Using the -O2 or -O3 optimization flags can make the compilation process longer, and the resulting code might be harder to debug. But in this case, since the program is simple, these issues are minimal.

Optimized Code:

```
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int x, y;
  std::cin >> x;
  int temp = x * x;  // calculate x * x once and store it in a temporary variable
  y = temp * x;  // multiply the result by x to get x * x * x
  std::cout << y << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

When compiling the code, use the -O2 or -O3 optimization flag, like so:

```
g++ -O2 program.cpp
```

or

```
g++ -O3 program.cpp
```

This will tell the compiler to optimize the code for speed.
