This code is a typical implementation of a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm in a 2D grid. The program is reading a 2D grid from the input, then it is determining if there is a path from a start location ('L') to an end location ('R') in the grid, considering that it can move only to free locations (not marked with '#').

After analyzing the code, the main performance bottleneck is the BFS procedure itself. The code is using a 4D array to mark visited states. This is both time and space inefficient.

## Optimization Strategy

1. Use a more efficient data structure: The 4D array used to mark visited states is inefficient in terms of memory usage. Instead, a hash map can be used to mark visited states. This can significantly reduce the memory footprint for sparse grid configurations.

2. Avoid unnecessary computations and data copying: When the BFS function pops a node from the queue, it creates a copy of the node which is unnecessary. Instead, a reference to the front can be used.

3. Use compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations can also be used to further improve the performance of the code. The -O3 flag in g++ enables all compiler optimizations.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Replace the 4D array with a hash map: The key of the hash map can be a tuple of four integers representing the state, and the value can be a boolean indicating whether the state has been visited or not. This can significantly reduce the memory usage especially when the grid is sparse. The trade-off of this optimization is that the hash map access time is slower than the array access time, but this is usually negligible compared to the memory saving.

2. Avoid unnecessary data copying: In the BFS function, instead of creating a copy of the front node when popping it from the queue, we can use a reference to the front node. This avoids unnecessary data copying which can improve performance. The trade-off of this optimization is that it slightly increases the complexity of the code.

3. Use compiler optimizations: The -O3 flag in g++ enables all compiler optimizations. This can significantly improve the performance of the code. The trade-off is that the code might become harder to debug, but this is usually not an issue for the final version of the code.

## Optimized Code Block

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <tuple>
using namespace std;
struct po {
  int lx, ly, rx, ry;
};
int w, h;
string mp[2][51];
unordered_map<tuple<int, int, int, int>, bool> visited;
int dx[4] = {0, 0, 1, -1};
int dy[4] = {1, -1, 0, 0};
bool bfs(int lx, int ly, int rx, int ry) {
  queue<po> Q;
  Q.push((po){lx, ly, rx, ry});
  while (!Q.empty()) {
    po& t = Q.front();
    Q.pop();
    int cnt = (mp[0][t.ly][t.lx] == '%') + (mp[1][t.ry][t.rx] == '%');
    if (cnt == 2)
      return true;
    if (visited[make_tuple(t.lx, t.ly, t.rx, t.ry)] || cnt == 1)
      continue;
    visited[make_tuple(t.lx, t.ly, t.rx, t.ry)] = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      int flg = 0;
      int nlx = t.lx + dx[i], nly = t.ly + dy[i];
      int nrx = t.rx - dx[i], nry = t.ry + dy[i];
      if (nlx < 0 || nly < 0 || nlx >= w || nly >= h || mp[0][nly][nlx] == '#')
        nlx = t.lx, nly = t.ly, flg++;
      if (nrx < 0 || nry < 0 || nrx >= w || nry >= h || mp[1][nry][nrx] == '#')
        nrx = t.rx, nry = t.ry, flg++;
      if (flg == 2)
        continue;
      Q.push((po){nlx, nly, nrx, nry});
    }
  }
  return false;
}
int main() {
  while (1) {
    cin >> w >> h;
    if (!w && !h)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      cin >> mp[0][i] >> mp[1][i];
    int lx, ly, rx, ry;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        if (mp[0][i][j] == 'L')
          lx = j, ly = i;
        if (mp[1][i][j] == 'R')
          rx = j, ry = i;
      }
    visited.clear();
    if (bfs(lx, ly, rx, ry))
      cout << "Yes" << endl;
    else
      cout << "No" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

To compile the code with optimizations, use the following command:

```bash
g++ -O3 -o optimized_program optimized_program.cpp
```

Note: This command should be run in a terminal. It compiles the C++ code in the file `optimized_program.cpp` with the `-O3` optimization level, and produces an executable named `optimized_program`.
