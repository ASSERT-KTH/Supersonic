Code Analysis:

This code is a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm that navigates a 2D maze using two points 'L' and 'R'. It checks for the possibility of both 'L' and 'R' reaching a destination '%'. 

The main performance bottleneck of this code is the BFS algorithm itself, which has a time complexity of O(|V|+|E|), where |V| is the number of vertices and |E| is the number of edges in the graph. In the worst-case scenario, the BFS algorithm must visit every vertex and traverse through every edge once. 

Another performance issue is memory usage. The program uses a 4D array `visited[][][][]` to keep track of the visited nodes, which could potentially take a lot of memory space, especially if the width and height of the maze are large.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Efficient Data Structures: The current data structures are suitable for this application, and changing them might complicate the logic of the program. The queue used in BFS is necessary for maintaining the BFS property of visiting each level before moving on to the next. It is also necessary to use a 4D array to store the visited state of both 'L' and 'R' at each point in the maze.

2. Redundant Computations: Each time the program checks whether a move is within the bounds of the maze and not blocked by a wall, it repeats the same boundary and wall checks for 'L' and 'R'. This redundancy could be reduced by creating a function to perform these checks.

3. Loop optimization: Loop unrolling or tail recursion optimization wouldn't significantly improve the performance of this program because the main time complexity comes from the BFS process, which requires visiting all nodes.

4. Compiler optimizations: Using `-O2` or `-O3` compiler optimization flags during the compilation process could allow the compiler to apply several code optimization techniques automatically.

Optimization Steps:

1. Create a function to perform boundary and wall checks: Refactor the code to create a function that checks if a move is within the boundaries of the maze and not blocked by a wall. This function can then be called for both 'L' and 'R', reducing code redundancy.

2. Use compiler optimization flags: Compile the code with `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flags to allow the compiler to automatically optimize the code.

Trade-offs:

1. Code complexity vs Performance gain: Refactoring the code to create a function for boundary and wall checks can make the code a bit more complex. However, it reduces code redundancy, which can improve readability and maintainability.

2. Compiler optimization flags: Using higher-level optimization flags like `-O3` can sometimes lead to longer compilation times and unpredictable behavior, but they can often lead to significant performance improvements.

Optimized Code Block:

Here's the optimized version of the code.

```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

struct po {
  int lx, ly, rx, ry;
};

int w, h;
string mp[2][51];
bool visited[51][51][51][51];
int dx[4] = {0, 0, 1, -1};
int dy[4] = {1, -1, 0, 0};

bool checkBoundaryAndWall(int &nx, int &ny, int i, int j, int d) {
  nx = i + dx[d], ny = j + dy[d];
  if (nx < 0 || ny < 0 || nx >= w || ny >= h || mp[0][ny][nx] == '#') {
    nx = i, ny = j;
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}

bool bfs(int lx, int ly, int rx, int ry) {
  queue<po> Q;
  Q.push((po){lx, ly, rx, ry});
  while (!Q.empty()) {
    po t = Q.front();
    Q.pop();
    int cnt = (mp[0][t.ly][t.lx] == '%') + (mp[1][t.ry][t.rx] == '%');
    if (cnt == 2)
      return true;
    if (visited[t.lx][t.ly][t.rx][t.ry] || cnt == 1)
      continue;
    visited[t.lx][t.ly][t.rx][t.ry] = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      int flg = 0;
      int nlx, nly, nrx, nry;
      flg += checkBoundaryAndWall(nlx, nly, t.lx, t.ly, i);
      flg += checkBoundaryAndWall(nrx, nry, t.rx, t.ry, i);
      if (flg == 2)
        continue;
      Q.push((po){nlx, nly, nrx, nry});
    }
  }
  return false;
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    cin >> w >> h;
    if (!w && !h)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      cin >> mp[0][i] >> mp[1][i];
    int lx, ly, rx, ry;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        if (mp[0][i][j] == 'L')
          lx = j, ly = i;
        if (mp[1][i][j] == 'R')
          rx = j, ry = i;
      }
    memset(visited, 0, sizeof(visited));
    if (bfs(lx, ly, rx, ry))
      cout << "Yes" << endl;
    else
      cout << "No" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
