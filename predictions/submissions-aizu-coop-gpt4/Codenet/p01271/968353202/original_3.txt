At first glance, this algorithm is a breadth-first search (BFS) that operates on a 4D grid (represented by the 4D visited array). The grid dimensions are determined by the width and height of two maps (mp[0] and mp[1]). The algorithm's time complexity is O(w^2 * h^2), which is quite high and could be a potential bottleneck for large inputs.

Here are the optimization strategies that we can apply to improve the performance:

1. Use an optimized data structure for visited:
    Currently, the visited array is a 4D boolean array, which is memory-inefficient, especially for large inputs. We can change the visited array to a hash set that only stores the visited states. This way, we only use memory when we need it, and lookup times remain constant.

2. Avoid unnecessary calculations:
    The variable 'cnt' is calculated at the beginning of each loop iteration. However, this calculation is not necessary for all iterations, especially when the current state has been visited. We can move this calculation down, after the visited check.

3. Use compiler optimizations:
    Turning on compiler optimizations like `-O2` or `-O3` can significantly improve the runtime of the program. These flags instruct the compiler to perform optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and dead code elimination.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

struct po {
    int lx, ly, rx, ry;
};

int w, h;
string mp[2][51];
unordered_set<long long> visited;
int dx[4] = {0, 0, 1, -1};
int dy[4] = {1, -1, 0, 0};

bool bfs(int lx, int ly, int rx, int ry) {
    queue<po> Q;
    Q.push({lx, ly, rx, ry});
    while (!Q.empty()) {
        po t = Q.front(); Q.pop();

        // check if visited
        long long state = t.lx + (long long)t.ly*w + (long long)t.rx*w*h + (long long)t.ry*w*h*w;
        if (visited.count(state)) continue;
        visited.insert(state);

        // cnt calculation moved after visited check
        int cnt = (mp[0][t.ly][t.lx] == '%') + (mp[1][t.ry][t.rx] == '%');
        if (cnt == 2) return true;
        if (cnt == 1) continue;

        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int flg = 0;
            int nlx = t.lx + dx[i], nly = t.ly + dy[i];
            int nrx = t.rx - dx[i], nry = t.ry + dy[i];
            if (nlx < 0 || nly < 0 || nlx >= w || nly >= h || mp[0][nly][nlx] == '#')
                nlx = t.lx, nly = t.ly, flg++;
            if (nrx < 0 || nry < 0 || nrx >= w || nry >= h || mp[1][nry][nrx] == '#')
                nrx = t.rx, nry = t.ry, flg++;
            if (flg == 2) continue;
            Q.push({nlx, nly, nrx, nry});
        }
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL); // fast I/O

    while (1) {
        cin >> w >> h;
        if (!w && !h) break;

        for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
            cin >> mp[0][i] >> mp[1][i];

        int lx, ly, rx, ry;
        for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
                if (mp[0][i][j] == 'L') lx = j, ly = i;
                if (mp[1][i][j] == 'R') rx = j, ry = i;
            }

        visited.clear();
        if (bfs(lx, ly, rx, ry)) cout << "Yes\n";
        else cout << "No\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the code still has the same functionality as the original but uses less memory and runs faster. However, it introduces a trade-off: the new version of the code is slightly more complex due to the use of a hash set for visited states and the calculation of a unique state key for each 4D state.
