This C++ program primarily calculates and prints the positions and radii of two circles within a given rectangle, such that the sum of areas of the two circles and the overlapping area matches the given inputs. If such placement is impossible, it prints "impossible".

Here are some steps to optimize the program:

1. Code Analysis:
    1. Inefficient use of #include <bits/stdc++.h> which includes all standard libraries, many of which are not used in the program.
    2. Use of the macro REP(i, n) for loop control is unnecessary complexity.
    3. The solve function has several repetitive code blocks, which can be consolidated to reduce redundancy and improve readability.
    4. There are multiple calls to the math functions sqrt, acos, and sin which can be optimized.
    5. Usage of assert statements for debugging purposes can be removed in the final optimized version.
    6. The usage of printf for output can be replaced with cout for consistency.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Use only the necessary includes instead of <bits/stdc++.h>.
    2. Remove the macro REP and replace it with regular for loops.
    3. Consolidate the repetitive parts of the code into helper functions.
    4. Make use of precalculated or cached results for costly mathematical operations where possible.
    5. Remove assert statements.
    6. Replace printf with cout for consistency.

Let's go through the step-by-step optimization process:

1. Replace #include <bits/stdc++.h> with necessary libraries:

    ```c++
    #include <iostream>
    #include <cmath>
    #include <cassert>
    ```

2. Remove the macro REP and replace with normal for loops:

    ```c++
    for (int _ = 0; _ < 80; ++_) {...}
    ```

3. To reduce code redundancy, separate the common logic in the solve function into a new function, print_results:

    ```c++
    void print_results(double xa, double ya, double ra, double xb, double yb, double rb, bool reversed) {
      if (!reversed) {
        cout << fixed << setprecision(9) << xa << " " << ya << " " << ra << " " << xb << " " << yb << " " << rb << "\n";
      } else {
        cout << fixed << setprecision(9) << xb << " " << yb << " " << rb << " " << xa << " " << ya << " " << ra << "\n";
      }
    }
    ```

4. Remove assert statements in the solve function.

5. Precalculate square of radii in the solve function to optimize mathematical operations:

    ```c++
    double ra_sq = sa / M_PI;
    double rb_sq = sb / M_PI;
    double ra = sqrt(ra_sq);
    double rb = sqrt(rb_sq);
    ```

6. Replace printf statements with cout in the print_results function for consistency.

Below is the optimized code block:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

const double EPS = 1e-4;

double calc(double ra, double rb, double s) {
  double lb = abs(ra - rb);
  double ub = ra + rb;
  for (int _ = 0; _ < 80; ++_) {
    double d = (lb + ub) / 2;
    double tha = acos((ra * ra + d * d - rb * rb) / (2.0 * d * ra));
    double thb = acos((rb * rb + d * d - ra * ra) / (2.0 * d * rb));
    double sum = ra * ra * tha + rb * rb * thb - ra * d * sin(tha);
    if (sum > s) {
      lb = d;
    } else {
      ub = d;
    }
  }
  return ub;
}

double sq(double x) { return x * x; }

bool judge(double x, double y, double r, double W, double H) {
  return x - r > -EPS && x + r < W + EPS && y - r > -EPS && y + r < H + EPS;
}

void print_results(double xa, double ya, double ra, double xb, double yb, double rb, bool reversed) {
  if (!reversed) {
    cout << fixed << setprecision(9) << xa << " " << ya << " " << ra << " " << xb << " " << yb << " " << rb << "\n";
  } else {
    cout << fixed << setprecision(9) << xb << " " << yb << " " << rb << " " << xa << " " << ya << " " << ra << "\n";
  }
}

bool solve(double W, double H, double sa, double sb, double sc, bool reversed) {
  
  double ra_sq = sa / M_PI;
  double rb_sq = sb / M_PI;
  double ra = sqrt(ra_sq);
  double rb = sqrt(rb_sq);
  
  if (2.0 * ra > min(W, H) + EPS)
    return false;
  if (2.0 * rb > min(W, H) + EPS)
    return false;
    
  double D = calc(ra, rb, sc);
  double xa = ra;
  double ya = ra;
  
  for (double xb : {ra, rb, W - rb}) {
    double dy = sqrt(sq(D) - sq(xa - xb));
    for (int sign = -1; sign <= 1; sign += 2) {
      double yb = ya + sign * dy;
      if (judge(xb, yb, rb, W, H)) {
        print_results(xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb, reversed);
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  
  for (double yb : {ra, rb, H - rb}) {
    double dx = sqrt(sq(D) - sq(ya - yb));
    for (int sign = -1; sign <= 1; sign += 2) {
      double xb = xa + sign * dx;
      if (judge(xb, yb, rb, W, H)) {
        print_results(xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb, reversed);
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  
  return false;
}

int main() {
  double W, H, sa, sb, sc;
  while (cin >> W >> H >> sa >> sb >> sc && W > 0) {
    if (solve(W, H, sa, sb, sc, false))
      continue;
    if (solve(W, H, sb, sa, sc, true))
      continue;
    cout << "impossible" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
