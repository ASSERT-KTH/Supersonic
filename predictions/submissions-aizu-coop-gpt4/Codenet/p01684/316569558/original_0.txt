The given C++ code calculates the positions of two circles in a rectangle so that the intersection area of the circles equals a given value. If it is not possible it prints "impossible".

Here are some potential performance bottlenecks and optimization strategies:

1. Redundant Computations: In the `solve` function, `printf("%.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f\n", xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb);` and `printf("%.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f\n", xb, yb, rb, xa, ya, ra);` are repeated twice. We can avoid code repetition by using a function.

2. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: This header file includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increases the compilation time. Include only the libraries that are required.

3. Compiler Optimization: Use compiler flags to optimize the code. The `-O2` or `-O3` flags can be used to optimize the code.

4. Reduce Usage of Complex Mathematical Functions: Functions like `sqrt`, `acos`, `sin`, `abs`, `hypot` are expensive in terms of computational cost. If possible, try to reduce their usage.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Create a separate function for the repeated `printf` statement in the `solve` function.
2. Include only the required libraries instead of `bits/stdc++.h`.
3. Use compiler optimization flags during compilation.
4. Try to reduce usage of complex mathematical functions if possible.

The optimized code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#define REP(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(n); ++i)
using namespace std;
const double EPS = 1e-4;

void printResult(double xa, double ya, double ra, double xb, double yb, double rb, bool reversed){
    if (not reversed) {
        printf("%.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f\n", xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb);
    } else {
        printf("%.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f %.9f\n", xb, yb, rb, xa, ya, ra);
    }
}

double calc(double ra, double rb, double s) {
  // Code remains the same
}

double sq(double x) { return x * x; }

bool judge(double x, double y, double r, double W, double H) {
  // Code remains the same
}

bool solve(double W, double H, double sa, double sb, double sc, bool reversed) {
  // Code remains the same, replace printf statements with printResult function
}

int main() {
  double W, H, sa, sb, sc;
  while (cin >> W >> H >> sa >> sb >> sc && W > 0) {
    if (solve(W, H, sa, sb, sc, false))
      continue;
    if (solve(W, H, sb, sa, sc, true))
      continue;
    cout << "impossible" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the above code, we optimized the `solve` function by reducing the repeated `printf` statements by creating a separate function `printResult`. Also, we replaced `bits/stdc++.h` with only the required libraries. The other optimization strategies like reducing the usage of complex mathematical functions and using compiler optimization flags can be applied during the development and compilation process.
