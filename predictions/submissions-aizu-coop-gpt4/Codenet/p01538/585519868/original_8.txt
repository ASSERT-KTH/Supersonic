Code Analysis:
The provided code seems to be an algorithm for a problem where we calculate the maximum product of two numbers formed by splitting a number N into two parts, then replacing N with the maximum product obtained, and repeat these steps until we either get a single digit number or encounter a number that has been encountered before. The code is implemented in C++ and the major performance bottlenecks are:

1. It uses a dynamic array 'table' of size 1000001 and initializes it with false in each query. This is a costly operation as it takes O(1000001) time in each query.

2. In each iteration of the while loop, it computes the maximum product by looping through all possible splits of the number N. This is also an expensive operation.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Instead of initializing the entire 'table' array in each query, we can just initialize the elements that we have updated in the previous query. This will reduce the time complexity from O(1000001) to O(number of iterations).

2. We can optimize the computation of the maximum product by observing that the maximum product will always be obtained by splitting the number N such that the two parts have the smallest difference. We can find these two parts by dividing N by 2.

3. We can also use a std::unordered_set instead of a dynamic boolean array to keep track of the numbers that we have encountered before. This will reduce the space complexity and also make the look up operation faster.

4. We can also use std::cin and std::cout instead of scanf() and printf() for input and output operations. This will make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Instead of using a dynamic boolean array 'table', use a std::unordered_set 'visited'. This will reduce the space complexity and also make the look up operation faster. Also, instead of initializing the 'visited' set in each query, just clear it at the end of each query. This will reduce the time complexity from O(1000001) to O(number of iterations).

2. Optimize the computation of the maximum product by observing that the maximum product will always be obtained by splitting the number N such that the two parts have the smallest difference. We can find these two parts by dividing N by 2. This will reduce the time complexity from O(logN) to O(1) in each iteration of the while loop.

3. Use std::cin and std::cout instead of scanf() and printf() for input and output operations. This will make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int Q, N, count, max;
  bool FLG;
  cin >> Q;
  unordered_set<int> visited;
  for (int loop = 0; loop < Q; loop++) {
    visited.clear();
    count = 0;
    cin >> N;
    visited.insert(N);
    FLG = false;
    while (N / 10 != 0) {
      max = (N/2) * (N - N/2);
      N = max;
      if (visited.count(N) > 0) {
        FLG = true;
        break;
      } else {
        visited.insert(N);
        count++;
      }
    }
    if (FLG) {
      cout << "-1\n";
    } else {
      cout << count << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
