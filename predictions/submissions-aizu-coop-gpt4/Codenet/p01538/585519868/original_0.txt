Code Analysis:

The main performance bottlenecks in the provided code are:

1. The initialization of `table` for each iteration of the outer loop. In each iteration, the program is setting every entry of `table` to `false`, which has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the size of the table. This is inefficient and can be improved.

2. The inner loop that calculates the maximum value of `tmp` also has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of digits in a number. This loop can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary multiplication and division operations.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Data structures: The `table` array of booleans can be replaced with an `unordered_set` from C++ Standard Template Library (STL). The `unordered_set` offers constant time complexity O(1) for insertion and searching operations as compared to the array which has a time complexity of O(N) for searching.

2. Redundant computations: In the current code, for each iteration of the outer loop, entire `table` is being set to `false`, which is redundant. Instead, we can clear the `unordered_set` once per outer loop iteration, which will be much faster.

3. Loop optimizations: The inner loop where maximum value of `tmp` is calculated can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary computations.

4. Compiler optimizations: Using compiler optimization flag like `-O2` during compilation can help in improving the speed of the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the `table` array with an `unordered_set`. This will improve the time complexity of insertion and searching operations from O(N) to O(1). The trade-off is a potentially increased memory usage, but the benefits generally outweigh the costs.

2. Instead of initializing the entire `table` to `false` in each iteration of the outer loop, simply clear the `unordered_set`. This reduces unnecessary computation.

3. Optimize the inner loop to avoid unnecessary computations. This can be achieved by changing the approach to calculate maximum value of `tmp`. Instead of performing multiple multiplications and divisions, split the number into individual digits and then multiply them.

4. Use compiler optimization flag `-O2` during compilation. This will instruct the compiler to perform optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, etc. to improve the speed of the code.

    count = 0;
    scanf("%d", &N);
    table.insert(N); // Use unordered_set insert function
    FLG = false;
    while (true) {
      if (N / 10 == 0)
        break;
      max = 0;

      vector<int> digits;
      while (temp > 0) {
        digits.push_back(temp % 10);
        temp /= 10;
      }
      for (int i = 0; i < digits.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i+1; j < digits.size(); j++) {
          max = max(max, digits[i] * digits[j]);
        }
      }
      N = max;
      if (table.find(N) != table.end()) { // Use unordered_set find function
        FLG = true;
        break;
      } else {
        table.insert(N); // Use unordered_set insert function
        count++;

    }
    if (FLG) {
