Code Analysis:
The provided code reads a number from the input and performs certain computations until a condition is met or a previously computed result is encountered. It does this by performing a multiplication of the leading and trailing parts of the number, starting with the last digit and moving towards the first. The number of iterations before a previously computed result is found is then outputted. If the computed result is found, it outputs -1.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The table array is re-initialized to false for every Q loop. This can be optimized to avoid unnecessary iterations.
2. The calculation of max can be optimized by avoiding repeated divisions.
3. The use of bool *table = new bool[1000001]; results in dynamic memory allocation which is slower than stack allocation.

Step-by-step Explanation:
1. Instead of re-initializing the table for every Q loop, we can just mark the visited elements as false at the end of each Q loop. This way, we only need to change the elements we used, rather than iterating through the entire array.
2. In the calculation of max, we repeatedly perform the operation of N/S and N%S. We can optimize this by storing the result of N/S and N%S to avoid repeated computations.
3. Instead of using dynamic memory allocation for the table, we can declare the table as a global variable. This will ensure that the memory is allocated on the stack instead of the heap, which is faster.

Trade-offs: These optimizations will increase the speed of the code but could potentially make it less readable due to the additional variables and more complex loop logic.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <queue>
#include <stack>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool table[1000001]; // Declare the table as a global variable

int main() {
  int Q, N, count, tmp, max, S;
  bool FLG;
  scanf("%d", &Q);
  for (int loop = 0; loop < Q; loop++) {
    count = 0;
    scanf("%d", &N);
    table[N] = true;
    FLG = false;
    while (true) {
      if (N / 10 == 0)
        break;
      max = 0;
      for (S = 10; N / S != 0; S *= 10) {
        int N_div_S = N / S;
        int N_mod_S = N % S;
        tmp = N_div_S * N_mod_S;
        max = (max >= tmp) ? max : tmp;
      }
      N = max;
      if (table[N] == true) {
        FLG = true;
        break;
      } else {
        table[N] = true;
        count++;
      }
    }
    if (FLG) {
      printf("-1\n");
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", count);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++) // Reset the visited elements
      table[i] = false;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code should run faster due to the reduced computation in the loops and faster memory allocation.
