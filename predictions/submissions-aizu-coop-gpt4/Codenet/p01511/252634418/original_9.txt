Code Analysis:

1. The code reads the input data and processes it in a while loop, where the condition for the loop is receiving three inputs (w, h, n).
2. Inside the loop, it reads (x, y) coordinates of objects and stores them in a map, where y is the key and the values are a vector of x's.
3. It then creates a matrix `O` of size `w x w`, which represents possible movements in the grid.
4. It also creates a matrix `A` which is an identity matrix of size `w x w`.
5. Then, it iterates over the map of objects using auto iteration and for each object it checks if the y coordinate has changed. If yes, it multiplies the matrix `A` with the power of matrix `O` raised to the difference between the new and old y coordinate minus one.
6. Afterwards, it creates a new matrix `B` and updates it based on the x values of the current y coordinate. It then multiplies `A` with `B`.
7. After the loop, it checks if the last y coordinate is less than `h-1`. If yes, it multiplies `A` with the power of `O` raised to `h-1` minus the last y coordinate.
8. Finally, it multiplies `A` with a vector `b`, in which only the first element is 1, and the rest are 0. The last element of the result vector is then printed.

Optimization Strategy:

1. The major bottleneck in this program is the multiplication of matrices, which is an operation with time complexity of O(n^3). Therefore, we should aim to reduce the number of times the matrices are multiplied.
2. The function `mat_pow` can be optimized using the divide and conquer approach, where instead of multiplying the matrix by itself `x` times, we can calculate the power of the matrix in logarithmic time.
3. We can avoid using map for storing the objects. Instead, we can use a vector and sort it based on the y coordinate.

Explanation:

1. The function `mat_pow` has been optimized to calculate the power of a matrix in logarithmic time using the divide and conquer approach.
2. The map for storing the objects was replaced with a vector and sorted based on the y coordinate. This reduces the time complexity of retrieval. However, this assumes that the number of objects is not very large, as sorting can be expensive for large inputs.
3. These optimizations reduce the time complexity and memory usage, making the program more efficient. The trade-off is a slight increase in code complexity due to the use of the divide and conquer approach in the power function.
