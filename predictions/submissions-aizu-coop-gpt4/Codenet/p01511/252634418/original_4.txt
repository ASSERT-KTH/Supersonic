Code Analysis:
The given code is a C++ program that calculates the number of paths from the start to the end of a given grid, avoiding certain obstacles. The primary functionalities of the code include matrix multiplication and exponentiation, which are often computationally expensive processes. 

1. Inefficient Computations: The major performance bottleneck seems to be in the matrix multiplication function, particularly the nested loop structure used for the calculation. Each multiplication operation is O(n^3), which can be significantly expensive for large matrices.

2. Redundant Computations: The program doesn't seem to have any redundant computations. However, in the multiplication process, there could be repeated calculations that could be avoided.

3. Memory Usage: The primary data structures used in the program are vectors and matrices (2D vectors). These are efficient data structures for this purpose. There doesn't seem to be any significant wastage of memory.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Efficient Matrix Multiplication: The current implementation of matrix multiplication is not efficient for larger sizes. One of the ways to speed it up would be to use a more efficient algorithm such as Strassen's algorithm or Coppersmithâ€“Winograd algorithm. However, these algorithms are quite complex and they only provide significant improvements for extremely large matrices. A simpler and more effective approach would be to use some sort of caching mechanism to avoid repeated calculations. 

2. Use of Bitwise Operators: The current implementation uses bitwise operators for checking if a number is odd and for halving a number. Although these operations are already fast, we can replace them with arithmetic operations for better readability without sacrificing performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Efficient Matrix Multiplication: We can improve the efficiency of the matrix multiplication by using a cache to store the results of previously computed multiplications. This is efficient for scenarios where the matrices have repetitive patterns, and the same multiplication is being calculated multiple times. We can use a map to store the results of previous multiplications, and before performing a multiplication, we can check if the result is already in the cache.

Optimized Code Block:

The optimized code with the above-mentioned changes is presented below:

```
// Include necessary libraries
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Define shorthand notations and constants
using ll = long long;
using vl = vector<ll>;

#define se second

// Define auxiliary functions

  int n = A.size();
  mat ret(n, vl(n));
  rep(i, n) ret[i][i] = 1;
  mat P(A);
  while (x) {
    if (x % 2) // Replace bitwise operation with arithmetic operation
      ret = mul(ret, P);
    P = mul(P, P);
    x /= 2; // Replace bitwise operation with arithmetic operation
  }
  return ret;
}

vl mul(const mat &A, const vl &b) {
  int n = A.size();
  vl ret(n);
  rep(i, n) rep(j, n)(ret[i] += A[i][j] * b[j]) %= mod;
  return ret;
}

      }
    }
    
    mat O(w, vl(w));
    rep(i, w) {
      for (int j = -1; j <= 1; ++j) {
        if (0 <= i + j && i + j < w)
          O[i][i + j] = 1;
      }
    }
    
    mat A(w, vl(w));
    rep(i, w) A[i][i] = 1;
    ll ny = 0;
    
    for (const auto &p : obj) {
      ll Y = p.fi;
      if (Y - ny > 1) {
        A = mul(mat_pow(O, Y - ny - 1), A);
      }
      mat B(O);
      for (int i : p.se) {
        for (int j = -1; j <= 1; ++j) {
          if (0 <= i + j && i + j < w)
            B[i][i + j] = 0;
        }
      }
      A = mul(B, A);
      ny = Y;
    }
    
    if (ny != h - 1)
      A = mul(mat_pow(O, h - 1 - ny), A);
      
    vector<ll> b(w);
    b[0] = 1;
    vector<ll> res = mul(A, b);
    ll ans = res[w - 1];
    printf("Case %d: %lld\n", T++, ans);
  }
  
  return 0;

Please note that the optimization strategy mentioned here is a general direction rather than a specific solution. The actual performance gain and trade-offs will depend on the specific problem and dataset.
