### Code Analysis
The given code is a C++ program that appears to simulate some sort of game logic or algorithm. It seems to follow the object's movement in a grid with some obstacles. The code is already quite optimized and uses many C++ features and modern idioms.

### Optimization Strategy
Given the already efficient state of the code, there are few areas where we can make small improvements:

1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The code uses a `std::map` to store objects. While `std::map` is a good choice for many situations, it may not be the most efficient in terms of performance as it implements a balanced binary search tree. A `std::unordered_map` may be a better choice as it implements a hash table and has average constant-time complexity.

2. **Redundant Computations:** In the `mul` function, the code performs matrix multiplication and reduces the result modulo `mod` for every multiplication. We can use a temporary variable to store the result and apply modulo operation only once.

3. **Function Calls:** The current implementation of the `mul` function is making function calls in the innermost loop which might be expensive. We can try to reduce these calls.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** We can use compiler options like `-O2` or `-O3` for more optimization at the compiler level.

### Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **Use More Efficient Data Structures:** Replace `std::map` with `std::unordered_map` for faster average lookup times. This change can potentially speed up the program, but it might increase the memory usage because hash tables usually require more memory than binary search trees. This trade-off is acceptable if the program doesn't have strict memory limits and speed is a priority.

2. **Avoid Redundant Computations:** In the `mul` function, we can store the result of multiplication in a temporary variable and apply the modulo operation only once instead of doing it for every multiplication. This change reduces the number of modulo operations, which are generally more expensive than other arithmetic operations.

3. **Reduce Function Calls:** In the `mul` function, we can store the results of `A[i][k]` and `B[k][j]` in temporary variables to avoid potentially costly array indexing operations inside the innermost loop.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** Use `-O2` or `-O3` compiler options to enable more aggressive optimizations at the compiler level.

### Optimized Code Block
Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
#define rep(i, n) for (int(i) = 0; (i) < (int)(n); ++(i))
#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()
#define pb push_back
#define fi first
#define se second
#define dbg(x) cout << #x " = " << ((x)) << endl
template <class T, class U>
ostream &operator<<(ostream &o, const pair<T, U> &p) {
  o << "(" << p.fi << "," << p.se << ")";
  return o;
}
template <class T> ostream &operator<<(ostream &o, const vector<T> &v) {
  o << "[";
  for (T t : v) {
    o << t << ",";
  }
  o << "]";
  return o;
}
const ll mod = 1000000009;
using vl = vector<ll>;
using mat = vector<vl>;

mat mul(const mat &A, const mat &B) {
  int n = A.size();
  mat C(n, vl(n));
  rep(i, n) rep(j, n) {
    ll temp = 0;  // Temporary variable to store multiplication result
    rep(k, n) {
      ll a = A[i][k];  // Store result in a variable
      ll b = B[k][j];  // Store result in a variable
      temp += a * b;
    }
    C[i][j] = temp % mod;  // Apply modulo operation once
  }
  return C;
}

// The rest of the code remains the same as before...

unordered_map<ll, vector<int>> obj; // Use unordered_map instead of map

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);  // Disable synchronization with C's stdio
  cin.tie(NULL);  // Untie cin and cout streams

  // The rest of the code remains the same as before...
}
```
Ensure to compile the code using `-O2` or `-O3` options for compiler-level optimizations.
