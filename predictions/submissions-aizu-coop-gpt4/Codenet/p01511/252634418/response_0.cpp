Here are the steps I would take to optimize the provided code:

1. **Code Analysis**
   - The code is a C++ program that appears to perform some matrix operations. It defines several functions to multiply matrices, raise a matrix to a power, and multiply a matrix by a vector.
   - There are three nested loops in the `mul` function which is an O(n^3) operation. This is a potential performance bottleneck.
   - The `mat_pow` function also has potential for optimization as it repeatedly calls the `mul` function.
   - The `main` function reads inputs and performs a series of matrix multiplications and transformations. There's a loop that iterates over a map, which could be a performance bottleneck if the map is large.

2. **Optimization Strategy**
   - One potential optimization is to use a more efficient algorithm for matrix multiplication. Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication algorithm, for instance, can improve the time complexity to approximately O(n^2.81).
   - Use of bitwise shift operator in `mat_pow` function could be replaced with simple division by 2.
   - The map `obj` could potentially be replaced with a more efficient data structure. However, without more information about the input data, it's hard to propose a specific alternative.
   - The `mat_pow` function could be optimized using the concept of 'Exponentiation by Squaring'.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**
   - Replace the matrix multiplication algorithm with a more efficient one like Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication. This would involve breaking down the input matrices into smaller matrices, recursively applying the multiplication algorithm to these smaller matrices, and then combining the results. This process reduces the number of multiplications needed, thereby improving performance.
   - Replace the bitwise shift operation in `mat_pow` with division by 2 for readability without impacting performance.
   - Replace the map `obj` with a more efficient data structure. However, this would depend on the specific characteristics of the input data. If the data is sparse, a hash table might be a good alternative. If the data is dense and ordered, an array or vector might be a better choice. 
   - Optimize `mat_pow` function using the concept of 'Exponentiation by Squaring'. This technique reduces the number of multiplications needed to calculate a power, thereby improving performance.
