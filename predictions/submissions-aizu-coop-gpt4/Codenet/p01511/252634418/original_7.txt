Code Analysis:
The provided code is a C++ program that performs matrix multiplication, matrix power, and vector multiplication operations. It also seems to simulate some kind of scenario involving a grid (possibly a game board or a path-finding problem) and obstacles within it. The code is well-structured but there are several opportunities for optimization. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use more efficient data structures: The current code uses std::vector for storing matrix and vector data. While std::vector is suitable in most cases, it has an overhead of dynamic memory allocation. If the size of the matrix or vector is known at compile time, we can use std::array, which is a more efficient data structure as it allocates memory on the stack instead of the heap. However, this is not applicable to this particular code as the sizes are not known at compile time.

2. Reduce redundant computations: The main bottleneck in the code is the three nested loops for matrix multiplication (in the function 'mul'). This is a cubic time complexity operation. We can improve this by using Strassen's algorithm or the Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm for matrix multiplication, which have a time complexity of O(n^log2(7)) and O(n^2.376), respectively.

3. Optimize loops: We can use OpenMP, a C/C++ library for parallel programming, to parallelize the three nested loops in the 'mul' function. This will allow different iterations of the loop to be executed concurrently, thus improving the time efficiency of the code.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can use some compiler options for optimization, such as -O3, -march=native, -funroll-loops, etc. These will provide an automatic boost to the performance of the code. 

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. To reduce redundant computations, we will replace the cubic time complexity matrix multiplication function 'mul' with Strassen's algorithm. This algorithm reduces the number of recursive multiplications needed from 8 to 7, thus improving the time complexity to O(n^log2(7)).
2. We will use OpenMP to parallelize the three nested loops in the 'mul' function. This is done by adding a '#pragma omp parallel for' directive before the loops. This will allow different iterations of the loop to be executed concurrently, thus improving the time efficiency of the code.
3. We will add compiler options for optimization in the build command. For example, 'g++ -O3 -march=native -funroll-loops program.cpp'. The -O3 option enables all optimization flags, -march=native enables all instruction subsets supported by the local machine, and -funroll-loops unrolls loops, which can lead to faster loop execution in some cases.

Optimized Code Block:
Due to the complexity involved in implementing Strassen's algorithm and the fact that its efficiency is only noticeable for large matrices (which may not be the case here), the optimal code block will not include this step. This leaves us with the parallelization of the loops and compiler optimizations. The optimized code block is shown below:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <omp.h> // Include OpenMP library
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
#define rep(i, n) for (int(i) = 0; (i) < (int)(n); ++(i))
#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()
#define pb push_back
#define fi first
#define se second
#define dbg(x) cout << #x " = " << ((x)) << endl
// ... Rest of the code as before ...

// Optimized 'mul' function
mat mul(const mat &A, const mat &B) {
  int n = A.size();
  mat C(n, vl(n));
  #pragma omp parallel for // Parallelize this loop
  for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
    for(int j=0; j<n; j++) {
      for(int k=0; k<n; k++) {
        C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
        C[i][j] %= mod;
      }
    }
  }
  return C;
}

// ... Rest of the code as before ...
```

The code should be compiled with the following command to enable the optimizations:

```bash
g++ -O3 -march=native -funroll-loops -fopenmp program.cpp
```

This command enables maximum optimizations (-O3), uses the native architecture for optimizations (-march=native), unrolls loops (-funroll-loops), and enables OpenMP (-fopenmp).
