**1. Code Analysis:**

The given code appears to be an implementation of a dynamic programming problem. The code reads in the width of a grid and the height, then a number of obstacles. For each obstacle, it takes an x,y pair and decrement both by one. It then constructs matrices and performs operations on them, such as multiplication, matrix power, and then multiplies matrix with a vector.

**2. Optimization Strategy:**

A. Inefficient Data Structures: The code seems to be using appropriate data structures like vector for matrix and map for storing obstacles.

B. Redundant Computations: The matrix multiplication and matrix-vector multiplication are performed in a naive way which can be optimized.

C. Loops and Recursive Calls: The matrix multiplication is performed in a nested loop which can be optimized.

D. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimization flags can be used to improve the performance of the code.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

A. Matrix Multiplication: In the given code, matrix multiplication is performed in a cubic time complexity manner. This can be optimized by using Strassen's algorithm or Karatsuba algorithm which perform multiplication in less time complexity.

B. Matrix-Vector Multiplication: The multiplication of matrix and vector can be optimized by using better cache utilization techniques like blocking.

C. Compiler Optimizations: Use compiler flags -O2 or -O3 for better optimization.

D. Avoiding use of Modulo operation: Modulo operation is computationally expensive. We can avoid it during multiplication by breaking down the multiplication into smaller parts that do not overflow and then add them back together with modulo.

**4. Optimized Code Block:**

Since the code is complex and involves multiple concepts, we will need a detailed understanding of the problem solution to perform meaningful optimizations. However, based on the given code and without changing the logic of the code, here are some general optimizations that can be applied. Please note that these optimizations may or may not give significant performance improvements depending on the input size and specific problem constraints.

```c++
// ... rest of the code

const ll mod = 1000000009;
using vl = vector<ll>;
using mat = vector<vl>;

mat mul(const mat &A, const mat &B) {
  int n = A.size();
  mat C(n, vl(n));
  rep(i, n) rep(j, n) {
    ll sum = 0;
    rep(k, n) {
      sum += (A[i][k] * B[k][j]) % mod; // Avoiding overflow by taking modulo in each multiplication
      sum %= mod;
    }
    C[i][j] = sum;
  }
  return C;
}

vl mul(const mat &A, const vl &b) {
  int n = A.size();
  vl ret(n);
  rep(i, n) {
    ll sum = 0;
    rep(j, n) {
      sum += (A[i][j] * b[j]) % mod; // Avoiding overflow by taking modulo in each multiplication
      sum %= mod;
    }
    ret[i] = sum;
  }
  return ret;
}

// ... rest of the code
```

Please note that the matrix multiplication optimization using Strassen's or Karatsuba's algorithm is not provided here because it would require a significant change in the code and it is not always faster due to overhead of recursion and additional memory required. It is faster for very large matrices. Also, these algorithms are not straightforward and require a good understanding of divide and conquer algorithms.

Also, the matrix multiplication and matrix-vector multiplication functions are not optimized for cache utilization because it would require a detailed understanding of the problem and it may not result in significant performance improvements for small matrices. The cache optimization techniques are usually used for large matrices where cache misses can significantly slow down the program.
