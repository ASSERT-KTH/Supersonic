1. Code Analysis:
The given code is a C++ program that performs matrix multiplication and power operations, and is used to solve some problem dealing with objects in a certain space. The main performance bottleneck in this program is the matrix multiplication function `mul()`, which has a time complexity of O(n^3) due to the three nested loops. This function is called multiple times in the program, so optimizing this function should significantly improve the performance of the program.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Use more efficient data structures: The current code uses nested vectors to represent matrices. While this is a simple and intuitive representation, it may not be the most efficient for large matrices. Consider using a library optimized for matrix operations, such as Eigen or Armadillo.
    2. Optimize matrix multiplication: The current implementation of matrix multiplication is the straightforward cubic time complexity algorithm. Consider using Strassen's algorithm or Coppersmithâ€“Winograd algorithm, which have better time complexities.
    3. Avoid unnecessary computations: The matrix power function `mat_pow()` computes the power of a matrix by repeated multiplication. This can be optimized using binary exponentiation, which avoids unnecessary multiplications.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Use an optimized library for matrix operations: Libraries like Eigen or Armadillo are optimized for matrix operations, and can perform operations like multiplication and power much faster than the straightforward implementations.
    2. Optimize matrix multiplication: Implementing a more efficient algorithm for matrix multiplication, such as Strassen's algorithm, can significantly improve the performance of the program. However, this comes at the cost of increased code complexity.
    3. Use binary exponentiation in `mat_pow()`: Binary exponentiation is a method used to compute large powers of a number in logarithmic time. It works by expressing the exponent as a binary number and multiplying the base for each bit of the exponent that is set. This can reduce the number of multiplications performed and thus improve the performance of the function.

Please note that the actual code changes would depend on the specific matrix library chosen. The following is a simplified example of how the matrix multiplication and power functions might look using Eigen.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
// Include Eigen library
#include <Eigen/Dense>
using namespace Eigen;

// Use Eigen's Matrix class instead of vector<vector<ll>>
using mat = Matrix<ll, Dynamic, Dynamic>;

// Use Eigen's matrix multiplication
mat mul(const mat &A, const mat &B) {
    return A * B;
}

// Use binary exponentiation to compute matrix power
mat mat_pow(const mat &A, ll x) {
    int n = A.rows();
    mat ret = Matrix<ll, Dynamic, Dynamic>::Identity(n, n);
    mat P = A;
    while (x) {
        if (x & 1)
            ret = mul(ret, P);
        P = mul(P, P);
        x >>= 1;
    }
    return ret;
}

// Rest of the code remains the same...
```
