1. Code Analysis:

This program seems to be solving some kind of dynamic programming problem, possibly related to pathfinding or similar combinatorial problems. 

The code seems to calculate a series of matrix multiplications and power operations, which are notorious for being computationally expensive. Therefore, these are the prime candidates for optimization.

2. Optimization Strategy:

Here are some strategies that could be used to optimize this program:

   A. Use more efficient data structures: Currently, the program uses nested vectors (vector of vectors) to represent matrices. Although vectors are quite efficient in terms of random access and dynamic resizing, they are not necessarily the best choice for matrices, particularly for sparse matrices where most of the elements are zero. If the matrices in this problem are sparse, using a sparse matrix representation could potentially save a lot of memory and computational time.

   B. Minimize redundant computations: The program performs matrix multiplication and matrix power operations in multiple places. These are computationally expensive operations and should be avoided if possible. 

   C. Optimize loops: There are several nested loops in the program, which contribute to its high time complexity. Some of these loops can be optimized using techniques like loop unrolling or parallel processing.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   A. Use Sparse Matrix Representation: If the matrices involved in this problem are sparse (which often happens in combinatorial problems), they can be represented using a sparse matrix representation. This can be done using the `Eigen` library, which provides a `SparseMatrix` class. This class stores only the non-zero values and their positions in the matrix, which saves a lot of memory and speeds up certain operations.

   B. Minimize Redundant Computations: The matrix multiplication and power operations are performed in multiple places in the program. These operations could be combined into a single function, which is called when necessary. This function could also be optimized to minimize redundant computations, for example by using the Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication, which has a lower time complexity than the naive algorithm.

   C. Optimize Loops: The nested loops in the program could be optimized in several ways. One way is to use loop unrolling, which involves duplicating the contents of the loop to minimize the overhead of loop control. Another way is to use parallel processing, which involves splitting the loop into several tasks that can be executed simultaneously. This can be done using OpenMP, a library for parallel programming in C++.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Please note that without the original problem statement or test cases, it is difficult to provide a concrete optimized code. However, I will provide an outline of how the optimized code might look like:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <Eigen/Sparse>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
// ... (rest of the code)

// Use Eigen::SparseMatrix instead of vector<vector<ll>>
using mat = Eigen::SparseMatrix<ll>;

// Combine matrix multiplication and power operations into a single function
mat mul_and_pow(const mat &A, const mat &B, ll x) {
  // ... (optimized code for matrix multiplication and power operations)
}

// Use OpenMP to parallelize loops
#pragma omp parallel for
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
  // ... (code inside the loop)
}

// ... (rest of the code)
```
Please note that these are just rough suggestions and the actual optimized code might look different depending on the specifics of the problem.
