The given code is a C++ program that performs matrix multiplication and matrix power operations. It appears to be a problem-solving code for a specific use case, where it calculates paths in a grid with obstacles. While the code is well-structured and uses efficient data structures, there are still some areas where we can optimize for performance. Here's the strategy:

1. Code Analysis:
    - The code uses matrix multiplication and exponentiation operations, which are computationally heavy.
    - There are nested loops in the multiplication functions which can be optimized.
    - The program uses `std::map` for storing objects, which is an ordered associative container and involves overhead for maintaining the ordering of elements.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - We can optimize the matrix multiplication using loop blocking (also known as loop tiling) technique. This technique can reduce the cache miss rate by taking advantage of temporal and spatial locality in the cache memory.
    - If we are sure about the absence of negative keys in our use case, we can replace `std::map` with `std::unordered_map` for storing objects. `std::unordered_map` has a faster access time compared to `std::map` because it uses hash table data structure.

3. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
#define rep(i, n) for (int(i) = 0; (i) < (int)(n); ++(i))
#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()
#define pb push_back
#define fi first
#define se second
#define dbg(x) cout << #x " = " << ((x)) << endl
template <class T, class U>
ostream &operator<<(ostream &o, const pair<T, U> &p) {
  o << "(" << p.fi << "," << p.se << ")";
  return o;
}
template <class T> ostream &operator<<(ostream &o, const vector<T> &v) {
  o << "[";
  for (T t : v) {
    o << t << ",";
  }
  o << "]";
  return o;
}
const ll mod = 1000000009;
using vl = vector<ll>;
using mat = vector<vl>;

// Cache-optimized matrix multiplication using loop blocking
mat mul(const mat &A, const mat &B) {
  int n = A.size();
  mat C(n, vl(n));
  int blockSize = 16; // Block size suitable for cache.
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i += blockSize)
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j += blockSize)
      for (int k = 0; k < n; k += blockSize)
        for (int x = i; x < min(i + blockSize, n); ++x)
          for (int y = j; y < min(j + blockSize, n); ++y)
            for (int z = k; z < min(k + blockSize, n); ++z)
              C[x][y] = (C[x][y] + A[x][z] * B[z][y]) % mod;
  return C;
}

// Other functions remain the same...

int main() {
  int T = 1;
  int w, n;
  ll h;
  while (cin >> w >> h >> n, w) {
    unordered_map<ll, vector<int>> obj; // Changed map to unordered_map
    rep(i, n) {
      ll x, y;
      cin >> x >> y;
      --x;
      --y;
      if (y > 0) {
        obj[y].pb(x);
      }
    }

    // Other codes remain the same...
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimization can significantly speed up the computation, but it may increase code complexity and memory usage slightly due to the introduction of loop blocking. The block size is an important factor and should be tuned according to the cache size of the specific system where the program runs.
