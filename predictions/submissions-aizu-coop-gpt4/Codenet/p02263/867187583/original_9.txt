The performance of this code is quite good, as it uses a stack to perform calculations. However, there are a few areas that can be optimized to increase its efficiency:

1. In the push operation of the Stack class, the top_ is incremented before the new element is inserted. This can lead to an index out of bounds issue. The correct way is to first insert the element at the top_, then increment the top_. 

2. The pop operation returns -1 when the stack is empty. This can be a problem if the stack is empty and the program tries to perform an operation. A better approach is to throw an exception when trying to pop an empty stack. 

3. Repeated calls to `atoi(s)` in the main loop can be avoided by storing the result in a variable.

4. The size of the stack is fixed to 110. A better approach would be to dynamically resize the stack when it's full.

5. Buffer `s[1000]` is oversized and `scanf` can be replaced with `fgets` to avoid potential buffer overflow.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Stack {
public:
  Stack(int n) : s_(n), top_(0){};
  
  bool isEmpty() { return top_ == 0; }

  bool isFull() { return top_ == s_.size(); }
  
  void push(int x) {
    if (isFull()) {
      s_.resize(s_.size() * 2); // resizing when stack is full
    }
    s_[top_++] = x;  // first insert the element, then increment top_
  }
  
  int pop() {
    if (isEmpty()) {
      throw out_of_range("Stack Underflow"); // throw exception if stack is empty
    }
    return s_[--top_];
  }

private:
  vector<int> s_;
  size_t top_;
};

int main() {
  char s[10];  // reduced buffer size
  Stack stack(100);
  while (fgets(s, sizeof(s), stdin) != NULL) {
    int num = atoi(s);  // store atoi result in a variable
    if (s[0] == '+') {
      int rhs = stack.pop();
      int lhs = stack.pop();
      stack.push(lhs + rhs);
    } else if (s[0] == '-') {
      int rhs = stack.pop();
      int lhs = stack.pop();
      stack.push(lhs - rhs);
    } else if (s[0] == '*') {
      int rhs = stack.pop();
      int lhs = stack.pop();
      stack.push(lhs * rhs);
    } else {
      stack.push(num);  // use stored atoi result
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", stack.pop());
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces unnecessary computation and memory usage; it also prevents potential stack overflow and underflow. The trade-off is a slight increase in code complexity due to the addition of dynamic resizing and exception handling. However, the overall performance improvement should outweigh this cost.
