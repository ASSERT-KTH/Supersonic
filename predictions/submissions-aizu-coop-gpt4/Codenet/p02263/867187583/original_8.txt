Code Analysis:
- The program defines a simple stack data structure with push and pop operations.
- The main function reads strings from the standard input and performs calculations based on the input, storing the results in the stack.
- If the string is a simple arithmetic operator '+', '-', or '*', it pops two items from the stack, performs the operation, and pushes the result back into the stack.
- If the string is not an operator, it is converted to an integer and pushed into the stack.
- After all inputs have been processed, it pops the final result from the stack and prints it.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use of `std::vector` in the Stack class: While vector is a versatile data structure, it has overheads that are not needed in this case. Instead, a simple dynamic array can be used.
2. Repeated calls to `isFull()` and `isEmpty()`: These are relatively simple functions, but they are called every time a push or pop operation is performed. Instead, we can directly check these conditions in the push and pop functions.
3. String handling in `main()`: The switch-case structure can be used to handle arithmetic operators more efficiently than if-else statements. Also, `scanf` can be replaced with `std::cin` for more efficient and safe input handling.
4. Use of `atoi()`: `atoi()` doesn't handle errors. We can use `std::stoi()` instead, which throws an exception when conversion is not possible.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace `std::vector` with a dynamic array: This reduces the overhead of vector operations. Here, we know the maximum size of the stack in advance, so we can allocate the array once and avoid dynamic resizing.
2. Remove `isFull()` and `isEmpty()`: These functions are called every time a push or pop operation is performed. Instead, we can directly check these conditions in the push and pop functions.
3. Replace if-else statements with switch-case: The switch-case structure has better performance than if-else when dealing with multiple options. Also, `std::cin` is more efficient and safe than `scanf` for input handling.
4. Use `std::stoi()` instead of `atoi()`: `std::stoi()` is safer because it throws an exception when conversion is not possible.

Trade-offs:
- By replacing `std::vector` with a dynamic array, we lose some of the benefits of vector, such as automatic resizing and easy access to the last element. However, because we know the maximum size of the stack in advance, these features are not necessary.
- The use of `std::cin` and `std::cout` could be slightly slower than `scanf` and `printf`, but they offer better type safety and are more idiomatic in C++.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;

class Stack {
public:
  Stack(int n) : size_(n), top_(0) { 
    s_ = new int[n]; 
  }
  ~Stack() { 
    delete[] s_; 
  }
  void push(int x) {
    if (top_ != size_) {
      s_[top_++] = x;
    }
  }
  int pop() {
    if (top_ != 0) {
      return s_[--top_];
    }
    return -1;
  }

private:
  int* s_;
  size_t size_;
  size_t top_;
};

int main() {
  char s[1000];
  Stack stack(110);
  while (cin >> s) {
    switch (s[0]) {
    case '+':
      stack.push(stack.pop() + stack.pop());
      break;
    case '-':
      {
        int rhs = stack.pop();
        stack.push(stack.pop() - rhs);
      }
      break;
    case '*':
      stack.push(stack.pop() * stack.pop());
      break;
    default:
      stack.push(stoi(s));
    }
  }
  cout << stack.pop() << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version, the stack is implemented with a dynamic array, the redundant calls to `isFull()` and `isEmpty()` have been removed, the input handling has been improved by using `std::cin` and a switch-case structure, and the less safe `atoi()` has been replaced with `std::stoi()`.
