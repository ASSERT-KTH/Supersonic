Code Analysis:
The given C++ program is a simple implementation of a stack with operations push and pop. The main function reads input from the standard input, performs some operations according to the input, and pushes the results back into the stack.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: The current implementation uses a vector to implement the stack. While this is not necessarily inefficient, we can use std::stack which has been specifically designed for stack operations. This could potentially offer some performance benefits.

2. Redundant Computations: The current implementation checks if the stack is empty or full before every push and pop operation. These checks could be eliminated by ensuring that the stack is never full and handling the case where we attempt to pop from an empty stack more efficiently.

3. Loops or Recursive Calls: There is a while loop in the main function which reads the input and performs operations on the stack. This loop cannot be avoided as it is necessary to read all the input, but we can make it more efficient by using faster I/O methods.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use the -O2 flag during compilation to enable all optimization that does not involve a space-speed tradeoff.

Optimization Steps:
1. Replace vector with std::stack: This is a more standard way of implementing a stack in C++ and could potentially offer performance benefits.

2. Eliminate redundant checks: We can remove the checks for whether the stack is full before pushing and empty before popping by ensuring that the stack is never full and handling the case where we attempt to pop from an empty stack more efficiently.

3. Use faster I/O methods: We can use fgets instead of scanf to read the input, which can be faster.

4. Use compiler optimization flag: We can compile the code with the -O2 flag to enable all optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.

Trade-offs:
The main trade-off here is that we are making the code slightly more complex in order to increase performance. Adding the -O2 flag during compilation could also potentially increase the size of the executable.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <stack>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  char s[1000];
  stack<int> stack;
  while (fgets(s, 1000, stdin) != NULL) {
    if (s[0] == '+') {
      int rhs = stack.top(); stack.pop();
      int lhs = stack.top(); stack.pop();
      int t = lhs + rhs;
      stack.push(t);
    } else if (s[0] == '-') {
      int rhs = stack.top(); stack.pop();
      int lhs = stack.top(); stack.pop();
      int t = lhs - rhs;
      stack.push(t);
    } else if (s[0] == '*') {
      int rhs = stack.top(); stack.pop();
      int lhs = stack.top(); stack.pop();
      int t = lhs * rhs;
      stack.push(t);
    } else {
      stack.push(atoi(s));
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", stack.top()); stack.pop();
  return 0;
}
```
Compile this code with -O2 flag for better performance.
