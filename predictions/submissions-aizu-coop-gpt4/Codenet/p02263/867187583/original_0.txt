Code Analysis:
The provided code implements a simple stack data structure and uses this stack to evaluate arithmetic expressions given in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). The main performance bottlenecks in this program are likely to occur in the following areas:

1. The stack push and pop operations are not efficient. In the push operation, `top_++` is done before `s_[top_] = x;`. This could lead to an out-of-bound index in the vector if `top_` is equal to the size of the vector. Similarly, for the pop operation, `top_--` is done before returning the popped element, which could again lead to an out-of-bound index if `top_` is zero. 

2. The `scanf` and `printf` functions for input/output operations can be slower than using C++ `cin` and `cout` functions with proper synchronization turned off.

3. The conversion of string to integer using `atoi(s)` can be slower than using `std::stoi(s)`.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Improve the efficiency of the push and pop operations in the stack class. For the push operation, first assign the value to `s_[top_]` and then increment `top_`. For the pop operation, first decrement `top_` and then return `s_[top_]`.

2. Use C++ `cin` and `cout` functions for input/output operations. Before using these, turn off synchronization with the C standard I/O by `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`.

3. Use `std::stoi(s)` instead of `atoi(s)` for conversion from string to integer.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Stack {
public:
  Stack(int n) : s_(n), top_(0){};
  bool isEmpty() { return top_ == 0; }
  bool isFull() { return top_ == s_.size(); }
  void push(int x) {
    if (!isFull()) {
      s_[top_++] = x;
    }
  }
  int pop() {
    if (!isEmpty()) {
      return s_[--top_];
    }
    return -1;
  }

private:
  vector<int> s_;
  size_t top_;
};

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  string s;
  Stack stack(110);
  while (cin >> s) {
    if (s[0] == '+') {
      int rhs = stack.pop();
      int lhs = stack.pop();
      stack.push(lhs + rhs);
    } else if (s[0] == '-') {
      int rhs = stack.pop();
      int lhs = stack.pop();
      stack.push(lhs - rhs);
    } else if (s[0] == '*') {
      int rhs = stack.pop();
      int lhs = stack.pop();
      stack.push(lhs * rhs);
    } else {
      stack.push(stoi(s));
    }
  }
  cout << stack.pop() << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs: While the optimized code might perform faster, it is slightly more complex and relies on more advanced features of C++, which could make it harder for beginners to understand. Also, `std::stoi(s)` may throw an exception if the conversion fails, unlike `atoi(s)`, which simply returns 0. This exception needs to be handled properly in a production environment.
