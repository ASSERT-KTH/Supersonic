Code Analysis:
1. The class `Stack` is implemented with the help of `vector<int>`. The stack is resized at the time of construction and no further resizing is performed which is efficient.
2. The `push` and `pop` operations have a time complexity of O(1) which is expected from a stack data structure. However, the `push` operation first increments the `top_` and then pushes the element which might lead to accessing out-of-bounds memory.
3. The main function processes the input command and performs the operations accordingly. However, it uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations which are slower than C++ `cin` and `cout`.
4. Use of C-style strings (`char[]`) and `atoi` function for string to integer conversion which is slower compared to C++ `std::string` and `std::stoi`.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient data structures: The current choice of data structures is optimal for the task.
2. Redundant computations: There are no redundant computations.
3. Loop optimizations: No loop optimizations are required.
4. Compiler Optimizations: Use `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flag during compilation.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. In the `push` operation, increment the `top_` after the element is pushed to avoid accessing out-of-bounds memory.
2. Use C++ `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations.
3. Use `std::string` and `std::stoi` for string manipulation and conversion.
4. Use `-O2` or `-O3` compiler optimization flags during compile time to allow the compiler to perform code optimization.

Trade-offs:
1. The use of `cin` and `cout` might lead to slight increase in code complexity, but they provide better performance compared to `scanf` and `printf`.
2. The use of `std::string` and `std::stoi` increases code readability and performance but might increase code complexity slightly.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Stack {
public:
  Stack(int n) : s_(n), top_(0){};
  bool isEmpty() { return top_ == 0; }
  bool isFull() { return top_ == s_.size(); }
  void push(int x) {
    if (isFull()) {
      return;
    }
    s_[top_] = x;
    top_++;
  }
  int pop() {
    if (isEmpty()) {
      return -1;
    }
    top_--;
    return s_[top_];
  }

private:
  vector<int> s_;
  size_t top_;
};

int main() {
  string s;
  Stack stack(110);
  while (cin >> s) {
    if (s[0] == '+') {
      int rhs = stack.pop();
      int lhs = stack.pop();
      int t = lhs + rhs;
      stack.push(t);
    } else if (s[0] == '-') {
      int rhs = stack.pop();
      int lhs = stack.pop();
      int t = lhs - rhs;
      stack.push(t);
    } else if (s[0] == '*') {
      int rhs = stack.pop();
      int lhs = stack.pop();
      int t = lhs * rhs;
      stack.push(t);
    } else {
      stack.push(stoi(s));
    }
  }
  cout << stack.pop() << "\n";
  return 0;
}
