## Code Analysis:

The code performs a postfix operation using a stack. From the code, the main performance issues that can be identified are:

1. The stack implementation uses a vector as the underlying data structure, which may not be the most efficient in terms of memory usage and performance.

2. The stack's `push` method increments the `top_` variable before setting the value, which leads to an off-by-one error, resulting in undefined behaviour.

3. The `scanf` function is used for string input without specifying the maximum length, which may lead to buffer overflow.

## Optimization Strategy:

1. Use an array instead of a vector for the stack. This data structure has less overhead, is more memory-efficient and is faster for memory allocation and deallocation.

2. Fix the off-by-one error in the `push` method by setting the value before incrementing the `top_` variable.

3. Use `fgets` instead of `scanf` to prevent buffer overflow. This function allows us to specify the maximum length of the input.

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the vector in the Stack class with an array. This will reduce the memory overhead and speed up the allocation and deallocation of memory.

2. Correct the `push` method to set the value before incrementing the `top_` index. This will prevent accessing the array out of its bounds, which can lead to undefined behaviour.

3. Replace `scanf` with `fgets` to prevent buffer overflow. `fgets` allows us to specify the maximum length of the string to be read, therefore avoiding buffer overflow.

## Optimized Code Block:

Below is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_SIZE 110

class Stack {
public:
  Stack() : top_(0){};
  bool isEmpty() { return top_ == 0; }
  bool isFull() { return top_ == MAX_SIZE; }
  void push(int x) {
    if (isFull()) {
      return;
    }
    s_[top_] = x;
    top_++;
  }
  int pop() {
    if (isEmpty()) {
      return -1;
    }
    top_--;
    return s_[top_];
  }

private:
  int s_[MAX_SIZE];
  size_t top_;
};

int main() {
  char s[1000];
  Stack stack;
  while (fgets(s, sizeof(s), stdin) != NULL) {
    if (s[0] == '+') {
      int rhs = stack.pop();
      int lhs = stack.pop();
      int t = lhs + rhs;
      stack.push(t);
    } else if (s[0] == '-') {
      int rhs = stack.pop();
      int lhs = stack.pop();
      int t = lhs - rhs;
      stack.push(t);
    } else if (s[0] == '*') {
      int rhs = stack.pop();
      int lhs = stack.pop();
      int t = lhs * rhs;
      stack.push(t);
    } else {
      stack.push(atoi(s));
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", stack.pop());
  return 0;
}
```

## Discussions:

The optimized code is more memory-efficient and faster because it uses an array instead of a vector for the stack. It also avoids undefined behaviour by correcting the off-by-one error in the `push` method and prevents buffer overflow by using `fgets` instead of `scanf`. 

However, using an array for the stack limits its size to a constant value. If you need a dynamically resizing stack, a vector would be a better choice, but with the trade-off of slightly higher memory usage and slower performance.
