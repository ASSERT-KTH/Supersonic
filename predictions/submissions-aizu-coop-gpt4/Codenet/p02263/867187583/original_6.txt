Code Analysis:
The code provided is a simple implementation of a stack-based calculator. It takes inputs as commands or numbers and performs calculations based on the stack's top two elements whenever an operator command is received. The code is fairly efficient but there are a few areas where performance can be improved.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The current code uses a vector for the stack implementation. While this is not inherently inefficient, using a deque could potentially provide marginally better performance for push and pop operations.

2. Redundant Computations: There are no redundant computations, however, there is repeated code for popping values from the stack and pushing the result back onto the stack. This can be refactored into a function.

3. Loops and Recursion: The main while loop can't be unrolled or optimized more as it depends on the input stream.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use the -O2 or -O3 optimization flag during compilation to automatically optimize the program.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Switch to deque: Deque is similar to vector but provides faster insertion and deletion at the beginning and end. This is a minor optimization as vector's push_back and pop_back are also O(1) operations, but every bit helps.

2. Refactor Repeated Code: We can refactor the code for popping two values from the stack and pushing the result back into a function. This will not only reduce code duplication but also improve readability.

3. Compiler Optimizations: Use the -O2 or -O3 flag when compiling the code. This will enable the compiler to automatically optimize the code, potentially improving performance.

Trade-offs:
The trade-off for these optimizations is slightly increased code complexity. However, the performance benefits should outweigh this slight increase in complexity.

Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <deque>
using namespace std;
class Stack {
public:
  Stack(int n) : s_(n), top_(0){};
  bool isEmpty() { return top_ == 0; }
  bool isFull() { return top_ == s_.size(); }
  void push(int x) {
    if (isFull()) {
      return;
    }
    top_++;
    s_[top_] = x;
  }
  int pop() {
    if (isEmpty()) {
      return -1;
    }
    top_--;
    return s_[top_ + 1];
  }
private:
  deque<int> s_;
  size_t top_;
};

void performOperation(Stack& stack, char operand) {
  int rhs = stack.pop();
  int lhs = stack.pop();
  int t;
  switch (operand) {
    case '+':
      t = lhs + rhs;
      break;
    case '-':
      t = lhs - rhs;
      break;
    case '*':
      t = lhs * rhs;
      break;
  }
  stack.push(t);
}

int main() {
  char s[1000];
  Stack stack(110);
  while (scanf("%s", s) != EOF) {
    if (s[0] == '+' || s[0] == '-' || s[0] == '*') {
      performOperation(stack, s[0]);
    } else {
      stack.push(atoi(s));
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", stack.pop());
  return 0;
}
```
This code will have the same functionality as the original code but with a few optimizations.
