1. **Code Analysis**

The code is a simple C++ program that reads 28 integers from the standard input, stores them in a set, and then prints any numbers between 1 and 30 that were not included in the input.

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:

- The set data structure uses a significant amount of memory and overhead for maintaining the balance of the tree (as `std::set` is usually implemented as a red-black tree in STL).
- Using `std::set::count` in each iteration of the second loop can be inefficient as it has a time complexity of O(log n).

2. **Optimization Strategy**

- Replace the `std::set` with a `std::vector<bool>` of size 30. Since we know the range of the numbers is from 1 to 30, we can use a boolean vector instead of a set. This will save memory and also eliminate the overhead of maintaining the balance of a tree. The index of the vector will represent the number and the value at that index will indicate whether the number is present (true) or not (false).
- Instead of using `std::set::count` which is O(log n), we can directly access the value from the vector which is O(1).

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**

- **Step 1:** Replace `std::set<int> data` with `std::vector<bool> data(30, false)`. This will create a boolean vector of size 30 with all values initialized to `false`.
- **Step 2:** Replace `data.insert(n)` with `data[n - 1] = true`. This will mark the number as present in the vector.
- **Step 3:** Replace `if (!data.count(i))` with `if (!data[i - 1])`. This will check if the number is present in the vector.

4. **Trade-offs:** This optimization reduces the time complexity from O(log n) to O(1) and also reduces memory usage. The trade-off is negligible as this does not significantly increase the code complexity and still maintains the readability of the code.

5. **Optimized Code Block**

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  vector<bool> data(30, false);
  int n;
  for (int i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
    cin >> n;
    data[n - 1] = true; // Mark as present
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= 30; i++) {
    if (!data[i - 1]) // Check if present
      cout << i << endl;
  }
}
```

Please note that the use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is generally discouraged due to potential performance issues and non-portability across different platforms. It is better to include only the necessary headers. In this case, we would need `#include <iostream>` and `#include <vector>`.
