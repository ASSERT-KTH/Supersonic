1. Code Analysis:

The current code reads 28 numbers from the user, inserts them into a set, and then checks for numbers between 1 and 30 that are not in the set. The use of a set is inefficient here because it requires more memory and time than necessary. The set data structure is typically used for operations that involve frequent insertions, deletions, and searches, but in this case, we're only inserting once and then performing a single search operation.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A more efficient data structure for this use case is a boolean array (or bitset), which uses less memory and can be accessed more quickly. The boolean array should have 31 elements (to account for a 0 index), and each number read from the user will be used as an index to set the corresponding element in the array to true. After all numbers have been read, the elements in the array that are still false will correspond to the numbers between 1 and 30 that were not read from the user.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    1. Replace the set with a boolean array. This array uses less memory than the set, and accessing an element in the array is an O(1) operation, whereas searching for an element in a set is an O(log n) operation.
    2. After reading a number from the user, use that number as an index to set the corresponding element in the boolean array to true. This eliminates the need to insert the number into a set, which is an O(log n) operation.
    3. After reading all the numbers, loop through the boolean array from 1 to 30. The elements that are still false will correspond to the numbers that were not read from the user. This is a single pass through the array, so it's an O(n) operation, whereas checking if each number from 1 to 30 is in the set is an O(n log n) operation.
    4. Trade-offs: The optimized code is slightly more complex than the original code because it uses an array index to represent a number. However, the performance gain and memory savings outweigh this minor increase in complexity.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  bitset<31> data; // Use bitset instead of set
  int n;
  for (int i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
    cin >> n;
    data.set(n); // Set the bit corresponding to the number read
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= 30; i++) {
    if (!data[i]) // If the bit corresponding to the number is not set
      cout << i << endl;
  }
}
```
The optimized code uses a bitset, which is a more efficient data structure for this use case. It also uses fewer operations (only setting a bit and checking if a bit is set) and performs fewer passes over the data (only one pass to set the bits and one pass to check if the bits are set).
