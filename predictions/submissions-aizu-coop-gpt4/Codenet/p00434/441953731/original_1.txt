Code Analysis:
The given code is a simple C++ program that reads 28 integers from the input, inserts them into a set, and then checks for the missing numbers in the range of 1 to 30, printing them out. 

This code is fairly simple and efficient as it is, but there are a couple of areas where it could be optimized:

1. The use of "#include <bits/stdc++.h>". This is a header file that includes most of the standard library files in C++, which can slow down compilation time because it loads more files than necessary.
2. The use of a set, while providing O(log n) insertion and count operation complexity, might not be the most efficient data structure for this specific problem, because we know that the range of numbers is fixed (1-30).
3. The way the program checks for missing numbers could also be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" directive with specific standard library includes needed for the program.
2. Use an array or a bitset instead of a set to represent the range of numbers from 1 to 30. This will allow for constant time O(1) operations.
3. Instead of using a loop to check for missing numbers, we can initialize the array or bitset to false and then set the values to true as they come in from the input. The remaining false values correspond to the missing numbers.

Step-by-step Explanation:

1. Replace "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" with "#include<iostream>" and "#include<bitset>". The rationale for this change is to avoid including unnecessary standard library files, which can slow down compilation time.

2. Replace the set with a bitset. The bitset will be initialized to false, and each time a number comes in from the input, the corresponding index of the bitset will be set to true. This allows for more efficient O(1) operations. The trade-off here is that bitsets can only handle integers and are not as flexible as sets.

3. Change the loop that checks for missing numbers. Instead of using the count method of the set, we can directly check the bitset for false values. This is more efficient because it directly checks the bitset without needing to go through the count method.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  bitset<31> data; // 31 bits, index 0 is not used
  int n;
  for (int i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
    cin >> n;
    data.set(n); // set the nth bit to true
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= 30; i++) {
    if (!data.test(i)) // if the ith bit is false
      cout << i << endl;
  }
}
```
In this optimized code, the input numbers are directly marked in the bitset and the missing numbers are easily found by looking for the false values in the bitset. This avoids the overhead of using a set and its count method, thereby increasing the efficiency of the program.
