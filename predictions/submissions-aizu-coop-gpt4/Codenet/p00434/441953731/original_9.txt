1. Code Analysis:
The code reads integers from the user and stores them in a set. Then it checks for the numbers between 1 and 30 which are not in the set and prints them.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Data Structure Optimization: We are using a set here, which has an average time complexity of O(log(n)) for insert and count operations. If we use a boolean array, we can reduce the time complexity to O(1) for these operations. We know that the numbers are between 1 and 30, so we can easily use an array of size 31 for this.

B. Loop Optimization: The current code uses two separate loops for reading and printing the output. We can merge these two loops into a single loop to reduce the running time.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Using Boolean Array: We use a boolean array of size 31 (because the numbers are between 1 and 30). For each number we read from the user, we set the corresponding index in the array to true. Later, we can simply check this array to see if a number was read or not. This reduces the time complexity of insert and count operations to O(1), and also reduces the memory usage because a boolean array uses less memory than a set of integers.

B. Merging Loops: We can merge the reading and output printing loops into a single loop. After we read each number, we check if all numbers before it (that are not already printed) are in the set or not, and print them if they are not. This reduces the running time because we are not iterating over the range 1 to 30 twice.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    bool data[31] = {false};
    int n;

    for (int i = 1; i <= 30; i++) {
        // If i is less than or equal to 28, read the input
        if (i <= 28) {
            cin >> n;
            data[n] = true;
        }

        // Check if all numbers less than i are in the set or not
        for (int j = 1; j < i; j++) {
            if (!data[j]) {
                cout << j << endl;
                data[j] = true;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Here, we are also avoiding the use of `<bits/stdc++.h>` as it is a hefty inclusion that can slow down the compile time, and it's not a standard header. Instead, we only include `<iostream>`, which is all we need for this program.
