Code Analysis:
The given program is implementing a priority queue using a binary heap data structure. The heap operations include insertion, extracting the maximum element, and increasing a key. The array A[MAX + 1] serves as the storage for the heap with a maximum size of 2000000 elements.

1) Inefficient Data Structures: The array A is a static array that is not resized. While this might not be an issue when dealing with small numbers of elements or when the maximum number of elements is known in advance, it can lead to inefficient memory usage when the actual number of elements is much smaller than the maximum size of the array.

2) Redundant Computations: There are no redundant computations in the original code.

3) Loop Optimization: The while loop in the increasekey function could be optimized.

4) Compiler Optimizations: As the code is written in C++, there might be some compiler flags that could be used to speed up the execution.

Optimization Strategy:
1) Replace the static array with a dynamic one. This would allow the array to grow and shrink as needed, which could significantly reduce memory usage when the number of elements is much smaller than the maximum size.

2) Unroll the loop in the increasekey function. This could potentially speed up the code as the number of iterations is reduced.

3) Use compiler optimization flags. For example, the -O3 flag can be used with g++ to turn on all optimizations.

Optimized Code Block:
```
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int H;
vector<int> A(1,0); // Initializing dynamic array with size 1
void maxHeap(int i) {
  int l, r, large;
  l = 2 * i;
  r = 2 * i + 1;
  if (l <= H && A[l] > A[i]) {
    large = l;
  } else {
    large = i;
  }
  if (r <= H && A[r] > A[large]) {
    large = r;
  }
  if (large != i) {
    swap(A[large], A[i]);
    maxHeap(large);
  }
}
int extract() {
  int maxv;
  if (H < 1)
    return -1;
  maxv = A[1];
  A[1] = A[H--];
  A.resize(H+1); // Resize the array after extraction
  maxHeap(1);
  return maxv;
}
void increasekey(int i, int key) {
  if (key < A[i])
    return;
  A[i] = key;
  while (i > 1 && A[i / 2] < A[i]) {
    swap(A[i], A[i / 2]);
    i = i / 2;
  }
}
void insert(int key) {
  H++;
  A.resize(H+1); // Resize the array before insertion
  A[H] = -1;
  increasekey(H, key);
}
int main() {
  int key;
  char com[10];
  while (1) {
    cin >> com;
    if (com[0] == 'e' && com[1] == 'n')
      break;
    if (com[0] == 'i') {
      cin >> key;
      insert(key);
    } else {
      cout << extract() << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code uses a dynamic array (vector) instead of a static one, which can reduce memory usage. The array is resized after each extraction and before each insertion. The loop in the increasekey function is unchanged as unrolling it would not significantly improve the performance. 

The code should be compiled with the -O3 flag to turn on all optimizations.
