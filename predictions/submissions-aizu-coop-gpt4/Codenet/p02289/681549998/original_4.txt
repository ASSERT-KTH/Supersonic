Upon analyzing the code, it can be seen that it is implementing a heap data structure. The code performs insertions and deletions into the heap. The insertion and deletion operations are optimized for a heap data structure, and there is not much scope to optimize these operations further algorithmically.

However, there are still some potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Instead of using arrays to store the heap, we could use a priority_queue data structure provided by the STL in C++. It will handle all the heap operations internally, reducing the code complexity and potential for errors. 

2. The usage of cin and cout for input and output operations is slower compared to scanf and printf. Therefore, replacing cin and cout with scanf and printf can speed up the I/O operations.

3. The input command is being checked character by character. This can be improved by comparing the entire string at once.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

priority_queue<int> heap;

int main() {
	int key;
	string com;
	while (1) {
		scanf("%s", &com[0]);
		if (com == "end") break;
		if (com == "insert") {
			scanf("%d", &key);
			heap.push(key);
		} else {
			printf("%d\n", heap.top());
			heap.pop();
		}
	}
	return 0;
}
```

This optimized code has the following improvements:

1. The code is cleaner and more concise by using the STL priority_queue. This data structure internally handles all the heap operations, making the code easier to understand and less prone to errors.
2. Replacing cin and cout with scanf and printf speeds up the I/O operations, which can be a significant time saver in programs with large amounts of I/O.
3. Comparing strings directly instead of character by character is not only more efficient but also makes the code easier to read.

Please note that the priority queue in C++ is a max heap by default. If you need a min heap, you can initialize it as priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>>.
