This C++ program implements a priority queue using a binary max heap. The main functions are `insert()`, `extract()`, `maxHeap()`, and `increasekey()`. The `insert()` function adds a new key to the heap, `extract()` removes and returns the maximum key of the heap, `maxHeap()` maintains the max heap property, and `increasekey()` increases an element's key and maintains the max heap property.

**1. Code Analysis:**
The code appears to be reasonably well-optimized, but a few potential improvements can be identified:

a. The heap size `H` is a global variable. This can be encapsulated within a class.

b. The use of C-style arrays for implementing the heap. This can be replaced with `std::vector` which provides dynamic memory allocation and resizing.

c. The use of `cin` and `cout` for I/O can be slower than using `scanf` and `printf`.

d. The use of recursion in `maxHeap()` can be replaced with an iterative approach, which can be more efficient as it avoids the overhead of function calls and stack frame creation.

**2. Optimization Strategy:**

a. Encapsulate `A[]` and `H` inside a class named `MaxHeap`. This also allows for better code organization and reusability.

b. Replace the C-style array `A[]` with a `std::vector<int>`.

c. Use `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout`.

d. Replace the recursion in `maxHeap()` with a while loop.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

a. Encapsulating `A[]` and `H` inside a class named `MaxHeap`:
    - This will increase the reusability and maintainability of the code.
    - It also provides better control over the data members.

b. Replacing the C-style array `A[]` with a `std::vector<int>`:
    - `std::vector` provides dynamic memory allocation and resizing.
    - It also provides a range of utility functions such as `size()` and `push_back()`.

c. Using `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout`:
    - The I/O operations using `cin` and `cout` are slower than `scanf` and `printf`.

d. Replacing the recursion in `maxHeap()` with a while loop:
    - The recursion incurs overhead due to function calls and stack frame creation.
    - An iterative approach using a while loop is more efficient.

**4. Optimized Code Block:**

Here is the optimized code:
```C++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define INFTY (1 << 30)

class MaxHeap {
  private:
    vector<int> A;
  public:
    MaxHeap() {
        A.push_back(-INFTY);  // So that the heap starts from index 1
    }
    void maxHeapify(int i) {
      int largest;
      while (true) {
        int l = 2 * i;
        int r = 2 * i + 1;
        if (l < A.size() && A[l] > A[i]) {
          largest = l;
        } else {
          largest = i;
        }
        if (r < A.size() && A[r] > A[largest]) {
          largest = r;
        }
        if (largest != i) {
          swap(A[i], A[largest]);
          i = largest;
        } else {
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    int extract() {
      if (A.size() < 2)
        return -INFTY;
      int maxv = A[1];
      A[1] = A[A.size() - 1];
      A.pop_back();
      maxHeapify(1);
      return maxv;
    }
    void increasekey(int i, int key) {
      if (key < A[i])
        return;
      A[i] = key;
      while (i > 1 && A[i / 2] < A[i]) {
        swap(A[i], A[i / 2]);
        i = i / 2;
      }
    }
    void insert(int key) {
      A.push_back(-INFTY);
      increasekey(A.size() - 1, key);
    }
};

int main() {
  int key;
  char com[10];
  MaxHeap maxHeap;
  while (true) {
    scanf("%s", com);
    if (com[0] == 'e' && com[1] == 'n')
      break;
    if (com[0] == 'i') {
      scanf("%d", &key);
      maxHeap.insert(key);
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", maxHeap.extract());
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized version of the code is more efficient and also more organized, making it easier to understand and maintain. However, it should be noted that code optimization often involves trade-offs. In this case, the code has become slightly longer and more complex due to the introduction of the `MaxHeap` class. But these changes have led to improved performance and code reusability.
