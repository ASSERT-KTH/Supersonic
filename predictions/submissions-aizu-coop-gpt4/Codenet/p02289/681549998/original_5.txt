The given C++ code is an implementation of a binary max heap with operations such as insert, increase key, extract max, and build max heap. The primary aim is to optimize the program for efficiency, reducing the running time and memory usage. Here are the potential areas of optimization:

1. Code Analysis:
    - The function maxHeap is recursively called whenever a swap operation is performed. This could increase the stack memory usage in scenarios involving large heaps.
    - The program uses an array to implement the heap, which is an efficient data structure for this purpose. However, the size of the array is fixed and quite large (2000000), which could lead to wasted memory space if the heap doesn't grow to that size.
    - The main program loops indefinitely until it encounters the command 'end'. This can be expensive in terms of CPU usage.
    - There's usage of both cin/cout and cstdio functions, which might slow down the I/O operations due to sync.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - Implement iterative version of maxHeap to avoid recursion.
    - Use a dynamic data structure such as std::vector to store the heap.
    - Use an exit condition for the 'end' command rather than a continuous loop.
    - Avoid mixing cstdio and iostream functions for I/O operation.
    - Use fast I/O operations.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    1. Implementing an iterative version of maxHeap will reduce the stack memory usage and can also improve the speed as the overhead of recursion is avoided.
    
    2. Using a dynamic data structure like std::vector instead of a fixed-size array allows the heap to grow and shrink as needed, reducing memory waste. Also, std::vector provides a safety layer for accessing its elements.
    
    3. Replacing the indefinite while loop with a do-while loop that breaks when the 'end' command is encountered can reduce CPU usage.
    
    4. The iostream library functions (cin, cout) are generally slower than cstdio functions (scanf, printf). If we turn off the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their C counterparts, we can speed up I/O operations.
    
    5. Fast I/O operations can be used to reduce the time taken for I/O operations. This can be done by using getchar_unlocked(), putchar_unlocked(), or using cin/cout with ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL).
    
4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

#define INFTY (1 << 30)

vector<int> A(1);
int H = 0;

void maxHeap(int i) {
  while (1) {
    int l = 2 * i;
    int r = 2 * i + 1;
    int largest;

    if (l <= H && A[l] > A[i]) largest = l;
    else largest = i;

    if (r <= H && A[r] > A[largest]) largest = r;

    if (largest == i) break;

    swap(A[i], A[largest]);
    i = largest;
  }
}

int extract() {
  if (H < 1) return -INFTY;
  int maxv = A[1];
  A[1] = A[H--];
  maxHeap(1);
  return maxv;
}

void increasekey(int i, int key) {
  A[i] = key;
  while (i > 1 && A[i / 2] < A[i]) {
    swap(A[i], A[i / 2]);
    i = i / 2;
  }
}

void insert(int key) {
  H++;
  if (H >= (int)A.size()) A.resize(A.size()*2);
  A[H] = -INFTY;
  increasekey(H, key);
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int key;
  string com;

  do {
    cin >> com;
    if (com[0] == 'i') {
      cin >> key;
      insert(key);
    } else if (com[0] == 'e' && com[1] != 'n') {
      cout << extract() << "\n";
    }
  } while (com[0] != 'e' || com[1] != 'n');

  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, maxHeap is implemented iteratively, a dynamic vector is used instead of a fixed-size array, and a do-while loop is used to terminate the program when the 'end' command is encountered. Fast I/O operations are also used to improve performance.
