**1. Code Analysis:**

This program is creating a max heap data structure and providing an interface for inserting into the heap and extracting the maximum element. In the main function, it reads commands from the standard input. If the command starts with an 'i', it inserts the number that follows into the heap. If the command starts with any other character, it extracts the max of the heap and prints it. It continues this process until it encounters a command that includes 'd'. The main performance bottlenecks in this program are:

- The use of dynamic memory allocation for the heap array.
- The extraction operation which includes heap sorting operation every time it's called.
- The use of fgets for reading the input which might be slower than other alternatives.

**2. Optimization Strategy:**

A. Use Static Memory Allocation: Instead of dynamically allocating memory for the heap array, we could use static memory allocation. This would reduce the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

B. Optimize Extraction Operation: The current implementation of the extraction operation sorts the heap every time it's called which is unnecessary. We can optimize this by simply swapping the first element with the last, reducing the heap size by one, and then heapifying the remaining heap.

C. Use Faster Input Reading Method: Instead of using fgets to read the input, we can use a faster method such as scanf.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

A. Use Static Memory Allocation: Dynamic memory allocation is slower than static memory allocation because it involves system calls, and it might lead to fragmentation which could further slow down the program. By using static memory allocation, we can eliminate these issues.

B. Optimize Extraction Operation: The current implementation of the extraction operation involves a sorting operation which is unnecessary and could be costly in terms of time complexity. We can optimize this by simply swapping the first element with the last element (since the first element is always the maximum in a max heap), reducing the size of the heap by one, and then heapifying the remaining heap.

C. Use Faster Input Reading Method: fgets is slower than other input reading methods such as scanf because it involves more system calls. By using scanf, we can speed up the input reading process.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Heap {
public:
  Heap() {
    n = 0;
  }
  void insert(int data) {
    array[n] = data;
    int tmp = n;
    while (tmp != 0 && array[tmp] > array[(tmp - 1) / 2]) {
      std::swap(array[tmp], array[(tmp - 1) / 2]);
      tmp = (tmp - 1) / 2;
    }
    n++;
  }
  void max_heapify(int start, int end) {
    int dad = start;
    int son = dad * 2 + 1;
    while (son <= end) {
      if (array[son] < array[son + 1] && son + 1 <= end)
        son++;
      if (array[dad] > array[son])
        return;
      else {
        swap(array[son], array[dad]);
        dad = son;
        son = dad * 2 + 1;
      }
    }
  }
  int extract() {
    int ret = array[0];
    swap(array[0], array[n - 1]);
    n--;
    max_heapify(0, n - 1);
    return ret;
  }

private:
  int array[2000000];
  int n;
};

int main() {
  int insert_data;
  char operation;
  Heap heap;
  while (true) {
    cin >> operation;
    if (operation == 'd')
      break;
    if (operation == 'i') {
      cin >> insert_data;
      heap.insert(insert_data);
    } else {
      cout << heap.extract() << endl;
    }
  }
}
```
