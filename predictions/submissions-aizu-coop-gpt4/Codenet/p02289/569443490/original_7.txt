Code Analysis:
1. The given code defines a class `Heap` that implements a max heap with methods for insert and extract operations, and a heap sort operation. 
2. The `main()` function reads commands from the input, where 'i' followed by a number inserts the number into the heap and 'e' extracts the maximum element from the heap and prints it out.
3. The code uses dynamic memory allocation to create the heap array and doesn't free the memory.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Using std::vector instead of a raw array: Using a raw array with dynamic memory allocation is prone to memory leaks and doesn't provide the benefits of automatic memory management. Replacing this with a std::vector will ensure better memory management.
2. Removing redundant heap sort operation: The `extract()` function currently sorts the entire heap before extracting the maximum element. This is unnecessary because the heap property ensures that the maximum element is at the root of the heap.
3. Input string parsing: The current method of parsing the input string is inefficient, using a more efficient method can improve performance.
4. Use of std::cin and std::cout: The current method using fgets and printf can be replaced with std::cin and std::cout for better type safety and clarity in the code.

Step by Step Explanation:
1. Replacing raw array with std::vector: A std::vector automatically manages memory, resizing as needed, and cleaning up when it goes out of scope. This eliminates the potential for memory leaks and makes the code more robust.
2. Removing heap sort operation in extract: The heap property ensures that the maximum element is at the root of the heap, so there's no need to sort the heap before extracting the maximum. This reduces the time complexity of the extract operation from O(n log n) to O(log n).
3. Parsing input string: Using stringstreams or inbuilt string functions can make the parsing more efficient and clean.
4. Replacing fgets and printf with std::cin and std::cout: The std::cin and std::cout are safer and more intuitive to use, improving the readability of the code.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Heap {
public:
  void insert(int data) {
    array.push_back(data);
    int tmp = array.size() - 1;
    while (tmp != 0 && array[tmp] > array[(tmp - 1) / 2]) {
      std::swap(array[tmp], array[(tmp - 1) / 2]);
      tmp = (tmp - 1) / 2;
    }
  }

  void max_heapify(int start) {
    int dad = start;
    int son = dad * 2 + 1;
    while (son < array.size()) {
      if (son + 1 < array.size() && array[son] < array[son + 1])
        son++;
      if (array[dad] > array[son])
        return;
      else {
        swap(array[son], array[dad]);
        dad = son;
        son = dad * 2 + 1;
      }
    }
  }

  int extract() {
    int ret = array[0];
    array[0] = array.back();
    array.pop_back();
    max_heapify(0);
    return ret;
  }

private:
  vector<int> array;
};

int main() {
  Heap heap;
  char op;
  int num;
  while (cin >> op) {
    switch (op) {
    case 'i':
      cin >> num;
      heap.insert(num);
      break;
    case 'e':
      cout << heap.extract() << endl;
      break;
    case 'd':
      return 0;
    default:
      break;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, we used std::vector to implement the heap, std::cin and std::cout for input and output, and simplified the extract method to make full use of the heap property. This results in a performance improvement and cleaner code.
