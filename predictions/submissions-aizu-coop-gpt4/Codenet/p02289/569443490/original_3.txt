This is a program that implements a max heap and provides the operations of inserting an element and extracting the maximum element.

1. Code Analysis:
The code is straightforward, but we can still identify some areas for optimization.

    1.1. The insert method of Heap class is inefficient because it swaps elements of the array up the heap for each insert operation. 
    1.2. Using raw pointers for heap memory management is error-prone and inefficient. It would be better to use a container class that handles memory management automatically.
    1.3. The function max_heapify is called each time an element is extracted which may be inefficient.
    1.4. The input reading loop in the main function is inefficient and can be simplified.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    2.1. Use a priority_queue instead of manually implementing a heap. Priority queues in C++ are implemented as heaps and the STL implementation is optimized for performance. 
    2.2. Use std::cin and std::cout for input/output operations instead of fgets and printf. This will simplify the code and could improve performance.
    2.3. Use std::stoi to convert string to integer instead of manual parsing.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    3.1. Replace the Heap implementation with a std::priority_queue. This change improves performance as the STL implementation is optimized. It also simplifies the code and reduces the possibility of errors.
    3.2. Replace fgets and printf with std::cin and std::cout. This makes the code more readable and might improve performance as these functions are optimized in most C++ compilers.
    3.3. Replace the manual string-to-integer conversion with std::stoi. This simplifies the code and could potentially improve performance as std::stoi is likely optimized in most C++ compilers.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::priority_queue<int> heap;
    std::string command;
    while (std::cin >> command) {
        if (command == "end") {
            break;
        } else if (command[0] == 'i') {
            int data = std::stoi(command.substr(1));
            heap.push(data);
        } else {
            std::cout << heap.top() << std::endl;
            heap.pop();
        }
    }
}
```
The commands for insert and extract should be entered as "i<number>" (ex: i10) and "e". The end command remains "end".
