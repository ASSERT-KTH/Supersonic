Code Analysis:

1. The use of a dynamic array in the heap class could lead to inefficient memory usage. The array is initialized with a fixed size, which could lead to wastage if not all the allocated memory is used.
2. The insert function in the heap class could be optimized. The while loop is swapping elements to maintain the heap property, which could be done more efficiently.
3. The extract function is using the heap_sort function to sort the array, then reducing the size of the heap by one. This could be optimized by directly extracting the maximum without sorting the entire array every time.
4. The main function is reading input from the stdin using fgets, which is slower than other methods. Furthermore, the conversion of input characters to integer is done manually within a for loop, which could be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the dynamic array with a vector. Vectors in C++ are dynamic and can efficiently handle memory allocation and deallocation.
2. Use the push_heap algorithm from the standard library in the insert function to efficiently maintain the heap property.
3. In the extract function, use the pop_heap algorithm from the standard library to efficiently extract the maximum without sorting the entire array.
4. Use the fast I/O methods in C++ to read input and convert characters to integers.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Heap {
public:
  vector<int> heap;

  void insert(int data) {
    heap.push_back(data);
    push_heap(heap.begin(), heap.end());
  }

  int extract() {
    pop_heap(heap.begin(), heap.end());
    int max = heap.back();
    heap.pop_back();
    return max;
  }
};

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int insert_data;
  char operation;
  Heap heap;
  while (true) {
    cin >> operation;
    if (operation == 'd')
      break;
    if (operation == 'i') {
      cin >> insert_data;
      heap.insert(insert_data);
    } else {
      cout << heap.extract() << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The given optimized code first makes the heap into a vector for dynamic memory handling. The insert function now uses the push_heap function from the standard library to efficiently maintain the heap property. The extract function uses the pop_heap function from the standard library to efficiently extract the maximum without sorting the entire array. The main function uses fast I/O methods to read input and convert characters to integers.
