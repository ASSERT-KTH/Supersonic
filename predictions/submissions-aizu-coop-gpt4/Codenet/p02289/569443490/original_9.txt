### Code Analysis

The provided program is a simple implementation of a max heap data structure with methods for inserting a new element (`insert`) and extracting the maximum element (`extract`). The heap is organized so that the parent of an element is always larger than its children.

Potential performance bottlenecks identified include:

1. In the `insert` method, the while loop is used to place the inserted element in its correct position in the heap. This operation is performed in O(logn) time where n is the size of the heap. However, the operation of swapping elements could be better optimized.

2. In the `max_heapify` method, the while loop is used to ensure that the heap property is maintained after an element is extracted. This operation is also performed in O(logn) time. Again, the operation of swapping elements could be better optimized.

3. In the `heap_sort` method, the operation of swapping elements could be better optimized.

4. The buffer size used in the `main` function to read user's input is fixed to 22 characters. If the user inputs more characters, it could potentially cause a buffer overflow error.

5. The way user's input is being processed to identify the operation (either "insert" or "extract") and the number to insert is inefficient. It involves checking each character of the input string one by one.

6. The heap array is dynamically allocated with a fixed size of 2000000 integers. If the heap grows beyond this limit, it will result in a heap overflow error. On the other hand, if the heap size is much smaller than this limit, it would result in wasted memory.

### Optimization Strategy

1. Use bitwise operators for operations that involve division or multiplication by 2. These operators are faster than arithmetic operators.

2. Modify the way user's input is processed to identify the operation and the number to insert. Instead of checking each character one by one, use the `sscanf` function which is more efficient.

3. Dynamically resize the heap array based on its current size. Start with a smaller size and double it whenever it's full. This way, it will avoid heap overflow errors and also minimize wasted memory.

4. Use the `scanf` function instead of `fgets` for reading user's input. This will automatically handle cases where the user inputs more characters than the buffer size. Also, it allows us to easily extract the operation and the number to insert at the same time.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Replace `(tmp - 1) / 2` with `(tmp - 1) >> 1` in the `insert` method. The right shift operator `>>` is equivalent to division by 2 but faster.

2. Replace `dad * 2 + 1` with `(dad << 1) + 1` in the `max_heapify` method. The left shift operator `<<` is equivalent to multiplication by 2 but faster.

3. Change the way user's input is processed in the `main` function. Use the `sscanf` function to identify the operation and the number to insert in one go.

4. Dynamically resize the heap array in the `insert` method. Check if the array is full before inserting a new element. If it is, create a new array with double the size, copy the elements from the old array to the new one, and delete the old array.

5. Replace `fgets(buf, 22, stdin)` with `scanf("%s", buf)`. This will prevent buffer overflow errors and make the code simpler.

6. Use the `scanf` function to read the operation and the number to insert at the same time. This will make the code simpler and more efficient.
