## Code Analysis
The code represents a Max Heap data structure implementation with methods to insert an element, max_heapify (for maintaining the heap property) and extract the maximum element. The main function reads from the standard input, if it reads 'i' it inserts the following number into the heap, otherwise, it extracts the maximum number from the heap and prints it.

## Optimization Strategy
1. **Inefficient data structures:** The code uses an array to represent the heap. This is efficient for memory usage, but it's not the best choice for readability and maintainability. An std::vector could be a better option for dynamic size arrays and will not affect the performance.

2. **Redundant computations:** The code converts the input string to an integer by multiplying and adding up for each digit. This can be replaced with a standard function like std::stoi which can be faster and more readable.

3. **Loops or recursive calls:** The loops and recursive calls in this code are necessary to maintain the heap property, and cannot be simplified or optimized without changing the algorithm.

4. **Compiler optimizations:** The code does not contain any compiler optimizations or pragma directives. We could potentially use compiler flags for optimization (like -O2 or -O3), but these are not in the code itself.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Use std::vector instead of int array:** Using std::vector for dynamic size arrays is better for readability and maintainability. It provides an interface for common operations and automatically manages the memory. Additionally, std::vector is as fast as an array for access to elements.

2. **Use std::stoi for string to int conversion:** The current implementation of string to int conversion is not efficient and hard to read. It's better to use a standard function like std::stoi which is faster and more readable.

3. **Use std::getline for reading input:** fgets is a C function and it's better to use C++ functions for a C++ program. std::getline is a C++ function for reading a line from a stream. It's more idiomatic and can be used with std::string which is easier to handle than char array.

4. **Use std::cout for output:** printf is a C function and it's better to use C++ functions for a C++ program. std::cout is a C++ function for writing to a stream. It's more idiomatic and can be used with any type that overloads the << operator, which is easier to handle than formatting a string.

## Optimized Code Block

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Heap {
public:
    Heap() : n(0) {}

    void insert(int data) {
        array.push_back(data);
        int tmp = n;
        while (tmp != 0 && array[tmp] > array[(tmp - 1) / 2]) {
            std::swap(array[tmp], array[(tmp - 1) / 2]);
            tmp = (tmp - 1) / 2;
        }
        ++n;
    }

    void max_heapify(int start, int end) {
        int dad = start;
        int son = dad * 2 + 1;
        while (son <= end) {
            if (array[son] < array[son + 1] && son + 1 <= end)
                ++son;
            if (array[dad] > array[son])
                return;
            else {
                std::swap(array[son], array[dad]);
                dad = son;
                son = dad * 2 + 1;
            }
        }
    }

    int heap_sort(int len) {
        std::swap(array[0], array[len - 1]);
        max_heapify(0, len - 2);
        return array[len - 1];
    }

    int extract() {
        int ret = heap_sort(n);
        --n;
        array.pop_back();
        return ret;
    }

private:
    std::vector<int> array;
    int n;
};

int main() {
    std::string line;
    Heap heap;
    while (std::getline(std::cin, line)) {
        if (line[2] == 'd')
            break;
        if (line[0] == 'i') {
            heap.insert(std::stoi(line.substr(1)));
        } else {
            std::cout << heap.extract() << "\n";
        }
    }
}
```

The above code maintains the same functionality as the original code but it's more readable and maintainable. The changes are minimal and do not affect the complexity of the code. The performance gain is not significant, but the code is more idiomatic and easier to read and maintain.
