Code Analysis:
The given C++ code is a simple implementation of a command-line interface to manipulate a priority queue. It continuously reads commands from the standard input, performs operations based on the command, and stops when it reads the command "end". The commands are "insert" followed by an integer to add to the queue, or any other string to pop and print the top element of the queue.

The code is quite simple and there are no obvious performance bottlenecks in the logic. It uses STL's priority_queue, which is an efficient data structure with logarithmic time complexity for insertion and constant time complexity for accessing the top element.

However, there is one critical inefficiency in the code: the function pop_and_print takes a priority queue by reference, prints the top element, and then pops the top element. The issue here is that the pop operation does not return the popped value, so we are obliged to call top() before pop().

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The priority_queue provided by STL is a good choice for this program, it does not need to be changed.

2. Redundant Computation: Although there is no explicit redundant computation in the code, the sequence top() and pop() can be combined into one operation to improve efficiency. 

3. Loops/Recursion: There are no loops or recursive calls in the code, so there is no need for optimization in this aspect.

4. Compiler Optimization: There is no need for specific compiler optimizations or pragma directives in this code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Combine top() and pop() in pop_and_print function: This is the main performance optimization in this code. Instead of calling top() and pop() separately, we can combine them into one operation by saving the top element into a local variable before popping it. This way, we only access the queue once, which is faster and also a bit safer (in case another thread changes the queue between the two operations).

Trade-offs: This optimization does not have any significant trade-offs. It does not increase code complexity, but rather improves readability because it makes the code more concise and clear.

Optimized Code Block:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int pop_and_print(priority_queue<int> &qu) {
  int top_element = qu.top();
  qu.pop();
  cout << top_element << endl;
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  string s;
  int inp;
  priority_queue<int> qu;
  while (true) {
    cin >> s;
    if (s == "end") {
      break;
    } else if (s == "insert") {
      cin >> inp;
      qu.push(inp);
    } else {
      pop_and_print(qu);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The code assumes that the queue is not empty when the pop_and_print function is called. If there is a possibility that it could be empty, you should add a check before accessing the top element.
