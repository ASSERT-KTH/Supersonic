**Step 1: Code Analysis**

Looking at the code, it's a simple CLI program that performs operations on a priority queue. The priority queue `qu` is a max heap, and the operations are `insert` to add an element and `pop_and_print` to remove the topmost element and print it. 

Here are some potential optimization points:

1. The function `pop_and_print` is called without checking if the queue is empty. This can cause undefined behavior if the queue is empty.
2. The function `pop_and_print` takes a priority queue as an argument by reference. In C++, passing by reference is usually done for large data structures to avoid unnecessary copying. However, in this case, since `pop_and_print` is not meant to be used outside of this file, it could be defined inside the main function.
3. The main loop is an infinite loop that only breaks when 'end' is entered. This is not efficient and can be improved.
4. The use of `endl` for printing introduces unnecessary overhead. Replacing it with `"\n"` can improve performance.

**Step 2: Optimization Strategy**

1. Add a check in `pop_and_print` to ensure the queue is not empty before popping and printing.
2. Move the `pop_and_print` function into the main function as a lambda to avoid passing the priority queue by reference.
3. Change the infinite loop to a while loop that only runs as long as there is input to read.
4. Replace `endl` with `"\n"` to improve performance.

**Step 3: Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. Before calling `pop` and `top` on the queue, we need to check if the queue is not empty. This prevents undefined behavior in case the queue is empty. This change not only provides a performance boost but also makes the code more robust.
2. By defining `pop_and_print` as a lambda inside the `main` function, we avoid passing the queue by reference. This simplifies the code and can provide a small performance boost.
3. Instead of having an infinite loop and breaking it when 'end' is entered, we can simply loop as long as there is input to read from cin. This makes the loop condition more explicit, which can help the compiler optimize the loop.
4. `endl` not only inserts a newline character, but also flushes the output buffer. This flushing is usually unnecessary and can degrade performance. By replacing `endl` with `"\n"`, we speed up the printing operation.

**Step 4: Optimized Code Block**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <limits.h>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string s;
  int inp;
  priority_queue<int> qu;

  // Define the pop_and_print function as a lambda inside main
  auto pop_and_print = [&]() {
    if (!qu.empty()) {
      cout << qu.top() << "\n"; // Use "\n" instead of endl
      qu.pop();
    }
  };

  // Loop as long as there is input to read
  while (cin >> s) {
    if (s == "end") {
      break;
    } else if (s == "insert") {
      cin >> inp;
      qu.push(inp);
    } else {
      pop_and_print();
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
