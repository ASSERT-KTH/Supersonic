Code Analysis:
The given C++ program takes user inputs and puts them into a priority queue if the input is "insert". If the user inputs anything other than "insert" and "end", it pops the largest element from the queue and prints it. The program runs until the user inputs "end".

Potential areas of optimization:
1. The function "pop_and_print" takes a priority_queue by reference and pops an element from it after printing. This function is called every time the user inputs anything other than "insert" and "end". However, it does not check if the queue is empty before popping an element, which can potentially lead to runtime error if the queue is empty.

2. The "pop_and_print" function always returns 0, which is not used anywhere in the main function. This is unnecessary.

3. The program uses "cin" and "cout" for input and output, which are slower compared to other methods like "scanf" and "printf".

Optimization Strategy:
1. Add a check in the "pop_and_print" function to ensure the queue is not empty before trying to pop an element.

2. Remove the return statement from the "pop_and_print" function as it is not being used.

3. Replace "cin" and "cout" with "scanf" and "printf" for faster input and output.

4. Instead of using "s == 'end'" or "s == 'insert'", we can use "s.compare('end')" or "s.compare('insert')". String comparison using '==' operator is slower because it compares the strings character by character, while "compare()" function is faster.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <limits.h>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Optimized pop_and_print function
void pop_and_print(priority_queue<int> &qu) {
  if (!qu.empty()) {   // Check if the queue is not empty
    printf("%d\n", qu.top());
    qu.pop();
  }
}

int main() {
  string s;
  int inp;
  priority_queue<int> qu;
  char command[10];
  while (1) {
    scanf("%s", command);
    s = string(command);
    if (s.compare("end") == 0) { // Faster string comparison
      break;
    } else if (s.compare("insert") == 0) { // Faster string comparison
      scanf("%d", &inp);
      qu.push(inp);
    } else {
      pop_and_print(qu);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code should run faster and avoid potential runtime errors due to popping an empty queue. The trade-off here is that "scanf" and "printf" can be a bit harder to use compared to "cin" and "cout", especially for beginners. However, the speed gain is usually worth it for performance-critical applications.
