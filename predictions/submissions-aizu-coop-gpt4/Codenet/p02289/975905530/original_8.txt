Code Analysis:

The code given above is a simple implementation of a priority queue in C++. The "main" function loops indefinitely until it receives the input string "end", at which point it breaks the loop and ends the program. The loop accepts two types of commands: "insert", which takes a subsequent integer input and adds it to the priority queue, and any other command, which pops the top element from the priority queue and prints it. 

This code is quite simple and there isn't much to optimize in terms of algorithmic efficiency, as priority queues are already an efficient data structure for this type of task. The main performance issue in this code is the unnecessary copying of data when the priority queue is passed to the "pop_and_print" function.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Pass the priority queue by reference to the "pop_and_print" function.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Passing the priority queue by reference to "pop_and_print": In the original code, the priority queue is passed by value to the "pop_and_print" function. This means that a copy of the entire queue is made every time this function is called, which is unnecessary and can be quite costly in terms of time and memory if the queue is large. Instead, we can pass the queue by reference, which avoids this copying.

Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Pass the queue by reference to avoid copying.
int pop_and_print(priority_queue<int>& qu) {
  // Check if the queue is empty to avoid popping from an empty queue.
  if (!qu.empty()) {
    cout << qu.top() << endl;
    qu.pop();
  }
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  string s;
  int inp;
  priority_queue<int> qu;
  while (1) {
    cin >> s;
    if (s == "end") {
      break;
    } else if (s == "insert") {
      cin >> inp;
      qu.push(inp);
    } else {
      pop_and_print(qu);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code is more efficient than the original code, as it avoids unnecessary copying of the priority queue. The functionality and output remain the same. The only trade-off is a slight increase in code complexity due to the added check for an empty queue in the "pop_and_print" function. However, this is a minor trade-off considering the performance gain.
