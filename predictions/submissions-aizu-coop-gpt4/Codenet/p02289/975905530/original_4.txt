Code Analysis:
The given C++ program is a simple implementation of a priority queue. It keeps reading user commands from standard input and performs operations on the priority queue accordingly. If "insert" command is given, it inserts the next input integer into the queue. If "end" command is given, it ends the program. For any other command, it pops the top element from the queue and prints it.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Pass `priority_queue` by reference to avoid unnecessary copying.
2. Minimize I/O operations as they are generally slower.
3. Instead of checking for "end" in each iteration, use a `while(cin >> s && s != "end")` loop to exit once the input is "end".
4. In the `pop_and_print` function, check if the queue is empty before trying to pop and print. This can prevent unnecessary function calls and exceptions.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

void pop_and_print(priority_queue<int> &qu) {
  if (!qu.empty()) {
    cout << qu.top() << endl;
    qu.pop();
  }
}

int main() {
  string s;
  int inp;
  priority_queue<int> qu;
  while (cin >> s && s != "end") {
    if (s == "insert") {
      cin >> inp;
      qu.push(inp);
    } else {
      pop_and_print(qu);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The `priority_queue` is passed by reference to the `pop_and_print` function. This avoids creating a copy of the queue which can be expensive in terms of both time and space complexity.

2. I/O operations are expensive, so it's best to minimize them. In the original program, the "end" check is done after each input, which is less efficient. In the optimized program, the "end" check is done during input, reducing the number of I/O operations.

3. The `pop_and_print` function now checks if the queue is empty before trying to pop and print. This prevents unnecessary function calls and potential exceptions when trying to pop from an empty queue.

4. The `pop_and_print` function is changed to a `void` function since it does not need to return a value. This makes the code cleaner and more readable.

5. The `using namespace std;` directive is generally not recommended in production code as it can lead to name clashes. However, it is kept in the optimized code for simplicity and as the original program used it.

Trade-offs:
1. The optimized code is slightly more complex due to the additional check for an empty queue before popping and printing. However, this is a necessary check to prevent exceptions and is considered good practice. The increase in code complexity is minimal and the benefit in terms of error prevention and efficiency outweighs it.

2. The optimized code uses less I/O operations which improves performance but makes the code slightly less intuitive to read for beginners. However, the advantage of increased performance outweighs this minor drawback.
