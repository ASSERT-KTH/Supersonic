Code Analysis:
The given code is a simple command-line program that takes user input to either insert an integer into a priority queue, or print and remove the top element of the priority queue. The code is generally efficient as it is, but there are a few areas where we could make some optimizations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The function `pop_and_print()` is called whenever an "insert" command is not given. This could cause a problem if the queue is empty, as the `pop()` and `top()` functions are called without checking if there's anything in the queue to pop or retrieve. We can optimize this by including a check for whether the queue is empty before trying to pop or print from it.

2. The function `pop_and_print()` returns an integer, specifically zero, but this returned value is not used by the caller. This is unnecessary and can be optimized by changing the return type of the function to void.

3. There are unnecessary uses of `std::endl` which also flushes the output buffer. We can replace this with a newline character `\n` to improve the performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Check if queue is empty: Before calling `pop()` or `top()`, we should check if there are any elements in the queue. This will prevent runtime errors from trying to pop or retrieve an element from an empty queue.

2. Change function return type: The function `pop_and_print()` doesn't need to return anything, since the caller doesn't use the returned value. Changing the return type to void reduces memory usage and removes the need for a return statement.

3. Replace `std::endl` with `\n`: The `std::endl` not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output buffer. This can be a costly operation, especially in a loop. Replacing it with `\n` can improve performance.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits.h>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Changed return type to void as the returned value is not used.
void pop_and_print(priority_queue<int> &qu) {
  // Check if queue is empty before popping.
  if (!qu.empty()) {
    cout << qu.top() << '\n';  // Replaced std::endl with '\n'
    qu.pop();
  } else {
    cout << "Queue is empty\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  string s;
  int inp;
  priority_queue<int> qu;
  while (1) {
    cin >> s;
    if (s == "end") {
      break;
    } else if (s == "insert") {
      cin >> inp;
      qu.push(inp);
    } else {
      pop_and_print(qu);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
