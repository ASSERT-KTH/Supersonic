1. Code Analysis:
This program reads commands from the console. If the `insert` command is entered, it reads an integer number and inserts it into a priority queue. If any other command but `end` is entered, it pops the highest number from the queue and prints it. If `end` is entered, the program stops execution.

2. Optimization Strategy:
As a performance-focused C/C++ developer, I would lay out the following optimization strategy.
    1. Use of references or pointers when passing large data types to functions.
    2. Using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to speed up C++ I/O operations.
    3. Profiling the code to identify any other potential performance bottlenecks.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. In the `pop_and_print` function, the priority queue `qu` is passed by reference, which is already an efficient way of passing data. However, there are no checks to ensure that the queue is not empty before calling `qu.top()` and `qu.pop()`. This can result in undefined behavior if the queue is empty. Therefore, we should add a check to ensure that the queue is not empty before accessing and popping its top element.
    2. Adding `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` at the beginning of the `main` function. This line disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. By default, all standard streams are synchronized at the beginning of the program. However, turning off synchronization can significantly speed up I/O operations. We are not using C-style input/output in our program, so we can safely disable synchronization.
    3. Profiling the code can help identify if there are any other performance bottlenecks. However, given the simplicity of the code, it is unlikely that there are any significant bottlenecks.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int pop_and_print(priority_queue<int> &qu) {
  if (!qu.empty()) {
    cout << qu.top() << endl;
    qu.pop();
  } else {
    cout << "Queue is empty." << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // Speed up I/O operations
  string s;
  int inp;
  priority_queue<int> qu;
  while (true) {
    cin >> s;
    if (s == "end") {
      break;
    } else if (s == "insert") {
      cin >> inp;
      qu.push(inp);
    } else {
      pop_and_print(qu);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code will have the same functionality as the original one but with faster I/O operations and safer queue operations due to the added check.
