Code Analysis:

The given code is a simple C++ program that uses a priority queue to store integers. The user can insert numbers or print and remove the largest number. The program stops when the user inputs "end".

Potential bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. The function pop_and_print() is called for every "pop" operation. This function call can be avoided by moving its functionality into the main function.
2. The usage of std::endl to print the top of the queue might be inefficient, as it forces a flush of the output buffer. We can use "\n" instead of std::endl for more efficient output.
3. The string comparison operation (s == "insert" and s == "end") can be optimized by using a hash map which maps the strings to integer codes. This allows us to switch over integral values instead of performing string comparisons.
4. The priority_queue is passed by reference to the pop_and_print function, which is good, but we can further optimize the code by avoiding this function call altogether. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Move the functionality of pop_and_print() into the main function to avoid function call overhead.
2. Replace std::endl with "\n" for efficient output.
3. Use a hash map to replace string comparisons with integer comparisons.
4. Remove the pop_and_print function since its functionality will be incorporated into the main function.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string s;
  int inp;
  priority_queue<int> qu;
  unordered_map<string, int> commandMap = {{"end", 0}, {"insert", 1}};

  while (1) {
    cin >> s;
    switch(commandMap[s]){
      case 0: // end
        return 0;
      case 1: // insert
        cin >> inp;
        qu.push(inp);
        break;
      default: // print and pop
        cout << qu.top() << '\n';
        qu.pop();
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: As a result of these optimizations, the code is slightly more complex due to the introduction of the unordered_map. However, the trade-off is improved performance, especially for large inputs. Also, the code logic remains clear as the switch-case structure directly maps to the original if-else structure.
