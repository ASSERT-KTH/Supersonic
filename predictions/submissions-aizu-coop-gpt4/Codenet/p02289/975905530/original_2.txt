1. Code Analysis:

This code represents a simple command line program that reads commands from the user, stores integers in a priority queue and prints the top of the queue when requested.

Here are the potential performance bottlenecks and areas of inefficient memory usage:

- The function `pop_and_print` takes a priority_queue reference as a parameter and pops an element from it after printing. But there's no check to see if the queue is empty before calling `pop()`. This might not necessarily slow down the program but it could crash the program if `pop()` is called on an empty queue.
- The input string `s` and integer `inp` are being created in each iteration of the infinite loop in main. This can be optimized to reduce memory allocation overhead.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Move the declaration of `s` and `inp` out of the loop to avoid unnecessary memory allocation in each iteration.
    2. Check if the queue is empty before calling `pop()` to avoid potential program crash.
    3. Implement error handling for the user input. For instance, if a user types a non-integer value for the 'insert' command, the program will crash.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Move the `s` and `inp` variables declaration outside of the loop. This will avoid unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation in each iteration of the loop, which is a costly operation in terms of time complexity.
    2. Add a check for whether the queue is empty before calling `pop()`. This will prevent the program from crashing if the user tries to pop from an empty queue.
    3. Implement basic error handling for user input. This might slightly increase the complexity of the code, but it will make it more robust and user-friendly.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits.h>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int pop_and_print(priority_queue<int> &qu) {
  if(qu.empty()) {
    cout << "The queue is empty." << endl;
    return 0;
  }
  cout << qu.top() << endl;
  qu.pop();
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  string s;
  int inp;
  priority_queue<int> qu;

  // Moved s and inp declaration out of the loop
  while (1) {
    if(!(cin >> s)) {
       cout << "Invalid command. Please try again." << endl;
       cin.clear();
       cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\n');
       continue;
    }
    
    if (s == "end") {
      break;
    } else if (s == "insert") {
      if(!(cin >> inp)) {
         cout << "Invalid number. Please try again." << endl;
         cin.clear();
         cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\n');
         continue;
      }
      qu.push(inp);
    } else {
      pop_and_print(qu);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code has similar functionality to the original code, but it is more efficient in terms of memory usage, it has basic error handling, and it doesn't crash when `pop()` is called on an empty queue.
