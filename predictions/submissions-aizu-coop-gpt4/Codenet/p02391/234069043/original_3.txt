The provided code is a simple C++ program that reads two integers from the standard input and then compares them, printing a message according to the result of the comparison. This code is already quite efficient and there aren't many areas for optimization as the operations performed (reading, comparing and printing integers) are all inexpensive.

However, there are a few improvements that can be made in terms of code quality:

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` directive isn't recommended for use in production code because it includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down your compilation times. It's better to only include the headers that you need.

2. The `#include <algorithm>` directive is unnecessary since this code doesn't use any algorithms provided by the C++ standard library.

3. The `#include <vector>` directive is also unnecessary since this code doesn't use any vectors.

4. The variable `pai` is defined but not used, which is a waste of resources.

5. Instead of using `scanf` and `printf`, it's more idiomatic in C++ to use `std::cin` and `std::cout`.

6. Instead of printing out three separate messages for each comparison case, you can store the result in a string and print it out once.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;

    string result;
    if (a > b)
        result = "a > b";
    else if (a < b)
        result = "a < b";
    else
        result = "a == b";

    cout << result << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code still performs the exact same task as the original code, but it's cleaner and more idiomatic in C++. It also avoids including unnecessary headers and declaring unused variables, which can help to speed up compilation times and reduce memory usage. However, the overall performance improvement would be negligible in practice, as the operations performed by the code are already very efficient.
