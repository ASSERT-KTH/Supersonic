Code Analysis:
The given code is relatively simple. It accepts two integers from the user, compares them, and then prints a message based on the result of the comparison. It also defines an unused variable `pai` and unnecessary include directives.

Though the code is simple, there are still areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary variable: The `pai` variable is defined but never used, which is a waste of memory.
2. Unnecessary libraries: `<algorithm>` and `<bits/stdc++.h>` libraries are included but not used, which increases the compilation time.
3. Multiple `printf` statements: Each `printf` statement has a cost associated with it. We can reduce this by using a single `printf` statement.
4. Use of `scanf` and `printf`: These are slower than `cin` and `cout` in C++. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove the unused `pai` variable.
2. Remove the unnecessary libraries from the include directives.
3. Use a single `cout` statement instead of multiple `printf` statements.
4. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` for faster input and output.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;

  // single cout statement for comparison
  cout << "a " << (a == b ? "==" : a > b ? ">" : "<") << " b\n";

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of Optimizations:

1. Removing unused variables and unnecessary libraries: This reduces memory usage and compilation time, leading to a faster and more efficient program. The only library we need here is `<iostream>` for `cin` and `cout`.

2. Using a single `cout` statement: This reduces the number of `cout` calls, which can be expensive. We use the ternary operator to choose the correct string based on the comparison of `a` and `b`. This is faster than using multiple `if` or `else if` statements.

3. Replacing `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`: In C++, `cin` and `cout` are generally faster than `scanf` and `printf`. They also have the advantage of type safety.

Trade-offs:

The optimized code is slightly more complex due to the use of nested ternary operators. However, this complexity is outweighed by the improved performance and efficiency.
