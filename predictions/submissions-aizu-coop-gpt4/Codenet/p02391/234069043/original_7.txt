The given code is a small program that takes two integer inputs and compares them, printing whether one is greater than, less than, or equal to the other. The program is quite simple and there are not many performance bottlenecks. However, there are still a few minor improvements that we can make:

1. **Unnecessary Library Imports**: The program imports `<algorithm>`, `<bits/stdc++.h>`, and `<vector>` but none of these are used. These can be removed to slightly reduce the programâ€™s compilation time.

2. **Unused Variable**: The variable `pai` is declared and assigned a value but not used anywhere in the code. Removing it will save a small amount of memory.

3. **Use of printf and scanf**: While `printf` and `scanf` are not inherently bad or inefficient, in C++ it is more idiomatic to use `cin` and `cout`. These are easier to use correctly and are less error-prone. While the performance difference is negligible, it's a good practice to adopt.

4. **Code Duplication**: The `printf` statements are repeated three times. We can store the comparison result as a string and print it once, reducing code duplication.

Here's the optimized code with the above mentioned changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;

  string result;
  if (a > b)
    result = "a > b";
  else if (a < b)
    result = "a < b";
  else
    result = "a == b";

  cout << result << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program is slightly cleaner and more idiomatic while maintaining the same functionality as the original code. It also has slightly smaller memory footprint due to removal of unused variable and libraries.
