Code Analysis:

1. The code reads two integer inputs from the user, compares them, and outputs the result. The performance of this small program is generally not a concern as it doesn't have any heavy computation or complex data structures.

Optimization Strategy:

However, there are a few points that can be improved:

1. The code has included both `<algorithm>` and `<bits/stdc++.h>`. The latter is a GCC extension that includes every standard library. This might slow down the compilation process. For this small program, we don't require all standard libraries, so we can remove the unnecessary includes.

2. The `double pai = 3.141592653589;` is unused in the code and can be removed.

3. The `printf` and `scanf` functions are used for I/O operations which are slower than `cin` and `cout` in C++. We can replace them for better performance.

4. Also, we can use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to disable the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding C standard streams for faster I/O operations.

5. In C++, it's better to use `std::` prefix with every standard library function for readability and to avoid name conflicts.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // Optimizing I/O operations
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;

    if (a > b)
        cout << "a > b\n";
    else if (a < b)
        cout << "a < b\n";
    else
        cout << "a == b\n";

    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we've removed the unused variable and unnecessary includes. We've also optimized I/O operations and replaced C-style I/O functions with their C++ counterparts for better performance. Despite these modifications, the functionality and the output of the original code are preserved.
