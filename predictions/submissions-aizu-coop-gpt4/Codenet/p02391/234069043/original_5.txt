Code Analysis:

In the given code, there are some inefficiencies and redundancies that can be improved for better performance:

1. The header file `<bits/stdc++.h>` is included. This header file includes almost all standard library headers in C++, which can slow down the compilation time, although it does not affect running time. If you are only using a few libraries, it's better to include them separately. 

2. The variable `pai` is declared and assigned a value but is not used in the code.

3. In the comparison process, the conditions are checked sequentially, which can cause inefficiencies if most of the time `a` and `b` are equal. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file and only include necessary headers.

2. Remove the unused variable `pai`.

3. Rearrange the if-else conditions to check for equality first as it might be the most frequent scenario.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  
  if (a == b) {
    printf("a == b\n");
  } else if (a > b) {
    printf("a > b\n");
  } else {
    printf("a < b\n");
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

The above code removes the unused variable and the unnecessary header file, and rearranges the if-else conditions. These optimizations result in faster compilation time and slightly improved runtime efficiency. However, the optimization in the if-else conditions highly depends on the most probable input scenario. If the equality case is not the most frequent, then the original arrangement might be better.
