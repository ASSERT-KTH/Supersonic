Code Analysis:
This C++ program compares two integers a and b, and then prints out the result of the comparison. The code is simple and there isn't much room for significant optimization. However, few minor improvements can be made:

1. The "#include <algorithm>" and "#include <vector>" are not used at all, nor is the variable "pai". These can be removed to reduce memory overhead.
2. The "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" is a header file that includes a lot of standard library headers. Including it can slow down the compilation process because it loads many unnecessary libraries, which can be a performance issue for larger programs. It's better to include only the necessary headers.
3. The scanf and printf can be replaced with cin and cout for better C++ style, although this will not impact performance significantly.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unused #include directives and variables.
2. Replace "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" with necessary specific library.
3. Replace scanf and printf with cin and cout.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  
  if (a > b)
    cout << "a > b\n";
  else if (a < b)
    cout << "a < b\n";
  else
    cout << "a == b\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```

This code performs exactly the same function as the original, but with a few minor improvements. It is cleaner and more idiomatic C++, and it avoids unnecessary memory overhead.
