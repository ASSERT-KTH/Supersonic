Code Analysis: 

This code is a simple one that takes two integer inputs, compares them, and then outputs a message based on the comparison. 

1. The program includes "bits/stdc++.h" which is a header file that includes every standard library. This can increase compilation time as it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries. It's better to include only the libraries that we are using in our program.

2. The variable "pai" is declared but not used anywhere in the program, which is wasteful.

3. The choice of data structure is not a problem in this code as we are dealing with only two integer variables.

4. There are no loops or recursive calls in the program that need optimization. 

5. The code is straightforward and doesn't have any noticeable performance bottlenecks.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove the unnecessary includes, specifically "bits/stdc++.h" and "algorithm" which are not used.

2. Remove the unused variable "pai".

3. Use cin and cout instead of scanf and printf for better type safety.

Optimized Code Block:

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  if (a > b)
    cout << "a > b\n";
  else if (a < b)
    cout << "a < b\n";
  else
    cout << "a == b\n";
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we removed unnecessary includes, and an unused variable, which reduce memory usage and improves readability. We also replaced scanf and printf with cin and cout for better type safety. The functionality of the program remains the same. The trade-off is negligible in this optimization. The code complexity remains the same, but the readability has improved.
