Code Analysis:

1. The code above primarily compares two integers a and b and outputs the comparison result. 
2. The program includes three unnecessary headers: "algorithm", "bits/stdc++.h", and "vector". The code does not use any functions, objects, or data types from these headers, resulting in unnecessary memory usage. 
3. There is an unused double variable, "pai", which contains the value of pi. Again, this results in unnecessary memory usage. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unused headers: We only need "stdio.h" for standard I/O operations.
2. Remove unused variables: Since the variable "pai" is not used, we can get rid of it.

Step-by-step Explanation:

1. Removing unused headers:
    - Rationale: Removing headers that are not used by the program decreases the memory footprint of the program. 
    - Trade-off: There is no trade-off in this case since the code does not use any functions, objects, or data types from these headers. 

2. Removing unused variables:
    - Rationale: Removing unused variables also decreases the memory footprint of the program. 
    - Trade-off: There is no trade-off in this case since the variable "pai" is not used in the program. 

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  if (a > b)
    printf("a > b\n");
  else if (a < b)
    printf("a < b\n");
  else
    printf("a == b\n");
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized version of the program uses only the "stdio.h" header and removes the unused variable "pai". The functionality of the original code is preserved. The changes are minimal and the code remains easily understandable.
