### Code Analysis:

The provided code is implementing a parser for a mathematical expression, evaluating the expression for all possible combinations of operator precedence, and outputting the maximum result.

1. The function `getNum` is reading a number from the string `S` starting at position `p`.

2. The function `get` is performing the operation specified by `c` on the operands `a` and `b`.

3. The function `calc` is parsing an expression from the string `S` starting at position `p`. It continues parsing until it reaches a character with a lower precedence than `c` or the end of the string.

4. The function `bnf` is parsing an expression from the string `S` starting at position `p`. It continues parsing until it reaches a closing parenthesis or the end of the string.

5. The main function reads the string `S`, calculates the result of the expression for the default operator precedence, and then tries all possible operator precedences and keeps the maximum result.

This code seems mostly optimized. However, there are a few approaches we can take to optimize it further by focusing on reducing unnecessary calculations.

### Optimization Strategy:

1. **Operator Precedence Calculation:** The code calculates the result for each possible operator precedence in a brute force manner. This part can be optimized by avoiding recalculations.

2. **Character Array:** The array `ch` is of size `1 << 8`, however, only three elements are used. This can be optimized.

3. **Compiler Optimization:** Use compiler optimization flags to further increase the performance of the code.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Operator Precedence Calculation:** The code calculates the result for each possible operator precedence in a brute force manner, which is not efficient. We can avoid recalculations by storing previously computed results in a hash map where the key is the string `S` and the value is the result. Before calculating the result, we can check the hash map to see if the result is already calculated.

2. **Character Array:** The array `ch` is of size `1 << 8`, however, only three elements are used. This can be optimized by using a map or a smaller array. But, accessing elements in an array is faster than in a map. So, we will keep this as it is.

3. **Compiler Optimization:** By using `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flags, the compiler will take care of optimizing the program further. This includes inlining functions, loop unrolling, etc.

### Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

unordered_map<string, ll> memo; // For memoization

string S;
int p, ch[1 << 8];

ll bnf();
ll getNum() {
  ll res = 0;
  while (isdigit(S[p]))
    res = res * 10 + S[p++] - '0';
  return res;
}
ll get(ll &a, ll b, char c) {
  if (c == '+')
    a += b;
  if (c == '-')
    a -= b;
  if (c == '*')
    a *= b;
  return a;
}
ll calc(int c) {
  ll res, t;
  if (S[p] == '(')
    p++, res = bnf(), p++;
  else
    res = getNum();
  while (p < S.size() && S[p] != ')' && ch[S[p]] > c)
    t = S[p++], get(res, calc(ch[t]), t);
  return res;
}
ll bnf() {
  if(memo.count(S)) return memo[S]; // return if result is already calculated

  ll res = calc(-1), t;
  while (p < S.size() && S[p] != ')')
    t = S[p++], get(res, calc(ch[t]), t);

  return memo[S] = res; // store result in memo
}
int main() {
  cin >> S;
  ll res = bnf();
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
        ch['+'] = i, ch['-'] = j, ch['*'] = k;
        p = 0;
        res = max(res, calc(-100));
      }
  cout << res << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
