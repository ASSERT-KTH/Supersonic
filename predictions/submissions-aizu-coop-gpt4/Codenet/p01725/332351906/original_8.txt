This program attempts to solve a mathematical expression problem. It reads a string as an input that represents a mathematical expression and calculates its value. Additionally, it modifies the precedence of the mathematical operations '+' (addition), '-' (subtraction), and '*' (multiplication) to maximize the resulting value of the expression. The program calculates the expression value for each possible precedence configuration and keeps track of the maximum value obtained.

This is a complex problem, and the code is efficient. However, the following are some areas that could be optimized:

1. **Redundant Computations:** The function `getNum()` is called whenever a numeric value is encountered in the string. This function converts the character representation of the number to an actual numeric value. However, this operation is performed over and over again for the same string with different operator prioritization. It would be much more efficient to convert the numeric strings to actual numbers only once and store them in a separate array. This way, the conversion operation will not be performed repeatedly.

2. **Inefficient Function Calls:** The function `calc()` is recursively called inside itself, which might result in an inefficient use of stack memory. The recursion depth can be reduced by re-implementing these recursive calls in a loop.

3. **Inefficient Data Structure:** The `ch` array is large and inefficient. It is an array with size 2^8, but only three elements are used. A more efficient alternative would be to use a map data structure to store the operation priorities.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** The `inline` keyword can be used to suggest to the compiler that it should attempt to insert the complete body of the function in every place where that function is used in the source code.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

string S;
int p;
map<char, int> ch;
vector<ll> nums;
ll bnf();
ll res;

ll getNum() {
  ll res = 0;
  while (isdigit(S[p])) {
    res = res * 10 + S[p++] - '0';
  }
  nums.push_back(res);
  return nums.back();
}

ll get(ll &a, ll b, char c) {
  if (c == '+') a += b;
  if (c == '-') a -= b;
  if (c == '*') a *= b;
  return a;
}

inline ll calc(int c) {
  ll res, t;
  if (S[p] == '(')
    p++, res = bnf(), p++;
  else
    res = nums[p++];
  while (p < S.size() && S[p] != ')' && ch[S[p]] > c)
    t = S[p++], get(res, calc(ch[t]), t);
  return res;
}

ll bnf() {
  ll res = calc(-1), t;
  while (p < S.size() && S[p] != ')')
    t = S[p++], get(res, calc(ch[t]), t);
  return res;
}

int main() {
  cin >> S;
  ll res = bnf();
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
        ch['+'] = i; ch['-'] = j; ch['*'] = k;
        p = 0;
        res = max(res, calc(-100));
      }
  
  cout << res << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Please be aware that this optimization may increase the complexity of the code and make it harder to understand for some developers. This is a trade-off that must be considered when deciding whether or not to apply these optimizations.
