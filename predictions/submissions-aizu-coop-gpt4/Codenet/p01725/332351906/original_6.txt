1. Code Analysis:
The code is a simple C++ program that reads a string as input and calculates the maximum possible value that can be achieved. It uses recursive calls to parse and evaluate the string as per the given rules. The most noticeable inefficiency is the nested loops at the end of the main function that iterate over all combinations of operator priorities, reset the parsing pointer and re-parse the entire string for each combination. This can be very inefficient if the string is large.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. Remove the redundant computations by calculating the results for all operator priorities in a single pass.
   2. Use a data structure to store intermediate results during each pass.
   3. Use dynamic programming to avoid recomputation.
   4. Use memoization to store the results of previous computations.
   5. Use a more efficient parsing technique to avoid the need to reset the parsing pointer.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Instead of calling the `calc` function repeatedly for each combination of operator priorities, create a 3D array to store the intermediate results for each combination. This can be done by adding an outer loop in the `calc` function that iterates over all combinations of operator priorities.
   2. In each iteration of the outer loop, calculate the result for the current combination of operator priorities and store it in the corresponding cell of the 3D array.
   3. In the `main` function, instead of resetting the parsing pointer and re-parsing the entire string for each combination of operator priorities, simply retrieve the precalculated results from the 3D array.
   4. This approach will significantly reduce the number of recursive calls and the amount of string parsing, leading to a substantial improvement in performance.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
string S;
int p, ch[1 << 8];
ll dp[3][3][3];
ll bnf();
ll getNum() {
  ll res = 0;
  while (isdigit(S[p]))
    res = res * 10 + S[p++] - '0';
  return res;
}
ll get(ll &a, ll b, char c) {
  if (c == '+')
    a += b;
  if (c == '-')
    a -= b;
  if (c == '*')
    a *= b;
  return a;
}
ll calc(int c, int i, int j, int k) {
  ch['+'] = i, ch['-'] = j, ch['*'] = k;
  ll res, t;
  if (S[p] == '(')
    p++, res = bnf(), p++;
  else
    res = getNum();
  while (p < S.size() && S[p] != ')' && ch[S[p]] > c)
    t = S[p++], get(res, calc(ch[t], i, j, k), t);
  return dp[i][j][k] = res;
}
ll bnf() {
  ll res = calc(-1, 0, 0, 0), t;
  while (p < S.size() && S[p] != ')')
    t = S[p++], get(res, calc(ch[t], 0, 0, 0), t);
  return res;
}
int main() {
  cin >> S;
  ll res = bnf();
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k < 3; k++)
        res = max(res, dp[i][j][k]);
  cout << res << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that this code is optimized for performance but it might consume more memory as it stores the intermediate results for each combination of operator priorities.
