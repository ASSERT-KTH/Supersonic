The provided code is quite complex and has a lot of potential optimization points. It is a C++ implementation of a Centroid Path Decomposition algorithm combined with an Ordered Multiset implemented using a Randomized Binary Search Tree (RBST). I will try to propose possible optimizations in a top-down approach:

1. Code Analysis:
   - The program uses a lot of recursive calls which can impact the performance and memory usage.
   - The data structure used for the implementation is RBST, which is not the most efficient one for this particular use case.
   - The xor128() function is used for random number generation but it can be replaced with a more efficient method.
   - The program makes heavy use of vectors which can cause a lot of memory reallocation.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Replace recursive calls with iterative methods where possible.
   - Replace RBST with a more efficient data structure for this use case, such as a Treap or AVL tree.
   - Use a more efficient random number generation method, such as xoroshiro128+.
   - Preallocate memory for vectors where their maximum size is known ahead of time.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   - Recursive to Iterative: Iterative methods are generally faster and more memory-efficient than recursive methods. For example, the BuildSubTreeSize() function can be rewritten using depth-first search without recursion.
   - RBST to AVL Tree: AVL tree ensures a better-balanced tree, which would result in more efficient search, insert, and delete operations.
   - xor128 to xoroshiro128+: The xoroshiro128+ PRNG algorithm is faster and has better statistical properties than xor128.
   - Vector Preallocation: By calling the reserve() function on a vector, we can preallocate memory and avoid costly reallocations.

4. Optimized Code: 
   - Due to the complexity and size of the original code, writing a fully optimized version here would be impractical. However, I will provide an example of how to optimize the BuildSubTreeSize() function.

```
void BuildSubTreeSize() {
  stack<int> s;
  vector<bool> visited(graph.size(), false);
  s.push(0);
  while (!s.empty()) {
    int node = s.top();
    if (!visited[node]) {
      visited[node] = true;
      for (auto &to : graph[node]) {
        if (!visited[to]) {
          s.push(to);
        }
      }
    } else {
      s.pop();
      SubTreeSize[node] = 1;
      for (auto &to : graph[node]) {
        if (to != parent[node]) {
          SubTreeSize[node] += SubTreeSize[to];
          if (NextPath[node] == -1 || SubTreeSize[NextPath[node]] < SubTreeSize[to]) {
            NextPath[node] = to;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
In this optimized function, I replaced the recursive depth-first search with an iterative one using a stack. This should make the function faster and more memory-efficient.
