Looking at the provided code, it demonstrates a rather complex use of multiple data structures and algorithms, which include a Binary Search Tree, Centroid Decomposition, and DFS. Optimizing such code requires careful consideration because the slightest change can lead to unexpected results. 

However, after thorough analysis, some potential areas for optimization and code improvement can be identified:

1. Eliminate the use of #include <bits/stdc++.h>: This header file is quite large and including it can slow down the compilation process. We should only include the libraries that we need.

2. Use of global variables: This code has a lot of global variables. While this is not inherently bad, it's generally a better practice to limit the scope of variables as much as possible to prevent accidental modifications from other parts of the code.

3. Inline functions: The use of inline functions can sometimes improve performance at the cost of larger executable size. However, the use of inline is just a hint to the compiler, and it's up to the compiler whether to actually inline the function or not.

4. Use of vectors: Vectors are used heavily throughout the code. While vectors are great for dynamic array-like data, they may not be the most efficient data structure for certain operations. For example, if we frequently need to insert or remove elements in the middle of the vector, a list or a deque might be a more efficient choice.

5. Use of bitwise operations: Bitwise operations are generally faster than arithmetic operations. However, modern compilers are pretty good at optimizing code, and the difference in speed might not be noticeable in most cases.

6. Avoid unnecessary function calls: For example, the function count(t) is called multiple times within the same scope. It would be more efficient to call it once, store the result in a variable, and then use that variable.

7. Use of recursion: Recursion can lead to a significant performance hit if the recursion depth is large. It can also lead to a stack overflow. For operations that can be done iteratively, it's usually more efficient to use iteration.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Include only the necessary libraries instead of <bits/stdc++.h>.
2. Try to limit the scope of variables, especially if they are not needed globally.
3. Analyze the code thoroughly to see if any inline functions can be removed without a significant performance hit.
4. Consider using other data structures that might be more efficient for certain operations. For example, if we need to frequently insert or remove elements in the middle of a vector, consider using a list or a deque.
5. Make sure to only use bitwise operations when necessary, and understand that the speed gain might not be noticeable in most cases.
6. Try to avoid unnecessary function calls. If a function is called multiple times with the same arguments within the same scope, consider calling it once, storing the result in a variable, and then using that variable.
7. If possible, replace recursion with iteration to avoid the potential performance hit and stack overflow.
