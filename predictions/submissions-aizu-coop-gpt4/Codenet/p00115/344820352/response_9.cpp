Code Analysis:
The code given is a C++ program that reads in the coordinates for two points (S and G), as well as three points defining a triangle (tri[0], tri[1], tri[2]). It then checks if a line segment between points S and G intersects with the plane defined by the triangle. If the segment intersects the plane, it further checks if the intersection point lies within the triangle. Based on these checks, it prints "HIT" or "MISS".

The code seems to be well-written and doesn't have any apparent performance bottlenecks. However, there are still some areas where the code's performance and readability can be improved.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoiding Global Definitions: Using macros and global definitions can lead to hard-to-trace bugs and code that is difficult to read. Instead of using macros to define constants, we can use the 'const' keyword within the code where necessary. Also, the 'using namespace std;' statement can cause name clashes. It's better to specify the namespace for each std function or object used.

2. Efficient Use of Functions: Currently, the 'equals' function is used to compare floating-point values. This function uses an absolute difference method, which is not always the most efficient or accurate. We can replace this with std::abs and std::numeric_limits::epsilon() for a more efficient comparison. 

3. Redundant Computations: In the existing code, the expression to calculate the cross product of two vectors is repeated multiple times. To avoid the redundancy, we can create a separate function for it.

4. Avoiding Complex Data Types: The code uses complex data types (like std::vector) for simple tasks. This can be replaced with simpler data types to reduce the overhead of the std::vector class.

5. Compiler Optimizations: We can use the -O2 or -O3 optimization flags when compiling the code to apply various compiler-level optimizations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Avoid Global Definitions: We will replace the macros with constant variables defined within the main function. We will also specify the namespace for each std function or object used.

2. Efficient Use of Functions: We will replace the 'equals' function with std::abs and std::numeric_limits::epsilon(). This will be done wherever the 'equals' function is currently being used.

3. Redundant Computations: We will create a separate function to calculate the cross product of two vectors. This function will be used wherever the cross product is currently being calculated.

4. Avoiding Complex Data Types: We will replace the use of std::vector with simpler data types, like arrays or simple variables.

5. Compiler Optimizations: We will use the -O2 or -O3 optimization flags when compiling the code.
