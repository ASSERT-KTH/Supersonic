The given code handles 3D geometrical computations, specifically focusing on points, vectors, segments, and planes. The code is well-structured with functions and classes that are dedicated to handling specific operations. However, there are a few areas that can be optimized for better performance.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Efficient Data Structures: The current data structures are sufficient and efficient for the tasks they are performing. Therefore, no significant changes are needed in this area.
2. Redundant Computations: There are some computations that can be optimized or reduced in this code. For instance, the `equals` function is used frequently to compare double values. The `EPS` (epsilon) value is used to determine if the two values are close enough to be considered equal. This frequent use of floating-point comparison can lead to performance issues and can be optimized.
3. Loop Optimizations: There is no significant loop in the code that needs optimization.
4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations can be implemented using compiler flags at the time of compilation. However, this is outside the scope of code optimization, and thus will not be discussed here.

Detailed Explanation:

1. Reducing Floating Point Comparison: The `equals` function is used numerous times in the code. Frequent floating point comparison can lead to performance issues. A better alternative can be to use the `std::abs` function from the standard library, which can handle floating-point comparison more efficiently. This change can potentially improve the performance of the code.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define REP(i, s, n) for (int i = s; i < n; i++)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define IINF (INT_MAX)
#define EPS (1e-7)
#define equals(a, b) (std::abs((a) - (b)) < EPS)
using namespace std;

// The rest of the code remains the same.
```
The code remains largely the same, with the exception of the updated `equals` macro. The new macro now uses `std::abs` instead of `fabs`, which can handle floating-point comparison more efficiently. This change can potentially improve the performance of the code. Note that the use of `std::abs` is generally considered more idiomatic in C++, although the performance difference may be negligible in most cases. If the performance gain is not significant, it may be more beneficial to prioritize code readability and maintainability over this kind of micro-optimization.

Please note that using the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header is not a good practice as it includes a plethora of unnecessary headers, which can increase compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary headers. The use of macros for functions (like `equals`) is also generally discouraged in C++ in favor of inline functions, for reasons of type safety and debugging convenience.
