Code Analysis:
The given C++ program is a geometric calculation program. It calculates and performs various operations on 3D points, vectors, segments, and planes such as addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product, distance calculation, intersection checking, and crosspoint calculation. The main function reads input from the console for points S, G, and a triangle's vertices. It then checks if a segment between points S and G intersects with the plane formed by the triangle. If the intersecting point is on the triangle, it outputs "MISS", otherwise, it outputs "HIT". 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Unnecessary Computations: There are a couple of places where the code performs unnecessary computations. Here are a couple of examples:
    1. In the `point_on_the_triangle3d` function, the same calculations like `tri2 - tri1` are performed multiple times. We can calculate these once and reuse the results.
    2. In the `Plane3d::intersectS` and `Plane3d::crosspointS` functions, the point `a` is calculated multiple times with the same values. We can calculate this once and reuse it.
2. Data Structures: The data structures used in the code are suitable for the task and don't require any changes.
3. Loop Optimizations: There are no significant loops in this code that could benefit from loop unrolling or other loop optimizations.
4. Compiler Optimizations: The compiler should already be optimizing the code as much as possible, and there are no particular sections that we could hint at for further optimizations with pragma directives.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Store the results of repeated computations in variables for reuse. This reduces the number of computations the program needs to perform.
    1. In the `point_on_the_triangle3d` function, calculate `v1`, `v2`, `v3`, and the cross products once and reuse them.
    2. In the `Plane3d::intersectS` and `Plane3d::crosspointS` functions, calculate `a` once and reuse it.
2. These changes will reduce the number of computations the program needs to perform, increasing its efficiency. The trade-off is a slight increase in memory usage to store the intermediate results.

Optimized Code Block:

```c++
bool point_on_the_triangle3d(Point3d tri1, Point3d tri2, Point3d tri3, Point3d p) {
  Vector3d v1 = tri2 - tri1;
  Vector3d v2 = tri3 - tri2;
  Vector3d v3 = tri1 - tri3;
  Vector3d cp[3] = {cross(v1, p - tri1), cross(v2, p - tri2),cross(v3, p - tri3)};
  double d1 = dot(cp[0], cp[1]);
  double d2 = dot(cp[0], cp[2]);
  if ((!equals(d1, 0.0) && d1 > 0) && (!equals(d2, 0.0) && d2 > 0))
    return true;
  return false;
}

bool Plane3d::intersectS(Segment3d seg) {
  Point3d a = normal_vector * d;
  double res1 = dot(a - seg.p[0], normal_vector);
  double res2 = dot(a - seg.p[1], normal_vector);
  if (res1 > res2)
    swap(res1, res2);
  if ((equals(res1, 0.0) || res1 < 0) && (equals(res2, 0.0) || res2 > 0))
    return true;
  return false;
}

Point3d Plane3d::crosspointS(Segment3d seg) {
  Point3d a = normal_vector * d;
  double dot_p0a = fabs(dot(seg.p[0] - a, normal_vector));
  double dot_p1a = fabs(dot(seg.p[1] - a, normal_vector));
  if (equals(dot_p0a + dot_p1a, 0))
    return seg.p[0];
  return seg.p[0] + (seg.p[1] - seg.p[0]) * (dot_p0a / (dot_p0a + dot_p1a));
}
```
The rest of the code remains the same as it does not require any performance optimizations.
