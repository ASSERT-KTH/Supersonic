Code Analysis:

The program is reading from the standard input two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the number of strings and the number of searches, respectively. The strings are stored in an array `b` and their corresponding integer values in `o`. The program then performs `m` searches, comparing each string `l` with all strings in `b`, and if a match is found, it adds the corresponding integer from `o` to `ans`.

There are potential performance bottlenecks in this program:

1. The use of a nested loop to perform string comparison contributes to high time complexity, especially when the number of strings or searches increases.
2. The use of two separate arrays for storing the strings and their corresponding integer values could lead to inefficient memory usage and may also affect cache performance.
3. The use of string comparison is not as efficient as integer or pointer comparison. Since the program only checks for matches and does not perform any manipulation on the strings, it would be more efficient to use hashed values instead of the actual string values.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a hash table (for example, `std::unordered_map` in C++) instead of an array to store the strings and their corresponding integer values. This will not only improve memory usage but will also reduce search time from O(n) to O(1).
2. Instead of performing string comparison, compute a hash value for each string and use it as the key in the hash table. This will make comparison faster as it will involve comparing integers instead of strings.
3. Eliminate the nested loop used for string comparison. With the use of a hash table, we can find the corresponding integer value for a string in constant time.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Compute a hash value for each string: This can be done using a simple hash function that computes a unique integer value for each string. This step will convert the string comparison to integer comparison, thus reducing computation time.
2. Store the strings and their corresponding integer values in a hash table: Instead of using two separate arrays, use a hash table where the hash value of the string is the key and the corresponding integer value is the value. This will improve memory usage and also reduce the search time from O(n) to O(1).
3. Eliminate the nested loop: With the use of a hash table, we don't need to iterate over the entire array to find a match. We can directly use the hash value of the string to find the corresponding integer value in the hash table.

Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

// Simple hash function for strings
size_t hash_string(const string& s) {
  size_t h = 0;
  for (char c : s) h = h * 31 + c;
  return h;
}

int main() {
  int n, m, value;
  string key;
  size_t hash_key;
  int ans;

  for (;;) {
    cin >> n >> m;
    if (!n && !m) break;
    ans = 0;

    // Use a hash table to store the strings and their corresponding integer values
    unordered_map<size_t, int> dict;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> key >> value;
      hash_key = hash_string(key);
      dict[hash_key] = value;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      cin >> key;
      hash_key = hash_string(key);

      // Use the hash value of the string to find the corresponding integer value
      if (dict.find(hash_key) != dict.end()) {
        ans += dict[hash_key];
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
