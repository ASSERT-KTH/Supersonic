## Code Analysis

This C++ program reads a series of pairs of integers (n, m) until it encounters a pair of zeros. For each pair (n, m), it then reads n pairs of a string and an integer, and m strings. For each of the m strings, it checks if it matches any of the n strings by comparing each character in the strings. If there is a match, it adds the corresponding integer to the answer. This answer is printed out at the end of each (n, m) pair.

## Optimization Strategy

1. **Data Structures**: The code uses arrays for storing strings and integers. This is not necessarily inefficient, but there are alternatives that could be more efficient for this specific task. For instance, a hash table or an unordered_map could be used to store the pair of a string and an integer. This could speed up the search for the strings from O(n) to O(1).

2. **Redundant Computations**: The innermost loop that checks for string equality could be replaced with the string comparison operator ==. This would not only simplify the code, but might also be faster because the standard library's implementation of string comparison can take advantage of specific hardware instructions.

3. **Loop Optimization**: The nested loop that searches the string in the array of strings can be replaced by a hash table lookup. This would replace a linear search by a constant time operation.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: Compiler optimizations can be enabled via compiler flags such as -O2 or -O3 for GCC and Clang, or /O2 for MSVC. These enable a variety of optimizations such as loop unrolling and function inlining, among others.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Data Structures**: Replace the arrays of strings and integers with an unordered_map. This data structure uses hashing to achieve constant time lookup, which can significantly speed up the program if n is large. The keys will be the strings and the values will be the integers. This change retains the functionality of the original code, but it may increase memory usage slightly because hash tables require additional memory for storing the hash values and handling collisions.

2. **Redundant Computations**: Replace the innermost loop with the == operator for string comparison. This simplifies the code and could be faster because the standard library's implementation can use hardware instructions for string comparison. This change does not affect the functionality or memory usage of the program.

3. **Loop Optimization**: Replace the nested loop that searches for the strings with a lookup in the hash table. This simplifies the code and speeds up the program by replacing a linear time operation with a constant time operation. This change retains the functionality of the original code and does not significantly affect memory usage.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: Enable compiler optimizations via compiler flags. This can speed up the program without changing the code or affecting its functionality or memory usage.

## Optimized Code Block

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  unordered_map<string, int> stringToInt;
  string l;
  int ans;

  while (true) {
    cin >> n >> m;
    if (!n && !m)
      break;

    stringToInt.clear();
    ans = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> l;
      cin >> stringToInt[l];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      cin >> l;
      ans += stringToInt[l];
    }

    cout << ans << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The changes made are:

1. Included the unordered_map header.
2. Replaced the arrays b and o with an unordered_map stringToInt.
3. Added a call to clear the hash table at the start of each (n, m) pair.
4. Modified the loop that reads the n pairs to store them in the hash table.
5. Modified the loop that processes the m strings to use a lookup in the hash table.
