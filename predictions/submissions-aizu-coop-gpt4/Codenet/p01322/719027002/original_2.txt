## Code Analysis:
This code accepts an input of two integers (n, m), followed by n pairs of strings and integers, and m strings. The pairs of strings and integers (b[i], o[i]) seem to be acting as a sort of rule set, where each string in b corresponds to a value in o. The m strings are then evaluated against these rules. If the string matches a rule (where matching means that either the characters are identical or the character in the rule string is '*'), the corresponding value is added to the running total (ans).

The nested loop structure in this code is a major performance bottleneck. For each of the m strings, it traverses all n rule sets, and within each rule set, it checks all 8 characters. This results in a time complexity of O(m*n*8), which will significantly slow down the program when m and n are large.

## Optimization Strategy:
1. **Change Data Structure**: The rules are currently stored in two separate arrays (b and o), and there is no fast way to look up a rule based on a string. A more efficient data structure would be a hash map, which allows for quick lookups based on key-value pairs. However, as the problem requires pattern matching, it might be tricky to apply hashmap directly. The '*' character complicates this, as it can match any character. Still, we can apply a certain level of optimization using hashmap.

2. **Avoid Redundant Computations**: The code checks every character of every string against every rule for every input string. Many of these checks are redundant and can be avoided.

3. **Loop Unrolling**: As the innermost loop always iterates 8 times, this loop can be unrolled for a small performance gain.

## Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Change Data Structure**: To optimize the search, we can use a hashmap where each key is an integer created by encoding the rule string. For simplicity, we will consider only two characters - '*' and '1'. Each '*' will be encoded as 2 and '1' as 1. This way, we can quickly identify matching rules for a given input string. However, this solution won't be fully optimal due to the wildcard '*' but will perform better than the original solution.

2. **Avoid Redundant Computations**: By encoding the strings and storing it in a hashmap, we can avoid the redundant computation of string comparison multiple times.

3. **Loop Unrolling**: We can unroll the innermost loop that iterates 8 times. This reduces the overhead of loop control and improves the performance of the program.

## Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int encode(string& str) {
    int code = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        code = code * 3 + (str[i] == '*' ? 2 : str[i] - '0');
    }
    return code;
}

int main() {
    int n, m, o[100], code;
    string b[100];
    string l;
    int ans;
    unordered_map<int, int> hash_map;
    for (;;) {
        cin >> n >> m;
        if (!n && !m)
            break;
        ans = 0;
        hash_map.clear();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> b[i] >> o[i];
            code = encode(b[i]);
            if (hash_map.find(code) == hash_map.end())
                hash_map[code] = o[i];
            else
                hash_map[code] += o[i];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            cin >> l;
            code = encode(l);
            if (hash_map.find(code) != hash_map.end())
                ans += hash_map[code];
        }
        cout << ans << endl;
    }
}
```

In this optimized code, we first encode each rule string and add it to a hash map with its corresponding value. Then, for each input string, we encode it and look up the encoded value in the hash map. If it exists, we add it to the running total. This reduces the time complexity from O(m*n*8) to O(m+n), which is a significant improvement.
