After analyzing the provided code, there are a few areas that can be optimized:

1. Searching for a match: Currently, for each input string `l`, the program searches the entire `b` array for a match. This is an O(n) operation that can be optimized by using a more efficient data structure for storing the b strings and o values.

2. Comparing strings: To compare the input string `l` with the stored strings, the program checks each character one-by-one. This operation can be optimized by using built-in string comparison functions.

3. Memory usage: The program uses two arrays, `b` and `o`, to store the strings and their corresponding values. This can be optimized by using a single data structure that can store both strings and their values.

## Optimization Plan:

1. Use `std::map` or `std::unordered_map` instead of arrays: These data structures are designed for efficient search operations. Furthermore, they can store both the string and its corresponding value, reducing the memory footprint.

2. Use `std::string::compare` instead of manual comparison: This built-in function can compare two strings more efficiently than a manual loop.

3. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`: These lines can significantly speed up C++ IO operations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, m, ans;
  unordered_map<string, int> map;
  string l;

  while(cin >> n >> m && (n || m)) {
    ans = 0;
    map.clear();

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> l;
      for (auto &c : l) if (c == '*') c = '?';
      cin >> map[l];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      cin >> l;
      ans += map[l];
    }

    cout << ans << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code has the following trade-offs:

1. It uses more complex data structures (`std::unordered_map`) and functions (`std::ios::sync_with_stdio`, `cin.tie`). This increases code complexity but provides substantial performance gains.

2. It uses an unordered_map, which can have slower worst-case performance than a sorted map or array. However, in practice, it is often faster due to its O(1) average-case lookup time.

3. It modifies the input strings to match the format in which they are stored in the map. This approach could potentially lead to issues if the original input strings are needed later in the code. However, in this case, the original strings are not needed after they are processed, so it is a safe optimization.
