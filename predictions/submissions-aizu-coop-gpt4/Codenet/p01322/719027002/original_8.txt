Code Analysis:

This program reads two integers n and m. If both n and m are zero, it breaks the loop and ends the program. Otherwise, it reads n pairs of string and integer. Then it reads m strings and tries to match each string with the n strings read before. If a match is found, it adds the corresponding integer to the answer. If not, it continues to the next string.

1. The strings are compared character by character. This is inefficient, especially when n and m are large.

2. The program uses an array to store the strings and their corresponding values. This is inefficient, especially when n is large.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a data structure that allows faster search, such as a hash map. Instead of storing the strings and their corresponding values in an array, store them in a hash map. This reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(1).

2. Use the string comparison function provided by the standard library, instead of comparing the strings character by character.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  unordered_map<string, int> score_map;
  string l;
  int ans;
  while (true) {
    cin >> n >> m;
    if (n == 0 && m == 0)
      break;
    ans = 0;
    score_map.clear();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> l;
      int o;
      cin >> o;
      score_map[l] = o;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      cin >> l;
      auto it = score_map.find(l);
      if (it != score_map.end()) {
        ans += it->second;
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The unordered_map "score_map" is used to store the strings and their corresponding values. This allows a faster search for the strings, reducing the time complexity from O(n) to O(1).

2. The function "score_map.find(l)" is used to search for the string "l" in the hash map. If the string is found, the corresponding value is added to the answer. If not, it continues to the next string.

Trade-offs:

1. Using a hash map increases the space complexity of the program. However, it significantly improves the time complexity.

2. The optimized code is slightly more complex than the original code. However, it is more efficient and scalable.
