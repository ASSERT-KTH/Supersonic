## Code Analysis
The provided code reads the height and width of a rectangle from the input and prints a rectangle with "#" for the border and "." for the inner part. The process continues until the input is 0 for both height and width.

The performance bottlenecks in the code are:
1. The use of `cin` and `cout` for input and output. These operations are slower compared to `scanf` and `printf`.
2. Nested loops for printing the rectangle. This approach has a time complexity of O(n*m) where n and m are the height and width of the rectangle respectively.
3. The use of if-else conditions inside the inner loop.

## Optimization Strategy
1. Replace `cin` and `cout` with faster `scanf` and `printf`.
2. Precompute the strings for each row to reduce the time complexity of the drawing process.
3. Eliminate the if-else conditions inside the inner loop.

## Step-by-Step Explanation
1. `cin` and `cout` are slower compared to `scanf` and `printf`. The reason is that `cin` and `cout` have to maintain compatibility with C++ streams which incurs some overhead. In contrast, `scanf` and `printf` are C functions and do not have this overhead.
2. Instead of computing the character for each cell in the rectangle, we can precompute the strings for the first row, middle rows, and last row. This way, we only need to print each row string H times. This reduces the time complexity from O(n*m) to O(n).
3. By precomputing the row strings, we can eliminate the if-else conditions inside the inner loops. This can lead to a significant speedup because branching can be expensive in terms of CPU cycles, especially when the prediction of the branch direction is wrong.

## Optimized Code Block
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int H, W;
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %d", &H, &W);
    if (H == 0 && W == 0)
      break;
    string first_and_last_row = string(W, '#');
    string middle_row = "#" + string(W-2, '.') + "#";
    for (int i = 1; i <= H; i++) {
      if (i == 1 || i == H) {
        printf("%s\n", first_and_last_row.c_str());
      } else {
        printf("%s\n", middle_row.c_str());
      }
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
}
```
In this optimized code, we do not perform any calculations inside the loops, and the loops only perform the minimal task of printing the strings. This makes the code more efficient and faster.
