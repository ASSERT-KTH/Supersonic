**Code Analysis**

This code takes in two integers H and W from the user in a loop until both are zero. It then prints a rectangle of '#' characters of height H and width W, where the interior of the rectangle is filled with '.' characters.

**Optimization Strategy**
1. **I/O Stream Optimization:** The use of cin and cout can be slow in comparison to scanf and printf. Also, the use of '\n' is faster than endl as endl causes a flush operation which can slow down the program. This optimization can help speed up the input and output operations.
2. **String Concatenation:** Instead of printing out each '#' or '.' character one by one, we can store the entire row in a string and print out the string once. This reduces the number of calls to cout, and thus can make the program faster. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation**
1. **I/O Stream Optimization:** Replace all instances of cin with scanf and all instances of cout with printf. Replace all instances of endl with '\n'.
2. **String Concatenation:** Instead of using cout to print each character, we will concatenate all characters in a row into a string and print the string all at once. We will use the string class for this. 

**Trade-offs**
The optimization doesn't increase code complexity, but it does add several lines of code due to the need for string concatenation.

**Optimized Code Block**
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int H, W;
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %d", &H, &W);
    if (H == 0 && W == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 1; i <= H; i++) {
      string row = "";
      for (int j = 1; j <= W; j++) {
        if (i == 1 || i == H) {
          row += "#";
        } else {
          if (j == 1 || j == W) {
            row += "#";
          } else {
            row += ".";
          }
        }
      }
      printf("%s\n", row.c_str());
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
}
