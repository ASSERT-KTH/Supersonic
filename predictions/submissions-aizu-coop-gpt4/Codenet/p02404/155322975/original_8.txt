The given code is a simple program to print a rectangle of '#' characters of size HxW, with '.' filling the inside. The main performance bottlenecks in the code are I/O operations (cin and cout) inside the nested loop. I/O operations are usually costly in terms of execution time. Here are the steps to optimize this code:

1. **Optimization Strategy:**

    1. Use faster I/O operations: Replace cin and cout with scanf and printf.
    2. Minimize I/O operations: Rather than printing each character separately, prepare the whole line in a string and then print it.
    3. Avoid unnecessary computations: If the rectangle dimensions are the same as the previous iteration, we don't need to compute the rectangle again. We can save the rectangle from the previous iteration and directly print it if the dimensions are the same.

2. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

    1. **Faster I/O Operations:** 
        The standard C++ I/O operations (cin and cout) are slower than the C I/O operations (scanf and printf) because cin and cout have to maintain compatibility with C++ stream I/O, which requires additional overhead.
    2. **Minimize I/O operations:**
        By preparing the whole line in a string before printing it, we are essentially buffering the output, which allows us to print the line in one go, rather than character by character. This significantly reduces the number of I/O operations and thus, improves the performance.
    3. **Avoid Unnecessary Computations:**
        If the rectangle dimensions are the same as the previous iteration, we don't need to compute the rectangle again. We can save the rectangle from the previous iteration in a string and directly print it if the dimensions are the same. This saves us from the costly computation of generating the rectangle every time.

3. **Trade-offs:**
    These optimizations make the code a bit more complex and harder to read, but they significantly improve the performance. Also, we are now using extra memory to store the rectangle string, but this is a reasonable trade-off for the gained performance.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int H, W, prevH = 0, prevW = 0;
  string rectangle;
  
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %d", &H, &W);
    if (H == 0 && W == 0)
      break;
      
    if (H != prevH || W != prevW) {  // Only generate the rectangle if dimensions have changed
      rectangle = "";  // Reset rectangle string
      for (int i = 1; i <= H; i++) {
        string line = "";
        for (int j = 1; j <= W; j++) {
          if (i == 1 || i == H || j == 1 || j == W) {
            line += "#";
          } else {
            line += ".";
          }
        }
        rectangle += line + "\n";  // Add line to rectangle string
      }
      prevH = H;  // Update previous dimensions
      prevW = W;
    }
    
    printf("%s\n", rectangle.c_str());
  }
}
```

This optimized code retains the functionality of the original code while improving its performance.
