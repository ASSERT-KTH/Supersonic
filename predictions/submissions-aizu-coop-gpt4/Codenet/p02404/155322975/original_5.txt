The given program reads two integers H and W from the standard input. If either H or W is zero, the program terminates. Otherwise, it prints an HxW grid where the border cells contain the '#' character and the inner cells contain the '.' character. Each grid is followed by a blank line.

Here are the potential performance issues and their solutions:

1. Unnecessary use of std::endl: This not only outputs a newline character but also flushes the output stream. This is usually not necessary and can slow down the output significantly, especially inside loops.

2. Use of C++ I/O streams: The C++ I/O streams (cin, cout) are slower compared to C-style I/O functions (scanf, printf).

3. Redundant checks in loops: The program checks whether the row or column is at the border for each cell in the grid. This is inefficient.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Replace std::endl with '\n': This avoids unnecessary flushes of the output stream.

2. Use scanf and printf instead of cin and cout: This can improve I/O speed.

3. Optimize border checks: Compute the string for the first/last row and the middle rows once, then print the first row, H-2 middle rows, and the last row.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <string>

int main() {
  int H, W;
  
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %d", &H, &W);
    if (H == 0 && W == 0) {
      break;
    }

    // Compute the border and middle strings once
    std::string border(W, '#');
    std::string middle = "#" + std::string(W-2, '.') + "#";

    // Print the first row
    printf("%s\n", border.c_str());

    // Print the H-2 middle rows
    for (int i = 1; i < H-1; i++) {
      printf("%s\n", middle.c_str());
    }

    // Print the last row
    if (H > 1) {
      printf("%s\n", border.c_str());
    }

    printf("\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program does the same as the original program but in a more efficient way. The trade-off is a slightly more complicated code due to pre-computation of the border and middle strings. This is a reasonable trade-off given the significant performance improvement.
