Code Analysis:

The given C++ program is essentially taking two inputs, H and W, from the user in a loop. It then prints a pattern of "#" and "." based on the values of H and W. The "#" is printed on the corners and the rest of the area is filled with ".". The program breaks when both H and W are zero. The code seems to be working fine but there are a couple of things that can be optimized to improve its performance.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Unnecessary I/O operations: The code currently outputs each character individually, which can be quite expensive in terms of I/O operations. We can reduce these operations by constructing each line as a string and then outputting it all at once.

2. Inner conditional checks: The code checks whether i is 1 or H for each iteration of the inner loop. This is unnecessary as the value of i doesn't change within the inner loop. We can perform this check once per outer loop iteration, and then use a simpler condition within the inner loop.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Reduce I/O operations: Instead of performing multiple cout operations within the loop, we can create a string for each line, appending the appropriate character to it based on the conditions. Then, we output the entire line at once using a single cout operation. This reduces the number of I/O operations, which can significantly improve performance.

2. Optimize inner conditional checks: We can move the condition i == 1 || i == H outside of the inner loop. For each row, if i is 1 or H, we print a line of '#', otherwise we print '#' followed by '.' and then again '#' for each line. This reduces the number of conditional checks, which can also improve performance.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int H, W;
  while (1) {
    cin >> H >> W;
    if (H == 0 && W == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 1; i <= H; i++) {
      string line;
      if (i == 1 || i == H) {
        line = string(W, '#');
      } else {
        line += "#";
        line += string(W-2, '.');
        line += "#";
      }
      cout << line << endl;
    }
    cout << endl;
  }
}
```

This optimized code has the same functionality as the original one but it is more efficient in terms of I/O operations and conditional checks. Note that this optimization might slightly increase memory usage due to the creation of the 'line' string. However, the increase is negligible compared to the performance improvement.
