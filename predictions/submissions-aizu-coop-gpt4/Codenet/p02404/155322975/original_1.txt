Code Analysis:
The code is a simple C++ program that reads two integers H and W from the standard input. If both H and W are zero, the program stops. Otherwise, it prints a rectangle of size HxW on the screen. The rectangle is filled with dots, and the border is made of the '#' character.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks and Inefficient Memory Usage:
1. Nested for loops: The nested for loops control the output of the rectangle, this can be a performance bottleneck especially for large H and W values.
2. Frequent usage of std::cout: The std::cout function is used multiple times within the loop, which can significantly slow the program down because each call to cout results in a system call.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Reduce the number of calls to std::cout: Instead of printing each character one by one, we can construct each line as a string and print the whole line at once.
2. Use fast I/O operations: The cin and cout operations are slower compared to scanf and printf. We can use the latter for faster I/O operations. Although, this might make the code a bit less readable.

Optimized Code Block:
Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int H, W;
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %d", &H, &W);
    if (H == 0 && W == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 1; i <= H; i++) {
      string line = "";
      for (int j = 1; j <= W; j++) {
        if (i == 1 || i == H) {
          line += "#";
        } else {
          if (j == 1 || j == W) {
            line += "#";
          } else {
            line += ".";
          }
        }
      }
      printf("%s\n", line.c_str());
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
}
```
In the optimized code, I replaced cin and cout with scanf and printf for faster I/O operations. The nested for loops are still there because they are necessary for the desired output, but inside the loops I am building the string for each line and printing it once, instead of making multiple calls to std::cout. This should improve the performance of the program.
