Code Analysis:
The provided code is a simple C++ program that, for each pair of integers (H, W), prints a HxW grid of characters where the border is made up of "#" characters and the internal area is made up of "." characters. The code stops execution when it encounters a pair (0, 0). 

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. The current implementation reads from the standard input and writes to standard output for each "#" or "." character. These operations are quite expensive in terms of time complexity.
2. Nested loops are used to generate the grid, which results in a time complexity of O(H*W).

Optimization Strategy:
1. We can reduce the number of I/O operations by constructing each row in a string and then printing the string only once per row.
2. The internal area of the grid, which is made up of "." characters, can be filled in a single operation by using the string constructor that fills the string with a certain number of instances of a character.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int H, W;
    while (1) {
        cin >> H >> W;
        if (H == 0 && W == 0)
            break;

        string border(W, '#');
        string inner = "#" + string(W - 2, '.') + "#";

        cout << border << endl;
        for (int i = 2; i < H; i++)
            cout << inner << endl;
        if (H > 1)
            cout << border << endl;
        
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```

Explanation of Optimizations:
1. The border and inner strings are created only once per input pair (H, W), reducing the number of I/O operations and improving the runtime.
2. The inner string is created using the string constructor that fills the string with a certain number of instances of a character. This is faster than the previous method of appending one character at a time.
3. The check "if (H > 1)" is added to avoid printing the bottom border in case where height is 1. This preserves the output of the original code.
   
Potential Trade-offs:
1. The complexity of the code has slightly increased due to the usage of string constructor and additional if condition. However, this is outweighed by the advantages of improved performance.
