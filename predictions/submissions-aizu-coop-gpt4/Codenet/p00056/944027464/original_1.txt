This C++ program calculates the Goldbach Conjecture, which states that every even integer greater than 2 can be represented as the sum of two prime numbers. The program takes an integer value as input and counts how many pairs of primes sum to that value. 

1. Code Analysis: 

The code first generates a list of prime numbers up to a limit (51000) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. However, the algorithm doesn't handle even numbers efficiently. It also uses a vector of boolean values to track if a number is prime, which can be memory-inefficient. Moreover, the code performs unnecessary computations.

2. Optimization Strategy:

   A. Inefficient data structures: 
      - The std::vector<bool> is inefficient because it's a specialization of std::vector that tries to save space by storing bools in individual bits. However, this can lead to slower access times. We can use a std::vector<char> instead.
   
   B. Redundant computations:
      - The outer loop of the Sieve algorithm checks all odd numbers up to 51000, but it would be more efficient to only check up to the square root of the limit, because any composite number will have a factor less than or equal to its square root.
      - The prime-checking loop in the main function checks all prime numbers up to n/2, but it would be more efficient to only check up to n/2 - 2, because the smallest prime number is 2.
      
   C. Loops optimization:
      - The second inner loop, which marks multiples of primes as composite, can start from i*i instead of 2*i. This is because all smaller numbers i*n (for n<i) would have already been marked by previous primes.
      
   D. Compiler optimizations:
      - We can use the -O3 optimization flag for the GCC or Clang compiler, which enables all -O2 optimizations and more. This could potentially lead to significant performance improvements.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    1. Replace std::vector<bool> with std::vector<char>. This change will make access to individual elements faster, improving the overall runtime of the program.
    2. Modify the outer loop of the Sieve algorithm to only iterate up to the square root of the limit. This reduces the number of iterations and therefore the running time.
    3. Adjust the prime-checking loop in the main function to only check primes up to n/2 - 2. This reduces unnecessary computations.
    4. Change the start of the inner loop in the Sieve algorithm to i*i. This avoids marking multiples of primes that have already been marked by previous primes.
    5. Compile the program with the -O3 optimization flag. This instructs the compiler to perform additional optimizations that may improve the program's performance.

Trade-offs: The optimizations proposed focus on improving the runtime efficiency of the program and reducing memory usage. However, they may make the code a bit more complex and difficult to understand for beginners. Using compiler optimization flags can also make the program behave unpredictably in some cases, as the compiler makes assumptions about the code that may not always hold.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int limit = 51000;
  vector<char> isPrime(limit + 1, true);
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  int sqrt_limit = sqrt(limit);
  
  for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt_limit; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= limit; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
  
  vector<int> primes;
  if(limit >= 2) primes.push_back(2);
  for (int i = 3; i <= limit; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
  }

  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < primes.size() && primes[i] <= n / 2; i++) {
      if (isPrime[n - primes[i]])
        kotae++;
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Compile the program with the -O3 optimization flag (gcc -O3 filename.cpp).
