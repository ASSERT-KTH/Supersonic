Here's the analysis of the code:

1. The code uses a Sieve of Eratosthenes to build a list of prime numbers less than 51000. `isPrime` is a boolean vector where `isPrime[i]` is `true` if `i` is a prime number.
2. The code then reads integers `n` from standard input and for each `n`, it counts how many pairs of prime numbers exist such that both primes are less than or equal to `n/2` and their sum equals `n`.

Here are the areas for optimization:

1. Nested loop: The nested loop in the Sieve of Eratosthenes can be optimized. The inner loop can start from `i*i` instead of `i + i`, because any number less than `i*i` and divisible by `i` would have already been marked by a previous prime.

2. Redundant computations: In the last part of the code, we are checking `if (primes[i] <= n / 2)`. Instead of checking this for every element in the loop, we can break the loop as soon as `primes[i] > n / 2` because the vector `primes` is sorted.

3. Unnecessary memory usage: The vector `isPrime` is using bool datatype which is usually 1 byte in size. We can use bitset which uses 1 bit per boolean value which will drastically reduce the memory usage.

4. Compiler optimization: Compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` can be used to enable all optimization flags.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  const int limit = 51000;
  bitset<limit + 1> isPrime;
  isPrime[2] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i <= limit; i += 2) {
    isPrime[i] = true;
  }
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= limit; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= limit; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
  vector<int> primes;
  primes.push_back(2);
  for (int i = 3; i <= limit; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
  }
  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < primes.size() && primes[i] <= n / 2; i++) {
      if (isPrime[n - primes[i]])
        kotae++;
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The trade-offs of these optimizations are:

1. The code might be slightly harder to understand, especially for beginners who are not familiar with the Sieve of Eratosthenes optimization or the use of bitset.
2. Using `-O2` or `-O3` optimization might lead to longer compilation times. However, this is usually negligible compared to the performance gain at runtime.
3. If the prime numbers are needed after the termination of the program, using a bitset could be an issue as it's not easy to serialize and store bitsets for future use. However, in this case, the prime numbers are not used after the program terminates so this is not a problem.
