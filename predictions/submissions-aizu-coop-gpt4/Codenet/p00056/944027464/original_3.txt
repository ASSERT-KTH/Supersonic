Code Analysis:
The given code is generating prime numbers up to 51000 first, and then it's checking for Goldbach's Conjecture for each entered number which is: Every even integer greater than 2 can be represented as the sum of two prime numbers. The performance bottlenecks are as follows:
1. The prime number generation code is not optimized. It is using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, but it's not efficient because it's checking all numbers up to n, but it can be optimized by checking numbers up to sqrt(n).
2. It is using vector<bool> that is a specialization of vector for bool; it's more memory-efficient but slower due to bit manipulation.
3. The code is using push_back() for vector which can cause multiple reallocations as the vector grows.

Optimization Strategy:
1. We will use vector<int> instead of vector<bool> to speed up the program.
2. We will optimize the prime number generation code to check numbers only up to sqrt(n).
3. Instead of using push_back(), we will pre-allocate memory for the primes vector by using the reserve() function.
4. We will use std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0); and cin.tie(0); to speed up cin and cout.
5. We will use the upper_bound() function from the algorithm library to find the number of primes less than n/2, which will reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);

  vector<int> isPrime(51000 + 1, 1);
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = 0;

  for (int i = 2; i * i <= 51000; ++i) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= 51000; j += i)
        isPrime[j] = 0;
    }
  }

  vector<int> primes;
  primes.reserve(51000);
  for (int i = 2; i <= 51000; ++i) {
    if (isPrime[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
  }

  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = upper_bound(primes.begin(), primes.end(), n / 2) - primes.begin();
    for (int i = 0; i < kotae; i++) {
      if (!isPrime[n - primes[i]])
        kotae--;
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Justifications:
1. Checking only till sqrt(n) for prime number generation: Any number n can have at most one prime factor greater than sqrt(n). So we need not check numbers beyond that.
2. Using vector<int> instead of vector<bool>: vector<bool> is not a STL container but a bitset, which means every boolean value does not take a byte but a bit of space. It's slower due to bit manipulation.
3. Using reserve() for vector: This pre-allocates memory for the vector, preventing the overhead of reallocations.
4. Using std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0); and cin.tie(0);: These two lines make input and output more efficient.
5. Using upper_bound(): The code was previously checking all primes up to n / 2, but using upper_bound we can reduce this to log(n).
