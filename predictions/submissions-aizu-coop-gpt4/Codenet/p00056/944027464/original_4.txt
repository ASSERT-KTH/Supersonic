After analyzing the given code, I found several areas that could be optimized:

1. The code creates a vector of boolean values `isPrime` with the size of 51001 and initializes all of its values to `false`. It then sets every odd index to `true`. This operation is redundant and can be avoided.

2. The code uses a nested loop to find prime numbers. This approach is not efficient as it requires a high computation time. A more efficient approach is to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm that avoids unnecessary computations.

3. After generating the list of prime numbers, the code iterates again over the `isPrime` vector to store the prime numbers in a separate vector `primes`. This is unnecessary and can be done in the same loop where the prime numbers are generated.

4. The code uses `vector::at` function to access the elements of the `isPrime` vector. `vector::at` function checks the bounds which causes an extra overhead. We can use `[]` operator instead which does not check the bounds.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  int MAX = 51000;
  vector<bool> isPrime(MAX + 1, true); // Initialize all to true
  vector<int> primes;

  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false; // 0 and 1 are not prime numbers
  primes.push_back(2); // Add 2 to the list of prime numbers

  // Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= MAX; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= MAX; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Add prime numbers to the list
  for (int i = 3; i <= MAX; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
  }

  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < primes.size(); i++) {
      if (primes[i] <= n / 2) {
        if (isPrime[n - primes[i]]) // Use [] instead of at
          kotae++;
      }
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code has the same functionality as the original code but with less computation time and memory usage. The trade-off is the slight increase in code complexity.
