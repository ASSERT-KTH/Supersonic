Code Analysis:

This C++ program is used to find all pairs of prime numbers that add up to a given number. It first generates a list of prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. Then, for each number input, it calculates the number of pairs of prime numbers that add up to the input number.

The code can be optimized in a couple of ways:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses a vector of booleans to mark prime numbers. However, this could be optimized by using a bitset, which uses less memory than a vector of booleans.

2. Redundant Computations: The code checks if a number is prime by iterating through all previous numbers. This process can be optimized by only checking up to the square root of the number.

3. Looping: The code uses nested loops to mark non-prime numbers, which can be computationally expensive. We can optimize this using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm more efficiently.

Optimization Strategy:

1. We can use a `bitset` instead of a `vector<bool>`. A bitset uses less memory as it uses only 1 bit per boolean.

2. We can optimize the prime checking process by only checking up to the square root of the number.

3. We can optimize the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm by marking off multiples of primes starting from the prime's square.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define MAX 51000

bitset<MAX + 1> isPrime;
vector<int> primes;

void generatePrimes() {
  isPrime.set(); // set all bits to 1
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  primes.push_back(2);
  for (int i = 4; i <= MAX; i += 2)
    isPrime[i] = false;
  
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= MAX; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      primes.push_back(i);
      for (int j = i * i; j <= MAX; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
  for(int i = primes.back() + 2; i <= MAX; i += 2) {
    if(isPrime[i]) primes.push_back(i);
  }
}

int main(void) {
  generatePrimes();
  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < primes.size() && primes[i] <= n / 2; i++) {
      if (isPrime[n - primes[i]])
        kotae++;
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version of the code, we have made a few changes:

1. We replaced `vector<bool>` with `bitset`. Bitset is a more memory-efficient data structure.

2. We optimized the prime number generation process. Now we only iterate up to the square root of `MAX` to mark multiples of primes as non-prime. For primes larger than the square root of `MAX`, we just push them into the primes vector if they are prime. This greatly reduces the number of iterations.

3. We moved the prime number generation process to a separate function for better code organization.

4. We added a condition in the loop where we count pairs of primes to break the loop when the current prime number is greater than half of `n`. This reduces unnecessary iterations.
