Code Analysis:
This program seems to be calculating the number of pairs of prime numbers that sum up to a given number `n`. The primes are calculated using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The main potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage include:

1. The usage of `vector<bool>` for `isPrime` which is a bitset container and has slower access times compared to `vector<int>` or `vector<char>`.
2. The nested loop for marking non-prime numbers can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary iterations.
3. The `push_back` method in a loop for storing prime numbers can cause multiple memory reallocations.
4. The `at` method is used to access elements in the `isPrime` vector, which does bounds checking and is slower than the `[]` operator.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace `vector<bool>` with `vector<int>` or `vector<char>` to speed up access times.
2. Start the inner loop in the Sieve algorithm from `i*i` instead of `i+i` because all smaller multiples of `i` would have already been marked.
3. Reserve memory for the `primes` vector in advance to avoid multiple memory reallocations.
4. Use the `[]` operator instead of the `at` method for accessing elements in the `isPrime` vector.
5. Optimize the last loop where we are counting the pairs of primes. We can use two pointers, one from the start and one from the end of the primes array, and move them towards each other until they meet.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  vector<int> isPrime(51000 + 1, false);
  isPrime[2] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i < 51000; i += 2) {
    isPrime[i] = true;
  }
  for (int i = 3; i*i < 51000; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j < 51000; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
  vector<int> primes;
  primes.reserve(51000/2); // Assuming half of the numbers are prime for upper limit
  primes.push_back(2);
  for (int i = 3; i < 51000; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
  }
  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    int i = 0, j = primes.size() - 1;
    while (i <= j) {
      if (primes[i] + primes[j] > n) {
        j--;
      } else if (primes[i] + primes[j] < n) {
        i++;
      } else {
        kotae++;
        i++;
        j--;
      }
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The performance of this code should be significantly better than the original, especially for large inputs.
