The given code block is a C++ program that finds all the prime numbers up to 51000, stores them, and then checks for user input. For each input, it counts the number of ways it can be expressed as a sum of two prime numbers.

Code Analysis:
1. The code uses a boolean vector (isPrime) to mark prime numbers. It initially marks all numbers as non-prime, then marks odd numbers as prime. It then eliminates multiples of the odd numbers, leaving the prime numbers.
2. The prime numbers are then stored in a separate vector (primes).
3. In the final loop, the program takes user inputs and for each, it checks how many ways it can be expressed as a sum of two primes.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm used to find prime numbers is already optimized. However, the memory consumption can be decreased by using a bitset instead of a vector<bool>, as a bitset uses only 1 bit for each boolean value whereas a vector<bool> can consume more than 1 bit per value on some implementations.
2. The second loop where multiples of prime numbers are marked as non-prime can be optimized by starting the inner loop from i*i instead of i+i because all smaller multiples of i would have already been marked non-prime by smaller prime numbers.
3. The storing of prime numbers in a separate vector is unnecessary as the same information is already stored in the isPrime bitset.
4. In the final loop, the search for primes can be stopped as soon as primes[i] > n / 2 because larger values cannot contribute to the sum.
5. Use cin.tie(0) and ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) to speed up cin and cout operations.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  bitset<51000 + 1> isPrime;
  isPrime[2] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i <= 51000; i += 2) {
    isPrime[i] = true;
  }
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= 51000; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= 51000; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n / 2; i++) {
      if (isPrime[i] && isPrime[n - i])
        kotae++;
    }
    cout << kotae << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code reduces memory usage and improves running time by using a bitset, optimizing the sieve algorithm, removing the unnecessary collection of primes, and optimizing the final count.
