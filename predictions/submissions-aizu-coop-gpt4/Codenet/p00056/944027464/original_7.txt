# Code Analysis
The given code is an implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given limit. After generating the prime numbers, the program checks for pairs of primes that add up to a user-provided number. The main inefficiencies in the current implementation are:

1. The algorithm iterates up to the limit for each prime number, which is not necessary. For each prime number, we should only start checking multiples from the square of that prime number.

2. The vector 'isPrime' is of type bool. In C++, a vector<bool> is a special case that is optimized for space and not for speed. It may be slower than other data types.

3. When checking for pairs, the program iterates through all prime numbers, even though we only need to check up to n/2.

# Optimization Strategy
Here is the proposed optimization strategy:
1. Start checking multiples from the square of each prime number.
2. Change the data type of 'isPrime' to vector<int> instead of vector<bool> for efficiency.
3. When checking for pairs, only iterate through prime numbers up to n/2.

# Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Check multiples from square: The inner loop in the Sieve algorithm can start from i*i instead of 2*i. This is because, for a prime number p, all non-prime numbers less than p*p are already marked by previous primes.

2. Use vector<int> instead of vector<bool>: In C++, vector<bool> is a special case where each bool is represented by a single bit instead of a full byte for efficiency. This makes accessing individual elements slower than in a regular vector, as it requires bitwise operations. We can use a vector<int> instead, where 0 represents false and 1 represents true.

3. Limit prime number iteration: When checking for pairs, we can stop when the prime number is greater than n/2. This is because a number cannot be the sum of two numbers where both are greater than half of it.

# Optimized Code Block
Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  vector<int> isPrime(51000 + 1, 0);
  isPrime[2] = 1;
  for (int i = 3; i < 51000; i += 2) {
    isPrime[i] = 1;
  }

  // Start checking multiples from the square of each prime number
  for (int i = 3; i * i < 51000; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j < 51000; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = 0;
      }
    }
  }

  vector<int> primes;
  primes.push_back(2);
  for (int i = 3; i < 51000; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
  }

  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    // Limit prime number iteration
    for (int i = 0; primes[i] <= n / 2; i++) {
      if (isPrime[n - primes[i]])
        kotae++;
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Trade-off: The code is slightly more complex, but the performance improvement makes it worth it. The memory usage is higher because we use int instead of bool, but the difference is negligible for the given problem size.
