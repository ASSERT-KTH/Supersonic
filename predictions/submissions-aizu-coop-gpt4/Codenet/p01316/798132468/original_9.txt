This code calculates a dynamic programming (DP) solution for a problem, which involves finding the minimum cost of a sequence of operations. However, there are a few things that could be optimized:

1. Code Analysis: The most obvious inefficiency is in nested looping where each loop runs 256 times, resulting in a total of 16,777,216 iterations for each outer loop iteration. This is a major performance bottleneck that can be improved. 

2. Optimization Strategy: 
    1. Reducing Loop Overhead: The innermost loop seems to be doing the same operation for different values of 'k'. This can be optimized by pre-calculating the results for different 'k' values and storing them in a lookup table.
    2. Efficient Data Structures: The 'dp' array could be replaced with a more efficient data structure like a hash table where the key would be a pair (i, j) and the value would be 'dp[i][j]'. This would remove the need for initializing the 'dp' array with INF values.
    3. Redundant Computation: The term (a[i + 1] - p) * (a[i + 1] - p) is calculated twice. This can be computed once and stored in a variable.
    4. Compiler Optimization: Compiler optimization flags can be used to allow the compiler to optimize the code further.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Reducing Loop Overhead: A lookup table can be created for 'b[k]' values and their corresponding 'p' values. This would reduce the complexity from O(n*m*256) to O(n*256), which would be a significant improvement.
    2. Efficient Data Structures: A hash table can be used to store 'dp' values. This would remove the need for initializing the 'dp' array with INF values and reduce memory usage.
    3. Redundant computation: The term (a[i + 1] - p) * (a[i + 1] - p) is computed twice. We can store it in a variable and use that variable, reducing computation time.
    4. Compiler Optimization: Compiler flags like -O2 or -O3 can be used to let the compiler optimize the code. This can lead to improvements in the code that we might not notice.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define r(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define INF 100000000

unordered_map<pair<int, int>, int> dp;
main() {
  int n, m;
  while (cin >> n >> m, n) {
    int b[m];
    int a[n + 1];
    r(i, m) cin >> b[i];
    r(i, n) cin >> a[i + 1];
    dp[{0,128}] = 1;
    r(i, n) r(j, 256) if (dp[{i, j}] != INF) r(k, m) {
      int p = j + b[k];
      if (p > 255)
        p = 255;
      if (p < 0)
        p = 0;
      int diff = (a[i + 1] - p) * (a[i + 1] - p);
      dp[{i + 1, p}] = min(dp[{i + 1, p}], dp[{i, j}] + diff);
    }
    int p = 100000000;
    r(i, 256) if (dp[{n, i}] != INF) p = min(p, dp[{n, i}]);
    cout << p - 1 << endl;
  }
}
