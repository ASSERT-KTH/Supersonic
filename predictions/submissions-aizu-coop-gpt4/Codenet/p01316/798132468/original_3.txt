1. Code Analysis:

The code is a C++ program that uses dynamic programming to solve a problem. It reads two integer inputs, `n` and `m`, and then reads `m` integers into an array `b` and `n` integers into an array `a`. It then creates a 2D array `dp` and fills it with a large number defined as `INF`. The dynamic programming matrix is then filled with the minimum value among the existing value and a newly computed value which is a function of the current index and the `b` array. Finally, it finds the minimum value in the last row of the `dp` array.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header with specific headers needed by the program. `bits/stdc++.h` is a convenience header file used in competitive programming that includes all standard C++ header files, which can slow down the compilation process.

B. Avoid using `main()` without a return type. In C++, the main function should always return an integer.

C. Avoid using the `#define` directive to define a loop. It's better to use actual loop constructs for better readability and to avoid potential issues.

D. The `int dp[20001][256];` array is too large to be stored on the stack. It's better to allocate it on the heap.

E. Use `std::vector` instead of C-style arrays for `a` and `b`. `std::vector` is safer and more flexible.

F. The last loop that finds the minimum value in the `dp` array can be optimized using `*min_element` from the STL.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the specific headers needed by the program, such as `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`, and `#include <algorithm>`. This will speed up the compilation process.

B. Specify the return type of `main()` as `int`. This is a convention in C++ programming and not specifying a return type can lead to undefined behavior.

C. Replace the `#define r(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)` with actual loop constructs. This enhances readability and avoids potential macro-related issues.

D. Allocate the `dp` array on the heap using `std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n + 1, std::vector<int>(256, INF));`. This will prevent potential stack overflow errors.

E. Replace C-style arrays `a` and `b` with `std::vector<int> a(n + 1)` and `std::vector<int> b(m)`. This uses safer and more flexible C++ style containers.

F. Use `*min_element(dp[n].begin(), dp[n].end())` to find the minimum value in the last row of the `dp` array. This STL function can find the minimum value in a range in linear time.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int INF = 100000000;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  while (cin >> n >> m, n) {
    vector<int> b(m);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
      cin >> b[i];
      
    vector<int> a(n + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> a[i + 1];

    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(256, INF));
    dp[0][128] = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < 256; j++)
        if (dp[i][j] != INF)
          for (int k = 0; k < m; k++) {
            int p = j + b[k];
            p = min(max(p, 0), 255);
            dp[i + 1][p] = min(dp[i + 1][p], dp[i][j] + (a[i + 1] - p) * (a[i + 1] - p));
          }

    int p = INF;
    p = *min_element(dp[n].begin(), dp[n].end());
    cout << p - 1 << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code preserves the functionality of the original program while improving readability and efficiency.
