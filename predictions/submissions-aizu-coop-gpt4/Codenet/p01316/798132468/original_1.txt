Code Analysis:
The provided code is a dynamic programming (DP) solution for a problem, where the main logic is nested inside three loops. Though the code is correct, it is not efficient due to several bottlenecks:

1. Redundant Computations: The expression `(a[i + 1] - p) * (a[i + 1] - p)` is computed numerous times. This computation can be stored to avoid recalculating it.

2. Inefficient Looping: The third nested loop (loop variable k) is iterating over all elements in the array b, resulting in unnecessary computations.

3. Inefficient Data Structure: The use of a 2D array for DP is leading to higher memory usage.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Reduce Redundant Computations: Store the value of `(a[i + 1] - p) * (a[i + 1] - p)` once calculated and use it in the subsequent calculations.

2. Optimize Looping: Instead of looping over all elements in the array b, compute the minimum and maximum values beforehand, and loop only over this range.

3. Efficient Data Structure: Use a 1D array for DP to reduce memory usage.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. To avoid redundant computations, store the result of `(a[i + 1] - p) * (a[i + 1] - p)` in a variable and use this variable in the DP formula.

2. To optimize the loop over array b, first calculate the minimum and maximum values that can be obtained by adding the elements of b to j. Then, loop only over this range. This reduces the number of iterations in the third loop.

3. To reduce memory usage, use a 1D array for DP instead of a 2D array. The 1D array can be updated for each `i` in the outer loop. This is feasible because for each `i`, we only need the DP values from the previous step, which can be stored in a 1D array.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define r(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define INF 100000000
int dp[256];
main() {
  int n, m;
  while (cin >> n >> m, n) {
    int b[m];
    int a[n + 1];
    r(i, m) cin >> b[i];
    r(i, n) cin >> a[i + 1];
    fill(dp, dp + 256, INF);
    dp[128] = 1;
    r(i, n) {
      int dp_next[256];
      fill(dp_next, dp_next + 256, INF);
      r(j, 256) if (dp[j] != INF) {
        int min_p = max(0, j - b[m - 1]);
        int max_p = min(255, j + b[0]);
        for (int p = min_p; p <= max_p; p++) {
          int diff = (a[i + 1] - p) * (a[i + 1] - p);
          dp_next[p] = min(dp_next[p], dp[j] + diff);
        }
      }
      copy(dp_next, dp_next + 256, dp);
    }
    int p = 100000000;
    r(i, 256) if (dp[i] != INF) p = min(p, dp[i]);
    cout << p - 1 << endl;
  }
}
```
Each optimization step makes the code more efficient by reducing the number of operations performed and the amount of memory used. However, the trade-off is slightly increased code complexity.
