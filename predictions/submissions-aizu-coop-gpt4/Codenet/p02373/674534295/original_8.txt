The existing C++ code is already fairly optimized, but there are still several areas where small improvements can be made. 

1. Code Analysis:
The main performance bottlenecks appear to be the two nested loops within the LowestCommonAncestor constructor and the get method. The constructor contains a nested loop that iterates through all nodes for each round of binary lifting, resulting in a time complexity of O(n log n). The get method also contains a loop that iterates log n times for both u and v, resulting in a time complexity of O(log n). 

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. The parent and depth vectors in the LowestCommonAncestor class can be replaced with static arrays if the maximum possible size is known beforehand. This may improve cache performance and decrease memory usage.
    2. The use of multiple cin and cout operations can slow down input/output operations. These can be replaced with faster alternatives, like scanf and printf.
    3. The use of bitwise operators in the get method may improve performance compared to regular arithmetic operations.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Replacing vectors with static arrays: The parent and depth vectors in the LowestCommonAncestor class can be replaced with static arrays if the maximum possible size is known beforehand. This could improve cache performance and decrease memory usage, but it increases the risk of buffer overflow errors if the maximum size is not estimated correctly. 
    2. Replacing cin and cout with scanf and printf: The cin and cout operations are slower than scanf and printf, especially when they are used in a loop. By replacing them, we can significantly reduce the time spent on input/output operations. However, scanf and printf are less safe and flexible than cin and cout, so care must be taken to avoid errors.
    3. Using bitwise operators: Bitwise operators are faster than regular arithmetic operators, so they can be used to improve performance in the get method. However, they are less readable and more prone to errors, so they should be used carefully.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define rep(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
#define MAXN 100005
#define LOG2N 20
using namespace std;
struct Edge { int s, d; };
using Graph = vector<vector<Edge>>;
int parent[LOG2N][MAXN], depth[MAXN];
void dfs(const Graph &g, int s, int p, int d) {
  parent[0][s] = p;
  depth[s] = d;
  for (auto &e : g[s]) {
    if (e.d == p) continue;
    dfs(g, e.d, s, d + 1);
  }
}
int lca(int u, int v, int log2_n) {
  if (depth[u] > depth[v]) swap(u, v);
  for (int k = 0; k < log2_n; k++) {
    if ((depth[v] - depth[u]) >> k & 1) {
      v = parent[k][v];
    }
  }
  if (u == v) return u;
  for (int k = log2_n - 1; k >= 0; k--) {
    if (parent[k][u] != parent[k][v]) {
      u = parent[k][u];
      v = parent[k][v];
    }
  }
  return parent[0][u];
}
int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  Graph g(n);
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    int k;
    scanf("%d", &k);
    rep(j, 0, k) {
      int c;
      scanf("%d", &c);
      g[i].push_back({i, c});
    }
  }
  int log2_n = log2(n) + 1;
  dfs(g, 0, -1, 0);
  for (int k = 0; k + 1 < log2_n; k++) {
    rep(v, 0, n) {
      if (parent[k][v] < 0) parent[k + 1][v] = -1;
      else parent[k + 1][v] = parent[k][parent[k][v]];
    }
  }
  int q;
  scanf("%d", &q);
  rep(i, 0, q) {
    int u, v;
    scanf("%d%d", &u, &v);
    printf("%d\n", lca(u, v, log2_n));
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the optimized code has a limitation on the maximum number of nodes (MAXN) and the maximum log2(n) (LOG2N), which should be adjusted accordingly to fit the actual problem constraints.
