Code Analysis:
The provided code is a C++ implementation of a Heavy-Light Decomposition data structure, which is used to solve various queries on a tree in logarithmic time complexity. This data structure is commonly used in competitive programming. The code reads a tree from the standard input, constructs a HeavyLight object, and then answers Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Efficient Data Structures: The code uses vectors extensively, which is a good choice for dynamic arrays in C++. However, the code also uses the `EACH` macro to iterate over vectors. Using range-based for loops instead would be more efficient and readable.
2. Redundant Computations: The `lca` function computes the ancestor repeatedly for the same nodes. A Depth-First Search (DFS) precomputation to store the ancestors of every node can help reduce these redundant computations.
3. Loops Optimization: The `dfs` and `buildPaths` functions can benefit from tail recursion optimization. Currently, these functions use recursive calls, which can be replaced by iterative logic to reduce function call overhead.
4. Compiler Optimizations: The `-O2` or `-O3` flags can be used with the g++ compiler to enable various compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and others.

Step-by-step Explanation:
1. Replace `EACH` Macro with Range-Based For Loops: The `EACH` macro uses the old style of iterating over a container. A range-based for loop is more efficient and readable. The change would look like this: replace `EACH(v, tree[u])` with `for(auto &v : tree[u])`.
2. Precomputation to Reduce Redundant Computations: Store the ancestors of every node using a DFS precomputation. This would help avoid multiple computations of the ancestor in the `lca` function.
3. Convert Recursive Calls to Iterative Logic: The `dfs` and `buildPaths` functions can be converted to use iterative logic instead of recursion. This eliminates the overhead of function calls and can significantly improve performance for large inputs.
4. Use Compiler Optimizations: When compiling the code, the `-O2` or `-O3` flags can be used to enable various compiler optimizations.

Trade-offs: 
The main trade-off in this optimization process is the increased complexity of the code. Converting recursive functions to iterative ones can make the code harder to understand. Furthermore, using compiler optimizations can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior if the code relies on certain language quirks or undefined behavior.

Optimized Code Block:
The optimized code is as follows (only the modified parts are shown for brevity):

```C++
// Replace EACH macro with range-based for loop
for(auto &v : tree[u]) {
  if(v != p) {
    dfs(v, u, k);
    size[u] += size[v];
  }
}

// Convert dfs function to iterative
void dfs(int u, int p, int &k) {
  stack<pair<int, int>> stk;
  stk.push({u, p});
  while(!stk.empty()) {
    tie(u, p) = stk.top();
    stk.pop();
    in[u] = k++, parent[u] = p, size[u] = 1;
    for(auto &v : tree[u]) {
      if(v != p) {
        stk.push({v, u});
      }
    }
    out[u] = k++;
  }
}

// Convert buildPaths function to iterative
void buildPaths(int u, int pt) {
  stack<pair<int, int>> stk;
  stk.push({u, pt});
  while(!stk.empty()) {
    tie(u, pt) = stk.top();
    stk.pop();
    path[u] = pt, pathPos[u] = pathSize[pt]++;
    for(auto &v : tree[u]) {
      if(v != parent[u]) {
        stk.push({v, 2 * size[v] >= size[u] ? pt : newPath(v)});
      }
    }
  }
}

// Precompute ancestors to avoid redundant computation
vector<int> ancestor(n);
void precomputeAncestors() {
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ancestor[i] = parent[pathRoot[path[i]]];
  }
}
```

Remember to compile the code with `-O2` or `-O3` flags for further optimization.
