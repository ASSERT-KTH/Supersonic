Code Analysis:

The given code implements a Suffix Array, a data structure used in string processing algorithms. It is used to preprocess a string to allow for efficient substring queries. The code also includes a "sparse_table" class for range minimum queries, which is used in the get_lcp() function to find the longest common prefix between two substrings.

The primary areas of concern for performance optimization are:

1. The sa_is() function, which creates the Suffix Array using the induced sorting method. This function has a time complexity of O(n log n), but it contains several loops and calls to other functions that can be optimized.

2. The construct_lcp() function, which computes the longest common prefix (LCP) array using Kasai's algorithm. It has a time complexity of O(n), but the inner loop that increments 'h' can be quite slow if the string has many repeated characters.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Optimize the sa_is() function:
    - Reduce the number of calls to create_begin_bucket() and create_end_bucket() by storing their results in an array and reusing them where possible.
    - Use a small constant value for 'mv' (maximum value in 'v') instead of calculating it each time, since 'v' contains ASCII values of characters.
    - Avoid creating new vectors each time the function is called recursively by passing them as parameters.

2. Optimize the construct_lcp() function:
    - Use a Fenwick Tree data structure (also known as Binary Indexed Tree) to store the LCP array and perform range minimum queries in O(log n) time instead of O(1). Although this increases the time complexity, the actual running time will be faster due to the reduced number of operations.

3. Use compiler optimizations:
    - Use the -O2 or -O3 optimization level when compiling the program to instruct the compiler to perform optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and others.

4. Improve I/O performance:
