The given C++ code is an implementation of a suffix array data structure, which is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string. It's primarily used in string matching algorithms in linear time. 

This code contains the following primary performance bottlenecks:

1. The code makes extensive use of vectors which can be expensive in terms of memory usage and can lead to significant overhead when resizing or copying.

2. The use of `vector<int>` for `bucket` and `is_l` in `induced_sort` and `invert_induced_sort` functions can be optimized. The size of these vectors is known, and they are filled with zeros initially. Instead of using `vector<int>` which dynamically allocates memory, using `std::array<int, size>` would be beneficial.

3. The `create_end_bucket` function has a loop that goes through the entire bucket vector to accumulate counts. This could be optimized by using prefix sum technique to avoid the extra pass through the bucket.

4. The `sa_is` function includes a nested loop which checks for differences in the input vector. This could be a potential performance bottleneck due to the quadratic time complexity.

5. The `init` function of `sparse_table` class includes a nested loop which also results in a quadratic time complexity. This could be optimized.

6. The `get_lcp` function uses `st.get_min(rank[i], rank[j])` which could potentially be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use `std::array<int, size>` instead of `vector<int>` for `bucket` and `is_l` in `induced_sort` and `invert_induced_sort` functions.

2. Optimize the `create_end_bucket` function to avoid the extra pass through the bucket.

3. Optimize the nested loop in the `sa_is` function to reduce the time complexity.

4. Optimize the `init` function of `sparse_table` class to reduce the time complexity.

5. Optimize the `get_lcp` function to reduce the time complexity.

6. Use compiler optimization flags such as `-O3` for further performance improvement.

7. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations wherever possible.
