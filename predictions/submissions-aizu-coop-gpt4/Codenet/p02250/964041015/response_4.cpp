The provided code implements a Suffix Array Data Structure with LCP (Longest Common Prefix) using Sparse Table. The Suffix Array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string. The LCP of two strings is the longest prefix common to both strings. 

However, the code is not optimized and has some performance issues. Below are some of the issues that can be improved:

1. **Use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`**: This header file includes all the standard library header files. It might be handy for programming competitions, but it's not good practice for production code due to increased compilation time.

2. **Using `std::endl` for newlines**: `std::endl` causes the output buffer to be flushed, which can slow down the program. It's better to use `"\n"`.

3. **Sparse Table Initialization**: The Sparse Table is initialized in every call to `get_min()`. It could be better to initialize it once in the constructor to avoid unnecessary computations.

4. **Use of `std::vector` for Suffix Array and LCP**: The use of `std::vector` here is not efficient because we're often appending to the end of the vector. A linked list or a deque might be more appropriate here.

5. **Unnecessary Recomputation in the `sa_is` Function**: The `sa_is` function performs some calculations that could be avoided if the results were stored in variables.

6. **Use of `std::string::compare` in the `contain` Function**: This function is used to check if a substring is part of the main string. This operation can be optimized by using a trie or a hash table.

7. **Use of `std::cin` and `std::cout` for Input/Output**: These are not the fastest methods for input/output in C++. Faster methods include using `scanf` and `printf` or synchronizing `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(nullptr)`.

8. **Lack of Parallel Computing**: There are some for-loops in the code that could potentially be parallelized to improve performance, especially on multi-core processors.

9. **Lack of Compiler Optimizations**: Compiler optimizations like `-O2` or `-O3` can make a significant difference.
