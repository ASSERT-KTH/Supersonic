The given code is an implementation of a Suffix Array, a data structure that can be used to solve many string-related problems such as pattern matching. The code is already quite optimized, but there are still a few areas where we can make improvements.

1. Code Analysis:

- The major bottleneck in this code is the creation of the suffix array and the construction of the longest common prefix (LCP) array. These operations have time complexities of O(n log n) and O(n), respectively, where n is the length of the string.
- For every query, the `contain` function is called which performs a binary search on the suffix array. This operation has a time complexity of O(log n) per query.
- The `get_lcp` function calls the `get_min` function of the `sparse_table` class, which also has a time complexity of O(log n) per query.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Use efficient data structures: The code already uses efficient data structures like vectors and strings which are the best choices for this problem. However, we can improve the `sparse_table` class by using an array instead of a vector of vectors to store the sparse table data.

B. Avoid unnecessary computations: The current implementation calculates the LCP array for the entire string, which can be avoided if the queries only ask for substring matches. In this case, we can calculate the LCP array only for the matching substrings.

C. Optimize loops and recursive calls: We can optimize the `get_lcp` function by storing the minimum LCP value in a separate array during the construction of the LCP array. This will allow us to retrieve the minimum LCP value in O(1) time instead of O(log n).

D. Use compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations can greatly improve the performance of the code. For example, we can use the `-O2` or `-O3` flags to enable all optimization levels.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Use an array in the `sparse_table` class: Instead of using a vector of vectors, we can use a 2-dimensional array to store the sparse table data. This will reduce the overhead caused by the dynamic memory allocation of vectors and will also improve cache locality, resulting in faster access times.

B. Calculate the LCP array only for matching substrings: Instead of calculating the LCP array for the entire string, we can calculate it only for the matching substrings. This can be achieved by modifying the `contain` function to return the index of the matching substring in the suffix array. Then, in the `get_lcp` function, we can calculate the LCP array only for the matching substring.

C. Optimize the `get_lcp` function: We can optimize the `get_lcp` function by storing the minimum LCP value in a separate array during the construction of the LCP array. This will allow us to retrieve the minimum LCP value in O(1) time instead of O(log n).

D. Use compiler optimizations: We can use the `-O2` or `-O3` flags to enable all optimization levels. These optimization levels apply various optimization techniques such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and constant propagation to improve the performance of the code.
