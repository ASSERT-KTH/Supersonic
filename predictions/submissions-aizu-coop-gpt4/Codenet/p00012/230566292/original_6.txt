1. Code Analysis:

The provided code seems to be implementing a geometric algorithm, determining if three given points (A, B, C) and a test point (P) are in the same clockwise order. The code is organized into a main function, a function to test each case, and a few smaller functions and data structures to manage geometric entities like points, lines, and circles. It's worth noting that the code doesn't have any obvious performance bottlenecks - it doesn't contain any nested loops or recursive calls that could exponentially increase the running time. However, there are still several small improvements that could be made to the code's structure and organization.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    1. Efficient use of `scanf` and `printf`: Instead of multiple calls to `scanf` and `printf`, we can use a single call with multiple arguments. This could potentially reduce the overhead involved in calling these functions.
    
    2. Efficient use of Condition Checks: The `testcase_ends` function checks the condition `tmp != ccwise(B, P, C)` and `tmp != ccwise(C, P, A)`. If the first condition is true, it will not execute the second condition, and the function will exit. We can store the result of these functions in a variable to avoid calling them twice.
    
    3. Avoid unnecessary namespace usage: The code uses `using namespace std;` at the beginning and then reopens the `std` namespace to define an operator. This is not good practice and can be avoided.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    1. Efficient use of `scanf` and `printf`: Instead of four calls to `scanf` for each of the points A, B, C, and P, we can use a single call with four sets of arguments. Similarly, instead of two calls to `printf` in the `testcase_ends` function, we can use a single call with a ternary operator to choose the correct string.
    
    2. Efficient use of Condition Checks: In the `testcase_ends` function, we can store the results of `ccwise(B, P, C)` and `ccwise(C, P, A)` in variables, and then use these variables in the conditional statements. This way, we avoid calling these functions twice.
    
    3. Avoid unnecessary namespace usage: We can define the operator outside of the `std` namespace.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>

static const double EPS = 1e-12;
static const double INF = 1e24;
using Point = std::complex<double>;
using Plane = std::vector<Point>;

bool operator<(const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  return real(a) != real(b) ? real(a) < real(b) : imag(a) < imag(b);
}

double cross_prod(const Point &a, const Point &b) { return imag(std::conj(a) * b); }
double dot_prod(const Point &a, const Point &b) { return real(std::conj(a) * b); }

struct Line : public std::pair<Point, Point> {
  Line() {}
  Line(const Point &a, const Point &b) {
    first = a;
    second = b;
  }
};

struct LineSeg : public std::pair<Point, Point> {
  LineSeg() {}
  LineSeg(const Point &a, const Point &b) {
    first = a;
    second = b;
  }
};

struct Circle {
  Point p;
  double r;
  Circle() {}
  Circle(const Point &p, const double r) : p(p), r(r) {}
};

enum CCWiseState {
  ONLINE_FRONT = -2,
  CLOCKWISE,
  ON_SEGMENT,
  COUNTER_CLOCKWISE,
  ONLINE_BACK,
};

CCWiseState ccwise(Point a, Point b, Point c) {
  b -= a;
  c -= a;
  if (cross_prod(b, c) > 0) {
    return COUNTER_CLOCKWISE;
  } else if (cross_prod(b, c) < 0) {
    return CLOCKWISE;
  } else if (dot_prod(b, c) < 0) {
    return ONLINE_BACK;
  } else if (norm(b) < norm(c)) {
    return ONLINE_FRONT;
  } else {
    return ON_SEGMENT;
  }
}

bool testcase_ends() {
  double x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4;
  // Combine scanf calls
  if (scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2, &x3, &y3, &x4, &y4) == EOF)
    return 1;
  Point A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2), C(x3, y3), P(x4, y4);
  
  CCWiseState tmp = ccwise(A, P, B);
  CCWiseState tmp1 = ccwise(B, P, C);
  CCWiseState tmp2 = ccwise(C, P, A);
  
  if (tmp != tmp1 || tmp != tmp2) {
    printf("NO\n");
    return true;
  }
  
  printf("YES\n");
  return false;
}

int main() {
  int solved = 0;
  while (!testcase_ends())
    ++solved;
  return !solved;
}
```
In this optimized code, the functionality remains the same as the original code, but it is structured more efficiently.
