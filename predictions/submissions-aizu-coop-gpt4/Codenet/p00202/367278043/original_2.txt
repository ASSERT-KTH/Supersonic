The provided C++ program appears to be solving a variant of the subset sum problem, where the goal is to find a subset of the input array whose sum is a prime number and as close as possible to a given target value.

Here are several ways to optimize this program:

1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes Optimization:**
   The code generates an array of prime numbers using a version of the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This algorithm can be optimized by iterating through odd numbers only (since even numbers other than 2 are not prime) and marking multiples of primes starting from the square of the current prime (since all smaller multiples would have been marked by previous primes). This reduces the number of iterations and thus the execution time.

2. **Subset Sum Algorithm Optimization:**
   The subset sum problem is solved using dynamic programming. However, the inner loop can be optimized by breaking as soon as a valid subset sum is found. This can help reduce the number of iterations.

3. **Input/Output Optimization:**
   The program uses scanf and printf for input/output which are slower than cin and cout in C++. Using cin and cout with ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL) can improve performance.

4. **Memory Usage Optimization:**
   The size of the dp and prime arrays is fixed and large. We can reduce memory usage by dynamically allocating these arrays only when needed and releasing the memory after use.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int n, x;
int* a;
bool* dp;
bool* prime;

void generatePrimes(int limit) {
    prime[0] = false;
    prime[1] = false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= limit; i++) {
        if (prime[i]) {
            for (int j = i * i; j <= limit; j += i)
                prime[j] = false;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    while (cin >> n >> x, n) {
        a = new int[n];
        dp = new bool[x + 1]();
        prime = new bool[x + 1]();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            cin >> a[i];
        sort(a, a + n);

        fill_n(prime, x + 1, true);
        generatePrimes(x);

        dp[0] = true;
        for (int i = 1; i <= x; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n && i >= a[j]; j++) {
                if (dp[i - a[j]]) {
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        for (int i = x; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (dp[i] && prime[i]) {
                cout << (i ? to_string(i) : "NA") << "\n";
                break;
            }
        }

        delete[] a;
        delete[] dp;
        delete[] prime;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
The optimized code performs the same functionality as the original code but with improved performance and less memory usage.
