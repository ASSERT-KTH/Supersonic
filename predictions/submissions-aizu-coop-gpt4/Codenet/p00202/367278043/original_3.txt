Analysis:
Here's a quick analysis of the provided code:

1. The code generates a prime number list up to 1,000,000 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. This operation has a time complexity of O(n log log n).

2. The code then reads numbers from the input, sorts them, and uses dynamic programming to identify the highest prime number that can be reached by summing up the numbers.

There are a couple of issues with this code:

1. The prime number generation is performed every time the program is run, even though the prime list doesn't change. This is a redundant computation.

2. The code uses a boolean array, dp, to mark achievable sums. This can be memory-intensive for larger inputs.

3. The sort operation on the array a[] can also be costly, especially if n is large. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Move the prime number generation outside of the main function so it is only performed once. This reduces redundant computation.

2. Use a more memory-efficient data structure than a boolean array for dp[]. A set data structure has an average time complexity of O(log n) for insertions and lookups and can dynamically allocate memory as required.

3. Instead of sorting the array a[], we can use a priority queue to keep track of the smallest element. This has a time complexity of O(log n) for insertions and removals, compared to O(n log n) for sorting.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <set>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int n, x, a[30];
set<int> dp;
bool prime[1000001];

void generate_primes() {
  prime[0] = false, prime[1] = false, prime[2] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i <= 1000000; i += 2)
    prime[i] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i <= 1000; i++) {
    if (!prime[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i; i * j <= 1000000; j += 2)
      prime[i * j] = false;
  }
}

int main() {
  generate_primes();
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &x), n) {
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &a[i]);
      pq.push(a[i]);
    }
    dp.clear(); dp.insert(0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= x; i++) {
      while (!pq.empty() && i >= pq.top()) {
        if (dp.count(i - pq.top())) {
          dp.insert(i);
          break;
        }
        pq.pop();
      }
    }
    for (int i = x; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (dp.count(i) && prime[i]) {
        printf(i ? "%d\n" : "NA\n", i);
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note: The above code assumes that the size of the array a[] and the maximum value of x are manageable in terms of memory. If they can be extremely large, further optimization would be needed.
