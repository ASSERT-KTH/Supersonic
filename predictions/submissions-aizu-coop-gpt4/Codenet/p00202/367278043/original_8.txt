1. Code Analysis:
This program checks if a number is prime and finds the largest prime number that can be obtained by summing up any subset of the given array of integers. For this purpose, it uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate an array of prime numbers upto a maximum limit. The program then checks if the sum of any subset of an array of integers can be a prime number. The algorithm for subset sums is implemented through dynamic programming. The program runs until the input is exhausted.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. The prime number generation is being done every time for each input case. We can optimize this by generating the prime numbers once at the beginning of the program.
    2. The dynamic programming array `dp` is being reset for every case. We can optimize this by reusing the `dp` array for smaller sums and only resetting values when necessary.
    3. We can use `std::fill` function instead of a loop for resetting the `dp` array.
    4. The `scanf` and `printf` functions are slower compared to the C++ `iostream` functions. We can use `cin` and `cout` instead.
    
3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Generate the prime numbers once at the beginning of the program. This avoids recalculating the prime numbers for each input case, which improves performance.
    2. Reuse the `dp` array for smaller sums. This avoids resetting the `dp` array for each input case, which reduces memory usage.
    3. Use `std::fill` function instead of a loop for resetting the `dp` array. This makes the code more concise and potentially faster, as `std::fill` may use optimized machine code.
    4. Use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`. `cin` and `cout` are more idiomatic in C++ and potentially faster due to better integration with the C++ standard library.
    
4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int n, x;
vector<int> a(30);
vector<bool> dp(1000001), prime(1000001);

void generate_primes() {
  prime[0] = true, prime[2] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i <= 1000000; i += 2)
    prime[i] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i <= 1000; i++) {
    if (!prime[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i; i * j <= 1000000; j += 2)
      prime[i * j] = false;
  }
}

int main() {
  generate_primes();
  while (cin >> n >> x, n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> a[i];
    sort(a.begin(), a.begin() + n);
    if (x >= dp.size()) dp.resize(x+1);
    fill(dp.begin(), dp.begin() + x + 1, false);
    dp[0] = true;
    for (int i = 1; i <= x; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n && i >= a[j]; j++) {
        if (dp[i - a[j]]) {
          dp[i] = true;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    for (int i = x; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (dp[i] && prime[i]) {
        cout << (i ? to_string(i) : "NA") << '\n';
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This optimized code reduces unnecessary computations by generating the prime numbers once and reusing the `dp` array for smaller sums. It also improves code readability by using `std::fill` and `cin`/`cout`. The trade-off is that the code may be slightly more complex due to the use of `std::vector` and `std::fill`. However, this complexity is justified by the performance gain.
