The given C++ program is trying to find the highest prime number that can be made as the sum of some elements in the given array. The program takes two inputs: n (number of elements in the array) and x (maximum possible sum). It uses dynamic programming (dp) to find out all possible sums, and uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find out all prime numbers up to 1,000,000. Here is the optimization strategy:

1. **Inefficient Data Structures**: The program uses a boolean array to mark each possible sum (from 0 to x) whether it can be made from the array elements or not. This is efficient in terms of time complexity, but it can be optimized in terms of space complexity. We do not need to store all the sums, only the ones that are prime. We can use a set instead of a boolean array to store only prime sums.

2. **Redundant Computations**: The program calculates all prime numbers up to 1,000,000 regardless of the input x. This can be optimized by calculating prime numbers only up to x. This will speed up the program in cases where x is much smaller than 1,000,000.

3. **Loops Optimization**: The program uses nested loops to check all possible sums. This is necessary and cannot be optimized further. However, the outer loop that checks for the highest prime sum can be optimized by storing the highest prime sum during the dynamic programming phase.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: The compiler can be instructed to optimize the code for speed using #pragma directive. For example, `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")`.

Here is the optimized code following the above strategy:

```C++
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <set>
using namespace std;
int n, x, a[30];
set<int> prime_sums;
bool prime[1000001];

void sieve() {
  prime[0] = false, prime[1] = false, prime[2] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i <= x; i += 2)
    prime[i] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= x; i++) {
    if (!prime[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i; i * j <= x; j += 2)
      prime[i * j] = false;
  }
}

int main() {
  #pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &x), n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    sort(a, a + n);
    prime_sums.clear();
    prime_sums.insert(0);
    int max_prime_sum = 0;
    sieve();
    for (int i = 1; i <= x; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n && i >= a[j]; j++) {
        if (prime_sums.count(i - a[j])) {
          prime_sums.insert(i);
          if (prime[i])
            max_prime_sum = i;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    printf(max_prime_sum ? "%d\n" : "NA\n", max_prime_sum);
  }
}
```

This optimized code should perform better in terms of both running time and memory usage. However, the trade-off is that it increases the code complexity slightly by using a set instead of a boolean array and by keeping track of the maximum prime sum during the dynamic programming phase.
