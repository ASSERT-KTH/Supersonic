After analyzing the provided C/C++ code, we can identify the following areas for optimization:

1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** The code block that generates the prime numbers can be optimized further. Currently, it is checking for every odd number whether it's prime or not, which is not the most efficient way to generate primes. We can optimize this by starting from the square of the prime number and increasing in steps of 2*i instead of just i.

2. **Dynamic Programming:** The dynamic programming part, where it is checking if a number can be made by the given numbers, can be optimized by breaking the loop as soon as we find a valid combination.

3. **Memory Usage:** Currently, two large arrays are being declared with a fixed size. The size of these arrays can be reduced depending on the inputs.

4. **Input/Output operations:** The use of `scanf` and `printf` can be optimized using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);`

Here's the optimized version of the code with the above-mentioned optimizations:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int n, x;
vector<int> a;
vector<int> dp;
vector<bool> prime;

void genPrimes(int max) {
  prime[2] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i <= max; i += 2)
    prime[i] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= max; i += 2) {
    if (prime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= max; j += i * 2)
        prime[j] = false;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  while (cin >> n >> x, n) {
    a.resize(n);
    dp.clear();
    dp.resize(x + 1);
    prime.clear();
    prime.resize(x + 1);
    
    genPrimes(x);  // Generate primes up to x
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> a[i];
    sort(a.begin(), a.end());

    dp[0] = true;
    for (int i = 1; i <= x; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n && i >= a[j]; j++) {
        if (dp[i - a[j]]) {
          dp[i] = true;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    for (int i = x; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (dp[i] && prime[i]) {
        cout << (i != 0 ? to_string(i) : "NA") << "\n";
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Explanation:

1. The Sieve of Eratosthenes logic has been optimized by starting from i*i and increasing in steps of 2*i. This reduces the number of operations.
2. The dynamic programming part is optimized by breaking the loop as soon as we find a valid combination. This reduces unnecessary iterations.
3. The fixed size arrays have been replaced with vectors which are resized according to the inputs. This reduces memory usage.
4. The use of `scanf` and `printf` is replaced with `cin` and `cout` after disabling sync with stdio. This speeds up input/output operations.
