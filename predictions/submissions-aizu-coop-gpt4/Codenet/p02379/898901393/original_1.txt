This is a simple C program that takes four input floating-point values, uses them to define two points in a 2D space, and calculates the Euclidean distance between the two points.

Code Analysis:
1. The program is efficient and does not contain any clear performance bottlenecks. The calculations are straightforward with no complex data structures or algorithms.
2. There is no memory leak or inefficient memory usage as the program does not dynamically allocate any memory.
3. The program does not use any loops or recursive calls, so there's no scope for optimization in these areas.
4. The program does not use any compiler specific features that could be optimized using pragma directives or other similar features.

Optimization Strategy and Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The only optimization that could possibly be made is to remove the unnecessary use of a temporary variable in the distance function. This change is minimal and may not lead to any significant performance improvement, but it will simplify the code slightly. However, this optimization is not necessary as modern compilers would likely optimize this out anyway during the compilation process.
2. It is also possible to inline the distance function to potentially save the overhead of a function call. However, modern compilers also automatically inline small functions like this, so this optimization may not be necessary.

Trade-offs:
1. The proposed optimizations may not lead to any noticeable performance improvement because modern compilers are typically able to automatically perform these optimizations.
2. Inlining the function can increase the size of the binary as the function code is duplicated each time the function is called. However, in this case, the function is small and only called once, so this is not a concern.

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct point {
  double x;
  double y;
} point;

inline double distance(point p1, point p2) {
  return sqrt((p1.x - p2.x) * (p1.x - p2.x) + (p1.y - p2.y) * (p1.y - p2.y));
}

int main(void) {
  point p1, p2;
  double d;
  scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf", &p1.x, &p1.y, &p2.x, &p2.y);
  d = distance(p1, p2);
  printf("%.5f\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The inline keyword is a hint to the compiler that the function should be inlined if possible, but it is just a hint and the compiler is free to ignore it if it determines that inlining the function would not improve performance.
