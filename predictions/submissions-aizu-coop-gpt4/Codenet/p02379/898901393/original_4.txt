The provided C program calculates the Euclidean distance between two points. The points are read from standard input, and the distance is printed to standard output with a precision of five decimal places. The program is simple and well-written, but there are a few opportunities to optimize it.

Optimization Strategy:

1. **Inline Function**: The `distance` function is called only once in the main function. It can be made inline to eliminate the function call overhead.

2. **Efficient I/O**: The standard I/O functions `scanf` and `printf` are quite slow. They can be replaced with faster alternatives like `getchar_unlocked` and `putchar_unlocked`.

3. **Eliminate Temporary Variable**: The temporary variable `temp` in the `distance` function is unnecessary and can be eliminated.

4. **Compiler Optimization**: The compiler can be hinted to optimize the code further with the `-O3` flag.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Inline Function**: Inlining the `distance` function will eliminate the function call overhead. The compiler replaces the function call with the actual code of the function, thereby saving the time of jumping to the function and returning back. However, this might increase the size of the binary slightly.

2. **Efficient I/O**: The `scanf` and `printf` functions have a lot of overhead because they need to parse the format string. Replacing them with `getchar_unlocked` and `putchar_unlocked`, which are lower level and faster, can improve the I/O performance. We need to handle the parsing and formatting ourselves, which increases the complexity of the code.

3. **Eliminate Temporary Variable**: We can eliminate the `temp` variable by directly returning the result of the distance calculation. This reduces the memory usage slightly.

4. **Compiler Optimization**: The `-O3` flag tells the compiler to optimize the code as much as possible. This includes vectorization, loop unrolling, and many other optimizations. This can significantly improve the performance, but it may make debugging more difficult.

Optimized Code Block:

```C
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct point {
  double x;
  double y;
} point;

inline double distance(point p1, point p2) {
  return sqrt((p1.x - p2.x) * (p1.x - p2.x) + (p1.y - p2.y) * (p1.y - p2.y));
}

double fast_read_double() {
  double result = 0.0, div = 1.0;
  char c = getchar_unlocked();
  while (c < '0' || c > '9') c = getchar_unlocked();
  while (c >= '0' && c <= '9') {
    result = result * 10 + (c - '0');
    c = getchar_unlocked();
  }
  if (c == '.') {
    c = getchar_unlocked();
    while (c >= '0' && c <= '9') {
      result = result + (c - '0') / div;
      div *= 10.0;
      c = getchar_unlocked();
    }
  }
  return result;
}

int main(void) {
  point p1, p2;
  double d;
  p1.x = fast_read_double(); p1.y = fast_read_double();
  p2.x = fast_read_double(); p2.y = fast_read_double();
  d = distance(p1, p2);
  printf("%.5f\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```
Compile the code with `-O3` flag to get maximum optimization from the compiler.
```bash
gcc -O3 program.c
```
