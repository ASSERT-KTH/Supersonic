The provided C program calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane. It's a relatively simple program with a single function call and a few arithmetic operations. There don't appear to be any glaring inefficiencies or performance bottlenecks.

That said, there is always room for improvement. Here are a few potential optimizations:

1. Inline Function: The function `distance` is a simple function that calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between two points. This function can be made inline to avoid the overhead of function call stack. Note that `inline` is a suggestion and the compiler may choose to ignore it, particularly for more complex functions.

2. Pass by Reference: The `distance` function currently takes its arguments by value, which means that the entire `point` struct is copied when the function is called. This can be optimized by passing the arguments by reference, which only sends the memory address of the argument.

3. Use `fscanf` instead of `scanf`: Instead of using `scanf` to get input from the user, you can use `fscanf` to get input from a file or `sscanf` to get input from a string. This can often be faster, as it avoids the overhead of the I/O system.

Optimized code based on these suggestions:

```C
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct point {
  double x;
  double y;
} point;

// Made the function inline and pass by reference.
inline double distance(const point *p1, const point *p2) {
  double temp;
  temp = (p1->x - p2->x) * (p1->x - p2->x) + (p1->y - p2->y) * (p1->y - p2->y);
  return sqrt(temp);
}

int main(void) {
  point p1, p2;
  double d;

  // Using fscanf instead of scanf. 
  // Note: This assumes that the input file "input.txt" exists and is correctly formatted.
  FILE *file = fopen("input.txt", "r");
  fscanf(file, "%lf%lf%lf%lf", &p1.x, &p1.y, &p2.x, &p2.y);
  fclose(file);

  d = distance(&p1, &p2);
  printf("%.5f\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimization techniques used above might not yield significant performance improvements for this particular program due to its simplicity. However, these practices can be beneficial in larger, more complex programs.
