The code snippet you've provided is pretty well optimized in its current state. It calculates the Euclidean distance between two points, which is a straightforward mathematical operation that does not provide many opportunities for optimization.

However, there are few points where we can make some minor tweaks:

1. **Pass by Reference Instead of by Value**: In the `distance` function, the parameters are passed by value, which leads to extra memory allocation and deallocation. Since the function does not modify these parameters, passing them by reference would be more efficient.

2. **Avoid Unnecessary Temporary Variable**: The `temp` variable in the `distance` function is not really necessary. We can directly return the result of the calculation.

3. **Direct Function Call**: Instead of storing the result of the `distance` function in the `d` variable, we can directly use the function call in the `printf` statement.

The optimized code would look like this:

```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct point {
  double x;
  double y;
} point;

double distance(const point &p1, const point &p2) {
  return sqrt((p1.x - p2.x) * (p1.x - p2.x) + (p1.y - p2.y) * (p1.y - p2.y));
}

int main(void) {
  point p1, p2;
  scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf", &p1.x, &p1.y, &p2.x, &p2.y);
  printf("%.5f\n", distance(p1, p2));
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations will not make a significant impact on runtime or memory usage for this particular code snippet. They are merely best practices that can make a difference in larger, more complex programs.
