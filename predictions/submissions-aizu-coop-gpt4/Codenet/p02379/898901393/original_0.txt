The given code is quite efficient already, as it calculates the distance between two points in a 2D space. However, there are few minor improvements that can be made for more efficient execution, especially when this code is part of a larger system where the function `distance` could be called multiple times.

### Optimization Strategy:

1. **Passing Structs by Reference:** In the current implementation, the point structs `p1` and `2` are passed by value to the `distance` function. This means the entire struct is copied, which can be inefficient, especially if the struct is large. Instead, we can pass the structs by reference.

2. **`sqrt` Computation:** The `sqrt` function is computationally expensive. This might not make a significant difference in this specific code snippet, but if the `distance` function is called multiple times in a larger program, this could be a bottleneck. If the objective is only to compare distances and not to know the exact distance, the square of the distance (i.e., without using `sqrt`) can be used. However, we need to be careful since this changes the output of the function.

### Optimized Code Block

Below is the optimized code based on the strategy above:

```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct point {
  double x;
  double y;
} point;

// Passing structs by reference to avoid copying
double distance(point* p1, point* p2) {
  double temp;
  temp = (p1->x - p2->x) * (p1->x - p2->x) + (p1->y - p2->y) * (p1->y - p2->y);
  return temp; // Returning square of the distance
}

int main(void) {
  point p1, p2;
  double d;
  scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf", &p1.x, &p1.y, &p2.x, &p2.y);
  d = distance(&p1, &p2); // Passing struct addresses
  printf("%.5f\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```

The trade-off here is that the `distance` function no longer returns the actual distance but the square of the distance. This is more efficient but can potentially cause confusion if not properly documented. If the exact distance is needed, we would have to resort to using `sqrt`, but for scenarios where only relative distances are compared, this approach can provide significant speed improvements.
