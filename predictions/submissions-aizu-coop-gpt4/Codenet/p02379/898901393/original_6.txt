The provided code is a simple program that calculates the distance between two points on a 2D plane. From a performance perspective, this is a rather straightforward program and doesn't seem to have any apparent performance bottlenecks. The memory usage is also minimal, with only two points and one double variable being defined. Moreover, there are no loops or recursive calls that could be optimized.

However, there are a few small changes that could potentially speed up the execution time and reduce memory usage even further:

1. Pass struct by reference: In the current program, the entire struct is passed to the function, which can be a bit slow if the struct is large. Even though our struct is quite small, passing the struct by reference (i.e., passing the address of the struct instead of the struct itself) can be faster. This would also reduce memory usage because the function would work with the original struct in memory rather than a copy.

2. Remove unnecessary temporary variable: The `temp` variable in the `distance` function is not necessary. We can directly return the result of the calculation without storing it in a temporary variable first.

3. Use `const` keyword: The `const` keyword can be used in the function definition to indicate that the function will not modify the struct. This allows the compiler to make certain optimizations.

4. Use `-Ofast` compiler flag: This flag tells the compiler to make the code run as fast as possible. It includes optimizations like `-O3` and `-ffast-math`. Note that `-ffast-math` may break IEEE compliance and only makes sense in context of mathematical programs.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct point {
  double x;
  double y;
} point;

double distance(const point* p1, const point* p2) {
  return sqrt((p1->x - p2->x) * (p1->x - p2->x) + (p1->y - p2->y) * (p1->y - p2->y));
}

int main(void) {
  point p1, p2;
  double d;
  scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf", &p1.x, &p1.y, &p2.x, &p2.y);
  d = distance(&p1, &p2);
  printf("%.5f\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```
Compile with `-Ofast`:
```bash
gcc -Ofast program.c -o program
```
