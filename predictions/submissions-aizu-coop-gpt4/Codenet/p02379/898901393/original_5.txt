This code is already quite efficient, but there are a few minor tweaks that could be made to potentially optimize the performance.

1. Code Analysis: 
   The code is a simple program calculating the distance between two points in a 2D space. There are no complex data structures, and no obvious bottlenecks in terms of computations or memory usage.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   A. There's no need to change data structures as the current structure is suitable for this task.
   B. The computation for distance could be mildly optimized.
   C. There are no recursive calls or loops that could be optimized.
   D. Compiler optimizations could be used to help improve the performance of the code. 

3. Step-by-Step Explanation: 
   A. Inline Function: We could mark the `distance` function as `inline`. This will suggest the compiler to replace the function call with the function code itself, which can potentially reduce the overhead of a function call. 
   B. Compiler Optimization Flags: We could use compiler optimization flags, such as `-O2` or `-O3` when compiling the program. These flags tell the compiler to focus on optimizing the code for speed.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct point {
  double x;
  double y;
} point;

inline double distance(point p1, point p2) {
  return sqrt((p1.x - p2.x) * (p1.x - p2.x) + (p1.y - p2.y) * (p1.y - p2.y));
}

int main(void) {
  point p1, p2;
  scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf", &p1.x, &p1.y, &p2.x, &p2.y);
  printf("%.5f\n", distance(p1, p2));
  return 0;
}
```

While compiling, you can use optimization flags such as `-O2` or `-O3`.

`gcc -O2 -o distance distance.c`

These optimizations are very minor, and in practice, the performance improvement might be negligible for this simple program. However, understanding and applying these techniques can be beneficial in larger, more complex programs where these performance gains can accumulate.
