Firstly, let's analyze the given C++ program. The program performs a search operation in a grid, and it uses a map, set, and vector as data structures. The map is used to store unique pairs of integers and the set is used to store a collection of unique long long integers. A vector is not explicitly used in the code, though it is included in the header files. The program includes a number of control structures such as loops and recursive calls.

Let's identify some potential bottlenecks and areas of optimization:

1. **Data Structures**: The choice of data structures can greatly impact the performance of your program. C++ provides multiple ways to store pairs of integers (like `std::pair` and `std::array`), and multiple ways to store collections of unique elements (like `std::set` and `std::unordered_set`). The best choice depends on the usage patterns of your program, but in general `std::unordered_set` can be faster than `std::set` for lookup operations, and `std::array` can be faster than `std::pair` for small, fixed-size collections.

2. **Redundant Computations**: The program contains multiple instances of the same computation. For example, the `inside` function is called multiple times with the same arguments, and the computation `(k + init_dir + (f ? 2 : 0)) % 4` is also repeated. These could be computed once and stored in variables for reuse.

3. **Loop Optimizations**: The program contains nested loops, which can be a performance bottleneck. Loop unrolling or blocking might be possible optimizations here.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: The use of compiler flags can help optimize the performance of the program. Flags such as `-O3` for GCC or `-Ox` for MSVC can enable many performance optimizations. 

Now let's work on optimizing the code:

1. **Data Structures**: Replace `std::map` with `std::unordered_map` and `std::set` with `std::unordered_set`. This can help improve lookup performance. However, note that these changes might increase memory usage due to the additional space required for storing hash tables.

2. **Redundant Computations**: Compute `(k + init_dir + (f ? 2 : 0)) % 4` and `(k + init_dir) % 4` once and store the results in variables for reuse. Similarly, compute `inside(tx, ty)` and `inside(ttx, tty)` once and store the results in variables for reuse.

3. **Loop Optimizations**: Loop unrolling or blocking might not be applicable here due to the variable loop sizes and the complex control flow within the loops. However, you could experiment with different loop orders to see if they improve cache locality.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: Use the `-O3` flag (for GCC) or `-Ox` flag (for MSVC) when compiling your program. This will enable many performance optimizations such as function inlining, loop unrolling, and vectorization.
