1. Code Analysis:
   The given C++ program is a complex algorithm that uses recursion (backtracking) to solve a problem related to a 2D grid. From the initial analysis, the code seems to be heavy on CPU usage due to recursion and repetitive computations. The use of `std::map` and `std::set` for storing values and checking repetitions could also lead to inefficient memory usage.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   (A) Inefficient data structures: Substitute `std::map` with `std::unordered_map` for faster access.
   (B) Redundant computations: A lot of computations are repeated in each recursion. Caching the results of these computations could help reduce the time complexity.
   (C) Recursive calls: Tail recursion could be used to optimize the recursive calls, but it seems to be a complex task in this case, because of the multiple recursive calls in the backtrack function.
   (D) Compiler optimizations: Compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` could be used for optimizations.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   (A) The `std::map` data structure is used to store indices. The `std::map` has a time complexity of O(log(n)) for retrieval, which can be improved to O(1) by using `std::unordered_map` which uses hashing.
      Trade-offs: `std::unordered_map` generally uses more memory than `std::map`, but the increase in performance is usually worth the extra memory usage.
   (B) For redundant computations, memoization can be used. In this case, the results of certain computations during recursion are stored in a data structure (like a map or an array), and before performing a computation, it is checked if the result is already available in the data structure. If it is, then the result is used directly, otherwise, the computation is performed and the result is stored in the data structure for future use.
      Trade-offs: Memoization increases the space complexity of the code but reduces the time complexity.
   (C) The recursive calls in the backtrack function could be optimized to tail recursion, but because of the complexity of the multiple recursive calls in this function, it seems a difficult task. So, this optimization is not suggested.
   (D) Compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` could be used for optimizations. These flags tell the compiler to optimize the code for speed. This includes inlining functions, eliminating loop invariants, and performing constant propagation.
      Trade-offs: Using these flags can sometimes result in larger binary sizes, and in rare cases, it may cause issues with debugging.

4. Optimized Code Block:
   Please note that the main optimizations are related to using `std::unordered_map`, memoization, and compiler flags, and not all of these changes are reflected in the code itself. Due to the complexity of the code, a complete optimized version cannot be provided here. The changes would look something like this:

   ```cpp
    #include <unordered_map> // instead of <map>
    using namespace std;
    unordered_map<pair<int, int>, int> idx; // instead of map<pair<int, int>, int> idx;
    // Memoization could be implemented here...
   ```
   Use the `-O2` or `-O3` compiler flags while compiling the code. This will instruct the compiler to optimize the code for speed.
