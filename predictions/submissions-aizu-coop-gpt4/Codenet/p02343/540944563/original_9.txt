The provided C++ program is a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) algorithm. Its primary purpose is to manage a collection of disjoint sets (also known as equivalence classes). It provides operations to add new sets, to merge existing sets, and to determine whether elements are in the same set. 

In terms of optimization, this code is already quite efficient and is employing a common structure for DSU with path compression and union by rank. However, there are still a few aspects that can be improved:

1. **Inefficient memory allocation**: The code is dynamically allocating memory for the boss and height arrays. This can be inefficient and prone to memory leaks if not handled properly. On the other hand, using a static array or std::vector can be more efficient and safer.

2. **Redundant function calls**: In the unite function, get_boss is called twice for both x and y. These calls can be reduced to one each.

3. **Inefficient I/O operations**: The code uses scanf and printf for input and output. These can be slower than cin and cout if ios_base::sync_with_stdio is set to false.

4. **Unnecessary use of 'else'**: After return statements, 'else' is not necessary. Removing 'else' after return can make the code cleaner.

## Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int N;
vector<int> boss, height;

int get_boss(int id) {
  if (boss[id] != id)
    boss[id] = get_boss(boss[id]);
  return boss[id];
}

void unite(int x, int y) {
  x = get_boss(x);
  y = get_boss(y);
  
  if (x == y)
    return;
  
  if (height[x] > height[y]) {
    boss[y] = x;
  } else {
    boss[x] = y;
    if (height[x] == height[y])
      height[y]++;
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int Q, command, x, y;
  cin >> N >> Q;
  boss.resize(N);
  height.resize(N, 1);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    boss[i] = i;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    cin >> command >> x >> y;
    if (command == 0) {
      unite(x, y);
    } else {
      cout << (get_boss(x) == get_boss(y)) << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

## Explanation:

1. Replaced dynamic arrays with vectors which are easier to handle and are safer. 

2. Moved the get_boss calls in unite() to the function arguments. This reduces the function calls for get_boss from four to two.

3. Set ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); and cin.tie(NULL); to make cin and cout faster, and replaced scanf and printf with cin and cout for consistency. 

4. Removed 'else' after return in get_boss function to make the code cleaner.

5. Consolidated the output printing in one line by directly comparing get_boss(x) and get_boss(y) and outputting the result.
