**1. Code Analysis:**
This code is implementing basic operations of Disjoint-Set Union (DSU) or Union-Find algorithm, which is a data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It provides operations like union, find and is_same. 

This is a well-known algorithm and its time complexity is nearly constant for union and find operations due to path compression and union by rank/size. Therefore, there don't appear to be any prominent performance bottlenecks in this code.

**2. Optimization Strategy:**
Though the code is already optimized, there are few minor improvements that could be made:

A. Use of C++ Standard Input/Output (cin, cout) instead of C-style (scanf, printf). Although scanf and printf are faster, cin and cout are safer and more flexible. The speed difference can be eliminated by using ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false).

B. Use of vectors instead of dynamic arrays. This will manage memory better and avoid the need for manual memory deallocation.

C. Use of 'bool' return type for is_same function, as it is more appropriate to return boolean values for functions checking a condition.

**3. Step-By-Step Explanation:**

A. Replace scanf and printf with cin and cout: This will make the code safer and more C++-like. The speed can be improved by using ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) which unties cin from cout and makes them faster, though at the cost of not being able to mix cin/cout and scanf/printf.

B. Replace dynamic arrays with vectors: This will manage memory better and automatically deallocate it when out of scope. It also provides better access methods and more safety.

C. Change is_same function to return bool: This is a more appropriate return type for a function that checks a condition.
