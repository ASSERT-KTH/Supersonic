The program is a simple implementation of the Union-Find algorithm, also known as Disjoint Set Union (DSU). This structure is used to keep track of a partition of a set into disjoint, non-overlapping subsets.

Given its functionality, the code is already quite efficient, but there are still a few areas where we can optimize it:

1. **Avoiding Dynamic Memory Allocation**: The dynamic allocation of `boss` and `height` arrays with `new` is not necessary and can be replaced with static allocation. Dynamic memory allocation can be slower than static allocation, especially when the size of the array is known at compile time.

2. **Avoiding Recursion**: In the `get_boss` function, recursion is used to find the root node. This can be optimized by using iteration instead of recursion to avoid the overhead of function calls.

3. **In-Line Simple Functions**: The `is_same` function is simple enough to be inlined. This will remove the overhead of function calls improving the performance.

4. **Avoiding Multiple Calls to `get_boss` Function**: In the `unite` function, we're calling `get_boss` twice for both `x` and `y`. We can instead store the results in variables and use them, reducing the number of function calls.

Now let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <queue>
#include <stack>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
typedef long long int ll;
#define BIG_NUM 2000000000
#define MOD 1000000007
#define EPS 0.000001
#define MAXN 100000
using namespace std;

int N;
int boss[MAXN], height[MAXN];

int get_boss(int id) {
  while (id != boss[id]) {
    id = boss[id] = boss[boss[id]];  // Path compression
  }
  return id;
}

inline bool is_same(int x, int y) { return get_boss(x) == get_boss(y); }

void unite(int x, int y) {
  int boss_x = get_boss(x);
  int boss_y = get_boss(y);
  if (boss_x == boss_y)
    return;
  if (height[x] > height[y]) {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
  } else if (height[x] < height[y]) {
    boss[boss_x] = boss_y;
  } else {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
    height[x]++;
  }
}

int main() {
  int Q, command, x, y;
  scanf("%d %d", &N, &Q);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    boss[i] = i;
    height[i] = 1;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d %d", &command, &x, &y);
    if (command == 0) {
      unite(x, y);
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", is_same(x, y));
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the maximum limit for `N` (`MAXN`) is set to `100000` here. You should adjust this according to your problem constraints.

Changes Made:

1. Declared `boss` and `height` arrays as global arrays with static memory allocation.
2. Changed recursive `get_boss` function to iterative with path compression.
3. Inlined the `is_same` function to reduce function call overhead.
4. Used the results of `get_boss` function calls in `unite` function to avoid multiple function calls.
5. Simplified the `printf` statements in `main` function.

Remember, these changes may make the code less flexible (for instance, the array size is now fixed at compile time), but for the sake of this specific problem, it is acceptable.
