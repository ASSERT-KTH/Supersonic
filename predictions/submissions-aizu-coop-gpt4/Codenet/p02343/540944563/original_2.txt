1. Code Analysis:
This code is implementing a union-find data structure, which is a data structure that tracks a partition of a set into disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It provides near-constant-time operations (bounded by the inverse Ackermann function) to add new sets, to merge existing sets, and to determine whether elements are in the same set. 

The main performance bottlenecks:
- Recursive function calls in the `get_boss` function. This can be optimized using path compression.
- Each time the `unite` function is called, it makes two calls to `get_boss`. This can be optimized.
- Dynamic memory allocation for the `boss` and `height` arrays. This can lead to fragmentation and inefficient memory usage.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Use path compression in the `get_boss` function. This means that each node visited on the way to the root will have its parent changed to the root. This flattens the structure of the tree, reducing the time complexity of future operations.
    2. Optimize the `unite` function to only make one call to `get_boss` for each of `x` and `y`.
    3. Use stack memory allocation. If `N` is not too large, using stack memory for `boss` and `height` arrays can be faster than using heap memory.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. In the `get_boss` function, after determining the boss of `id` (the root of the tree), set `boss[id]` to be the determined boss. This is called path compression and it will make future calls to `get_boss` for `id` faster by caching the result of the current call.
    2. In the `unite` function, store the results of `get_boss(x)` and `get_boss(y)` to avoid calling these functions twice.
    3. If `N` is not too large, use stack memory for `boss` and `height` arrays. This can be faster than using heap memory because it avoids the overhead of memory management.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#define N 10000
int boss[N], height[N];
int get_boss(int id) {
  if (boss[id] != id)
    boss[id] = get_boss(boss[id]);
  return boss[id];
}
void unite(int x, int y) {
  x = get_boss(x);
  y = get_boss(y);
  if (x == y)
    return;
  if (height[x] > height[y]) {
    boss[y] = x;
  } else {
    if (height[x] == height[y])
      height[y]++;
    boss[x] = y;
  }
}
int is_same(int x, int y) { return get_boss(x) == get_boss(y); }
int main() {
  int Q, command, x, y;
  scanf("%d", &Q);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    boss[i] = i;
    height[i] = 1;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d %d", &command, &x, &y);
    if (command == 0) {
      unite(x, y);
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", is_same(x, y));
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
