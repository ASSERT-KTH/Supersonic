This C++ program is a simple implementation of a union-find data structure, also known as a disjoint-set data structure. This data structure is useful in solving problems that involve dividing elements into sets and querying whether elements are in the same set.

There is not much room for optimization in this code as it is already quite efficient. The time complexity of the union and find operations are nearly linear (technically, they perform in near constant time, thanks to a technique called path compression). The space complexity is also linear, which is the best we can achieve since we need to store all elements.

However, we can make a few minor improvements:

1. Code Analysis: The given code is using "scanf" and "printf" for input and output. While there's nothing inherently wrong with these functions, they do tend to be slower compared to I/O functions in C++ like "cin" and "cout". Furthermore, the code uses dynamic memory allocation with "new" keyword, which is slower than static memory allocation.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    1. Replace "scanf" and "printf" with "cin" and "cout", and use ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL) to speed up cin/cout.
    2. Use vector instead of dynamically allocating memory with new. This makes the code safer (no need to manually deallocate memory) and potentially faster (due to better cache locality).
    3. Use inline functions (or let the compiler decide with the auto keyword) for small functions like get_boss, is_same and unite. Inline functions can reduce function call overhead.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    1. The use of "cin" and "cout" with ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL) can significantly speed up I/O operations as it will stop C++ from syncing with the C standard I/O library.
    2. Using vector instead of dynamic memory allocation makes code safer as it reduces chances of memory leaks. Also, vector is cache friendly. Thus, it can speed up access time.
    3. Inline functions are a suggestion to the compiler to insert the code of a function into the code of its callers at the point where the function is called. If this is done, it saves the overhead of a function call.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int N;
vector<int> boss, height;

inline int get_boss(int id) {
    return boss[id] == id ? id : boss[id] = get_boss(boss[id]);
}

inline bool is_same(int x, int y) {
    return get_boss(x) == get_boss(y);
}

inline void unite(int x, int y) {
    int boss_x = get_boss(x);
    int boss_y = get_boss(y);

    if (boss_x == boss_y) return;

    if (height[x] > height[y]) {
        boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
    } else if (height[x] < height[y]) {
        boss[boss_x] = boss_y;
    } else {
        boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
        height[x]++;
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int Q, command, x, y;
    cin >> N >> Q;

    boss.resize(N);
    height.resize(N);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        boss[i] = i;
        height[i] = 1;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
        cin >> command >> x >> y;
        if (command == 0) {
            unite(x, y);
        } else {
            cout << (is_same(x, y) ? 1 : 0) << "\n";
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```
