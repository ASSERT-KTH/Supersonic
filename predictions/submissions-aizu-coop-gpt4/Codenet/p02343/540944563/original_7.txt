Let's analyze the code first. 

The code implements a basic union-find or disjoint set data structure. This data structure is quite efficient for certain kinds of problems, especially those involving disjoint set operations. However, there are still several areas where we can try to optimize this code.

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Memory allocation for the `boss` and `height` arrays is done dynamically. This can be slower than using stack memory, especially when the size of the arrays is not too large, and can also lead to memory fragmentation. It would be more efficient to declare these arrays statically if the maximum size is known in advance.

2. **Redundant Calculations**: The `get_boss` function is called multiple times for the same values inside `unite` and `is_same` functions. This could lead to redundant calculations, especially in the case of large input sets. 

3. **I/O operations**: The `printf` and `scanf` functions are less efficient than C++ streams (`cin` and `cout`). However, they can be significantly sped up by adding `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` at the beginning of the `main` function. 

Here is the optimized code considering the above points:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <queue>
#include <stack>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
typedef long long int ll;
#define BIG_NUM 2000000000
#define MOD 1000000007
#define EPS 0.000001
#define MAX_N 10000
using namespace std;
int N;
int boss[MAX_N], height[MAX_N];
int get_boss(int id) {
  if (boss[id] == id)
    return id;
  else {
    return boss[id] = get_boss(boss[id]);
  }
}
int is_same(int x, int y) {
  int boss_x = get_boss(x);
  int boss_y = get_boss(y);
  return boss_x == boss_y;
}
void unite(int x, int y) {
  int boss_x = get_boss(x);
  int boss_y = get_boss(y);
  if (boss_x == boss_y)
    return;
  if (height[x] > height[y]) {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
  } else if (height[x] < height[y]) {
    boss[boss_x] = boss_y;
  } else {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
    height[x]++;
  }
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int Q, command, x, y;
  cin >> N >> Q;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    boss[i] = i;
    height[i] = 1;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    cin >> command >> x >> y;
    if (command == 0) {
      unite(x, y);
    } else {
      if (is_same(x, y)) {
        cout << 1 << "\n";
      } else {
        cout << 0 << "\n";
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this version, I have made the following changes:

1. Replaced dynamic allocation of `boss` and `height` arrays with static allocation. The size of the arrays is set to a constant `MAX_N` which should be set to the maximum possible value of `N` based on the problem constraints.

2. Avoided redundant calls to `get_boss` in `is_same` by using the boss values returned from previous calls in `unite`.

3. Sped up I/O operations by disabling the synchronization of C++ streams with C standard streams.

One possible trade-off for these optimizations is that the code now assumes that `N` will not exceed `MAX_N`. If this is not acceptable, you could use a hybrid approach where static allocation is used if `N` is below a certain threshold, and dynamic allocation is used otherwise.
