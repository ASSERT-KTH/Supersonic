This program appears to implement the disjoint-set data structure, also known as a union-find data structure. It supports two operations: uniting two sets and checking if two elements belong to the same set. The program does this using a union-by-rank and path compression scheme, which is generally efficient.

Here are some potential optimizations:

1. **Memory management**: Using raw pointers with `new` and not freeing them with `delete` can lead to memory leaks. We can replace raw pointers with std::vector which automatically manages memory. This won't directly improve runtime performance, but it makes the code safer and easier to maintain.

2. **Data reading**: `scanf` and `printf` are slower compare to cin and cout in c++. So, for faster input/output, you can use cin and cout with ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL).

3. **Function inlining**: The functions `get_boss`, `is_same`, and `unite` are small and called frequently. It can be beneficial to declare them inline, which suggests to the compiler that it should attempt to embed these functions' code in place of the actual function call, eliminating the overhead of a function call.

4. **Reduce unnecessary calls**: In the `unite` function, there are unnecessary calls to `get_boss`. When `height[x]` equals `height[y]`, it calls `get_boss` again which is not needed.

5. **Constant variables**: Variables like `BIG_NUM`, `MOD` and `EPS` are not used in the code and can be removed.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <queue>
#include <stack>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int N;
vector<int> boss, height;

inline int get_boss(int id) {
  if (boss[id] == id)
    return id;
  else {
    return boss[id] = get_boss(boss[id]);
  }
}

inline int is_same(int x, int y) { return get_boss(x) == get_boss(y); }

inline void unite(int x, int y) {
  int boss_x = get_boss(x);
  int boss_y = get_boss(y);
  if (boss_x == boss_y)
    return;
  if (height[x] > height[y]) {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
  } else if (height[x] < height[y]) {
    boss[boss_x] = boss_y;
  } else {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
    height[x]++;
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int Q, command, x, y;
  cin >> N >> Q;
  boss.resize(N);
  height.resize(N);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    boss[i] = i;
    height[i] = 1;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    cin >> command >> x >> y;
    if (command == 0) {
      unite(x, y);
    } else {
      if (is_same(x, y)) {
        cout << "1\n";
      } else {
        cout << "0\n";
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs: These optimizations mainly improve the code's clarity and maintainability rather than improving runtime performance. The performance gain from function inlining and reducing unnecessary function calls might not be significant, as the compiler often does similar optimizations automatically. Furthermore, function inlining might increase the compiled code's size, which could potentially cause cache misses and slow down the program. However, in this case, the functions are very small, so the impact should be minimal.
