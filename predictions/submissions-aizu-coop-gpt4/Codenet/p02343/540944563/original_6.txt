The provided code implements the union-find data structure (also known as disjoint-set data structure) that is used to keep track of a partition of a set into disjoint subsets. It provides operations for adding new sets, merging sets (replacing them by their union), and finding a representative member of a set. The most common scenario where this data structure is used is for managing partitions of elements where we are interested in knowing, for each element, which subset it belongs to, or whether two elements are in the same subset.

Here are the performance optimization strategies for the code:

1. **Compiler Optimizations**: Enabling compiler optimizations will allow the compiler to perform code optimizations that can significantly speed up the execution time. For GCC, the `-O2` or `-O3` flag can be used to enable optimizations.
2. **Inlining small functions**: The `get_boss`, `is_same`, and `unite` functions make simple computations and can be inlined to avoid the overhead of function calls. This can be achieved by adding the `inline` keyword before the function definitions.
3. **Avoiding unnecessary computations**: In the `unite` function, we are retrieving the boss of `x` and `y` twice. These computations can be saved to variables and reused.
4. **Memory Allocation**: The memory allocated for the `boss` and `height` arrays is not freed after use. This can cause a memory leak in case the function is called multiple times.

After applying the optimizations, the optimized code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
typedef int bool;
#define true 1
#define false 0

int N;
int *boss, *height;

inline int get_boss(int id) {
  return boss[id] == id ? id : (boss[id] = get_boss(boss[id]));
}

inline bool is_same(int x, int y) {
  return get_boss(x) == get_boss(y);
}

inline void unite(int x, int y) {
  int boss_x = get_boss(x);
  int boss_y = get_boss(y);

  if (boss_x != boss_y) {
    if (height[boss_x] > height[boss_y]) {
      boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
    } else {
      boss[boss_x] = boss_y;
      if (height[boss_x] == height[boss_y]) {
        height[boss_y]++;
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int Q, command, x, y;
  scanf("%d %d", &N, &Q);
  boss = (int*)malloc(N * sizeof(int));
  height = (int*)malloc(N * sizeof(int));
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    boss[i] = i;
    height[i] = 0;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d %d", &command, &x, &y);
    if (command == 0) {
      unite(x, y);
    } else {
      printf(is_same(x, y) ? "1\n" : "0\n");
    }
  }
  
  free(boss);
  free(height);

  return 0;
}
```

The trade-off in this situation is that the code becomes slightly more complex with the use of ternary operators and inline functions. However, the performance gain by avoiding function call overheads and unnecessary computations is significant. Moreover, using malloc and free instead of new and delete can help avoid memory leaks.
