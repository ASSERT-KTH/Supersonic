**Code Analysis:**
The given code represents a basic implementation of Union-Find data structure, often used for disjoint set operations. The primary operations provided are `get_boss` (Find operation), `unite` (Union operation), and `is_same` (Connected check). The code reads from standard input the number of elements `N` and the number of operations `Q`, then executes each operation based on the input.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Inefficient Data Structures**: The data structures used here are efficient for the purpose of this code.

2. **Redundant Computation**: In the `unite` function, the `get_boss` is called twice for both `x` and `y`, which can be avoided.

3. **Loops/Recursions**: The `get_boss` function uses recursion to find the representative of a set, which can lead to deep recursion calls in a worst-case scenario. This can be optimized using path compression technique.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: We can use Fast I/O techniques to expedite input and output operations.

**Optimization Steps:**

1. **Path Compression in `get_boss` function**: Instead of just returning the representative of a set, we can make every node in the path from `id` to root point directly to the root. This will flatten the tree, making future operations faster.

2. **Avoid Redundant `get_boss` calls**: In the `unite` function, we can store the result of `get_boss` calls for `x` and `y` in variables and use those in the subsequent conditions, avoiding the need for calling `get_boss` again.

3. **Fast I/O**: Replace `scanf` and `printf` with faster alternatives, like `std::cin` and `std::cout`, and use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` for faster cin and cout operations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int N;
vector<int> boss, height;

int get_boss(int id) {
  if (boss[id] != id)
    boss[id] = get_boss(boss[id]);
  return boss[id];
}

void unite(int x, int y) {
  int boss_x = get_boss(x);
  int boss_y = get_boss(y);

  if (boss_x == boss_y)
    return;

  if (height[x] > height[y]) {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
  } else {
    if (height[x] == height[y])
      height[x]++;
    boss[boss_x] = boss_y;
  }
}

bool is_same(int x, int y) {
  return get_boss(x) == get_boss(y);
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int Q, command, x, y;
  cin >> N >> Q;

  boss.resize(N);
  height.resize(N, 1);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    boss[i] = i;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    cin >> command >> x >> y;
    if (command == 0) {
      unite(x, y);
    } else {
      cout << is_same(x, y) << "\n";
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Remember to properly deallocate the memory allocated using `new` in the original program. In the optimized version, I have used `vector` which automatically manages memory, so explicit deallocation is not required. However, if you stick with dynamically allocated arrays, make sure to deallocate them using `delete[]` to prevent memory leaks.
