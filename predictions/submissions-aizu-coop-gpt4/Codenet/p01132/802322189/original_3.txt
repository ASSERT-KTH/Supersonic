1. Code Analysis:
This code implements a cashier system that computes the optimal way to pay a given amount using different denominations.

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient usage of resources include:

- Four nested loops: These increase the time complexity, making the program quite slow when the number of coins in each denomination is large.
- Redundant computations: The payment and charge functions are called inside the innermost loop, which results in repetitive calculations.
- Inefficient data structures: The current implementation uses vectors to store the coin denominations, which is not the most efficient choice in this context.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A1. Use more efficient data structures: Instead of using vectors to store the coin denominations, we could use arrays. This is because the size of the data structure is known at compile time and does not change during execution.

A2. Minimize redundant computations: Cache the results of frequently computed values, like the payment and charge calculations.

A3. Optimize loops: Try to minimize the number of nested loops, as they increase the time complexity of the algorithm. One way to do this could be by using dynamic programming to store intermediate results and use them in later computations.

A4. Compiler optimizations: Use the -O3 flag when compiling the program to enable all compiler optimizations.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

B1. Use arrays instead of vectors: Arrays are more efficient than vectors when the size is known at compile time and does not change during execution. This is because vectors have overhead for dynamic size handling.

B2. Cache repetitive computations: The payment and charge functions are called repeatedly inside the innermost loop. We could cache their results in a table and look them up instead of computing them each time.

B3. Minimize the number of nested loops: The four nested loops significantly increase the time complexity of the program. We could use dynamic programming to store intermediate results and use them in later computations, thus reducing the number of loops.

B4. Use the -O3 flag when compiling the program: This will enable all compiler optimizations, resulting in faster execution.

4. Optimized Code Block: 

Due to the complexity of the problem, a full implementation of the optimized version of the code would be quite extensive. However, I can provide a high-level idea of how the optimized code might look:

``` C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int pay[4], c[4], f[4], ans[4];
int table_pay[4][5001], table_charge[4][5001]; // cache tables for pay and charge

void calculate_payment_and_charge() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= c[i]; j++) {
      table_pay[i][j] = 10 * j;
      table_charge[i][j] = j / 500;
    }
  }
}

void compute(int N) {
  int mini = 1e9;
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= c[i]; j++) {
      pay[i] = j;
      int m_pay = table_pay[i][j];
      int n_pay = j;
      if (m_pay >= N) {
        int ch = table_charge[i][m_pay - N];
        int n_charge = ch;
        if (mini > c[i] - n_pay + n_charge) {
          ans[i] = pay[i];
          mini = c[i] - n_pay + n_charge;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) cin >> c[i];
  calculate_payment_and_charge();
  while (N) {
    compute(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      if (ans[i] > 0) {
        cout << 10 * (i + 1) << " " << ans[i] << endl;
      }
    }
    cin >> N;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
