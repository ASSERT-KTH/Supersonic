This program reads in a string and a number `m` from the user, then reads `m` numbers and sums them up as `t`. Finally, it prints the string shifted by `t` places. 

The main areas where optimization can be applied are:

1. Avoiding unnecessary calls to `strlen`: The function `strlen` is called for each input string to store the length of the string in variable `a`. This operation is expensive as it has to traverse the entire string. Instead, we can store the length of the string once after reading it.

2. Reducing I/O operations: The I/O operations are usually a major source of performance bottlenecks. Here, `printf` is called in a loop to print each character separately. Instead, we can shift the string first and then output the entire string at once.

3. Compiler optimizations: The use of `-O3` compiler flag can also help in further optimizing the code.

The optimized code would look like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int i, m, h, t, a;

int main() {
    char s[201], temp;
    while (scanf("%s%d", s, &m), s[0] != '-') {
        a = strlen(s);
        for (i = t = 0; i < m; scanf("%d", &h), t += h, i++)
            ;
        t %= a;
        while (t--) {
            temp = s[0];
            for (i = 0; i < a - 1; i++)
                s[i] = s[i + 1];
            s[a - 1] = temp;
        }
        puts(s);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In the optimized version, the `strlen` function is called only once per input string. The string is shifted in place and the entire string is printed at once using `puts`. Also note the use of `t %= a;` which helps in reducing the number of rotations when `t` is larger than `a`. This may increase code complexity slightly, but it significantly improves the performance.
