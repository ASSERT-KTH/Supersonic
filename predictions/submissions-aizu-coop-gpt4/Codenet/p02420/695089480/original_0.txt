The provided C code reads a string `s` and an integer `m` from the standard input. It then reads `m` integers, sums them up, and stores the result in `t`. Finally, it uses `t` to rotate the string `s` and prints the result.

### Code Analysis
The code is relatively efficient, but there are some parts that can be optimized:
1. Multiple global variables are being used which are not necessary.
2. The code is lacking in readability due to the absence of function and variable names that clearly signify their purpose.
3. The usage of `strlen(s)` inside the loop can be avoided as this length will not change through the iterations.

### Optimization Strategy
1. Use meaningful variable names and local variables where possible.
2. Avoid calling `strlen()` multiple times.
3. Use `fputs()` instead of `puts("")` to avoid the overhead of finding the end of the string.
4. Use preincrement instead of postincrement to avoid temporary object creation.

### Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Remove global variables `i`, `m`, `h`, `t`, and `a`. Declare them inside `main()` where they'll be used.
2. Rename `s` to `input_string`, `m` to `num_shifts`, `h` to `shift`, `t` to `total_shift`, and `a` to `string_length` for clarity.
3. Calculate `strlen(input_string)` once and store the result in `string_length`.
4. Use `fputs("\n", stdout)` instead of `puts("")` as it avoids the overhead of finding the end of the string.
5. Use preincrement whenever possible to avoid the creation of temporary objects. This applies to the loops iterating over `num_shifts` and `string_length`.

### Optimized Code Block

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  char input_string[201];
  while (scanf("%s", input_string), input_string[0] != '-') {
    int num_shifts;
    scanf("%d", &num_shifts);
    
    int string_length = strlen(input_string);
    int total_shift = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_shifts; ++i) {
      int shift;
      scanf("%d", &shift);
      total_shift += shift;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < string_length; ++i) {
      printf("%c", input_string[(total_shift + i) % string_length]);
    }

    fputs("\n", stdout);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code makes the program more readable and slightly more efficient by removing unnecessary global variables, reducing the number of function calls, and using preincrement operators. It also maintains the functionality of the original code.
