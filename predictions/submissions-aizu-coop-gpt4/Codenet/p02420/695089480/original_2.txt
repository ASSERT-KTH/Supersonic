Code Analysis:
This C program reads a string and a number m from the input. Then, it reads m numbers, summarizing them to the variable t. After that, it prints the characters of the string in a certain order determined by the sum t and the size of the string. There is no apparent memory leak or operations that would significantly degrade the performance. However, the code has a few areas that can be enhanced to improve readability, maintainability, and potentially performance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use meaningful variable names: The variable names i, m, h, t, a, and s are not descriptive. Using meaningful names would make the code more readable and maintainable.
2. Avoid global variables: The variables i, m, h, t, and a are declared as global variables, which can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs in larger programs. It's better to limit their scope by declaring them where they are used.
3. Use appropriate types: The function main does not have a return type and no return statement. This is not good practice. The main function should return int and end with a return statement.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replacing variable names: The new names would be as follows: i -> num_loops, m -> num_rotations, h -> rotation_value, t -> total_rotations, a -> str_length, s -> str. This will make the code more readable and understandable.
2. Moving variable declarations: All variables except 'str' will be moved inside the main function, restricting their scope and making the code more maintainable.
3. Adding a return type and return statement to main: The main function will be declared to return int and end with a return 0 statement. This is considered good practice in C.

Optimized Code Block:
```C
#include <string.h> 

int main() {
  char str[201];
  int num_loops, num_rotations, rotation_value, total_rotations, str_length;
  for (; scanf("%s%d", str, &num_rotations), str[0] != '-'; puts("")) {
    str_length = strlen(str);
    for (num_loops = total_rotations = 0; num_loops < num_rotations; scanf("%d", &rotation_value), total_rotations += rotation_value, num_loops++)
      ;
    for (num_loops = 0; num_loops < str_length; printf("%c", str[(total_rotations + num_loops++) % str_length]))
      ;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This code maintains the same functionality as the original code, but it's more readable, maintainable, and potentially more efficient due to local scope of the variables.
