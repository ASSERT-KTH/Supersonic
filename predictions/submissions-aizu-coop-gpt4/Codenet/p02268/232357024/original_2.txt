Code Analysis:
The given code is C++ code that reads an array of integers, and then performs binary searches on the array for a number of specified queries. The array is not sorted before performing searches, which can lead to incorrect results since binary search requires a sorted array. Moreover, the binary search is performed for each query from the beginning, which can be inefficient if the array is large and the number of queries is also large.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The array should be sorted before performing binary searches. This will ensure that the binary search algorithm works correctly.
2. The binary search algorithm can be further optimized by early exiting if the searched value is not within the range of the array.
3. The binary search can be implemented as a function. This will make the code more structured and easier to maintain.
4. If the array is large and the number of queries is also large, it may be more efficient to use a data structure that supports faster search operations, such as std::set or std::unordered_set. These data structures are implemented as binary search trees and hash tables, respectively, and provide O(log n) and average O(1) search complexity.
5. Standard input/output functions (scanf, printf) are faster than their counterparts in C++ (cin, cout). We can use them to speed up input/output operations.

Optimized Code:
```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>

// Function to perform binary search
bool binarySearch(int arr[], int left, int right, int x) {
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == x)
            return true;
        if (arr[mid] < x)
            left = mid + 1;
        else
            right = mid - 1;
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    int S[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        scanf("%d", &S[i]);
    }

    // Sort the array before performing binary search
    std::sort(S, S + n);

    int cnt = 0;
    int q;
    scanf("%d", &q);
    for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
        int T;
        scanf("%d", &T);
        // Perform binary search only if T is within the range of the array
        if (T >= S[0] && T <= S[n - 1] && binarySearch(S, 0, n - 1, T)) {
            ++cnt;
        }
    }
    printf("%d\n", cnt);
    return 0;
}
```
Explanation:
In the optimized code, we first sort the array before performing binary searches. This ensures that the binary search algorithm works correctly. We also move the binary search into a separate function to make the code more structured and easier to maintain. For each query, we first check if the searched value is within the range of the array. If it is, we perform the binary search; otherwise, we skip the search. This can speed up the search operation for some queries. Finally, we use the standard input/output functions (scanf, printf) instead of their C++ counterparts (cin, cout) to speed up input/output operations. These changes make the code more efficient and easier to understand and maintain.
