This program performs binary search for each of the q queries on an integer array of size n. The cnt variable keeps track of successful queries. The code is correct, but there are a few areas that could be optimized.

Let's start with code analysis:

1. Dynamic array allocation in C++ can be slow and prone to fragmentation. In this case, an array S of size n is dynamically allocated. 

2. The mid variable is recalculated in each iteration of the while loop, even when it's not necessary.

3. The use of scanf and printf for input and output operations is slower compared to cin and cout.

Here's the optimization plan:

1. Replace dynamic array with std::vector. std::vector in C++ is more efficient than a dynamically allocated array because it manages memory allocation and reallocation automatically.

2. Move the calculation of mid to the places where right or left changes.

3. Use cin and cout for input and output operations instead of scanf and printf, and use '\n' instead of endl as endl forces a flush operation which can slow down the program.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> S(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> S[i];
  }
  int cnt = 0;
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    int left = 0;
    int right = n;
    int mid = (right + left) / 2;
    while (left < right) {
      if (T > S[mid]) {
        left = mid + 1;
        mid = (right + left) / 2;
      } else if (T < S[mid]) {
        right = mid;
        mid = (right + left) / 2;
      } else {
        ++cnt;
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << cnt << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

The trade-off in this optimization is that the code is slightly more complex due to the addition of vector and ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); statements, but the performance gain is significant.
