Code Analysis:

This program is a typical example of a binary search algorithm. It reads an array of integers from the input, and for each query, it checks if the queried number is present in the array. If the number is found, the count is incremented. It returns the total count of found numbers at the end.

Potential performance bottlenecks:

1. Variable-Length Array: The code uses a variable-length array, which is not a standard C++ feature and can cause stack overflow for large inputs. It's also less efficient than dynamic memory allocation.

2. I/O operations: The code uses scanf and cout for reading and writing data. These functions can be slower than other I/O functions.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use std::vector instead of Variable-Length Array: The std::vector class is a safer and more flexible alternative to C-style arrays. It manages its own memory, so we don't have to worry about causing a stack overflow. 

2. Use fast I/O operations: Replace scanf and cout with fast I/O operations to reduce the I/O time. We can use std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(NULL), and cout.tie(NULL) to speed up I/O operations.

3. Use std::binary_search instead of manual implementation: The C++ STL provides an implementation of the binary search algorithm that is likely to be more optimized than a manual implementation.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace variable-length array with std::vector: This change is relatively straightforward. We simply declare a std::vector<int> instead of an array and use its member functions to manipulate it. This will prevent stack overflow and increase the flexibility of our code.

2. Use fast I/O operations: By calling std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(NULL), and cout.tie(NULL), we disable the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams, which can significantly speed up I/O operations.

3. Use std::binary_search: This function is a part of the C++ Standard Library and is likely to be more optimized than the manual binary search implemented in the provided code. It also simplifies the code, making it easier to read and maintain.

Optimized Code Block:
```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> S(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> S[i];
  }
  
  int cnt = 0;
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    if (binary_search(S.begin(), S.end(), T)) {
      ++cnt;
    }
  }
  
  cout << cnt << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code should have the same functionality as the original code, but it should be more efficient, safer, and easier to read and maintain.
