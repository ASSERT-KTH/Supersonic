The provided C++ program reads two arrays of integers from the user, and checks how many elements of the second array are present in the first array using binary search. The program is already quite efficient, but there are a few areas where we can improve it:

1. **Avoid using Variable Length Arrays (VLAs)**: The C++ standard does not support Variable Length Arrays. It is better to use std::vector which dynamically allocates memory.

2. **Use of std::cin and std::cout instead of scanf and printf**: The C++ standard library provides the iostream library which is more type safe and easier to use.

3. **Avoid recalculating mid inside the while loop**: Currently, the mid index is recalculated in each iteration of the while loop, even when it hasn't changed. We can move the calculation to the end of the loop to avoid unnecessary computations.

4. **Use of std::binary_search instead of manual implementation**: The C++ STL provides a binary_search function which performs the same operation as the current binary search implementation. This function is highly optimized and using it can simplify the code.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<int> S(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cin >> S[i];
    }
    int cnt = 0;
    int q;
    std::cin >> q;
    for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
        int T;
        std::cin >> T;
        if(std::binary_search(S.begin(), S.end(), T)) {
            ++cnt;
        }
    }
    std::cout << cnt << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code is more readable and maintainable. It uses the standard C++ library to perform binary search, which is simpler and less error-prone than manually implementing the algorithm. Also, it uses std::cin and std::cout for standard I/O operations, which are more idiomatic in C++. The use of std::vector instead of a C-style array is safer and more flexible, allowing for dynamic resizing.
