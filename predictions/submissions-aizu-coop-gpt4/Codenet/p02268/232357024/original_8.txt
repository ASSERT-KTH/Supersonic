The provided code is a simple program that reads a sequence of numbers, and for each query, it checks if the query number is in the sequence using binary search. The code then outputs the total number of successful queries. The binary search is efficient for large inputs, however, there are still some potential optimization points that we can apply:

1. Unnecessary IO operations: The usage of scanf and printf is slower than cin and cout in C++. We can speed up the cin and cout operations by using synchronization with stdio as false and untie as null. 

2. Using Variable Length Array: In C++, variable-length arrays are not part of the standard and not recommended. Instead, we can use std::vector which is safer and provides dynamic sizing.

3. Unnecessary calculations during binary search: The mid-point calculation can be optimized by using bit-wise operators which are faster than arithmetic operations. And this calculation can be performed inside the while loop only when the left and right indices have been updated.

4. Use of auto keyword: When the type of the variable is clear from the context, we can use the auto keyword to let the compiler deduce the type of the variable. This can make the code cleaner and easier to read without affecting performance.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> S(n);
  for (auto& num : S) {
    cin >> num;
  }

  int cnt = 0;
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    int T;
    cin >> T;

    int left = 0, right = n;
    while (left < right) {
      int mid = left + ((right - left) >> 1);
      if (T > S[mid]) {
        left = mid + 1;
      } else if (T < S[mid]) {
        right = mid;
      } else {
        ++cnt;
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  cout << cnt << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the IO operations are made faster by disabling synchronization with stdio and untie. The array S is replaced with a std::vector for safer memory handling. The mid-point calculation is now done by using bit-wise operators inside the while loop after updating the left and right indices. And finally, the 'auto' keyword is used in the for loop to let the compiler deduce the type of the variable.
