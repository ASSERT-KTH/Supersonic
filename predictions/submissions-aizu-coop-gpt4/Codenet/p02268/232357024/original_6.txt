Code Analysis:
The given C/C++ program performs a binary search operation on an array of integers. The length of the array and its elements are read from the standard input. Then, it accepts a number of queries and for each query, it performs binary search on the array. If it finds the queried number, it increments a counter. Finally, it prints the count of successful searches.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. The binary search is performed from scratch for each query. This could be a potential performance bottleneck if the number of queries is large.
2. The use of standard I/O functions like scanf and cout could slow the program down.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Unnecessary Computations: As the binary search is performed from scratch for each query, we can optimize this by using a data structure that supports faster search operations, such as a hash set (unordered_set in C++ STL). This would bring down the search operation to O(1) complexity.
2. I/O Operations: We can use faster I/O operations in C++ by avoiding cin/cout and using faster alternatives like scanf/printf or using cin/cout with std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL).
3. Memory Usage: In the current scenario, memory usage is optimal, and we would not need to optimize it further.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  unordered_set<int> S;
  int temp;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &temp);
    S.insert(temp);
  }
  int cnt = 0;
  int q;
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    int T;
    scanf("%d", &T);
    if (S.find(T) != S.end()) {
      ++cnt;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", cnt);
  return 0;
}
```

Step-by-step Explanation:
1. We have replaced the dynamic array with an unordered_set. This is because unordered_set in C++ STL is implemented as a hash table that provides constant time insertion and search operations on average.
2. The elements are now inserted into the unordered_set instead of the array.
3. For each query, now instead of performing binary search on the array, we simply check if the queried number is present in the unordered_set. This operation is performed in constant time.
4. We have replaced the use of cout with printf for faster I/O operation.

Trade-offs:
1. unordered_set uses more memory than a simple array because of the additional data and overhead required for maintaining the hash table.
2. The order of elements is not maintained in unordered_set, which is not a problem in this case as we are only interested in the presence of elements.
3. Using unordered_set makes the code a bit more complex and harder to understand for beginners compared to the simple binary search on array.

The performance of the program is significantly improved with these changes, especially when the number of queries is large. The time complexity of each query is reduced from O(log n) to O(1).
