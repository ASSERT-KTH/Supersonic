Code Analysis:
This program reads an array of integers and then reads a series of queries. For each query, it executes a binary search on the array and increments a counter if the queried value is found. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use std::vector instead of C-style arrays: The code currently uses a C-style array. Switching to std::vector is more efficient because it can grow and shrink dynamically, which can eliminate the need for an explicit size declaration. 

2. Use std::cin and std::cout instead of scanf and printf: The C++ iostream library is more type safe and object-oriented, which may lead to more efficient code.

3. Reduce unnecessary computations: The mid value is computed twice in each loop, once before the loop and once at the end. We can eliminate the duplicate computation by only calculating mid at the beginning of each loop iteration.

4. Use std::binary_search: Instead of implementing the binary search manually, we can use the built-in std::binary_search function, which may be optimized by the compiler.

Here are the steps for the optimization:

1. Replace the C-style array with std::vector.
2. Replace scanf and printf with std::cin and std::cout.
3. Eliminate the duplicate mid computation in the binary search loop.
4. Use std::binary_search for the search operation.

Trade-offs:
The proposed optimizations are straightforward and don't entail significant trade-offs. However, the use of std::binary_search could be seen as making the code more abstract and less transparent to someone unfamiliar with the standard library.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> S(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> S[i];
  }
  int cnt = 0;
  int q;
  std::cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    int T;
    std::cin >> T;
    if (std::binary_search(S.begin(), S.end(), T)) {
      ++cnt;
    }
  }
  std::cout << cnt << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation:
In the optimized code, we replaced the C-style array with std::vector, which is more idiomatic in C++. We also replaced scanf and printf with std::cin and std::cout for the same reason.

The main optimization is in the binary search loop. The original code calculated the mid value twice in each iteration, which was redundant. In the optimized code, we use the std::binary_search function from the standard library, which eliminates this redundancy and may be more efficient due to compiler optimizations. It also simplifies the code, making it easier to read and understand.
