This C++ program is performing a binary search on an integer array `S` for a number of queries `q`. The number of successful searches is counted and printed at the end. The code is already quite efficient given that it is implementing a binary search, which is a highly efficient algorithm (O(log n)) for searching a sorted array. However, there are some improvements that can be made:

1. **Code Analysis**:

    The primary performance issue here is the usage of scanf and printf for input/output operations. These are considerably slower than their C++ counterparts, cin and cout. Another improvement can be on variable declaration, as declaring them inside the loop is not efficient.

2. **Optimization Strategy**:

    - **Input/Output Operations**: Replace scanf and printf with cin and cout for better performance.
    - **Variable Declaration**: Declare variables outside the loop to avoid re-declaration at each iteration.
    - **Compiler Optimizations**: Use optimization flags when compiling the code. For example, the `-O2` flag in g++ enables all optimization flags.

3. **Step-by-step Explanation**:

    - **Input/Output Operations**: By replacing scanf and printf with cin and cout, we are making use of the faster input/output operations provided by C++. This can significantly reduce the running time of the program when dealing with large inputs.
    - **Variable Declaration**: By declaring the variables outside the loop, we are reducing the overhead of variable declaration at each iteration. This can result in a slight performance improvement.
    - **Compiler Optimizations**: By using compiler optimization flags, we can allow the compiler to optimize the code for better performance. This can result in significant improvements, especially in larger programs.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> S(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> S[i];
    }

    int cnt = 0;
    int q, T, left, right, mid;
    cin >> q;

    for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
        cin >> T;
        left = 0;
        right = n;
        mid = (right + left) / 2;

        while (left < right) {
            if (T > S[mid]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else if (T < S[mid]) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                ++cnt;
                break;
            }
            mid = (right + left) / 2;
        }
    }
    cout << cnt << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
When compiling this code, use the `-O2` flag to enable optimizations:

`g++ -O2 my_program.cpp`
