Code Analysis:

The provided code is implementing Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph. The main components of the code are the creation of the graph, the implementation of the algorithm using a priority queue, and the output of the shortest distances.

Potential performance bottlenecks:

1. The use of the `std::vector` data structure for storing edges: While vectors provide dynamic sizing, they can cause overhead when resizing frequently. Moreover, accessing elements in a vector using the operator [] does not perform any bounds checking, leading to potential issues.

2. The priority queue operations: The main loop of the algorithm involves operations on a priority queue, which can be expensive.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Data Structures: Instead of using vectors for storing edges, consider using an adjacency list representation of the graph, which can be more memory efficient. The adjacency list can be implemented using a standard array or std::array for fixed-size graphs, which offer better performance due to less overhead.

2. Redundant Computations: In the main loop of the algorithm, the code computes `d[G[nv][i].to]` and `G[nv][i].to` multiple times. Save these computations in local variables to avoid redundancy.

3. Loop optimization: Use C++11 range-based for loop to iterate over the edges. This can make the code more readable and prevent potential issues with index-based access.

4. Compiler optimizations: Use compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` for optimization.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace `vector<edge> G[100000];` with `array<vector<edge>, 100000> G;`. This changes the graph's data structure to an adjacency list represented by an array of vectors. This change optimizes memory usage and provides better performance due to less overhead.

2. Inside the main while loop, save the computations of `d[G[nv][i].to]` and `G[nv][i].to` in local variables. This avoids repeated computations and improves performance.

3. Replace the traditional for loop iterating over the edges with a range-based for loop. This makes the code more readable and prevents potential issues with index-based access.

4. Compile the code with the `-O2` or `-O3` flag for optimization. This allows the compiler to perform optimizations like loop unrolling and function inlining, improving the code's performance.

Trade-offs:

The proposed optimizations aim to improve performance and memory usage. However, they might increase the code's complexity slightly, especially when using compiler flags for optimization. The optimized code might be harder to debug due to compiler optimizations.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <queue>
#include <array>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 1000000000;

struct edge {
  int to, cost;
};

array<vector<edge>, 100000> G;
int v, e, r;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
priority_queue<P, vector<P>, greater<P>> q;

int main() {
  scanf("%d %d %d", &v, &e, &r);
  for (int i = 0; i < e; i++) {
    int s, t, d;
    scanf("%d %d %d", &s, &t, &d);
    G[s].push_back(edge{t, d});
  }

  vector<int> d(v, INF);
  d[r] = 0;
  q.push(P(0, r));

  while (!q.empty()) {
    P p = q.top();
    q.pop();
    int nv = p.second;
    if (p.first > d[nv])
      continue;

    // Use range-based for loop and avoid repeated computations
    for (auto &e : G[nv]) {
      int next_vertex = e.to;
      int new_dist = d[nv] + e.cost;
      if (new_dist < d[next_vertex]) {
        d[next_vertex] = new_dist;
        q.push(P(new_dist, next_vertex));
      }
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < v; i++) {
    if (d[i] == INF)
      printf("INF\n");
    else
      printf("%d\n", d[i]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code maintains the functionality of the original code while improving memory efficiency and computation redundancy. It also takes advantage of compiler optimization flags and C++11 features for better performance.
