Code Analysis:
This program is implementing Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a source node to all nodes in a graph. The graph is represented as an adjacency list. A priority queue is used to always select the node with the smallest distance.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. The priority queue is used in an inefficient way. Each time a shorter distance to a node is found, a new pair is pushed into the queue even if there is already a pair with the same node in the queue.
2. The program uses dynamic arrays (vectors) to store the adjacency list of the graph. While vectors are versatile, they are not the most efficient data structure for this use case.
3. The program uses a lot of unnecessary temporary variables.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Optimize the use of the priority queue. Instead of pushing a new pair into the queue each time a shorter distance to a node is found, update the existing pair in the queue.
2. Use a more efficient data structure to store the adjacency list of the graph.
3. Eliminate unnecessary temporary variables.
4. Use fast input/output methods to further improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Optimize the use of the priority queue: The current approach can lead to a lot of unnecessary operations because the same node can appear multiple times in the queue. This can be solved by checking whether the distance to a node has been updated since it was added to the queue. If the distance has been updated, the node can be ignored when it is taken from the queue.
2. Use a more efficient data structure for the adjacency list: Instead of using a vector of vectors to store the adjacency list, use an array of linked lists. This will make adding and accessing elements more efficient because no dynamic resizing is required.
3. Eliminate unnecessary temporary variables: Instead of creating a temporary edge variable, add the edge directly to the adjacency list.
4. Use fast input/output methods: The current input/output methods are slow and can be a bottleneck in a program that processes a lot of data. Use faster methods to improve performance.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <list>
#define INF 1000000000
using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> P;

struct edge {
  int to, cost;
};

list<edge> G[100000];
int v, e, r;
priority_queue<P, vector<P>, greater<P>> q;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cin >> v >> e >> r;
  for (int i = 0; i < e; i++) {
    int s, t, d;
    cin >> s >> t >> d;
    G[s].push_back({t, d}); // Directly add the edge to the list
  }
  vector<int> d(v, INF);
  d[r] = 0;
  q.push(P(0, r));
  while (!q.empty()) {
    P p = q.top();
    q.pop();
    int nv = p.second;
    if (p.first > d[nv])
      continue;
    for (auto &e : G[nv]) {
      if (d[nv] + e.cost < d[e.to]) {
        d[e.to] = d[nv] + e.cost;
        q.push(P(d[e.to], e.to));
      }
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < v; i++) {
    if (d[i] == INF)
      cout << "INF\n";
    else
      cout << d[i] << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that this code requires C++11 or later to compile due to the use of auto and list initializer.
