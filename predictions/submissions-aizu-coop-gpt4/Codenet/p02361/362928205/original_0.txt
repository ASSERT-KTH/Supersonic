Here's an analysis of the provided code:

The code represents an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. It uses a priority queue to maintain nodes in the order of their shortest path distances from the start node. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace `std::vector` with `std::array` for fixed-size arrays.
2. Remove redundant or unnecessary computations.
3. Optimize the loops using cache-friendly accesses.
4. Use compiler optimizations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. The graph nodes are stored as vectors. For a fixed size graph, it's more efficient to use a `std::array` because it uses stack memory which is faster to access as compared to heap memory used by `std::vector`. 

2. In the main loop, the code checks `if (p.first > d[nv]) continue;`. This condition is unnecessary because it has already been checked when we are pushing into the queue.

3. The loop `for (int i = 0; i < G[nv].size(); i++)` can be optimized by using iterators instead of indices, which are more cache-friendly.

4. Compiler flags can be used to optimize the code, such as `-O3` for gcc compilers. 

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <queue>
#include <array>
using namespace std;

const int INF = 1000000000;

struct edge {
  int to, cost;
};

array<edge, 100000> G;
int v, e, r;

typedef pair<int, int> P;
priority_queue<P, vector<P>, greater<P>> q;

int main() {
  scanf("%d %d %d", &v, &e, &r);
  for (int i = 0; i < e; i++) {
    int s, t, d;
    scanf("%d %d %d", &s, &t, &d);
    G[s].push_back({t, d});
  }
  int d[v];
  fill(d, d + v, INF);
  d[r] = 0;
  q.push(P(0, r));
  while (!q.empty()) {
    P p = q.top();
    q.pop();
    int nv = p.second;
    for (auto it = G[nv].begin(); it != G[nv].end(); ++it) {
      if (d[nv] + it->cost < d[it->to]) {
        d[it->to] = d[nv] + it->cost;
        q.push(P(d[it->to], it->to));
      }
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < v; i++) {
    if (d[i] == INF)
      printf("INF\n");
    else
      printf("%d\n", d[i]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:

1. Using `std::array` instead of `std::vector` will limit the size of the graph to a fixed value, but it will speed up the code as it uses stack memory.
2. Using iterator instead of indices might make the code a bit less readable to some developers, but it's more efficient due to cache-friendliness.
3. Compiler optimizations can sometimes lead to unexpected results or make debugging difficult. But, they generally enhance the performance of the code significantly.
