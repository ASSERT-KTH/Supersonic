The given code is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths in a graph. It reads a graph from input, performs Dijkstra's algorithm, and then prints the shortest distances to all vertices from a source vertex. 

Here are some possible optimization strategies:

1. **Use `std::vector` instead of C-style array for distances**: C-style arrays such as `int d[v]` don't provide the same level of abstraction and safety as a `std::vector`. Also, the size of C-style arrays needs to be known at compile time, which is not the case here. Using `std::vector<int> d(v, INF);` would be better, and we can initialize all distances to `INF` at the same time.

2. **Avoid unnecessary pair creations**: In the main loop, there are unnecessary pair creations which can be avoided by directly using the data.

3. **Use `emplace` instead of `push`**: When adding a pair to the priority queue, instead of creating a pair and then pushing it, we can directly construct the pair in-place using `emplace`.

4. **Reduce the number of lookups in the adjacency list**: The adjacency list `G[nv][i]` is looked up multiple times in the while loop. We can store a reference to it to reduce the number of lookups.

Here is the optimized code with these changes:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int INF = 1000000000;

struct edge {
  int to, cost;
};

vector<edge> G[100000];
int v, e, r;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
priority_queue<P, vector<P>, greater<P>> q;

int main() {
  scanf("%d %d %d", &v, &e, &r);
  for (int i = 0; i < e; i++) {
    int s, t, d;
    scanf("%d %d %d", &s, &t, &d);
    G[s].push_back({t,d}); // push_back can take arguments for constructor
  }
  
  vector<int> d(v, INF); // change from C array to vector
  d[r] = 0;
  q.emplace(0, r); // use emplace instead of push
  
  while (!q.empty()) {
    P p = q.top();
    q.pop();
    int nv = p.second;
    if (p.first > d[nv])
      continue;
      
    for (const edge &e : G[nv]) { // use range-based for loop and reference to reduce lookups
      if (d[nv] + e.cost < d[e.to]) {
        d[e.to] = d[nv] + e.cost;
        q.emplace(d[e.to], e.to); // use emplace instead of push
      }
    }
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < v; i++) {
    if (d[i] == INF)
      printf("INF\n");
    else
      printf("%d\n", d[i]);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
These optimizations mainly improve the readability of the code and reduce the number of unnecessary operations, which can lead to a slight performance improvement. However, the complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm itself remains unchanged.
