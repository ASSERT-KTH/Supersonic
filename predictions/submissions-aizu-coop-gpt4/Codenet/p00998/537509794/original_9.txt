The provided code doesn't seem to have any glaring inefficiencies or performance bottlenecks. Given that, there are a few areas that we can still look into for optimization:

1. **Memory Management**: The code dynamically allocates memory for nodes in the `avl_tree` using the `new` keyword. There might be a potential memory leak as the code does not explicitly deallocate the memory using `delete`.

2. **Input/Output Operations**: The code uses `cin` and `printf` for input and output respectively. This inconsistency can be improved. Also, using the `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(0)` commands only really helps when mixing C++ and C-style I/O operations. Since we are not doing that in this code, these commands can be removed.

3. **Usage of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`**: This header file is actually not a standard library header. It is a GCC-specific include file that includes every standard library. This can slow down the compilation process and may not be portable across different compilers.

Optimization Strategy:

1. **Memory Management**: To avoid potential memory leaks, we can modify the `erase(node *t)` function to delete the node after its use.

2. **Input/Output Operations**: We can replace `printf` with `cout` to maintain consistency and readability in the code.

3. **Remove unnecessary headers**: We can replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the specific header files needed for the program to improve compilation time.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct RMQ {
  using type = int;
  static type id() { return INT_MAX; }
  static type op(type l, type r) { return min(l, r); }
};

template <typename M> class avl_tree {
  // same as original
  // ...
  
  node *erase(node *t) {
    if (!t)
      return t;
    if (!t->ch[0] && !t->ch[1]) {
      delete t;
      return nullptr;
    }
    if (!t->ch[0] || !t->ch[1]) {
      node *ret = t->ch[t->ch[0] == nullptr];
      delete t;
      return ret;
    }
    return fix(
        update(new node(find(t->ch[1], 0)->val, t->ch[0], erase(t->ch[1], 0))));
  }

  // same as original
  // ...
};

int main() {
  int n, q;
  cin >> n >> q;
  avl_tree<RMQ> tree;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    tree.insert(i, a);
  }
  while (q--) {
    int x, y, z;
    cin >> x >> y >> z;
    if (x == 0) {
      int val = tree.find(z);
      tree.erase(z);
      tree.insert(y, val);
    } else if (x == 1) {
      cout << tree.find(y, z + 1) << '\n';
    } else {
      tree.erase(y);
      tree.insert(y, z);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

All modifications are minimal and do not affect the functionality of the program. They also improve the readability and maintenance of the code. The only trade-off is the slight increase in code complexity due to the explicit memory management, but this is necessary to avoid potential memory leaks.
