1. Code Analysis:
The code appears to be a card game where the user inputs a number of cards that have been played (n), followed by the suit (S, H, C, D) and the number of each card. The code then outputs the cards that haven't been played. 

The main potential performance bottleneck in this code is the repetitive `if`-`else if` statements for each card suit in the input section, and the redundant for-loops in the output section. These sections can be optimized to reduce redundancy and improve performance.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Replace the `if`-`else if` statements with switch cases for faster execution.
    2. Use a single loop to print the unplayed cards instead of using separate loops for each suit.
    3. Use compiler optimization flags to allow the compiler to make code optimizations during the compilation process.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Replace `if`-`else if` statements with a `switch` case: The `switch` case has better performance than `if`-`else if` statements because it directly jumps to the matched case, while `if`-`else if` statements evaluate each condition sequentially. This change will improve performance when n is large.
    2. Single loop for printing unplayed cards: There is a lot of repetition in the section that prints the unplayed cards. This can be simplified by using a single loop that iterates over each suit, reducing the code size and making it easier to read and maintain.
    3. Compiler optimization flags: Using `-O2` or `-O3` flags during compilation will allow the compiler to make several code optimizations, such as loop unrolling or function inlining, to improve the performance of the code.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int Cards[4][14] = {{}};
  int i, j, n, Num;
  char Mark, suits[4] = {'S', 'H', 'C', 'D'};
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
    scanf(" %c", &Mark);
    scanf("%d", &Num);
    switch(Mark) {
    case 'S':
      Cards[0][Num - 1] = 1;
      break;
    case 'H':
      Cards[1][Num - 1] = 1;
      break;
    case 'C':
      Cards[2][Num - 1] = 1;
      break;
    case 'D':
      Cards[3][Num - 1] = 1;
      break;
    }
  }
  for(i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    for (j = 1; j < 14; j++) {
      if (Cards[i][j - 1] != 1) {
        printf("%c %d\n", suits[i], j);
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Remember to compile the C program with the `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flag. For example:
```bash
gcc -O2 card_game.c -o card_game
```
