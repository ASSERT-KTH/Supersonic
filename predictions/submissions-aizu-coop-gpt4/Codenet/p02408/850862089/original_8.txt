Code Analysis:
The given program reads from the input a number `n` and then 2*n times a character and a number, representing a card from a deck of cards. The character is the suit of the card ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D') and the number is the rank of the card (1-13). It then stores a 1 in a 2D array `Cards` to mark that card as present. Finally, it goes through each suit and each rank and if a card was not marked as present, it prints it out.

Optimization Strategy:
1. One potential inefficiency in this code is the reading of the cards from the input. Each card is read in two separate operations (first the character, then the number), which can be slow.
2. The conditional statements used to determine the suit of the card based on the character can be replaced by a switch statement. Switch statements generally perform better than if-else chains, as they use a lookup table internally.
3. The loops for printing the missing cards are repeated 4 times, once for each suit. This repetitive code can be simplified into a single loop with a switch statement for each suit.
4. The `Cards` array is initialized to zero by default, so there's no need for the `{{}}` initializer. 

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Combine the two `scanf` operations into one to read the suit and rank of a card at once. This reduces the number of input operations, hence improving the performance of the program.
2. Replace the if-else chain with a switch statement to determine the suit of the card. This will likely improve the performance as switch statements are generally faster than if-else chains.
3. Combine the four for loops into one for-loop that goes over all suits and ranks. This reduces the amount of repetitive code, making it cleaner and more maintainable.
4. Remove the `{{}}` initializer from the `Cards` array as it is unnecessary.

Optimized Code Block:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int Cards[4][13] = {0}; // No need for {{}} initializer
  int i, j, n, Num;
  char Mark;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  // Combined the two scanf operations into one
  for (i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
    scanf(" %c %d", &Mark, &Num);
    switch (Mark) { // Switch statement instead of if-else chain
      case 'S':
        Cards[0][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
      case 'H':
        Cards[1][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
      case 'C':
        Cards[2][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
      case 'D':
        Cards[3][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
    }
  }
  // Combined the four for loops into one
  for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    for (j = 1; j <= 13; j++) {
      if (Cards[i][j - 1] != 1) {
        switch (i) { // Switch statement to determine the suit
          case 0:
            printf("S %d\n", j);
            break;
          case 1:
            printf("H %d\n", j);
            break;
          case 2:
            printf("C %d\n", j);
            break;
          case 3:
            printf("D %d\n", j);
            break;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version of the code should perform better due to the reduced number of input operations and the use of switch statements. The trade-off is a slight increase in code complexity due to the nested switch statements, but this is mitigated by the reduction in repetitive code.
