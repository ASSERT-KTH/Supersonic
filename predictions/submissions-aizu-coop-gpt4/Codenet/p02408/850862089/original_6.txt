1. Code Analysis:
This program seems to track the presence of certain cards in a deck. It uses a 2D array to note the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of each card. The bottleneck could be the sequential if-else statement, which checks for every possible card type, as well as the redundant loops for printing.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Instead of using an if-else ladder for each card type, we can directly calculate the index using the ASCII value of the character. 
    2. The four separate loops for printing can be combined into a single loop by using an array of characters to represent the card types (i.e., 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D').

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. We will define an array `char types[] = {'S', 'H', 'C', 'D'}` to map the indices of our 2D array to their corresponding card types. This way, we can use the ASCII value of the input character to directly calculate the index, eliminating the need for the if-else ladder.
    2. We will also combine the four separate printing loops into a single loop. Within this loop, we will iterate over the card types and print out each card that is not present. This reduces the redundancy in our code and makes it more efficient.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int Cards[4][14] = {{}};
  int i, j, n, Num;
  char Mark;
  char types[] = {'S', 'H', 'C', 'D'}; // Map indices to card types

  scanf("%d", &n);

  for (i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
    scanf(" %c", &Mark); // Note: added space before %c to skip whitespace
    scanf("%d", &Num);
    Cards[Mark - 'S'][Num - 1] = 1; // Use ASCII value to calculate index
  }

  // Combine printing loops into a single loop
  for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    for (j = 1; j < 14; j++) {
      if (Cards[i][j - 1] != 1) {
        printf("%c %d\n", types[i], j); // Use array to print card type
      }
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the code is more efficient and less redundant. It avoids unnecessary condition checks and loop iterations, making it faster and more readable without changing the output or overall functionality.
