1. Code Analysis:
In this code, we have an array of 4x14 integers named `Cards` and the code is reading an integer `n` from input, then reading 2n characters and integers, and depending on the character value, it sets some elements of the `Cards` array to 1. After that, it checks all elements of `Cards` and if it finds an element that is not 1, it prints the row and column (with some formatting applied). 

The code is pretty straightforward and does not have any obvious inefficient parts. However, there is room for some minor enhancements.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   A. Inefficient data structures: The data structure used here is a static array of integers which is pretty efficient for this purpose. So, no modification needed for this.
   
   B. Redundant or unnecessary computations: The way we're scanning the input can be optimized. We are using two separate scanf statements to read the character and the integer. We could combine these into a single scanf statement. This would reduce the number of system calls and improve the performance.
   
   C. Loops or recursive calls: The four for-loops at the end of the program are identical except for the index used to access the `Cards` array. We could combine these into a single loop, reducing repetition and simplifying the code.
   
3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   A. Combine the two scanf statements into one: Currently, we have two separate scanf statements to read the character and the integer. We can combine these into a single scanf statement by using the format specifier "%c %d", which will read a character followed by an integer. This will reduce the number of system calls, thereby improving performance.
   
   B. Combine the four for-loops into one: Instead of having four separate for-loops to check and print each row of the `Cards` array, we can have one loop that iterates over all rows. We can use a switch-case construct or an array of characters to map the row index to the correct character to print.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int Cards[4][14] = {{}};
  int i, j, n, Num;
  char Mark, Marks[4] = {'S', 'H', 'C', 'D'};
  
  scanf("%d", &n);
  
  for (i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
    scanf(" %c %d", &Mark, &Num);
    
    switch(Mark) {
      case 'S':
        Cards[0][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
      case 'H':
        Cards[1][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
      case 'C':
        Cards[2][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
      case 'D':
        Cards[3][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
    }
  }

  for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    for (j = 1; j < 14; j++) {
      if (Cards[i][j - 1] != 1) {
        printf("%c %d\n", Marks[i], j);
      }
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code does exactly the same as the original code, but with fewer lines and potentially better readability and maintainability. However, the major drawback of this optimization is that it may require more understanding of the C programming language to fully understand the code. As a result, it may not be suitable for beginner programmers.
