# Code Analysis

The given program is reading from the input a number `n` and then 2n pairs of character and number. According to the character read (`S`, `H`, `C` or `D`), it sets a flag in a two-dimensional array `Cards` at a position defined by the number read. After that, it prints each number that was not flagged for each character.

# Optimization Strategy

1. **Redundant Computations**: The four for loops in the code are repetitive and can be combined into one loop. This will reduce the number of loop initializations and conditions checks.
2. **Compiler Optimizations**: Compiler optimizations can be used to improve the speed of the program. Some of the flags that can be used are `-O2` or `-O3` which optimize the code for speed.
3. **Data Structure**: The current 2D-array data structure is efficient for this task. It provides O(1) access time which is optimal. Therefore, no change is needed in this aspect.

# Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Redundant Computations**: Instead of having four separate loops for each character, we will have one loop that iterates over all characters. This will reduce the number of loop initializations and condition checks, thus improving performance.
   
   **Trade-offs**: While this reduces redundant computations, it may slightly increase code complexity due to the nested loop structure. However, the performance gain outweighs this increase in complexity.

2. **Compiler Optimizations**: By compiling the program with `-O2` or `-O3` flags, we can potentially improve the speed of the program. These flags enable various performance optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, etc.

   **Trade-offs**: Using these flags may lead to increased code size and potentially longer compile times. However, the resulting speed-up in execution time is typically worth this trade-off.

# Optimized Code Block

Below is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int Cards[4][14] = {{}};
    int i, j, n, Num;
    char Mark;
    char Marks[4] = {'S', 'H', 'C', 'D'};
    
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
        scanf(" %c", &Mark); // Leading space to consume any whitespace
        scanf("%d", &Num);
        switch (Mark) {
            case 'S':
                Cards[0][Num - 1] = 1;
                break;
            case 'H':
                Cards[1][Num - 1] = 1;
                break;
            case 'C':
                Cards[2][Num - 1] = 1;
                break;
            case 'D':
                Cards[3][Num - 1] = 1;
                break;
        }
    }
    
    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        for (j = 1; j < 14; j++) {
            if (Cards[i][j - 1] != 1) {
                printf("%c %d\n", Marks[i], j);
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code should be compiled with `-O2` or `-O3` flag for optimal performance:
```
gcc -O2 program.c -o program
```
