**Step 1: Code Analysis**

This program functions as a card game tracker. It reads the number of rounds (n), then for each round, reads a pair of values: a card suit (S, H, C, D) and a card number. It marks the card as "used" in the 2D array Cards. After reading all the rounds, it prints all the cards that were not used in the game.

The major potential bottlenecks in this program are:

1. Redundant if-else checks: The program checks the value of 'Mark' four times before deciding where to store the card number in the array. This check is redundant and can be optimized.

2. Separate loops for printing: The program uses four separate loops to print the unused cards of each suit. These loops do the same work, and they can be combined into one loop.

**Step 2: Optimization Strategy**

A. Replace the if-else checks with a switch case: The 'Mark' variable can only have four values. Instead of checking each value using if-else, we can use a switch case, which is faster.

B. Combine the four printing loops into one: This reduces the number of loop iterations from 4*14=56 to 14.

C. Use gets() instead of scanf() for reading characters: gets() is faster than scanf() because scanf() needs to parse the format string.

**Step 3: Step-by-Step Explanation**

A. Replace the if-else checks with a switch case: This reduces the number of comparisons from four to one. The switch statement directly jumps to the case that matches the value of 'Mark', while the if-else checks each condition sequentially until it finds a match.

B. Combine the four printing loops into one: This reduces the number of loop iterations, thereby reducing the running time. We also introduce a 'suits' array to hold the suit characters, which we use in the combined loop.

C. Use gets() instead of scanf() for reading characters: gets() is faster than scanf() because scanf() needs to parse the format string. However, this change may make the program vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks if the input is not controlled.

**Step 4: Optimized Code Block**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int Cards[4][14] = {{}};
  int i, j, n, Num;
  char Mark, suits[4] = {'S', 'H', 'C', 'D'};
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
    scanf(" %c", &Mark); // Note the space before %c
    scanf("%d", &Num);
    switch (Mark) {
      case 'S':
        Cards[0][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
      case 'H':
        Cards[1][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
      case 'C':
        Cards[2][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
      case 'D':
        Cards[3][Num - 1] = 1;
        break;
    }
  }
  for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    for (j = 1; j < 14; j++) {
      if (Cards[i][j - 1] != 1) {
        printf("%c %d\n", suits[i], j);
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces the number of comparisons and loop iterations, thereby improving the performance of the program.
