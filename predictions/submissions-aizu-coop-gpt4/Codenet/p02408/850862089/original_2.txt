Code Analysis:
The given code is a simple C program that accepts an integer 'n' and then takes 2n inputs of a character and a number. This pair represents a playing card where the character represents the suit ("S", "H", "C", or "D") and the number represents the card's value. The cards are being stored in a 2D array. After storing all the cards, the program then prints all the cards that were not inputted by the user, suit by suit.

Potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. The program uses a separate loop for each suit to print the missing cards. This results in redundant code and extra iterations.

2. The code reads in each card with two separate scanf function calls. This could be optimized into one function call.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a single loop to print the missing cards from all suits. This would reduce code redundancy and improve readability.

2. Read in each card with a single scanf function call. This would make the code cleaner and slightly faster.

3. The card's suit and number are being separately checked and then stored into the array. Instead, a switch case can be used to simplify the code and reduce the number of comparison operations.

4. Use "fgets()" and "sscanf()" instead of "scanf()" for better performance and error checking.

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int Cards[4][14] = {{}};
    int i, j, n, Num;
    char Mark;
    char buffer[10];

    fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
    sscanf(buffer, "%d", &n);

    for (i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
        fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
        sscanf(buffer, "%c %d", &Mark, &Num);

        switch(Mark) {
            case 'S':
                Cards[0][Num - 1] = 1;
                break;
            case 'H':
                Cards[1][Num - 1] = 1;
                break;
            case 'C':
                Cards[2][Num - 1] = 1;
                break;
            case 'D':
                Cards[3][Num - 1] = 1;
                break;
        }
    }

    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        for (j = 1; j < 14; j++) {
            if (Cards[i][j - 1] != 1) {
                printf("%c %d\n", "SHCD"[i], j);
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:

1. The use of fgets() and sscanf() over scanf() can make the code slightly more complex, but it provides better performance and error checking.

2. The use of switch-case over if-else ladder makes the code cleaner and easier to understand, but it might be slightly slower in some cases. However, the impact on the performance would be negligible in this case as the number of cases is small.
