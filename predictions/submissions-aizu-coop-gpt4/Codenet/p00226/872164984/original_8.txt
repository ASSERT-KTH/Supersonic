This code reads bytes from the standard input and performs some calculations on a global array R of size 99. It uses bitwise operations and other tricks for compactness and speed. However, readability is sacrificed, and there might be performance issues due to unnecessary computations and inefficient data structure. 

## Optimization Strategy

1. Use of a Bitset: In the current code, an array R[] is used as a bitset. However, native C++ bitset data structure can be more efficient and easier to understand, improving both performance and readability. 

2. Redundant Computations: The code is performing redundant computations in both assignments to h and b. These computations can be stored in temporary variables to avoid redundancy, improving performance.

3. Compiler Optimizations: To increase the performance, we can use compiler optimizations like -O3 that applies all the standard optimizations to the code. However, this should be done carefully as some optimizations might change the code behavior.

4. Use of more Efficient I/O Methods: The read() function is a system call that can be slower than other I/O methods. Using other methods like getchar() can be more efficient.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Use of a Bitset: The array R is used as a bitset to store whether each character has been encountered or not. Instead of using an array and bitwise operations, we can use a native C++ bitset. This can be more efficient and easier to understand.  

2. Redundant Computations: The current code is performing the same computation twice in the assignments to h and b. Instead, we can store the result of R[c] ^= 1 << i % 5 in a temporary variable and use that in the assignments to h and b. This would reduce the number of computations, improving performance.

3. Compiler Optimizations: We can use the -O3 compiler optimization flag to improve performance. This flag applies all the standard optimizations to the code, potentially speeding up execution. However, care should be taken as some optimizations might change the behavior of the code.

4. Use of more Efficient I/O Methods: The read() function is a system call and can be slower than other I/O methods. Instead, we can use getchar() which can be more efficient.

## Optimized Code Block

Below is the optimized version of the code:

```c++
#include <bitset>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>

std::bitset<256> R;
int i, h, b;

int main() {
  char c;
  while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
    bool temp = R[c] ^= 1 << i % 5;
    b += !temp;
    h += temp;
    if (++i > 9) {
      printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h);
      R.reset();
      i = h = b = 0;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this code, we replaced the array with a bitset for more efficient and readable code. We also used getchar() instead of read() for more efficient I/O. The redundant computations were removed by using a temporary variable. Finally, the memset() call was replaced with the reset() function of the bitset, which is more efficient and easier to understand.
