Code Analysis:
This C code is a compact and optimized solution for counting the number of set and unset bits from the input. The character array 'R' is being used to keep track of the count of bits. It uses bitwise operations to set and unset bits and then calculates the number of set and unset bits.

However, there are several potential areas for improvement:

1. It uses the 'read' system call to read a single byte at a time from the input. This is inefficient because each system call has a significant overhead.
2. The 'memset' function is used to clear the 'R' array after every 10 iterations. This is unnecessary because the array 'R' only needs to be cleared once, before the start of the loop.
3. The 'printf' function is called inside the 'memset' function. This makes the code hard to understand and optimize.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use buffered I/O functions instead of the 'read' system call to read data from the input. This reduces the number of system calls and improves performance.
2. Move the 'memset' function call outside of the loop. This reduces the number of times the 'R' array is cleared, saving CPU cycles.
3. Separate the 'printf' function call from the 'memset' function call. This makes the code easier to understand and optimize.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the 'read' system call with the 'getchar' function. The 'getchar' function uses a buffer to read data from the input, which reduces the number of system calls and improves performance.
2. Move the 'memset' function call outside of the loop. The 'R' array only needs to be cleared once, before the start of the loop. This reduces the number of times the 'R' array is cleared, saving CPU cycles.
3. Separate the 'printf' function call from the 'memset' function call. The 'printf' function call is used to print the number of set and unset bits, while the 'memset' function call is used to clear the 'R' array. Separating these two function calls makes the code easier to understand and optimize.

Optimized Code Block:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

char R[99];
int i, h, b;
int main() {
  int c;
  memset(R, 0, 99);  // clear the 'R' array
  while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {  // read data from the input
    b += !!R[c], h += !(R[c] ^= 1 << i % 5);
    if (++i > 9) {  // print and then clear the variables after every 10 iterations
      printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h);
      i = h = b = 0;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version of the code performs the same function as the original, but it is more efficient and easier to understand.
