# Code Analysis
The given program is a C program that reads bytes from the standard input and performs some computations on them. It maintains an array `R` of size 99, and three variables `i`, `h`, and `b`. Here's what the main loop does:

1. It reads a byte from the standard input.
2. If the byte has been read before, it increments `b`.
3. If the byte has not been read before, it increments `h`.
4. Every 10 bytes, it prints out the values of `h` and `b - h`, and resets `R`, `i`, `h`, and `b`.

The main potential performance bottlenecks are:

1. The use of the `read` syscall for each byte read. System calls are expensive and should be minimized.
2. The use of the `printf` and `memset` functions inside the loop condition. These are also expensive operations.
3. The use of the `!!` and `!(...)` operators to convert values to boolean. This is unnecessary in C and could be removed.
4. The use of the `^=` operator and `%` operator in the computation of `R[c]`. These operations are also expensive and could be optimized.

# Optimization Strategy
Here's how we can optimize the program:

1. Use `fread` instead of `read` to read multiple bytes at once from the standard input.
2. Move the `printf` and `memset` calls out of the loop condition and into the loop body.
3. Remove the `!!` and `!(...)` operators.
4. Replace the `^=` operator with a simple assignment, and use a separate counter to avoid using the `%` operator.

# Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Replace the `read` syscall with `fread`: The `read` syscall is expensive and reading one byte at a time is inefficient. We can replace it with the `fread` function, which can read multiple bytes at once. The buffer size should be chosen to balance memory usage and syscall overhead. A buffer size of 1024 bytes is a good starting point.

2. Move `printf` and `memset` out of the loop condition: The loop condition should be as simple as possible. By moving these calls into the loop body, we can make the loop condition simpler and easier to understand. Also, the `memset` function is expensive and should be called as few times as possible.

3. Remove `!!` and `!(...)` operators: In C, any non-zero value is considered true and zero is considered false. We can simply remove these operators and the code will still work as expected.

4. Replace `^=` operator and `%` operator: These operators are used to compute `R[c]`. We can replace the `^=` operator with a simple assignment, and use a separate counter to avoid using the `%` operator. This makes the code simpler and slightly faster.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define BUF_SIZE 1024

char R[99];
int i, h, b;

int main() {
    char buffer[BUF_SIZE];
    int c, counter = 0;

    while ((c = fread(buffer, 1, BUF_SIZE, stdin)) > 0) {
        for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
            char byte = buffer[j];
            b += R[byte];
            h += R[byte] = 1 << counter;
            if (++counter > 9) {
                printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h);
                memset(R, 0, sizeof(R));
                counter = i = h = b = 0;
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

# Trade-offs
While the optimized code is faster, it is also slightly more complex. The use of a separate buffer for reading and a separate counter for computing `R[c]` adds a bit of complexity. However, this is a reasonable trade-off for the performance gain.
