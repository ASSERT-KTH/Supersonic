This C program is a highly condensed piece of code. It appears to be reading from standard input and performing some bitwise operations and arithmetic. Let's break it down:

1. `R[99];` - This declares an array of integers with 100 elements. It is global and thus automatically initialized to zero.

2. `i, h, b;` - These are global integer variables, also initialized to zero.

3. `main(c) { ... }` - This is the main function where `c` is the input.

4. `for (; read(0, &c, 1); ... )` - This loop reads one byte of input at a time from standard input until it can't read any more (i.e., until it hits EOF).

5. `++i > 9 && memset(R, i = h = b = !printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h), 232)` - This is a complex line. Let's break it down:
    - `++i > 9` - If the incremented `i` is greater than 9, then the rest of the statement is executed.
    - `memset(R, i = h = b = !printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h), 232)` - This sets every byte in `R` to the value of `i = h = b = !printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h)`, which is a complex expression itself. 
    - `printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h)` - This prints the values of `h` and `b - h`. The return value of `printf` is the number of characters printed, so `!printf(...)` will be 0 if something is printed, and 1 if nothing is printed (which should never happen).
    - `i = h = b = !printf(...)` - This sets `i`, `h`, and `b` to the value of `!printf(...)`, which will always be 0.
    - So, this line essentially resets `i`, `h`, and `b` to 0 every 10 iterations, and prints the values of `h` and `b - h` before resetting them.

6. `b += !!R[c], h += !(R[c] ^= 1 << i % 5);` - This line manipulates `b` and `h` and performs a bitwise operation on `R[c]`.
    - `b += !!R[c]` - This increments `b` by 1 if `R[c]` is non-zero.
    - `h += !(R[c] ^= 1 << i % 5);` - This toggles the `i % 5`th bit of `R[c]`, and if the result is zero, it increments `h`.

This program may be optimized by making the following changes:

1. Use better variable naming: Using descriptive variable names can improve code readability and maintainability, which can indirectly lead to better performance because it's easier to see what the code is doing and where potential bottlenecks might be.

2. Avoid unnecessary operations: The bitwise operation `1 << i % 5` appears to be unnecessary, as it doesn't seem to have any impact on the output of the program.

3. Use efficient data structures: The fixed-size array `R` is inefficient if we're dealing with a small amount of input. A dynamic data structure like a vector would be more memory efficient.

4. Avoid unnecessary memory setting: The `memset()` function is used to reset the entire `R` array every 10 iterations, which is unnecessary and inefficient. We could just reset the specific indices we've modified.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int R[99];
int index, high, base;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int c;
  while (read(0, &c, 1)) {
    base += !!R[c];
    high += !(R[c] ^= 1);
    if (++index > 9) {
      printf("%d %d\n", high, base - high);
      index = high = base = 0;
      memset(R, 0, sizeof(R));
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the code is clearer, more maintainable, and potentially more efficient because it avoids unnecessary operations. However, it should be noted that these optimizations are quite minor and might not lead to noticeable performance improvements, especially for small inputs.
