This is an interesting piece of obfuscated C code. It reads characters from standard input and performs some operations. There are some areas of this code that can be optimized.

## Code Analysis
1. The array `R` is declared without specifying the type of its elements. This implicitly makes it an array of integers.
2. The variable `c` is being used as both an integer and a character.
3. The `read()` function is being used to read one character at a time from standard input, which is inefficient.
4. The `printf()` function is being called within the conditional part of the `memset()` function which makes the code more complex.
5. The `memset()` function is used to reset variables and the array `R` after every 10 iterations, which is inefficient.

## Optimization Strategy
1. Use an array of `char` instead of `int` for `R` to reduce memory usage.
2. Use different variables for different purposes to make the code easier to understand.
3. Use `fgetc()` instead of `read()` to read characters from standard input.
4. Move the `printf()` function out of the `memset()` function to improve readability.
5. Rather than resetting the array `R` and the variables `i`, `h`, and `b` after every 10 iterations, initialize them before the loop and update them as necessary within the loop.

## Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Change the declaration of `R` from `R[99]` to `char R[99]` to reduce memory usage.
2. Replace `c` with `int ch` in `main()` and use `c` only as a character.
3. Replace `read(0, &c, 1)` with `(c = fgetc(stdin)) != EOF` to read characters from standard input more efficiently.
4. Move the `printf()` and `memset()` calls out of the loop condition and into the body of the loop to improve readability.
5. Initialize `i`, `h`, `b`, and `R` before the loop and update them as necessary within the loop instead of resetting them after every 10 iterations.

## Optimized Code Block

Here is the optimized version of the C code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

char R[99];
int i, h, b;

int main() {
  int ch;

  memset(R, 0, 99);
  i = h = b = 0;

  while ((ch = fgetc(stdin)) != EOF) {
    b += !!R[ch];
    h += !(R[ch] ^= 1 << i % 5);

    if (++i > 9) {
      printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h);
      memset(R, 0, 99);
      i = h = b = 0;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code is more readable and performs the same operations more efficiently.
