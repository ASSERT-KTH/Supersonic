This C code seems to be a golfed code for a specific purpose. It's not very readable and uses several bitwise operations and ternary operators to keep the code short. The program reads characters from standard input, performs a series of bitwise operations, and prints two numbers at the end.

Here are some potential optimization steps:

1. Use larger data types: The current code uses an array of 99 elements each of size 1 byte (as it's an array of char). The access to this array is done using bitwise operations. We could use an array of a larger data type (like `int`) to make the operations more efficient.

2. Unroll loops: The code is using a loop to read individual bytes. This could potentially be optimized by reading larger chunks of data at once.

3. Make use of compiler optimizations: Most modern compilers support various optimization flags that can help in improving the performance of the code. Using these flags can help in improving the runtime performance of the code.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
int R[32]; // Using int array to hold the bits
int i, h, b;
int main(int c) {
  int chunk;
  char buffer[4096]; // Buffer to read data in chunks
  while ((chunk = read(0, buffer, sizeof(buffer))) > 0) { // Reading data in chunks
    for (int j = 0; j < chunk; j++) {
      c = buffer[j];
      b += !!R[c], h += !(R[c] ^= 1 << i % 5);
      if (++i > 9) { // Resetting counters after every 10 iterations
        printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h);
        memset(R, i = h = b = 0, sizeof(R));
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This code should be more efficient because it reads data in chunks, uses larger data types for bitwise operations, and resets counters after every 10 iterations instead of doing it every time. Please note that the output of the program can change based on how the input is chunked and read.

The trade-off of this optimization is that the code becomes slightly more complex, but it should be more efficient. However, as always, the best way to verify this would be to run the code with some test data and measure the performance.
