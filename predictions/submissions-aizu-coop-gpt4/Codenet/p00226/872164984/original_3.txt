The provided code reads characters from the standard input (stdin) and performs some operations on globally declared variables and an array, R[99]. The program appears to be written in an obfuscated manner, making it hard to understand its purpose. However, we can deduce that it's doing some bit manipulation operations and accumulating certain results to be printed out.

The optimization process for this code would be as follows:

1. Code Analysis:

- The code uses the read() system call to read character by character from the stdin. This is highly inefficient as system calls are expensive operations.
- The memset() function is used inside the loop condition, which is not recommended due to clarity and performance issues. It's also invoked for every 10th character, which can be improved by using a counter variable and an if condition inside the loop.
- The array R[99] seems to be used as a bitmap where each character's ASCII value is the index and each bit represents the position of the character in the last 5 characters read.
- Variables `i`, `h`, and `b` are not clearly named and their purpose is ambiguous. Renaming these to more descriptive names would improve code readability.

2. Optimization Strategy:

- Replace the read() system call with a standard C function like getchar() to avoid the overhead of system calls.
- Use a counter variable to invoke memset() after every 10th character.
- Use larger integer types for bit manipulations if the program is intended to run on a 64-bit machine. This can take advantage of the larger word size.
- Rename variables to more descriptive names to improve code readability.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

- Replace read() with getchar() to avoid the overhead of system calls.
- Introduce a counter variable, count, to keep track of the number of characters read. Use an if condition to check if 10 characters have been read and then invoke memset() and printf(). Reset count to 0 after this.
- Replace the variable i with a more descriptive name, bit_position.
- Replace the variable b with a more descriptive name, total_bit_count.
- Replace the variable h with a more descriptive name, flip_count.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int R[99];
int bit_position, flip_count, total_bit_count;

int main() {
  int c, count = 0;
  while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
    total_bit_count += !!R[c];
    flip_count += !(R[c] ^= 1 << bit_position % 5);
    if (++count > 9) {
      printf("%d %d\n", flip_count, total_bit_count - flip_count);
      memset(R, bit_position = flip_count = total_bit_count = 0, sizeof(R));
      count = 0;
    }
    bit_position++;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimized code assumes that stdin will be terminated by EOF. If the input comes from another source that doesn't terminate with EOF, the while loop condition will need to be modified accordingly.
