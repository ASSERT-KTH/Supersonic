Code Analysis:
The main purpose of the given code is to solve a dynamic programming problem. The input is a sequence of integers between 0 and 20, inclusive. The program calculates the number of ways to perform addition and subtraction operations on the sequence to make the result equal to the last number in the sequence. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: The current data structures used are arrays, which are already among the most efficient data structures in terms of memory. Therefore, no change is necessary here.

2. Redundant or Unnecessary Computations: The initialization loop for dp array is unnecessary and can be removed as C++ automatically initializes the array to zero.

3. Recursive Calls and Loops: The loops used in the program are necessary and efficient for the problem at hand. However, the bounds of the inner loop can be reduced to improve the performance.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The compiler optimizations such as -O2 or -O3 can be used to improve the performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Removing the initialization loop for dp array: In C++, the global variables and static variables are automatically initialized to zero. As dp is a global variable, we can remove the initialization loop. This will reduce the time complexity of the program.

2. Reducing the bounds of the inner loop: In the inner loop, we are checking for all j from 0 to 20. However, the possible values of j can only be from 0 to a[i]. Therefore, we can reduce the bounds of the inner loop to improve the performance.

Trade-offs:
Removing the initialization loop and reducing the bounds of the inner loop will make the code more efficient. However, it might slightly increase the complexity of understanding the code.

Optimized Code Block:
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int a[101];
long long dp[110][21];

int main() {
  int i, j;
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  
  for (i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  dp[1][a[1]] = 1;
  
  for (i = 2; i < N; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j <= a[i]; j++) {
      if (j - a[i] >= 0)
        dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - a[i]];
      if (j + a[i] <= 20)
        dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j + a[i]];
    }
  }
  
  cout << dp[N - 1][a[N]] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
