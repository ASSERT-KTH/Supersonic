The provided C++ program seems to be a dynamic programming problem. It uses a 2D array for storing the results of sub-problems, and an array `a` to store input values.

Code Analysis:

1. Most of the code is efficient, but there are parts that can be optimized.
2. The initialization of the `dp` array in a nested loop is not efficient. If the default value for all cells is 0, this can be done in a more cost-effective way.
3. The main logic of the code is in the double-loop block, where no obvious optimization opportunities are found. However, the bounds of the loops can be checked for optimization.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the nested loop for initialization with a more efficient method.
2. Check the loop bounds and see if they can be optimized.
3. Try to exploit compiler optimizations.

Optimization Steps:

1. Initialization of `dp` array: Instead of initializing the `dp` array with nested loops, we can use the `std::fill` function from the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++. It can fill the entire 2D array with 0 in one line.

2. Loop bounds: The inner loop runs from 0 to 20 inclusive. This seems to be a fixed range and hence no further optimization seems possible here.

3. Compiler optimizations: Using certain flags while compiling the code can make the compiler optimize the program. For example, the `-O2` flag enables all optimization flags.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>  // For std::fill
using namespace std;
int a[101];
long long dp[110][21];
int main() {
  int i, j;
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  fill(&dp[0][0], &dp[0][0] + sizeof(dp) / sizeof(long long), 0); // Efficient initialization
  for (i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  dp[1][a[1]] = 1;
  for (i = 2; i < N; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j <= 20; j++) {
      if (j - a[i] >= 0)
        dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - a[i]];
      if (j + a[i] <= 20)
        dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j + a[i]];
    }
  }
  cout << dp[N - 1][a[N]] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Compile the code with `-O2` flag for further optimizations. Use the command `g++ -O2 filename.cpp`. 

Trade-offs:

1. The use of `std::fill` introduces an additional overhead of including another library. However, it simplifies and optimizes the code, making it a worthwhile trade-off.
2. Compiler optimization flags like `-O2` can make the code run faster, but they might make it harder for debugging and the code may behave unpredictably in some rare cases. However, this is generally not a problem for well-written code.
