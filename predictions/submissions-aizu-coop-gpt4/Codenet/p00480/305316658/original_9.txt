Code analysis:
The provided code is a C++ program that reads an array of integers and performs some calculations on a 2D array `dp`. The code initially zeroes out the `dp` array. Then, for each position `i` from the second position to the penultimate position in the input array `a`, it uses the value at `a[i]` to update the corresponding positions in the `dp` array. Finally, the code outputs the value of `dp[N-1][a[N]]`.

Optimization strategy:

1. Inefficient data structures: The `dp` array is a 2D array with dimensions 110x21. However, the code only uses up to `N` rows of the `dp` array, where `N` is the size of the input array. Thus, the `dp` array can be reduced to `N`x21.

2. Redundant computations: The initial zeroing out of the `dp` array is unnecessary because the C++ standard guarantees that global and static variables are initialized to zero.

3. Loops or recursive calls: The current loops and calls are already efficient.

4. Compiler optimizations: The compiler optimizations are not applicable for this task.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Resize the `dp` array from 110x21 to `N`x21. This reduces the memory usage by only allocating the required amount of memory. 

2. Remove the redundant zeroing out of the `dp` array. This optimizes the initialization of the `dp` array, reducing the running time.

Trade-offs: The proposed optimizations do not introduce any significant trade-offs. The code complexity remains the same, and the performance and memory usage are improved.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  
  vector<int> a(N+1);
  vector<vector<long long>> dp(N+1, vector<long long>(21));
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  dp[1][a[1]] = 1;
  
  for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= 20; j++) {
      if (j - a[i] >= 0)
        dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - a[i]];
      if (j + a[i] <= 20)
        dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j + a[i]];
    }
  }
  
  cout << dp[N - 1][a[N]] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, the `dp` array is replaced by a vector of vectors, which allows for dynamic resizing of the array. The zeroing-out loop has been removed, taking advantage of the fact that vectors in C++ are initialized with zero by default.
