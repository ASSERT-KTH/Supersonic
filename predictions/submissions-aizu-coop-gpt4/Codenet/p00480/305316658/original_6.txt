1. Code Analysis:
The provided code is a simple dynamic programming solution that is reading input, initializing an array, and computing a two-dimensional array `dp` based on certain conditions. The code seems to be clean and efficient overall. However, there are still a couple of places where we could apply some optimization techniques.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. The initialization of the `dp` array could be optimized. Instead of using nested loops to initialize the array to zero, we can use `std::fill_n` function which is a more efficient way to initialize an array.
    2. The array `a` is keeping a record of all inputs. If memory usage is a concern and the array is large, we can optimize this by reading inputs directly into the `dp` array. However, this can make the code a bit more complex.
    3. The input and output method cin and cout are slower compared to scanf and printf. We can switch to using scanf and printf to optimize for input/output speed.
    4. We can apply compiler optimization using pragma directives.
   
3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Initialization of `dp` array: Instead of using nested loops to initialize the array to zero, we can use `std::fill_n` function which fills the specified range of elements with the given value. This function is generally faster than a for loop.
    2. Memory Optimization: Instead of storing all inputs in array `a`, we can read inputs directly into the `dp` array where they are used. However, this makes the code a bit more complex and harder to read.
    3. Input/Output Method: The cin and cout operations are slower compared to scanf and printf. By switching to scanf and printf, we can reduce the time taken for input/output operations.
    4. Compiler Optimization: We can use pragma directives to give hints to the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. For example, `#pragma GCC optimize ("Ofast")` will tell the compiler to optimize the code for speed.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
long long dp[110][21];

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int N;
    scanf("%d", &N);

    fill(&dp[0][0], &dp[0][0] + sizeof(dp) / sizeof(long long), 0);

    int temp;
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &temp);
        dp[i][temp] = i == 1 ? 1 : dp[i - 1][temp - 1] + dp[i - 1][temp + 1];
    }

    printf("%lld\n", dp[N - 1][temp]);

    return 0;
}
```
Please note that the aforementioned optimizations might not always result in noticeable performance improvements, especially for small inputs. However, for larger inputs, these optimizations can significantly improve performance.
