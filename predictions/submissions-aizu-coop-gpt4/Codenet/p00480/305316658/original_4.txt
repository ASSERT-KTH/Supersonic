This C++ program seems to be solving a dynamic programming problem. It first initializes a 2D array `dp` to 0, and then reads in `N` integers into array `a`. Afterwards, it populates the `dp` array based on the values of `a` and finally outputs `dp[N - 1][a[N]]`.

The program is already quite efficient, but there are still a few areas we can optimize:

1. **Memory Initialization**: Currently, the program initializes the entire `dp` array to 0. However, only `N` rows of the array are actually used. We can reduce the memory usage by only initializing `N` rows.

2. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input one integer at a time which could be inefficient due to the overhead of I/O operations. We can use faster I/O methods to speed this up.

3. **Loop Structure**: The `dp` array is updated in a nested loop, which is necessary for this dynamic programming problem. However, we can slightly optimize the loop structure by avoiding checking the conditions `j - a[i] >= 0` and `j + a[i] <= 20` twice.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // Use faster I/O
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int N;
  cin >> N;

  vector<int> a(N + 1);
  vector<vector<long long>> dp(N + 1, vector<long long>(21, 0));
  // Only initialize the necessary part of dp array

  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }

  dp[1][a[1]] = 1;
  for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= 20; j++) {
      if (j >= a[i])
        dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - a[i]];
      if (j + a[i] <= 20)
        dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j + a[i]];
    }
  }

  cout << dp[N - 1][a[N]] << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code should have the same output as the original, but with reduced memory usage and potentially faster performance due to the faster I/O and optimized loop structure.

The trade-off here is that the code is slightly more complex due to the use of `vector` instead of built-in arrays, and the use of faster I/O methods. However, the performance gain is usually worth this slight increase in complexity.
