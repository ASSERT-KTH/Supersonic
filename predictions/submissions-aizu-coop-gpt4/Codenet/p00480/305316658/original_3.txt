Code Analysis:
The given program seems to be solving a dynamic programming problem. It first initializes a 2D dynamic programming (DP) table, then reads in an array of integers, and finally performs some dynamic programming operations on the array to fill the DP table. 

The main performance bottleneck and inefficient memory usage in this program are in the initialization of the DP table and the subsequent DP operations. The program initializes a DP table of size 110*21, but only uses N*21 of it. Also, the DP operations involve a loop that iterates up to 20 for each element in the array, which is quite inefficient.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: Use a 2D DP table of size N*21 instead of 110*21 to save memory. This is because the program only processes N elements from the input array, hence the DP table should also have N rows.

2. Redundant Computations: Eliminate redundant computations in the DP operations. Instead of looping from 0 to 20 for each element in the array, loop from max(0, j - a[i]) to min(20, j + a[i]).

3. Compiler Optimizations: Use the -O2 or -O3 flag to enable compiler optimizations. These flags can enable various compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling and function inlining, which can boost the performance of the program.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Change the size of the DP table to N*21. This reduces the memory usage of the program since we are only storing the needed values, instead of initializing a much larger table and wasting memory.

2. Modify the DP operations to loop from max(0, j - a[i]) to min(20, j + a[i]). This reduces the number of iterations in the loop, thus improving the running time of the program.

3. Use compiler optimization flags. This will enable the compiler to automatically apply several optimizations to the program, such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and others. This can further boost the performance of the program.

Trade-offs: These optimizations may make the code slightly more complicated and harder to understand. However, they significantly improve the performance and efficiency of the program, making them a worthwhile trade-off.

Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  
  int a[N+1];
  long long dp[N+1][21] = {0};
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  dp[1][a[1]] = 1;
  
  for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = max(0, a[i]); j <= min(20, a[i]); j++) {
      if (j - a[i] >= 0)
        dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - a[i]];
      if (j + a[i] <= 20)
        dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j + a[i]];
    }
  }
  
  cout << dp[N - 1][a[N]] << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

Compile this program with the -O2 or -O3 flag for further optimizations.

Note: This optimized code assumes that the maximum value of N is 100. If N can be larger, you should dynamically allocate the DP table and the array a based on the input size N.
