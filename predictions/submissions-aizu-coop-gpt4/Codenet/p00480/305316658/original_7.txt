Code Analysis:

This C++ program is solving a dynamic programming problem. The program reads a number N and then reads N integers. It then performs some calculations using a 2D dynamic programming table (dp[i][j]) where each entry represents the number of ways to reach the value of j using the first i numbers.

Potential performance bottlenecks:

1. Initialization of the 2D array dp[110][21] to 0. This operation has a time complexity of O(N^2).

2. Nested for loop for the main computation. This operation also has a time complexity of O(N^2) because it iterates over all elements of the 2D array in the worst case.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use memset to initialize all elements of 2D array dp to 0. C++ standard library function memset is faster than a for loop for initializing an array to a constant value.

2. This program already uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant computation, so there is not much redundant or unnecessary computation to remove.

3. The loop iterating over the dp array seems necessary and cannot be unrolled or transformed to tail recursion.

4. Use C++ IO streams more efficiently. The cin and cout operations can be made faster by tying them off from stdio and adding manual flushing. This disables the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams.

5. Compiler optimizations: If allowed, we can use -O3 flag for the g++ compiler which enables all the optimization flags.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the double for loop initializing the dp array with memset. The reason is that memset is generally faster than a manual loop to initialize values in memory. The trade-off is that memset can only be used to set all bytes in a block of memory to the same value, it cannot be used for more complex initialization.

2. Add the line of code "ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);" before any I/O operations. This line of code will make cin and cout operations faster. However, after this line you should not mix stdio and C++ streams on the same file descriptor.

3. Add the line of code "cin.tie(NULL);" before any I/O operations. This line of code unties cin from cout. By default cin is tied to cout to ensure a sensible order of output. But this can cause unnecessary flushes slowing down the I/O operations.

4. Use -O3 flag during compilation if allowed. This flag tells the compiler to perform nearly all supported optimizations that do not involve a space-speed trade-off.

Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring> // for memset
using namespace std;
int a[101];
long long dp[110][21];
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp)); // replace double for loop with memset
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  dp[1][a[1]] = 1;
  for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= 20; j++) {
      if (j - a[i] >= 0)
        dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - a[i]];
      if (j + a[i] <= 20)
        dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j + a[i]];
    }
  }
  cout << dp[N - 1][a[N]] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should be compiled with -O3 flag if allowed.
