Code Analysis:

This program is a simulation of a game where a player can change the color of the top-left cell. All adjacent cells of the same color as the top-left cell also change color. The calculation process continues until the count reaches 5. The `calc` function counts the number of cells with a specific color, and the `on` function applies color changes to the cells.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The current program uses a standard queue for BFS, which is efficient in this case. The pair, vector and array data structures are also used appropriately. Therefore, there's no need for change in data structures for optimization.

2. Redundant computations: In the `on` function, a BFS is run to change the color of the cells. However, during this process, many cells are revisited due to the queue, which is unnecessary and can be optimized.

3. Loops and Recursive Calls: The `calc` function is a recursive function that can be optimized through tail recursion. The loops in the program are essential and well-optimized.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Using optimization flags during compilation such as `-O2` or `-O3` can significantly improve the performance of the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Redundant computations: In the `on` function, the `used` boolean array is used to check if a cell has been visited before or not. If a cell has been visited and colored, there's no need to add it into the queue again. By adding a condition to check if a cell has been visited before adding it to the queue can eliminate the redundant computations.

2. Tail Recursion: The `calc` function can be optimized using tail recursion. After each recursive call, the function doesn't perform any computation. Therefore, the compiler can optimize it by converting it into a loop, which can save stack space and improve performance.

Optimized Code Block:

```
void calc(int y, int x) {
  stack<pair<int, int>> stk;
  stk.push({y, x});
  while(!stk.empty()) {
    auto [y, x] = stk.top(); stk.pop(); // Replace recursive calls with a stack
    if (y < 0 || x < 0 || x >= w || y >= h)
      continue;
    if (temp[y][x] == Col) {
      tres++;
      temp[y][x] = 0;
      for (int r = 0; r < 4; r++)
        stk.push({y + dy[r], x + dx[r]});
    }
  }
}

void on(P N, int count, int c) {
  // ...
  while (!Q.empty()) {
    C now = Q.front();
    Q.pop();
    if (used[now.first][now.second])
      continue;
    used[now.first][now.second] = true;
    N[now.first][now.second] = c;
    for (int r = 0; r < 4; r++) {
      int ny = now.first + dy[r], nx = now.second + dx[r];
      if (ny < 0 || nx < 0 || ny >= h || nx >= w || used[ny][nx])
        continue;
      if (N[ny][nx] == nc)
        Q.push(make_pair(ny, nx));
    }
  }
  // ...
}
```
This optimized code reduces redundant computations and optimizes the recursive function `calc` using tail recursion. The functionality and output of the original code are preserved, and the changes are minimal. The code is well-commented to highlight the changes.
