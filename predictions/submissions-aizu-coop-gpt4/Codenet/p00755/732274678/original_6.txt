1. Code Analysis:
   This code is a solution to a problem that seems to be a variant of the Flood-Fill problem. It works by recursively traversing a 2D grid and filling in cells based on certain conditions. The main performance bottlenecks are:
    - The function `on()` creates a copy of the 2D grid `N` every time it's called.
    - The function `calc()` uses recursion for flood-fill, which can lead to a stack overflow for large inputs.
    - The grid is stored as a `vector<vector<int>>`, which can lead to inefficient memory access patterns.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   To optimize this code, we can:
    - Pass the grid `N` by reference to avoid copying it in every recursive call to `on()`.
    - Replace the recursion in `calc()` with an iterative approach using a queue.
    - Store the grid as a 2D array instead of a `vector<vector<int>>` to improve cache locality.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    - Pass the grid `N` by reference: This avoids the overhead of copying the entire grid for every recursive call to `on()`. This can significantly reduce the time complexity and memory usage of the program.
    - Replace recursion with iteration: The function `calc()` uses recursion to perform a flood-fill operation. For large grids, this can lead to a stack overflow. By replacing the recursion with an iterative approach using a queue, we can avoid this problem and improve the performance of the program.
    - Use a 2D array: The grid is stored as a `vector<vector<int>>`. Accessing elements in this data structure can be inefficient due to poor cache locality. By storing the grid as a 2D array, we can improve cache locality and hence the performance of the program.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int w, h, Col;
typedef pair<int, int> C;
typedef int P[8][8];
P V;
int dx[4] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int dy[4] = {1, 0, -1, 0};
int res;
P temp;
int tres = 0;
void calc(int y, int x) {
  queue<C> q;
  q.push({y, x});
  while (!q.empty()) {
    auto [cy, cx] = q.front();
    q.pop();
    if (cy < 0 || cx < 0 || cx >= w || cy >= h || temp[cy][cx] != Col)
      continue;
    tres++;
    temp[cy][cx] = 0;
    for (int r = 0; r < 4; r++)
      q.push({cy + dy[r], cx + dx[r]});
  }
}
void on(P &N, int count, int c) {
  if (count == 5) {
    memcpy(temp, N, sizeof(temp));
    tres = 0;
    calc(0, 0);
    res = max(res, tres);
    return;
  }
  int nc = N[0][0];
  queue<C> Q;
  Q.push(make_pair(0, 0));
  bool used[8][8];
  memset(used, false, sizeof(used));
  int tres = 0;
  while (!Q.empty()) {
    C now = Q.front();
    Q.pop();
    if (used[now.first][now.second])
      continue;
    used[now.first][now.second] = true;
    N[now.first][now.second] = c;
    for (int r = 0; r < 4; r++) {
      int ny = now.first + dy[r], nx = now.second + dx[r];
      if (ny < 0 || nx < 0 || ny >= h || nx >= w)
        continue;
      if (N[ny][nx] == nc)
        Q.push(make_pair(ny, nx));
    }
  }
  if (count != 4)
    for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++)
      on(N, count + 1, i);
  else
    on(N, count + 1, Col);
}
void solve() {
  res = 0;
  memset(V, 0, sizeof(V));
  for (int y = 0; y < h; y++)
    for (int x = 0; x < w; x++) {
      cin >> V[y][x];
    }
  for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
    if (V[0][0] != i)
      on(V, 0, i);
  }
  cout << res << endl;
}
int main() {
  while (cin >> h >> w >> Col) {
    if (w == 0)
      break;
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
