Code Analysis:
This code reads two integers as input and prints their multiplication and the sum of their doubles. The program is simple and doesn't contain any loops, recursive calls, or complex data structures. There's no apparent memory inefficiency. However, a small optimization can be made in the computation section.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Reducing Computations: The code calculates 'a * 2' and 'b * 2' separately which results in two multiplication operations. We can bring down the number of multiplication operations to one by factoring out the common 2.

Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
   int a;
   int b;
   std::cin >> a >> b;
   
   // Factoring out the common multiplier '2' to reduce the multiplication operation
   std::cout << a * b << " " << 2 * (a + b) << std::endl;
}
```

Explanation:
The optimized code reduces the number of multiplication operations by one. The sum of 'a' and 'b' is multiplied by 2 instead of multiplying 'a' and 'b' separately by 2. This results in a slight performance gain by reducing the number of CPU instructions. 

This optimization doesn't have a significant impact on the performance of this particular program because it's a simple mathematical operation. However, it could have a noticeable impact in a larger program where such computations occur inside a loop or are part of a critical path.

The trade-off here is negligible. The code complexity does not increase and it's just as easy to understand and maintain as the original code. The functionality and output remain the same. The code remains clear and readable.
