The provided code is a simple C++ program that reads two integer inputs and outputs their product and the sum of their doubled values. It's a very simple program without any noticeable performance issues.

However, assuming this code is a part of a larger system where performance optimization is key, there are a few basic modifications that could be made to reduce the number of operations and potentially enhance the performance:

1. **Avoiding Repeated Computations**: The multiplication operation is performed three times in the code. We can reduce this by reusing the result of the first multiplication operation (a * b) and storing it in a variable.

2. **Better Variable Initialization**: Instead of declaring variables 'a' and 'b' separately, we can initialize them on the same line. While this does not improve performance, it does make the code cleaner and easier to read.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int a, b; // Initialize variables on the same line
  std::cin >> a >> b;

  int product = a * b; // Calculate product once and store it

  std::cout << product << " " << (product << 1) - (a + b) << std::endl; // Reuse product and use bit shift for doubling
}
```

In the optimized code, I've made the following changes:

1. **Single Line Initialization**: Variables 'a' and 'b' are declared on the same line to make the code cleaner.

2. **Store Product**: The product of 'a' and 'b' is calculated once and stored in a variable called 'product'. This reduces the number of multiplication operations from 3 to 1.

3. **Reuse Product and Use Bit Shift**: The product is reused when calculating the sum of the doubled values. Also, instead of multiplying the product by 2 (product * 2), I use a bit shift operation (product << 1), which is equivalent but typically faster. However, this is a micro-optimization and modern compilers may already optimize this automatically.

Please note that these optimizations will not lead to significant performance improvements for this simple program, but they serve as examples of the kinds of performance tuning that could be applied in a larger, more complex codebase.
