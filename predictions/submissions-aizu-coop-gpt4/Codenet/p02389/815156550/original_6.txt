The given code is very straightforward and quite optimized already. It takes two input integers, computes their product and the sum of each integer multiplied by two. However, there are still a few minor optimizations that can be applied:

1. **Avoid Unnecessary Variable Declaration**: The variables `a` and `b` are declared separately. This can be slightly optimized by declaring them together on the same line.

2. **Reduce Number of Operations**: The expression `a * 2 + b * 2` performs two multiplication operations. By factoring out the common factor `2`, we can reduce this to a single multiplication operation.

3. **Input/Output Stream Optimization**: I/O operations are generally expensive. We can use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to unsynchronize C++'s `iostream` objects from C's `stdio` objects. This can potentially speed up I/O operations. Also, we can use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl` as it does not cause a flush operation which can be costly.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;

  std::cout << a * b << " " << 2 * (a + b) << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version:

1. The variables `a` and `b` are declared on the same line, reducing the number of declarations.
2. The expression `a * 2 + b * 2` is replaced with `2 * (a + b)`, reducing the number of multiplication operations.
3. The I/O stream is optimized with `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`, and `'\n'` is used in place of `std::endl` to avoid unnecessary flush operations.

However, it's important to mention that these optimizations are very minor and the performance improvement will be barely noticeable. Also, the use of `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` may lead to undefined behaviors when mixing C++ and C style I/O operations. In this case, it's safe because we are only using C++ style I/O operations.
