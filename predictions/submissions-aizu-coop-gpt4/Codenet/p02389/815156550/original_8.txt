The given code is quite simple and already quite efficient. It reads two integers from the standard input, computes their product and the sum of their doubles, and outputs these two values to the standard output.

However, there are a few micro optimizations that can be applied:

1. **Use of Fast I/O Operations**: The iostream operations in C++ are comparatively slower than C-style I/O operations. We can use scanf and printf instead of cin and cout for faster I/O operations.

2. **Redundant Computations**: The code multiplies a and b twice. We can avoid this redundancy by storing the result of the multiplication in a variable and reusing it.

3. **Compiler Optimization**: Compiler flags like -O2 or -O3 can be used while compiling the program to optimize the code further. These flags tell the compiler to focus on code optimization during the compilation process.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);  // fast input

    int product = a * b;  // store the result of multiplication

    printf("%d %d\n", product, a * 2 + b * 2);  // fast output

    return 0;
}
```
When compiling this program, use -O2 or -O3 flag for further compiler optimization.

Please note that these optimizations may not have a significant impact on the overall performance of the program due to its simplicity and small size. However, these strategies can be beneficial when dealing with larger and more complex programs. Any trade-off in this case would be increased code complexity vs. performance gain. But since the code is simple, this trade-off is negligible.
