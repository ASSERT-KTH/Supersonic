The given code is relatively simple and doesn't contain loops, unnecessary computations, or inefficient data structures, which are usually the main targets for optimization in larger and more complex programs. However, there are still minor optimizations that can be made to improve the performance and efficiency of the code.

Here's the optimization strategy:

1. Perform I/O operations more efficiently: The 'std::cin' and 'std::cout' operations are slower as they are synchronized with the C standard library's 'stdio' functions by default. Disabling this synchronization can improve performance, especially when there are many I/O operations.

2. Reduce the number of I/O operations: Multiple 'std::cout' operations can be combined into one, which can help to boost performance.

3. Store the result of a * b first: Since the multiplication operation is used twice, it's better to store the result first and then use it, which saves one multiplication operation.

Here's the optimized code with detailed comments:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);  // Disable synchronization with stdio
  std::cin.tie(NULL);  // Untie cin from cout

  int a;
  int b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;

  int mult = a * b;  // Store the result of a * b first
  std::cout << mult << " " << (a + b) * 2 << std::endl;  // Combine 'std::cout' operations into one

  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:
- The optimization of disabling synchronization with the C standard library's stdio functions and untieing cin from cout will make the I/O operations faster, but it may cause issues if the program also uses C-style I/O or if it relies on the synchronization for correct behavior.
- Storing the result of 'a * b' first slightly increases memory usage, but it saves one multiplication operation, which can be a worthwhile trade-off especially for larger inputs.
