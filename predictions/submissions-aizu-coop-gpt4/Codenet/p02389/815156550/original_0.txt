The given code is simple, clean and already quite efficient. It reads two values from the user and performs two operations - multiplication and addition. However, there are still a few minor improvements we could make to further optimize it.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Variable Initialization:** In C++, uninitialized variables can lead to undefined behavior. To avoid this, we can initialize the variables `a` and `b` when we declare them.

2. **I/O Stream Optimization:** The `std::endl` not only inserts a newline character, but also flushes the output buffer. If performance is a concern, using `"\n"` is faster because it doesn't perform a flush operation.

3. **Compiler Optimization:** Compiler optimizations can significantly improve the performance of the code. The `-O2` flag can be used to enable all optimization that does not involve a space-speed tradeoff.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. We will initialize variables `a` and `b` with `0` when we declare them. This ensures that they always have a defined value.

2. We will replace `std::endl` with `"\n"`. `std::endl` is generally used to insert a newline character and flush the stream. However, the flush operation can be costly in terms of performance, and is unnecessary in this case.

3. Use `-O2` flag for compiler optimization. This optimization level performs nearly all supported optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff. It increases both compilation time and the performance of the generated code.

**Optimized Code Block:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a = 0;
  int b = 0;
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  std::cout << a * b << " " << a * 2 + b * 2 << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
To compile the code with optimization, use the following command:
```
g++ -O2 -o program program.cpp
```
In this optimized version, the functionality and output of the original code are preserved while making it slightly more efficient. However, the improvements in this case are minimal due to the simplicity of the original code.
