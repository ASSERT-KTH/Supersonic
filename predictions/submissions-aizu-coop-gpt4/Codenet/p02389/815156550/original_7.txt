Code Analysis:
This is a simple C++ program that reads two integers from the user and prints their product and the sum of their doubles. The code is already quite optimized, but there are a few minor changes we can make to further improve performance.

Optimization Strategy:
  1. Instead of declaring variables `a` and `b` separately, we can declare them on the same line to save a few clock cycles.
  2. The operation `"a * 2 + b * 2"` can be optimized by using the mathematical formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is `2 * (a + b)`. This reduces the number of multiplications from 2 to 1, which can result in a slight performance improvement.
  3. Use '\n' instead of std::endl to print new line. std::endl does more than just a newline, it also flushes the stream, which might be an expensive operation.

Optimization Explanation:
  1. Declaring multiple variables of the same type on one line reduces the number of operations that the compiler needs to perform, therefore saving a few clock cycles.
  2. The mathematical formula for the perimeter of a rectangle performs one multiplication operation instead of two, which can result in a slight performance improvement.
  3. Using '\n' instead of std::endl for printing a new line improves efficiency because std::endl flushes the stream, which might be an expensive operation.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  
  std::cout << a * b << " " << 2 * (a + b) << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimization in this code is minimal because the original code is already quite optimized. These improvements might not result in noticeable performance gains for this specific program due to its simplicity. However, they can be useful in more complex programs where these operations are performed multiple times.
