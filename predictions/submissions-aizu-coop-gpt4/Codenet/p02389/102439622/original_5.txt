The given block of code is a simple C program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. Here are the steps to optimize the code:

1. **Code Analysis**: The code is straightforward but there are some areas where it can be optimized. The main area where it can be improved is the computation of the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

2. **Optimization Strategy**:

   A. Removing unnecessary use of variables: The variables `a` and `b` are used only for holding the input values and for computation. We can directly use these variables in the `printf` function to calculate the area and perimeter.

   B. Use of compiler optimization: We can use compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to allow the compiler to automatically optimize the code. This flag tells the compiler to perform optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, etc. However, in this case, the program is quite simple and does not have any loops or functions to inline.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:

   A. The first step involves removing the extra variables `area` and `c`. Instead of calculating the area and perimeter and storing them in separate variables, we directly compute these values in the `printf` function. This reduces memory usage.

   B. We recommend using compiler optimization flags when compiling the program. These flags allow the compiler to perform various optimizations that can speed up the execution of the program. In this case, since the program is quite simple, the compiler would not be able to perform much optimization.

4. **Trade-offs**: The optimization does not introduce any significant trade-offs. However, it's worth noting that by removing the variables `area` and `c`, the code becomes slightly less readable. This is because the `printf` function now performs the computations of area and perimeter, which are not immediately obvious from just reading the function call.

5. **Optimized Code Block**:
```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  printf("%d %d\n", a*b, a*2 + b*2);
  return 0;
}
```
Remember to compile this program with optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to allow the compiler to perform any possible optimizations. For example, you would use the command `gcc -O2 program.c` to compile this program with the `-O2` optimization level.
