The given code is relatively simple and has minimal potential for optimization. However, there are a few minor changes that can be made to optimize the performance of the program.

1. **Code Analysis:**
   The code is a simple program that reads two integers as input, calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle with sides of the input lengths, and then prints the results. There are no loops, recursive calls, or complex data structures that might be inefficient or slow.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**
   1. **Inlining**: The calculation of the area and perimeter can be inlined in the printf statement to save memory.
   2. **Removing unnecessary variables**: The variables 'area' and 'c' are unnecessary and can be removed.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
   1. **Inlining**: Instead of calculating the area and perimeter and storing them in variables, we can calculate them directly in the printf statement. This saves memory because we no longer need to store the results in variables. 
   2. **Removing unnecessary variables**: By inlining the calculations, we can remove the variables 'area' and 'c'. This makes the code simpler and saves memory.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  printf("%d %d\n", a * b, a * 2 + b * 2);
  return 0;
}
```

The trade-off in this optimization is readability versus performance. Some may argue that storing results in variables makes the code more readable, as it's clear what each calculation is for. In this case, the trade-off is minimal, as the calculations are simple and their purposes are clear even without the variables.
