This is a simple C program that takes two integers as input, calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle, and prints the results. The program is already small and simple, but there are a few minor optimizations we can do to improve its performance:

1. We can remove the temporary variable `c` that is used to store the perimeter of the rectangle. Instead, we can calculate the perimeter directly in the `printf` function. This reduces memory usage by eliminating the need for the temporary variable.

2. We can also combine the multiplication operations into a single expression which could potentially lower the number of CPU instructions.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  // Combine area and perimeter calculation into single printf statement
  printf("%d %d\n", a * b, 2 * (a + b));
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the changes:

- Removed the `area` and `c` variables. Their calculations are now directly in the `printf` statement. This reduces memory usage by eliminating the need for two integer variables.
- The perimeter calculation is now `2 * (a + b)`, which could be slightly faster than `a * 2 + b * 2` due to fewer operations.

Trade-offs:

- The code is slightly less readable than before, as the calculations are now embedded within the `printf` statement. Comments are important in this case to ensure that the code's functionality is clear.
- The optimized code is essentially the same as the original in terms of functionality. The performance gain might be negligible as this is a very small program. However, the principles applied here are more relevant for larger, more complex programs.
