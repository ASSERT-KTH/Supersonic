The provided code is a simple C program that reads two integers from the standard input, treats them as the lengths of the sides of a rectangle, calculates the area and the perimeter of the rectangle, and prints them to the standard output. 

The program is straightforward and efficient; however, there are a couple of small improvements that could be made to optimize the code further:

1. **Avoiding Redundant Multiplications**: The expressions `a * 2` and `b * 2` could be simplified to `a << 1` and `b << 1` respectively, using bitwise left shift operator. This transformation can be faster than multiplication in some architectures.
   
2. **Optimizing `printf` Call**: The `printf` function is typically slower than other output functions due to its flexibility and the variable number of arguments it can process. If performance is a critical factor, using a faster output function could be beneficial. However, in this case, since we are dealing with a simple program where the output operation is not a bottleneck, changing `printf` to another function might not bring significant improvement. Also, it's worth noting that replacing `printf` might make the code less readable or portable. Therefore, we will keep the `printf` function as it is.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

  int area = a * b;  // Calculation of the area
  int perimeter = (a << 1) + (b << 1);  // Calculation of the perimeter using bitwise shift instead of multiplication

  printf("%d %d\n", area, perimeter);

  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the benefits of these optimizations are minimal and might not be noticeable in a simple program like this. The effectiveness of such optimizations generally comes into play in larger programs, particularly when dealing with more complex calculations or operations being executed many times.
