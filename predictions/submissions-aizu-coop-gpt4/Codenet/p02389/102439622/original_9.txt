This code is already quite efficient, but we can make a few minor tweaks to optimize it slightly. Below are some potential areas for optimization:

1. **Code Analysis:**
   The code takes two integer inputs, calculates the area and the perimeter of a rectangle with sides of these lengths, and then prints the results. The operations in the code are very basic and straightforward. 

2. **Optimization Strategy:**
   1. Reducing Memory Usage: We can directly use the input variables a and b in the printf statement instead of storing the results in the area and c variables.
   2. Redundant Computations: There are no redundant computations in this code.
   3. Loop Optimizations: There are no loops in this code to optimize.
   4. Compiler Optimizations: The code is simple and does not require any specific compiler optimization flags.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
   1. Reducing Memory Usage: By eliminating the area and c variables, we reduce the memory footprint of the program. This is a small gain for this simple program, but it's a good practice for larger, more complex programs.
   2. Trade-offs: The trade-off in this case is the readability of the code. By removing the area and c variables, we make the code slightly less readable. However, the formulae used are very basic (area and perimeter of a rectangle), so the impact on readability is minimal.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  // Print the area (a*b) and perimeter (2*(a+b)) directly
  printf("%d %d\n", a*b, 2*(a+b));
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, we have eliminated the area and c variables, reducing the memory usage. We are directly calculating and printing the area and perimeter in the printf statement. The performance improvement will be minimal, but it's a good practice to avoid unnecessary variables in more complex codes.
