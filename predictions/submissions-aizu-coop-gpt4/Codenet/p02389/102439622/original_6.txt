This is a very simple program with limited scope for optimization, but we can still make some minor tweaks to improve performance. 

1. Code Analysis:

The code basically takes two integers as input, calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle with sides equal to the inputs, and then prints the results. There are no significant performance bottlenecks, inefficient memory usage, or complex computations that would benefit from optimization in this code.

2. Optimization Strategy:

   A. No inefficient data structures are being used.
   
   B. There is a redundant computation of 'a * 2' and 'b * 2' which can be computed once and stored in a variable.
   
   C. There are no loops or recursive calls to optimize.
   
   D. No specific compiler optimizations or pragma directives are necessary for this simple code.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   A. To minimize the redundant computation, we can calculate 'a * 2' and 'b * 2' once and store the result in separate variables. This will reduce the number of multiplications from 4 to 2. This might be a negligible gain in this simple case, but it's a good programming practice to avoid redundant computations.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  int doubleA = a * 2;  // calculate 'a * 2' once
  int doubleB = b * 2;  // calculate 'b * 2' once
  int area = a * b;
  int c = doubleA + doubleB;  // use the pre-calculated values
  printf("%d %d\n", area, c);
}
```

Please note that the improvements in this case are minimal and won't have a noticeable impact on the performance. This is because the input size is very small and the computations are not complex. However, the principle of avoiding redundant computations is a good practice and can lead to significant improvements in more complex programs.
