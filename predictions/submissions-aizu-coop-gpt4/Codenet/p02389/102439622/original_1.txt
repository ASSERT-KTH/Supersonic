The given code is already quite efficient, as it's a simple program that reads two numbers, calculates the area and the perimeter of a rectangle with sides of those lengths, and prints the results. However, some minor improvements can still be made:

Code Analysis:
1. Redundant computations: There are no redundant computations. Each computation (multiplication or addition) is necessary and used just once.
2. Inefficient data structures: No data structures are used in this code.
3. Loops and recursive calls: There are no loops or recursive calls in this code.
4. Compiler optimizations: There are no compiler optimizations, but this code doesn't need any.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The two multiplications (a * b and a * 2) can be combined into one operation by storing the result of a * 2 in a variable. This would reduce the number of multiplications from two to one, which could be a slight performance improvement depending on the compiler and architecture.
2. Changing the order of operations in the calculation of the perimeter can reduce the number of arithmetic operations. Instead of calculating a * 2 + b * 2, we can calculate 2 * (a + b). This reduces the number of operations from three (two multiplications and one addition) to two (one addition and one multiplication).

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Store the result of a * 2 in a variable. This avoids the necessity of performing this multiplication twice.
2. Use the formula 2 * (a + b) to compute the perimeter. This reduces the number of arithmetic operations.

Trade-offs: 
There are no significant trade-offs in this optimization. The code becomes slightly more complex due to the additional variable, but the potential performance gain outweighs this minor increase in complexity.

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  
  int doubleA = a * 2; // store the result of a * 2 in a variable
  int area = doubleA * b; // use the stored result to calculate the area
  int c = doubleA + b * 2; // use the stored result to calculate the perimeter
  
  printf("%d %d\n", area, c);
}
```
