The given code is a simple C program that takes two integer inputs, calculates their product (representing an area), and calculates their sum multiplied by 2 (representing a perimeter). The results are then printed out. 

As the code is straightforward and simple, there are not many performance bottlenecks to address. However, there are minor optimizations we can apply:

1. **Use of register storage class:** The variables `a` and `b` are frequently accessed for calculation. Making them register variables can potentially speed up the execution as it may store these variables in the register of the microprocessor.

2. **Direct Calculation:** Rather than calculating and storing the area and perimeter in separate variables (`area` and `c`), we can directly print these values. This reduces the memory footprint of the program.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  register int a, b; 
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  printf("%d %d\n", a * b, a * 2 + b * 2); // Directly print area and perimeter
}
```

**Trade-offs:**
1. The use of register storage class is a suggestion to the compiler. The compilers may not honor this request in some scenarios. If they do, it may speed up the execution but at the same time it might limit the number of register variables because the number of registers is limited.
   
2. Direct calculation and printing of the results make the code less readable. In larger programs, it might be harder to understand what each calculation represents.
