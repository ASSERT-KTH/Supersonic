The given code is a simple C program that takes two integers as input and computes the area and perimeter of a rectangle with sides of length equal to the input values.

This program is already quite efficient, as there are no loops or complex data structures that could potentially slow it down. However, there are a few minor tweaks that we can make to improve the performance, such as avoiding redundant computations and enabling compiler optimizations.

### Optimization Strategy:
1. **Redundant Computations:** The program calculates the perimeter as `a * 2 + b * 2`. While this calculation is not computationally expensive, we can slightly optimize it by factoring out the common factor of `2`. This reduces the number of multiplications from two to one.

2. **Compiler Optimizations:** Modern compilers like GCC and Clang have flags that instruct them to optimize the generated code. Using these flags can help the compiler generate more efficient machine code which can run faster. The `-O2` flag, for example, instructs the compiler to perform all optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.

### Optimized Code:

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  
  // Compute area and perimeter using optimized calculations
  int area = a * b;
  int perimeter = 2 * (a + b);  // Factored out the common factor of 2
  
  printf("%d %d\n", area, perimeter);
  
  return 0;
}
```

When compiling this code, use the `-O2` flag to enable optimizations:

```bash
gcc -O2 program.c -o program
```

### Trade-offs:

The trade-off in this case is negligible. The optimization step made the code slightly more readable by avoiding redundant computations, and it did not significantly increase the code complexity.


While compiler optimizations can improve the performance of the generated code, they can sometimes make debugging more difficult because the generated machine code may not correspond directly to the source code. In this simple case, however, this trade-off is negligible.
