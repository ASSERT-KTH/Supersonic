Code Analysis:

The given code is a dynamic programming (DP) solution to a problem, presumably related to combinatorics or number partitioning. The code is reading the number of elements `N` and a value `W`, then it reads `N` elements into the array `w`. It then initializes a 3D DP table `dp` and populates the table in a bottom-up fashion.

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:

1. The first potential issue is the size of the DP table. The dimensions of the table are [2][10001][202] which amounts to approximately 4 million entries. This can be quite memory intensive.
2. The second potential bottleneck is the nested loop structure used to fill the DP table. The runtime complexity of this code is O(N*W*N), which can be quite large if `N` and `W` are large.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Space Optimization: We can notice that the DP table's first dimension switches between two values, i.e., `i%2` and `(i+1)%2`. This indicates that we are only using two layers of the DP table at any given time. Hence, we can reduce the DP table to a 2D matrix, drastically reducing the memory usage.
2. Loop Optimization: We are iterating over `N` in the innermost loop, but many of these iterations may be redundant, especially when `w[k] > w[i]`. We can optimize this by rearranging the loop order.
3. Avoiding Modulus Operation: The modulus operation is computationally expensive. We can avoid it by performing the modulus operation only when the DP value exceeds `mod`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Space Optimization: We can reduce the 3D DP table to a 2D matrix. Instead of keeping track of `i`, we keep track of `cur` and `nxt`, and these only take two values, `0` and `1`. So, we only need a 2D matrix [2][202] instead of a 3D matrix. This reduces memory usage significantly.
2. Loop Optimization: In the code, the innermost loop runs for `k` from `0` to `N` inclusive. But when `w[k] > w[i]`, we are not making any updates to `dp[nxt][j][k]`. Hence, we can break the loop as soon as `w[k] > w[i]`. This optimizes the number of iterations in the innermost loop.
3. Avoiding Modulus Operation: The modulus operation is performed in every iteration, even when `dp[nxt][j][k]` is not exceeding `mod`. We can add a condition to check if `dp[nxt][j][k]` exceeds `mod` before we perform the modulus operation. This reduces the number of expensive modulus operations.

Trade-offs:

The primary trade-off in this optimization is that the code might become slightly more complex due to the additional condition for modulus operation. This might affect code readability but improves performance.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int mod = 1000000007;
int N, W;
int w[201];
ll dp[2][202];
int main() {
  cin >> N >> W;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> w[i];
  for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
    if (j <= W)
      dp[N % 2][N] = 1;
    else
      dp[N % 2][N] = 0;
  }
  for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int cur = (i + 1) % 2;
    int nxt = (i) % 2;
    for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k <= N; k++) {
        if (w[k] > w[i]) break; // loop optimization
        dp[nxt][k] = 0;
        int nmwidx = k;
        if (k == N || w[k] > w[i])
          nmwidx = i;
        dp[nxt][k] += dp[cur][nmwidx];
        if (j + w[i] <= W)
          dp[nxt][k] += dp[cur][j + w[i]];
        if (dp[nxt][k] >= mod) // avoid modulus operation
          dp[nxt][k] %= mod;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << dp[0][N] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should provide a substantial improvement in both runtime and memory usage.
