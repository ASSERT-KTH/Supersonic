1. Code Analysis: 

The provided code seems to be the implementation of a dynamic programming algorithm. It is used to solve a problem related to subset sum or knapsack, where we are given a number of items (weights) and a maximum weight capacity (W). The goal of the algorithm is to find the number of ways to choose subsets of items such that the total weight of the chosen subset is less than or equal to W.

The dynamic programming table (dp) has three dimensions. The first dimension is used to alternate between two states (i and i+1). The second dimension is the total weight of the chosen items. The third dimension is the index of the smallest weight in the chosen items.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Inefficient data structures: The dp array has a size of 2x10001x202, which is quite large. However, it seems we are using only two slices of the first dimension at a time. Reducing this dimension to just 2 can save memory.

B. Redundant computations: The current code calculates "nmwidx" and uses it in multiple places. We can calculate "nmwidx" once and use the result everywhere.

C. Loops: The given code has nested loops. The inner loops iterate from 0 to N and 0 to 10001. It might be possible to reduce the number of iterations by initializing the dp array more efficiently.

D. Compiler optimizations: Compiler level optimizations can be turned on to further improve the performance of the code. For example, using the -O3 flag in g++ enables all optimization flags.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. We will decrease the size of the first dimension of the dp array from N to 2. This change will reduce the memory usage of the program.

B. We will calculate the "nmwidx" once and use its value in the subsequent calculations. This change will reduce the number of operations in the program.

C. We will initialize the dp array in a more efficient way. Instead of using nested loops to initialize the dp array, we will use memset to fill the array with zeros. This change will reduce the number of iterations in the program.

D. We will use the -O3 flag when compiling the program. This flag enables all optimization flags, which can improve the performance of the code.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int mod = 1000000007;
int N, W;
int w[201];
ll dp[2][10001][202];
int main() {
  cin >> N >> W;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> w[i];
  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp)); // Initialize entire dp table to 0
  for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
    for (int k = 0; k <= N; k++) {
      if (j <= W && (k == N || w[k] + j > W))
        dp[N % 2][j][k] = 1;
    }
  }
  for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int cur = (i + 1) % 2;
    int nxt = (i) % 2;
    for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k <= N; k++) {
        int nmwidx = (k == N || w[k] > w[i]) ? i : k; // Calculate nmwidx once
        dp[nxt][j][k] = dp[cur][j][nmwidx];
        if (j + w[i] <= W)
          dp[nxt][j][k] += dp[cur][j + w[i]][k];
        dp[nxt][j][k] %= mod;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << dp[0][0][N] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Compile the program with -O3 flag to enable all optimization flags:
```
g++ -O3 -o optimized_program optimized_program.cpp
```
