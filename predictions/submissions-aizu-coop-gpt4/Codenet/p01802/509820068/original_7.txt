Code Analysis:
The code reads two integers, `d` and `e`, from the input stream until both of them are zero. For each pair of non-zero integers, it calculates the minimum "gap" which is the absolute difference between `e` and the Euclidean distance of two points `(i, j)` where `i + j = d`. The Euclidean distance is calculated using the formula `sqrt(i * i + j * j)` and the gap is calculated as `sqrt((cost - e) * (cost - e))`. The minimum gap is then printed to the output stream.

Potential performance bottlenecks are:

1. The nested loop that runs from `i = 0` to `d` and `j = i` to `d`. The complexity of the nested loop is O(d^2/2), which is quite high.

Optimization Strategy:

1. The inner loop can start from `j = d - i` since the condition `i + j == d` needs to be satisfied.

2. The calculation of cost can be optimized. The cost is recalculated for every pair of `(i, j)`, even though it is only needed when `i + j == d`. We can move its calculation inside the if condition.

3. The calculation of the gap involves unnecessary multiplication and square root operations. We can replace it with the absolute value of the difference, which is equivalent and computationally cheaper.

4. `min` is a standard function in the STL library. It can be replaced with another variable name to avoid confusion.

Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int d, e;
  while (1) {
    cin >> d >> e;
    if (d == 0 && e == 0)
      break;
    double minGap = 1e5;  // renamed from min to minGap
    for (int i = 0; i <= d; i++) {
      int j = d - i;  // calculate j based on i and d
      double cost = sqrt(i * i + j * j);  // moved inside the if statement
      double gap = abs(cost - e);  // replaced with abs()
      if (gap < minGap) {
        minGap = gap;
      }
    }
    cout << minGap << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code reduces the time complexity from O(d^2) to O(d), and eliminates unnecessary calculations. It provides the same result as the original code but is more efficient. The trade-off is that the code might be slightly more difficult to understand, especially for beginners. However, the benefits of the optimization outweigh this minor disadvantage.
