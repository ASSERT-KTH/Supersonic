The above C++ program seems to be a brute force solution for a problem where it takes two inputs 'd' and 'e', then it tries to find the pair of integers 'i' and 'j' (where 'i' and 'j' are less than or equal to 'd' and sum of 'i' and 'j' is 'd') which makes the difference between the Euclidean distance (sqrt(i*i + j*j)) and 'e' minimal. 

1. **Code Analysis**:
    - The outer loop runs 'd' times and the inner loop also runs 'd' times, which makes the runtime complexity O(d^2). Hence, this can be a potential performance bottleneck for large values of 'd'.
    - Unnecessary computation of sqrt() function in every iteration even when 'i+j' is not equal to 'd'.
    - The program uses the standard library math function sqrt() which is computationally expensive.

2. **Optimization Strategy**:
    - We can optimize the nested for loop by removing the redundancy. Since i+j should be equal to 'd', we can directly calculate one variable based on the other.
    - We can optimize the calculation of the Euclidean distance and the gap by reducing the number of computationally expensive sqrt() function calls.
    - We can use compiler level optimization to optimize the math function calls.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    - Since the sum of 'i' and 'j' should be equal to 'd', we don't need to run two nested loops. We can compute 'j' as 'd-i'. This will reduce the time complexity from O(d^2) to O(d).
    - We can move the calculation of 'cost' and 'gap' inside the 'if' condition to avoid unnecessary computation.
    - We can use compiler level optimization (-Ofast) to optimize the sqrt() function calls. However, use this optimization carefully as it can sometimes lead to incorrect results for floating point numbers.

4. **Optimized Code Block**:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <math.h>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int d, e;
  while (1) {
    cin >> d >> e;
    double min = 100000;
    if (d == 0 && e == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i <= d; i++) {
      int j = d - i; // Calculate 'j' based on 'i'
      double cost = sqrt(i * i + j * j); // Move inside the loop
      double gap = abs(cost - e); // Use abs() instead of sqrt() to calculate the gap
      if (gap < min) {
        min = gap;
      }
    }
    cout << min << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: Compile the above code with -Ofast optimization flag.

```bash
g++ -Ofast -o program program.cpp
```
