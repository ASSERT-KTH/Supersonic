Code Analysis:
The given program is a simple console application that reads two integers, 'd' and 'e', and then performs some calculations based on these inputs. The calculations are within two nested loops, which iterate over the range 0 to 'd' inclusive. The program calculates 'cost' as the square root of the sum of the squares of 'i' and 'j' (essentially calculating the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle). Then, it calculates the 'gap' as the difference between 'cost' and 'e', squared and square-rooted. If this 'gap' is less than a 'min' value, it updates 'min'. The program continues to read 'd' and 'e' until both are 0. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: Not applicable as no data structures are used.
2. Redundant or unnecessary computations: The 'cost' and 'gap' calculations are performed even when 'i' and 'j' don't add up to 'd'. This extra computation can be avoided.
3. Optimization of loops or recursive calls: The inner loop is unnecessarily iterating from 'i' to 'd'. It can start at 'd - i' instead, which will significantly reduce the number of iterations.
4. Compiler optimizations or pragma directives: Consider using the '-O3' compiler optimization flag for maximum speed during the compilation process.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Move the 'cost' and 'gap' computations inside the condition that checks if 'i' + 'j' equals 'd'. This avoids unnecessary calculations when the condition isn't met.
2. Start the inner loop from 'd - i' instead of 'i'. This reduces the number of iterations and hence the running time of the program.
3. Compile the optimized program with the '-O3' compiler flag to allow the compiler to perform additional optimizations like function inlining, loop unrolling, etc.

Trade-offs: The code complexity will slightly increase due to the changes in the loop structure. However, the trade-off is worth it considering the significant performance boost.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int d, e;
  while (1) {
    cin >> d >> e;
    double min = 100000;
    if (d == 0 && e == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i <= d; i++) {
      for (int j = d - i; j <= d; j++) {
        if (i + j == d) {
          double cost = sqrt(i * i + j * j);
          double gap = sqrt((cost - e) * (cost - e));
          if (gap < min) {
            min = gap;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    cout << min << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized version, the inner loop starts from 'd - i', reducing the number of iterations. Also, the 'cost' and 'gap' calculations are inside the condition that checks if 'i' + 'j' equals 'd', avoiding unnecessary computations.
