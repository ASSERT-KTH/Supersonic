**Code Analysis**

This C++ program accepts an infinite series of pairs of integers until it encounters a pair of zeroes. For each pair (d, e), it calculates the minimum gap between a certain cost and the second number 'e'. The cost is calculated as the square root of the sum of squares of two numbers (i, j) such that i+j equals 'd'. The gap is the square of the difference between the cost and 'e'. The program finally prints out the minimum gap for each pair (d, e).

**Optimization Strategy**

1. **Inefficient Loops**: The nested for-loop in the current program is a significant performance bottleneck. For each pair of numbers, it iterates from 0 to 'd' twice, leading to a time complexity of O(d^2). We can simplify this by using only one loop.

2. **Redundant Computations**: The program calculates sqrt(i * i + j * j) and sqrt((cost - e) * (cost - e)) in each iteration, which is unnecessary. We can reduce the number of computations by storing the intermediate results.

3. **Compiler Optimizations**: We can use the -O3 optimization flag when compiling the program. This will enable all optimization flags, including those that increase execution speed and decrease program size.

4. **Data Types**: Using 'double' data type for variables that can hold 'int' values is inefficient in terms of memory usage.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **Simplify the Loops**: Instead of using a nested loop to find pairs of numbers that sum up to 'd', we can accomplish this with a single loop. For each number 'i' from 0 to 'd', we can calculate 'j' as 'd' - 'i', which also satisfies the condition i + j = d.

2. **Reduce Redundant Computations**: Instead of calculating sqrt(i * i + j * j) in every iteration, we can store the result in a variable 'cost'. Similarly, we can store the result of sqrt((cost - e) * (cost - e)) in a variable 'gap'. This way, we only need to calculate these values once.

3. **Compiler Optimizations**: When compiling the program, we can use the -O3 optimization flag to speed up the execution and reduce the program size.

4. **Use Appropriate Data Types**: We can replace the 'double' data type with 'int' where possible to save memory.

**Trade-offs**: The above optimizations improve the performance and reduce memory usage. However, they may make the code slightly more complex to understand.

**Optimized Code Block**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int d, e;
  while (1) {
    cin >> d >> e;
    if (d == 0 && e == 0)
      break;
    double min_gap = 1e6;
    for (int i = 0; i <= d; i++) {
      int j = d - i;
      double cost = sqrt(i * i + j * j);
      double gap = abs(cost - e);
      min_gap = min(min_gap, gap);
    }
    cout << min_gap << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This program has a time complexity of O(d), which is significantly faster than the original O(d^2). It also uses less memory, thanks to the efficient use of data types.
