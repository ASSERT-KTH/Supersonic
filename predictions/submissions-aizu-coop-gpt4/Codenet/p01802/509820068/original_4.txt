### Code Analysis

The provided code takes two integers, `d` and `e`, as input in an infinite loop. When both `d` and `e` are zero, the loop breaks. For each pair of `d` and `e`, it calculates the minimum `gap` which is the difference between the `cost` (`sqrt(i * i + j * j)`) and `e`. Here, `i` and `j` are two integers that sum up to `d`. 

### Optimization Strategy

1. **Inefficient computations:** The code contains nested loops where it checks for all pairs `(i, j)` such that `i + j = d`. This is a highly inefficient computation as it has a time complexity of O(n^2). It can be simplified to a single loop with `i` ranging from `0` to `d`, and `j` being `d - i`.

2. **Redundant computations:** The calculation of `cost` and `gap` is done for each pair `(i, j)`. However, `cost` calculation which involves square root operation is computationally expensive and can be optimized by eliminating the redundant calculations.

3. **Use of `std::endl`:** `std::endl` not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output buffer, which can be a costly operation. Using `'\n'` instead can provide a performance boost.

### Step-By-Step Explanation

1. **Optimizing the nested loop:** Replace the nested loop with a single loop. For each `i` in the range `0` to `d`, calculate `j = d - i`. This reduces the time complexity of the program from O(n^2) to O(n).

2. **Eliminating redundant computations:** Move the `cost` calculation outside the loop. Since `cost` only depends on `i` and `j`, and `j` is now calculated directly from `i`, we can calculate `cost` once per iteration of the outer loop.

3. **Replace `std::endl` with `'\n'`:** Flushing the buffer every time might be unnecessary and can affect the performance. We can replace `std::endl` with `'\n'` to improve the output performance.

### Optimized Code Block

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <math.h>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int d, e;
  while (1) {
    cin >> d >> e;
    double min = 100000;
    if (d == 0 && e == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i <= d; i++) {
      int j = d - i;  // Calculate j directly
      double cost = sqrt(i * i + j * j);  // Move calculation outside the loop
      double gap = sqrt((cost - e) * (cost - e));
      if (gap < min) {
        min = gap;
      }
    }
    cout << min << '\n';  // Replace std::endl with '\n'
  }
  return 0;
}
```
