The code snippet you provided seems to be a simulation of a scenario where we have 'n' points in a 2D space, each with a speed 'v'. The simulation keeps updating a position 'now' in the direction of the point which requires the longest time to reach, and this process repeats until the movement is less than a very small number (EPS). The final result 'ans' is the maximum time needed to reach any point from the final 'now' position.

1. Code Analysis: 
    The main performance bottleneck is the repeated calculation of distances between the current position and every other point in every iteration of the simulation, which results in an O(n) computation for each iteration. 

2. Optimization Strategy:
    A. Redundant Computations: The distance between 'now' and every other point is calculated twice per iteration: once for finding the point with maximum distance and once for moving towards that point. This redundancy can be eliminated.
    B. Inefficient Data Structure: The vectors P and V can be combined into one vector of a structure containing point and speed information, which can improve data locality and cache usage.
    C. Compiler Optimizations: Some compilers can auto-vectorize or parallelize loops. The loop for calculating the maximum distance can be a candidate for this if the compiler supports it.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    A. Redundant Computations: We can store the maximum distance when we calculate it for the first time and reuse it when moving towards the maximum distance point.
    B. Inefficient Data Structure: Instead of having two separate vectors for points and speeds, we can have a single vector of a structure containing both point and speed. This will improve the cache usage as the point and its corresponding speed will likely be in the same or nearby cache line.
    C. Compiler Optimizations: Modern compilers like GCC and Clang can auto-vectorize or parallelize certain types of loops. The loop for calculating the maximum distance might be a candidate for this, but it's largely dependent on the specific compiler and its settings. We can give hints to the compiler by using OpenMP pragma directives.

Please note that the code is still bounded by the algorithm's complexity, and large inputs may still result in high running time. Further optimization may require algorithmic changes, parallelization, or use of more advanced data structures or methods.
