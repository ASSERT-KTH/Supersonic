1. **Code Analysis:**

This code is a recursive dynamic programming solution to a problem. `solve` function is called recursively and the result is stored in a 2-D array `dp`. The potential issue here is that the recursion depth can be large due to the nested loop, and each recursive call comes with overhead. 

2. **Optimization Strategy:**

Here's the optimization strategy:

    1. Transform recursion into iteration: Recursive function calls have a cost, and in some cases, this cost can be avoided by converting the recursion into an iterative loop.
    2. Use appropriate data structures: In this case, a 2-D array is used to store the solutions to subproblems. This is a good use of data structures as it allows constant time access to any previously computed solution.
    3. Avoid unnecessary calculations: In the loop within the `solve` function, the condition `times == 0` is checked for every iteration. However, this condition is only true for the first call to the function, and thus, this check can be removed from the loop.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

    1. Convert the recursion into an iteration: Dynamic programming problems like this one can typically be solved either top-down (using recursion and memoization, as in the original code) or bottom-up (using iteration). The benefit of the bottom-up approach is that it avoids the overhead of recursion.

    2. Optimize data structures: The 2-D array `dp` is already a suitable choice of data structure. It allows constant time access to any element, and it is easy to iterate over. 

    3. Remove unnecessary calculations: The condition `times == 0` is only true for the first call to the `solve` function. Therefore, this condition can be checked before the loop, and the corresponding computation can be done separately. This way, the condition doesn't have to be checked in every iteration of the loop.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

Here is the optimized code.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int n, m;
double dp[101][101];
double t[101][101];

double solve() {
  dp[0][0] = 1;
  for (int times = 1; times <= m; times++) {
    for (int prev = 0; prev < n; prev++) {
      double tmp = -1;
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        tmp = max(tmp, dp[times - 1][i] * t[i][prev]);
      }
      dp[times][prev] = tmp;
    }
  }
  return *max_element(dp[m], dp[m] + n);
}

int main(void) {
  while (cin >> n >> m) {
    if (!(n | m))
      break;
    fill((double *)dp, (double *)dp + 101 * 101, -1);
    int ret;
    double retd;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        cin >> t[i][j];
      }
    }
    retd = solve() * 100;
    printf("%.2lf\n", round(retd) / 100);
  }
}
```

In the optimized code, the recursive function `solve` has been replaced with an iterative version. This reduces the overhead of recursive calls and makes the program run faster. The condition `times == 0` has been removed from the loop, which reduces the number of operations performed in each iteration. The final return value of `solve` function is now calculated by finding the maximum element in the last row of `dp` array. This is because, after the iterations, the last row of `dp` array contains the highest probabilities for each state.
