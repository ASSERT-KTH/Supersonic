The given code solves a dynamic programming problem. It reads a pair of integers n and m, and then a n*n matrix from the standard input. After that, it computes a value through a recursive function (solve) and prints it to standard output. 

Here are some optimization strategies:

1. **Avoiding Recalculations: Memoization**: The function `solve` is a recursive function with memoization (dp array). However, the memoization is not being used effectively. The function is called multiple times with the same arguments, which leads to repeated calculations. To avoid duplicate work, we can use a lookup table (dp array) to store the results of subproblems.

2. **Using Fast Input/Output Methods**: The current input/output methods (cin and printf) can be slow for large inputs. We can use faster methods such as `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout`.

3. **Using More Efficient Data Structures**: The current data structures (2D arrays dp and t) can be replaced with vectors, which are more flexible and efficient in C++.

Here's the optimized code, incorporating the above strategies:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int n, m;
vector<vector<double>> dp(101, vector<double>(101));
vector<vector<double>> t(101, vector<double>(101));

double solve(int times, int prev) {
  if (dp[times][prev] != -1)
    return dp[times][prev];
  if (times == m)
    return dp[times][prev] = 1;
  double tmp = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (times == 0) {
      tmp = max(tmp, solve(times + 1, i));
    } else {
      tmp = max(tmp, solve(times + 1, i) * t[prev][i]);
    }
  }
  return dp[times][prev] = tmp;
}

int main(void) {
  while (scanf("%d %d", &n, &m) != EOF) {
    if (!(n | m))
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < 101; i++) {
      fill(dp[i].begin(), dp[i].end(), -1);
    }
    double retd;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        scanf("%lf", &t[i][j]);
      }
    }
    retd = solve(0, 0) * 100;
    printf("%.2lf\n", round(retd) / 100);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations will improve the performance of the program while preserving its functionality. The trade-off is that the code is slightly more complex and uses more modern C++ features, which might not be familiar to all C++ programmers. However, the performance gain is worth the increase in complexity.
