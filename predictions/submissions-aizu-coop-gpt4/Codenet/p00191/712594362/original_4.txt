After analyzing the given C++ code, it appears that the code is a solution to a dynamic programming problem. The main function reads in parameters and a matrix, then calls the recursive function to solve the problem. The recursive function utilizes memoization to avoid recalculations, which is a common technique in dynamic programming. However, there are several areas where performance could be improved.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Redundant Computation: The function 'solve' is called multiple times with the same arguments in the loop inside the 'solve' function. This redundant computation can be avoided by storing the result of the function call in a variable and reusing it.

2. Inefficient Data Structure: The 'dp' array used for memoization is a 2D array, which might cause cache misses due to its non-contiguous memory layout. A 1D array or a vector could be used instead.

3. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler flags such as -O3 could be used for automatic optimization of the code.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int n, m;

vector<double> dp(101 * 101, -1);
vector<vector<double>> t(101, vector<double>(101, 0));

double solve(int times, int prev) {
  if (dp[times * 101 + prev] != -1)
    return dp[times * 101 + prev];
  if (times == m)
    return dp[times * 101 + prev] = 1;
  double tmp = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Store the result of solve function in a variable to avoid redundant computation
    double res = solve(times + 1, i);
    if (times == 0) {
      tmp = max(tmp, res);
    } else {
      tmp = max(tmp, res * t[prev][i]);
    }
  }
  return dp[times * 101 + prev] = tmp;
}

int main(void) {
  while (cin >> n >> m) {
    if (!(n | m))
      break;
    fill(dp.begin(), dp.end(), -1);
    double retd;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        cin >> t[i][j];
      }
    }
    retd = solve(0, 0) * 100;
    printf("%.2lf\n", round(retd) / 100);
  }
}
```

Explanation:

1. Redundant Computation: In the original code, the function 'solve' was called multiple times with the same arguments. This was inefficient and could lead to a significant performance drop, especially in large inputs. In the optimized code, we store the result of the 'solve' function in a variable and reuse it, thus avoiding redundant computation.

2. Inefficient Data Structure: The 'dp' array used for memoization in the original code was a 2D array, which could cause cache misses due to its non-contiguous memory layout. In the optimized code, we use a 1D vector instead. This could significantly improve cache performance and thus the overall performance of the code.

3. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler flags such as -O3 could be used for automatic optimization of the code. This could include optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and better register allocation.

The optimized code preserves the functionality and output of the original code. It improves the performance of the code by avoiding redundant computation and improving cache performance. However, using a 1D vector for memoization increases the code's complexity slightly, as the index calculation is less intuitive than with a 2D array.
