1. Code Analysis: 
The provided code is a classic example of a Dynamic Programming (DP) problem. It calculates the maximum probability of a certain event, which is determined by the previous events, and stores the result to avoid redundant computations. The complexity of the code is O(n^3) due to the nested loops and the recursive function calls.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Inefficient data structures: The 2D arrays dp and t could be replaced with vectors of vectors for safer memory management and better control over sizes.
    2. Redundant computations: Recalculating the same subproblems multiple times is avoided by storing the results in the dp table. However, the initialization of dp array can be made more efficient.
    3. Loops and recursive calls: The recursion can be replaced with a bottom-up DP approach, eliminating the need for multiple function calls and stack overhead.
    4. Compiler optimizations: One can use `-O3` compiler flag for maximum optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining etc.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Replacing arrays with vectors: This will provide safer memory management as vectors handle their own memory and allow dynamic resizing.
    2. Efficient Initialization: Instead of using fill() function, we'll initialize the dp vector during its declaration which will be more efficient.
    3. Bottom-up DP approach: Instead of a recursive top-down approach, we can use an iterative bottom-up DP approach. This reduces the overhead of function calls and stack space.
    4. Using `-O3` compiler flag: This flag can be used while compiling to introduce several compiler optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining etc.

Trade-offs: While vectors provide safer memory management, they might be slower than arrays due to additional overhead. However, the impact on performance is negligible for small sizes. The bottom-up approach might be slightly more difficult to understand than the recursive approach.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  int n, m;
  while (cin >> n >> m) {
    if (!(n | m))
      break;
    vector<vector<double>> dp(m+1, vector<double>(n, -1));
    vector<vector<double>> t(n, vector<double>(n));
    double retd;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        cin >> t[i][j];
      }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      dp[m][i] = 1;
    for (int times = m - 1; times >= 0; times--) {
      for (int prev = 0; prev < n; prev++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
          if (times == 0) {
            dp[times][prev] = max(dp[times][prev], dp[times + 1][i]);
          } else {
            dp[times][prev] = max(dp[times][prev], dp[times + 1][i] * t[prev][i]);
          }
        }
      }
    }
    retd = dp[0][0] * 100;
    printf("%.2lf\n", round(retd) / 100);
  }
}
```
