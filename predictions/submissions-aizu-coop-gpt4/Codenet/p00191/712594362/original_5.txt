Here are the steps to optimize the given code:

1. Code Analysis:

The given code is a dynamic programming solution to a problem. It reads the inputs `n` and `m`, and a matrix `t` of size `n x n`. It then calculates the maximum value that can be achieved by traversing the matrix `m` times, starting from any cell in the first column. 

One potential performance bottleneck in the code is the recursion in the `solve` function. Recursions can lead to stack overflow for large inputs and are generally slower than iterative solutions due to the overhead of function calls. 

Another potential issue is the use of `fill` function to initialize the `dp` matrix in every test case. This could be inefficient if the same test case is run multiple times.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Use an iterative dynamic programming solution instead of recursion. Recursion involves a lot of function call overhead and can also lead to stack overflow for large inputs. An iterative solution can resolve these issues.

B. Use lazy initialization for the `dp` matrix. Instead of initializing the whole matrix in every test case, we can initialize a cell only when it's needed. This can save a lot of time if the same test case is run multiple times.

C. Use `printf` instead of `cout` for output. `printf` is generally faster than `cout` in C++.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Change the recursive `solve` function to an iterative one. We can start from the last column of the `dp` matrix and calculate the maximum value for each cell by considering all possible transitions from the current cell. This eliminates the need for recursion and function call overhead.

B. Instead of using `fill` to initialize the `dp` matrix, we can use a separate `visited` matrix to keep track of the cells that have been initialized. This way, we only need to initialize a cell when it's visited for the first time.

C. Replace `cout` with `printf` for output. `printf` is generally faster than `cout` in C++.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```C++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int n, m;
double dp[101][101];
bool visited[101][101];
double t[101][101];

double solve() {
  for (int times = m; times >= 0; --times) {
    for (int prev = 0; prev < n; ++prev) {
      if (times == m) {
        dp[times][prev] = 1;
        visited[times][prev] = true;
      } else if (!visited[times][prev]) {
        double tmp = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
          tmp = max(tmp, dp[times + 1][i] * ((times == 0) ? 1 : t[prev][i]));
        }
        dp[times][prev] = tmp;
        visited[times][prev] = true;
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[0][0] * 100;
}

int main(void) {
  while (scanf("%d %d", &n, &m) == 2 && (n || m)) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        scanf("%lf", &t[i][j]);
      }
    }
    printf("%.2lf\n", round(solve()) / 100);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we have replaced the recursive function with an iterative one and introduced lazy initialization for the `dp` matrix. We have also replaced `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output.
