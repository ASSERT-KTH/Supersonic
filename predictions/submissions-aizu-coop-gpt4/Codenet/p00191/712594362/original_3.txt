Code Analysis:
The given code is an implementation of a dynamic programming algorithm. The algorithm's performance is determined by the number of sub-problems it solves, which in this case is `m*n*n`. For each sub-problem, the code runs a loop of size `n`. Therefore, the time complexity of the code is `O(m*n^3)`, which is quite high for large values of `m` and `n`. The memory usage of the code is determined by the size of the `dp` and `t` arrays, which is `O(n^2)`. 

Optimization Strategy:

A. Inefficient data structures: The data structures used in the code are not inefficient, but rather, the manner in which they are used is the problem. The algorithm is solving some sub-problems repeatedly due to not storing the answers for these sub-problems.

B. Redundant computations: In the `solve` function, the condition `times == 0` is checked in every iteration of the loop. This condition is only true for the first call to the `solve` function, which means that it is redundant for all other calls.

C. Loops and recursion: The `solve` function can be optimized by changing the order in which sub-problems are solved. Instead of using a top-down approach (which starts with the original problem and breaks it down into sub-problems), a bottom-up approach (which starts with the base cases and builds up to the original problem) can be used. This will eliminate the need for recursion and the function call overhead associated with it.

D. Compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations like `-O2` or `-O3` can be used to further optimize the code. These optimizations include techniques such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and constant propagation.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  int n, m;
  while (cin >> n >> m) {
    if (!(n | m)) break;
    double dp[101][101] = {0};
    double t[101][101];
    int ret;
    double retd;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        cin >> t[i][j];
      }
    }
    // Initialize dp array
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      dp[m][i] = 1;
    }
    // Bottom-up DP
    for (int times = m - 1; times >= 0; times--) {
      for (int prev = 0; prev < n; prev++) {
        double tmp = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
          tmp = max(tmp, dp[times + 1][i] * t[prev][i]);
        }
        dp[times][prev] = tmp;
      }
    }
    retd = dp[0][0] * 100;
    printf("%.2lf\n", round(retd) / 100);
  }
}
```

Explanation:

The `solve` function has been removed and its functionality has been incorporated into the `main` function. The `dp` array is now local to the `main` function and is initialized with `0` rather than `-1`. The base cases for `dp` are initialized outside the main loop. The main loop now calculates `dp[times][prev]` in a bottom-up manner. The condition `times == 0` has been removed, which eliminates the redundancy. The memory usage of the code remains the same at `O(n^2)`, but the time complexity is reduced to `O(m*n^2)`.
