1. Code Analysis:
The given code is a recursive solution to a problem, which uses memoization to store the results of sub-problems. The main bottleneck in this code is the recursive function `solve(n, m, p, i)`, which gets called multiple times for the same sub-problems. Although memoization helps to an extent, the function still gets called even when the result is already available in the memo table. This results in unnecessary function calls which can slow down the program.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    A. An efficient data structure is already being used (3D array for memoization). However, it can be optimized.
    B. The redundant computation is in the form of unnecessary function calls, even when the result is already available in the memo table.
    C. The recursion can be optimized by converting it into a Dynamic Programming (DP) bottom-up approach.
    D. Compiler optimizations can be used, like `-O2` or `-O3`, but they won't be discussed here as they are not related to code optimization.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. The recursive function `solve(n, m, p, i)` can be converted to a bottom-up DP approach. This would eliminate redundant function calls and also make the program faster. The DP approach builds the solution iteratively from smaller sub-problems to the final problem, and doesn't require function calls.
    2. The memoization table can be initialized to `-1` instead of `0`, and we can check if `memo[p][m][k] != -1` instead of `memo[p][m][k] > 0`. This will ensure that we only compute the sub-problem if it hasn't been computed before.
    3. Using the bottom-up DP approach may increase the code complexity slightly, but it will drastically improve the performance, especially for larger inputs.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#define REP(i, a, b) for (i = (a); i < (b); ++i)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
double a[101][101];
double memo[101][101][101];

void solve(int n, int m) {
  int p, i, j;
  rep(i, n) rep(j, m+1) rep(p, n) memo[i][j][p] = -1;
  rep(i, n) memo[i][1][0] = 1;
  REP(j, 2, m+1) rep(i, n) rep(p, n) if (memo[i][j-1][p] != -1) memo[i][j][p] = MAX(memo[i][j][p], memo[i][j-1][p] * a[p][i]);
}

int main(void) {
  int n, m, i, j;
  double res;
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &m), n | m) {
    rep(i, n) rep(j, n) scanf("%lf", &a[i][j]);
    solve(n, m);
    res = 0;
    rep(i, n) rep(j, n) res = MAX(res, memo[i][m][j]);
    printf("%.2f\n", res);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, the recursive function `solve` has been converted into an iterative function that fills up the 'memo' table in a bottom-up manner. This eliminates unnecessary function calls and reduces the running time of the program. The code complexity has slightly increased due to the nested loops in the `solve` function, but the performance gain outweighs this downside.
