# Code Analysis:

The current code is a brute-force recursive solution to a problem that involves finding the maximum product of values in a multidimensional array. However, it suffers from high time complexity due to redundant computations. The function `solve` is called multiple times with the same arguments, leading to repeated calculations.

# Optimization Strategy:

1. Use Memoization: The `solve` function can be optimized by using a dynamic programming technique called memoization to store the results of subproblems, preventing the need for redundant computation.

2. Use Iterative Dynamic Programming: Instead of using recursion, which involves function call overhead and can lead to a stack overflow for large inputs, we can use an iterative dynamic programming approach. This approach builds the solution in a bottom-up manner, starting from smaller subproblems and using their solutions to solve larger subproblems.

3. Reducing Space Complexity: The current memoization array `memo` has a very high space complexity. It is declared as a three-dimensional array of size [101][101][101], which is not efficient in terms of memory usage. We can reduce the space complexity by noting that the current state of `solve` depends only on the current and previous states of `m`.

# Optimization Steps:

1. Change the recursive function to an iterative one. This reduces the overhead of function calls and avoids potential stack overflow issues.

2. Instead of a three-dimensional array, use a two-dimensional array for memoization. The size of this array will be [101][101], thus saving a lot of space.

3. Initialize the memoization array with -1 to indicate that a state has not been computed yet.

4. Use the memoization array to store the results of subproblems and use these stored results to avoid redundant computations.

# Optimized Code:

Here's the optimized version of the code with the changes mentioned above:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#define REP(i, a, b) for (i = (a); i < (b); ++i)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
double a[101][101];
double memo[101][101];

int main(void) {
  int n, m, i, j, k;
  double res;
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &m), n | m) {
    memset(memo, -1, sizeof(memo));
    rep(i, n) rep(j, n) scanf("%lf", &a[i][j]);

    // Base case: When m = 1, memo[i][1] = 1 for all i
    rep(i, n) memo[i][1] = 1;

    // Iterative dynamic programming
    for (int m = 2; m <= m; m++) {
      rep(i, n) {
        memo[i][m] = 0;
        rep(j, n) {
          memo[i][m] = MAX(memo[i][m], memo[j][m-1] * a[j][i]);
        }
      }
    }

    // Find the maximum result
    res = 0;
    rep(i, n) res = MAX(res, memo[i][m]);
    printf("%.2f\n", res);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code has a better time complexity and space complexity. It avoids redundant computations by using memoization and has a lower space complexity by using a two-dimensional array instead of a three-dimensional one.
