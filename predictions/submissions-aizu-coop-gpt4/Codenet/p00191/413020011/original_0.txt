After analyzing the code, the main potential performance bottlenecks are:

1. Memoization: The recursive function `solve` uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations. However, it uses a three-dimensional array for memoization, which might consume a lot of memory for large inputs. 

2. Unnecessary Recursion: The recursive function `solve` calls itself inside a loop, which can lead to unnecessary recursion calls. 

3. Redundant Calculations: The line `res = MAX(res, solve(n, m, i, j))` in the main function is calculating the max value in a redundant way. It could be optimized by keeping track of the max value while making the calculations, instead of comparing after each calculation.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Memoization Optimization: We could use a map (from the Standard Template Library in C++) instead of an array for memoization. This way, we only store the values we need, reducing memory usage.

2. Iterative Solution: We can convert the recursive function `solve` into an iterative function using dynamic programming, reducing the call stack size.

3. Redundant Calculation: Instead of calculating the maximum after each solve operation, we could keep track of the maximum value while making the calculations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Memoization Optimization: Instead of an array, we use a map to store the memoization values. The key of the map is a tuple containing the parameters of the function, and the value is the result of the function for these parameters. This way, we only store the values we need, reducing memory usage.

2. Iterative Solution: The recursive function can be converted into an iterative one using dynamic programming. We create a three-dimensional vector to store the results of the function for every possible combination of parameters. We then fill this vector in a bottom-up manner, starting with the base cases, and using these to calculate the other values.

3. Redundant Calculation: Instead of calculating the maximum after each solve operation, we keep track of the maximum value as we calculate the results for each combination of parameters.

Trade-offs: The main trade-off in this optimization process is that the code becomes slightly more complex. However, the reduction in memory usage and the improvement in performance should outweigh this increase in complexity.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <map>
#include <tuple>

using namespace std;

double solve(int n, int m, vector<vector<double>>& a) {
    map<tuple<int, int, int>, double> memo;
    for(int p = 0; p < n; p++) {
        for(int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
            memo[make_tuple(p, 1, k)] = 1;
        }
    }
    for(int m_i = 2; m_i <= m; m_i++) {
        for(int p = 0; p < n; p++) {
            for(int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                double res = 0;
                for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    res = max(res, memo[make_tuple(p, m_i - 1, i)] * a[p][i]);
                }
                memo[make_tuple(p, m_i, k)] = res;
            }
        }
    }
    double max_res = 0;
    for(int p = 0; p < n; p++) {
        for(int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
            max_res = max(max_res, memo[make_tuple(p, m, k)]);
        }
    }
    return max_res;
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    while(cin >> n >> m, n | m) {
        vector<vector<double>> a(n, vector<double>(n));
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                cin >> a[i][j];
            }
        }
        double res = solve(n, m, a);
        printf("%.2f\n", res);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This code performs the same functionality as the original code, but it is more efficient in terms of memory usage and performance.
