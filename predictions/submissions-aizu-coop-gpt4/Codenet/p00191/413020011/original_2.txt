The given C program appears to be a dynamic programming solution to an unspecified problem. The main areas that can be optimized are:

1. The recursive function `solve()` that has overlapping subproblems.
2. The usage of `rep()` macro for looping.
3. The usage of `memset()` for initialization.
4. The large size of the `memo` and `a` arrays.

Here is the optimization strategy:

1. Convert the recursive function `solve()` to an iterative one to eliminate the cost of function call overhead and recursion stack. This will also allow us to avoid the cost of repeated computations in overlapping subproblems.
2. Replace the `rep()` macro with a standard for loop. While the macro itself isn't inefficient, it obscures what the code is doing, which can lead to confusion and mistakes.
3. Instead of using `memset()` to initialize the `memo` array, we can initialize it when we declare it. This can prevent unnecessary writes to memory.
4. The `memo` and `a` arrays are quite large. If the maximum size isn't often reached in practice, we can consider using dynamically allocated arrays instead, or an alternative data structure such as a hash map to save memory.

The trade-off of these optimizations is that the code might become a little bit more complicated. However, the potential performance gain is significant.

Here is the optimized code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
double a[101][101];
double memo[101][101][101] = {0};

void calculate(int n, int m) {
  int i, j, k, p;
  for (p = 0; p < n; ++p)
    for (k = 1; k < m; ++k)
      for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        for (j = 0; j < n; ++j)
          memo[p][k][j] = MAX(memo[p][k][j], memo[i][k - 1][p] * a[p][i]);
}

int main(void) {
  int n, m, i, j;
  double res;
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &m), n | m) {
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) scanf("%lf", &a[i][j]);
    calculate(n, m);
    res = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) res = MAX(res, memo[i][m - 1][j]);
    printf("%.2f\n", res);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this code, the recursive `solve()` function is replaced by the iterative function `calculate()`. The `rep()` macro is replaced by standard for loops for clarity. The `memset()` function is removed as the `memo` array is initialized when declared. However, the size of the `memo` and `a` arrays is kept the same for the sake of simplicity, and because the size is manageable for modern hardware.
