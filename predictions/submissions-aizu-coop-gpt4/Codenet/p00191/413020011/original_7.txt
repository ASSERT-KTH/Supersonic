This code involves a recursive function `solve()` that has overlapping subproblems. The function is called multiple times with the same arguments, which leads to redundant computations. The code uses memoization to prevent these redundant computations, but the implementation of memoization is inefficient.

Optimization Strategy:

1. **Optimizing Memoization**: The current memoization strategy uses a 3D array, which is not only inefficient in terms of memory usage but also has cache-miss issues, which can slow down the program. Using a hash map instead of a 3D array can optimize memory usage and improve cache performance.

2. **Avoiding Redundant Computations in the Main Loop**: The function `solve()` is called repeatedly in the main loop with the same arguments. This is unnecessary as the result could be stored after it's computed the first time and simply retrieved on subsequent calls with the same arguments.

3. **Avoiding Macro Definitions for Looping and Comparison**: Although macros like `REP()`, `rep()`, and `MAX()` can make the code cleaner and reduce typing, they can also result in slower performance as they add an additional layer of abstraction. Instead, we can use regular loops and comparison statements.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cstring>

double a[101][101];
std::unordered_map<int, double> memo;

double solve(int n, int m, int k, int p) {
  double res;
  int i, j;

  if (m == 1)
    return 1;

  int hash_key = p*10000 + m*100 + k;
  if (memo.find(hash_key) != memo.end())
    return memo[hash_key];

  res = 0;
  for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    double temp_res = solve(n, m - 1, p, i) * a[p][i];
    res = (temp_res > res) ? temp_res : res;
  }

  memo[hash_key] = res;
  return res;
}

int main(void) {
  int n, m, i, j, k;
  double res;
  while (std::cin >> n >> m, n | m) {
    memo.clear();
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
      for(j = 0; j < n; j++) 
        std::cin >> a[i][j];
    res = 0;
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
      for(j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        double temp_res = solve(n, m, i, j);
        res = (temp_res > res) ? temp_res : res;
      }
    printf("%.2f\n", res);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code replaces the 3D memoization array with a hash map, resulting in more efficient memory usage and better cache performance. It also replaces the macro definitions with regular loops and comparisons for better performance. The running time of the program should be significantly improved.
