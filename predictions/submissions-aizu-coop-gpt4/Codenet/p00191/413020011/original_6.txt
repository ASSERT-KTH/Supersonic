Code Analysis:
The given code is a dynamic programming solution for an optimization problem. The solve function is the core of this program, it calculates the maximum value that can be achieved by recursively solving sub-problems and storing the results in the memo array to avoid re-computation.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The given data structures are appropriate for the problem, so no changes are required in this aspect.

2. Redundant Computation: The recursive call within the 'solve' function can lead to redundant computation. The current implementation relies on memoization to avoid redundant computation, but this can be further optimized.

3. Optimize Loops/Recursion: The recursive call in the 'solve' function can be converted to a loop for better performance.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations using flags like -O3 can also be considered to improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Conversion of Recursion to Iteration in 'solve' function: The recursive call in the 'solve' function can be converted into a bottom-up loop. This can make the function faster since it eliminates the overhead of recursive function calls and the need for system stack. The trade-off is that the code might be a bit harder to understand.

2. Compiler Optimization flags: Using compiler flags like -O3 during compilation can enable all optimization levels, potentially increasing the performance of the code. The trade-off is that this might make debugging more difficult.

Optimized Code Block:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#define REP(i, a, b) for (i = (a); i < (b); ++i)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
double a[101][101];
double dp[101][101][101];

double solve(int n, int m) {
  int i, j, k, p;
  rep(i, n) dp[i][1][i] = 1;
  REP(k, 2, m+1) {
    rep(i, n) {
      rep(j, n) {
        rep(p, n) dp[i][k][j] = MAX(dp[i][k][j], dp[p][k-1][i] * a[j][p]);
      }
    }
  }
}

int main(void) {
  int n, m, i, j, k;
  double res;
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &m), n | m) {
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    rep(i, n) rep(j, n) scanf("%lf", &a[i][j]);
    solve(n, m);
    res = 0;
    rep(i, n) rep(j, n) res = MAX(res, dp[i][m][j]);
    printf("%.2f\n", res);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, the 'solve' function is converted into an iterative function. It calculates the maximum value that can be obtained for all possible states and stores the result in a dp array. We then use these stored results to get our final answer.
