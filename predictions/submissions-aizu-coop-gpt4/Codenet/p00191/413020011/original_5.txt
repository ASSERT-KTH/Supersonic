1. Code Analysis:

This program seems to be solving some kind of dynamic programming problem with a 3-dimensional state. The function `solve(int n, int m, int k, int p)` appears to be a recursive function with memoization. The performance bottlenecks in this program could be:

    - The recursive call in the loop in the `solve` function. Recursion can be a performance bottleneck if there are many levels of recursion, as each recursive call adds a new layer to the call stack.
    - The nested loops in the main function: these loops iterate over the entire 2D array `a` and call the `solve` function, which can be expensive.
    - The use of `memset` to zero out the memo array. This operation is O(n^3), which can be a significant performance hit for large inputs.
    - The use of `scanf` and `printf` for input/output. These functions are typically slower than their counterparts in other languages, and could be replaced with faster I/O functions.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    1. Convert the `solve` function from a recursive function to an iterative one, which will eliminate the overhead of recursive calls.
    2. Use a more efficient data structure for the memoization table, such as a hash map.
    3. Minimize the number of times the memoization table is accessed by storing the result of `memo[p][m][k]` in a local variable instead of accessing it multiple times.
    4. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with faster I/O functions.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    1. Convert `solve` to iterative: This eliminates the overhead of recursive calls and makes it easier to manage the state of the program. However, this will make the code more complex and harder to understand.
    2. Use a hash map for memoization: This can speed up the lookup of previously computed values, at the expense of slightly more memory usage.
    3. Minimize table access: Instead of accessing `memo[p][m][k]` multiple times, store its value in a local variable and access that instead. This can speed up the program by reducing the number of memory accesses.
    4. Replace `scanf` and `printf`: These functions are slow compared to other I/O functions. Replacing them with faster alternatives can speed up the program.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
using namespace std;
double a[101][101];
unordered_map<int, double> memo;

double solve(int n, int m, int k, int p) {
  if (m == 1)
    return 1;
  int key = p * 10000 + m * 100 + k;
  if (memo.find(key) != memo.end())
    return memo[key];
  double res = 0;
  rep(i, n) res = max(res, solve(n, m - 1, p, i) * a[p][i]);
  return memo[key] = res;
}

int main(void) {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, m;
  double res;
  while (cin >> n >> m, n | m) {
    memo.clear();
    rep(i, n) rep(j, n) cin >> a[i][j];
    res = 0;
    rep(i, n) rep(j, n) res = max(res, solve(n, m, i, j));
    cout << fixed << setprecision(2) << res << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code uses a hash map for memoization and replaces `scanf` and `printf` with faster I/O functions. The `solve` function remains recursive, but it would be possible to convert it to an iterative function for further optimization.
