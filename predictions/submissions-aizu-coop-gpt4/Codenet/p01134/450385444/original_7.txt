Code Analysis:
The given code is a C++ program that takes a series of line segments as input and counts the number of fields formed by the intersections of these segments. It uses various mathematical calculations such as dot product, cross product, and distance to determine the intersection points. 

Potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structures: The program uses a vector to store intersection points (vector<P> exist). For each new intersection point, it checks if the point already exists in the vector, which is an O(n) operation. This could be a performance bottleneck when the number of intersection points is large.

2. Redundant computations: The program computes the intersection point of two segments even if they don't intersect. This is unnecessary and can be avoided.

3. Loops and Recursive calls: The nested loops used to check for existing intersection points can be optimized. 

4. Compiler optimizations: The compiler can be instructed to optimize certain parts of the code with pragma directives.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the vector data structure used for storing intersection points with a more efficient data structure like set or unordered_set which has O(1) average complexity for insert and find operations.

2. Avoid computing intersection points for non-intersecting segments.

3. Use efficient algorithms for searching and inserting intersection points.

4. Use pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replacing vector with unordered_set: The unordered_set in C++ is an associative container that contains set of distinct elements in no particular order. It performs the insert and find operations in constant time on average which can drastically improve the performance when dealing with large data.

2. Avoid computing intersection points for non-intersecting segments: The program currently computes intersection points even for non-intersecting segments. This is unnecessary and can be avoided by checking if the segments intersect before computing the intersection point.

3. Using efficient algorithms: The existing code uses a brute force approach to check if an intersection point already exists in the vector. This can be optimized by using efficient searching and inserting algorithms provided by the unordered_set.

4. Compiler optimizations: The compiler can be instructed to unroll loops or inline functions using pragma directives. These can lead to faster code execution.

Trade-offs:

1. Using unordered_set instead of vector might increase the memory usage slightly as unordered_set uses a hash table internally to provide fast access to elements.

2. Compiler optimizations can sometimes lead to increased code complexity and can make debugging difficult.
