Code Analysis:
This code is implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm on a graph with 'n' vertices. The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix 'm'. The BFS algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the source node to every other node in the graph. Here, the source node is considered to be '0'. The array 'd' stores the shortest distance from the source node to every other node, and the array 'v' keeps track of whether a node has been visited or not.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: The adjacency matrix 'm' uses O(n^2) space. If the graph is sparse (i.e., the number of edges is much less than n^2), it would be more space-efficient to use an adjacency list.
2. Unnecessary Computations: The array 'd' is initialized with -1 and then the source node is immediately set to 0. This step can be optimized.
3. Loops: The BFS algorithm inherently involves a loop, but it's already quite efficient.

Optimization Explanation:
1. Replacing Adjacency Matrix with Adjacency List: An adjacency list is a more space-efficient way to represent a graph when the graph is sparse. In the worst case (when the graph is a complete graph), both the adjacency matrix and the adjacency list will require the same amount of space. However, in practice, most real-world graphs are sparse, and using an adjacency list can result in significant space savings.
2. Removing Unnecessary Computations: We can initialize 'd' array with a large value (like INT_MAX from <climits>) to indicate that the node is not reachable. Then, we don't need to set the source node to 0 separately.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;
vector<vector<int>> g;
vector<int> d;
vector<bool> v;
void bfs(int s) {
  v[s] = true;
  d[s] = 0;
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(s);
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int u = q.front();
    q.pop();
    for (auto i: g[u]) {
      if (!v[i]) {
        d[i] = d[u] + 1;
        v[i] = true;
        q.push(i);
      }
    }
  }
}
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  g.resize(n);
  d.resize(n, INT_MAX);
  v.resize(n, false);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int u, k;
    cin >> u >> k;
    u--; // zero-based index
    for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      int v;
      cin >> v;
      v--; // zero-based index
      g[u].push_back(v);
    }
  }
  bfs(0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cout << i + 1 << ' ' << ((d[i] == INT_MAX) ? -1 : d[i]) << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Here, 'g' is an adjacency list that represents the graph. It's a vector of vectors, where g[i] is a vector containing the neighbors of node i. 'd' is a vector storing the shortest distance from the source node to every other node, and 'v' is a vector to keep track of whether a node has been visited or not. We use the STL vector because it can dynamically resize, which is more convenient and efficient than using a fixed-size array.
