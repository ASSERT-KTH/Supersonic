This C++ program implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm on a graph represented by a 2D matrix. The graph has `n` nodes numbered from 1 to `n`. The adjacency matrix `m` represents the graph where `m[i][j]` is `true` if there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`, and `false` otherwise.

Code Analysis:

The code appears to be well-optimized for a BFS algorithm. However, there are a few areas that could potentially be optimized for performance:

1. The adjacency matrix `m` is a 2D array, which may not be the most efficient data structure for storing the graph if the graph is sparse (i.e., it has relatively few edges). 

2. The `bfs` function is called only once, for node `0`. If it were required to call this function multiple times, it would be inefficient since the visited array `v` and distances array `d` are not reset.

3. The distances array `d` is initialized with `-1` for all nodes, which may not be necessary if all nodes are reachable from node `0`.

Optimization Strategy:

A1. Use an adjacency list instead of an adjacency matrix to represent the graph, which can be more space-efficient for sparse graphs. This will reduce the space complexity of the program from O(n^2) to O(n + m), where `n` is the number of nodes and `m` is the number of edges.

A2. Reset the visited array `v` and distances array `d` in the `bfs` function. This will make the function reusable for multiple nodes.

A3. Initialize the distances array `d` with `INT_MAX` for all nodes, and update the distance for each node as it is visited. This will eliminate the need to initialize the distances array with `-1`.

The optimized code block is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> adjList(105);
bool visited[105];
int distance[105];

void bfs(int s) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 105; i++) {
    visited[i] = false;
    distance[i] = INT_MAX;
  }
  
  queue<int> q;
  visited[s] = true;
  distance[s] = 0;
  q.push(s);
  
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int u = q.front();
    q.pop();
    for (int neighbor : adjList[u]) {
      if (!visited[neighbor]) {
        distance[neighbor] = distance[u] + 1;
        visited[neighbor] = true;
        q.push(neighbor);
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int u, v, k;
    cin >> u >> k;
    for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      cin >> v;
      adjList[u - 1].push_back(v - 1);
    }
  }
  
  bfs(0);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << i + 1 << ' ' << ((distance[i] == INT_MAX) ? -1 : distance[i]) << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, the adjacency matrix `m` is replaced by an adjacency list `adjList`, and the `bfs` function is updated to reset the visited array `visited` and distances array `distance` at the beginning. Moreover, the distances array `distance` is initialized with `INT_MAX` for all nodes, and the distance for each node is updated as it is visited. If a node is not reachable from node `0`, its distance will remain `INT_MAX`, which is printed as `-1`.
