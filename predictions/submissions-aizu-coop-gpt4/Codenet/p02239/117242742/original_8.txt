This provided C++ program implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm on a graph. The graph's adjacency matrix is stored in a 2-dimensional array m[105][105] and the number of vertices in the graph is stored in the integer variable n. BFS is used to find the shortest path from a source vertex (s) to all other vertices in the graph.

Here are some optimizations that could be applied:

1. Code Analysis:
   - The adjacency matrix m[105][105] is a 2-dimensional array that might be taking a lot of memory if the graph is sparse (i.e., has few edges). Using an adjacency list instead of an adjacency matrix could save memory.
   - It seems that the variables v[105] and d[105] are arrays storing whether a vertex has been visited and the distance from the source vertex to other vertices, respectively. They are initialized in different parts of the code which might not be necessary.
   - The graph vertices input is 1-indexed while in C++, it's common to use 0-indexing which can make the code more readable and less error-prone.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Use an adjacency list instead of an adjacency matrix.
   - Initialize the visited array v[105] and distance array d[105] at the same place.
   - Use 0-indexing for the graph vertices.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   - Adjacency Matrix to Adjacency List: The adjacency matrix takes O(V^2) space while the adjacency list takes O(V+E) space, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. If the graph is sparse, using an adjacency list can save a lot of memory.
   - Initializing at the Same Place: Initializing the visited array and distance array at the same place can make the code cleaner and easier to read.
   - 0-indexing for Graph Vertices: This makes the code more readable and less error-prone because in C++, array indices start at 0.
   
4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> adj; // adjacency list
vector<int> d; // distance array
vector<bool> visited; // visited array

void bfs(int s) {
  visited[s] = true;
  d[s] = 0;
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(s);
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int u = q.front();
    q.pop();
    for (int i = 0; i < adj[u].size(); i++) {
      int v = adj[u][i];
      if (!visited[v]) {
        d[v] = d[u] + 1;
        visited[v] = true;
        q.push(v);
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  adj.resize(n);
  d.resize(n, -1);
  visited.resize(n, false);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int u, k;
    cin >> u >> k;
    u--; // 0-indexing
    for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      int v;
      cin >> v;
      v--; // 0-indexing
      adj[u].push_back(v);
    }
  }
  bfs(0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cout << i + 1 << ' ' << d[i] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the adjacency matrix is replaced with an adjacency list to save memory for sparse graphs. The arrays for storing distances and visited vertices are initialized at the same place to make the code cleaner. Also, the vertices are 0-indexed to make the code more readable and less error-prone.
