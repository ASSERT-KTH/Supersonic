Analysis:
This code performs a breadth-first search (BFS) on an adjacency matrix. The matrix is created from the input data and the BFS function starts from node 0. The BFS function uses a queue to keep track of visited nodes and their distances from the starting node. The results are then printed.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Data Structures: The matrix is an efficient data structure for this problem as it allows constant time access to any element. However, if the graph is sparse (i.e., has few edges compared to the number of nodes), an adjacency list might be more efficient in terms of memory usage.

2. Computation: The BFS function performs a redundant computation by checking v[i] twice. This can be avoided.

3. Compiler Optimization: Compiler optimizations such as -O3 or -Ofast can be used to improve the execution speed of the program.

4. Pragma Directives: Pragma directives can be used for loop unrolling, but in this case, as the loop's iteration count is not fixed (depends on user input), it's not a good candidate for loop unrolling.

Optimization Steps:

1. Remove the redundant check for v[i] in the BFS function. This can be done by checking v[i] only once before pushing i into the queue.

2. Use compiler optimizations. This depends on the compiler and environment, so the exact steps may vary. Typically, this can be done by passing -O3 or -Ofast flags when compiling the program.

Trade-offs: Using compiler optimizations might make debugging harder as the code execution could skip some lines or perform out-of-order execution. However, the performance gains are typically worth it for the final, debugged code.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;
int m[105][105], n, v[105], d[105];

void bfs(int s) {
  v[s] = true;
  d[s] = 0;
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(s);
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int u = q.front();
    q.pop();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (m[u][i] && !v[i]) {
        d[i] = d[u] + 1;
        q.push(i);
        v[i] = true;
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    d[i] = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int u, v, k;
    cin >> u >> k;
    for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      cin >> v;
      m[u - 1][v - 1] = true;
    }
  }
  bfs(0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cout << i + 1 << ' ' << d[i] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
