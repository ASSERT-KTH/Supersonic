1. Code Analysis:
The given code seems to be an implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm on a graph, where:
- `m` is the adjacency matrix of the graph.
- `n` is the number of nodes in the graph.
- `v` is a boolean array representing visited nodes in the graph.
- `d` is an array storing the distance of each node from the source node.
- The function `bfs` performs the actual BFS algorithm.
- The main function initializes the graph and calls the `bfs` function.

2. Optimization Strategy:
The code appears to be quite optimized for its purpose. However, a few enhancements can be made:
    A. Use of std::vector instead of C-style arrays: C++ std::vector is a template class in STL (Standard Template Libraries), which is dynamic, meaning its size can grow and shrink at runtime.
    B. Reserve memory for vectors: If you know the maximum size your vector can reach, it is better to reserve that much memory beforehand. This way you can avoid unnecessary re-allocations.
    C. Avoidance of global variables: As a good coding practice, it is better to avoid global variables when possible.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    A. Using std::vector instead of C-style arrays: C++ std::vector has many advantages over C-style arrays, such as dynamic sizing and ability to pass vectors by value to functions. It also has various built-in functions, which can sometimes make your code more efficient and easier to read. This can contribute to the overall performance and readability of the code.
    B. Reserving memory for vectors: In certain scenarios, where the maximum size of a vector can be determined in advance, it is better to reserve that much memory beforehand to avoid unnecessary reallocations. For instance, in this code, we know that the maximum size of the vectors `v` and `d` would be `n`.
    C. Avoidance of global variables: Generally, it is a good practice to avoid the use of global variables. This not only makes the code more readable but also reduces the chances of encountering bugs related to the scope of variables. Therefore, we can pass these variables as parameters to the `bfs` function.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

void bfs(vector<vector<int>>& m, int n, vector<bool>& v, vector<int>& d, int s) {
    v[s] = true;
    d[s] = 0;
    queue<int> q;
    q.push(s);
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int u = q.front();
        q.pop();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (m[u][i] && !v[i]) {
                d[i] = d[u] + 1;
                v[i] = true;
                q.push(i);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    vector<vector<int>> m(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
    vector<bool> v(n, false);
    vector<int> d(n, -1);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int u, k;
        cin >> u >> k;
        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            int v;
            cin >> v;
            m[u - 1][v - 1] = true;
        }
    }
    
    bfs(m, n, v, d, 0);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cout << i + 1 << ' ' << d[i] << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
