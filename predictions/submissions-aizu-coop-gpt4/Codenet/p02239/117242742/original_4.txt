The given program appears to be solving the shortest path problem in a graph using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The graph is represented with an adjacency matrix, and the BFS function is implemented to find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in the graph.

Here are some potential optimization strategies:

1. Use an adjacency list instead of an adjacency matrix: The adjacency matrix 'm' is a 2D array with a size of 105x105, which can be quite large and inefficient for sparse graphs. We can use an adjacency list instead, which can save a lot of memory if the graph has fewer edges. The trade-off is that the edge existence check may take more time for dense graphs.

2. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The array 'v' is used to track visited nodes, which is necessary for BFS. But the array 'd' is initialized with -1 for all nodes at the beginning, which is not necessary. We only need to set d[s] to 0 at the start of BFS, and for other nodes, their distance will be set when they are visited.

3. Use Fast Input/Output methods: The cin and cout are slower when compared to scanf and printf. So, if the input size is larger it is better to use faster I/O methods.

Here is how the optimized code looks like after applying these strategies:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;
vector<int> adj[105], d(105), v(105);
void bfs(int s) {
  v[s] = true;
  d[s] = 0;
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(s);
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int u = q.front();
    q.pop();
    for (int i = 0; i < adj[u].size(); i++) {
      int node = adj[u][i];
      if (!v[node]) {
        d[node] = d[u] + 1;
        v[node] = true;
        q.push(node);
      }
    }
  }
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); //Fast I/O
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int u, k;
    cin >> u >> k;
    for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      int v;
      cin >> v;
      adj[u - 1].push_back(v - 1);
    }
  }
  bfs(0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cout << i + 1 << ' ' << d[i] << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the above code is assuming that the graph is 0-indexed. If it's not, you will need to adjust the indices accordingly.
