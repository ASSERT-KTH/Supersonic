Code Analysis:
The given C++ code appears to be an implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The algorithm uses a queue data structure to visit nodes in a graph starting from a specified source node. It marks each node as visited and keeps track of the shortest distance from the source node to each other node.

The potential performance bottlenecks and memory inefficiencies in the code include:

1. The adjacency matrix, `m`, is of fixed size `105 x 105`. This matrix may occupy more memory than required if `n` (the number of nodes) is less than 105. Furthermore, if `n` is greater than 105, the program will not work correctly. This is a clear memory inefficiency.

2. The BFS function visits each node in the graph by iterating over the entire adjacency matrix for every node. This is inefficient, especially for sparse graphs (where the number of edges is significantly less than the number of nodes squared), as many iterations will be wasted on non-existent edges.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use an adjacency list instead of an adjacency matrix. An adjacency list is more memory-efficient for sparse graphs, as it only stores the existing edges. This also improves the BFS function's efficiency as it will only need to iterate through the existing edges.

2. Instead of using a fixed-size array for marking visited nodes and storing distances, use a dynamic data structure, like a vector, which can be resized based on the number of nodes.

3. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` to disable the synchronization of the C and C++ standard streams. This can significantly speed up input and output operations.

Optimization Steps and Rationale:

1. Replace the adjacency matrix `m` with an adjacency list. Use `std::vector<std::vector<int>> adj` to store the adjacency list. This will only store the existing edges, thus reducing memory usage. In the BFS function, replace the iteration over the adjacency matrix with iteration over the adjacency list for the current node. This reduces the number of iterations to the number of edges, improving the time complexity of the BFS function.

2. Replace the fixed-size arrays `v` and `d` with `std::vector<int> visited` and `std::vector<int> distance`. This will ensure that only the necessary amount of memory is used.

3. Add `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` at the beginning of the main function. This can speed up input and output operations.

Trade-offs:

1. Using an adjacency list instead of an adjacency matrix can increase the code's complexity slightly, as working with 2D vectors in C++ is slightly more complex than working with 2D arrays. However, the performance gain in terms of time and memory efficiency is generally worth it.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;
vector<vector<int>> adj;
vector<int> visited, distance;

void bfs(int s) {
  visited[s] = true;
  distance[s] = 0;
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(s);
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int u = q.front();
    q.pop();
    for (int i : adj[u]) {
      if (!visited[i]) {
        distance[i] = distance[u] + 1;
        visited[i] = true;
        q.push(i);
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  adj.resize(n);
  visited.resize(n, false);
  distance.resize(n, -1);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int u, v, k;
    cin >> u >> k;
    u--;  // adjust to 0-based indexing
    for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      cin >> v;
      v--;  // adjust to 0-based indexing
      adj[u].push_back(v);
    }
  }

  bfs(0);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cout << i + 1 << ' ' << distance[i] << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code still performs BFS on the graph, but it does so more efficiently in terms of both time and memory usage.
