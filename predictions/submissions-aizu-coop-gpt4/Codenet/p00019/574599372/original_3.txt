1. **Code Analysis:**

The given program calculates the factorial of a given number 'n'. The factorial is calculated by multiplying all positive integers from 1 to 'n'. The program reads the number 'n' from the input, then uses a loop that iterates 'n' times, in each iteration the current number 'i' is multiplied with the variable 'a' which stores the factorial.

Potential performance bottlenecks might be:
- The loop that calculates the factorial can be inefficient for large values of 'n' due to the multiplication operation which is computationally expensive.
- The variable 'a' is of type `long long` which can consume a significant amount of memory for large factorials.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**

Optimizing this code might not be straightforward because the factorial operation inherently requires 'n' multiplications. However, we can use the following strategies to make the code more efficient:

A. Use an efficient data structure: For large factorials, the `long long` variable might not be sufficient to store the result. We can use an array to store the digits of the factorial. This can reduce memory usage as we are using integers instead of `long long`.

B. Use efficient algorithms: The multiplication operation can be optimized by using more efficient algorithms like the Karatsuba algorithm for large numbers.

C. Use compiler optimizations: We can use compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to enable optimizations at the compiler level.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

A. Change the data structure: We change the data structure for 'a' from `long long` to an array of integers. This way, we can store each digit of the factorial in the array which can be more memory efficient than using `long long`. The downside is that we need to implement the multiplication operation ourselves.

B. Efficient multiplication: Implement the multiplication operation using the Karatsuba algorithm or similar. This can speed up the multiplication operation significantly. However, it adds complexity to the code and might not be worth it for small values of 'n'.

C. Compiler optimizations: Use compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to let the compiler optimize the code. These flags can enable optimizations like loop unrolling and other performance optimizations. The downside is that the compiled code might not be portable to other systems or compilers.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**
Given the fact that the factorial calculation inherently requires 'n' multiplications and the optimization strategies might add complexity to the code, optimizing this code might not be straightforward and for small values of 'n', it might not affect the performance significantly. However, we can still optimize the loop by minimizing the number of multiplications.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
main() {
    long long a = 1;
    int i, n;
    cin >> n;
    for (i = n; i > 1; i -= 2) {
        if (i == 2) {
            a *= 2;
        } else {
            a *= i * (i - 1);
        }
    }
    cout << a << endl;
}
```
In this optimized code, the loop counts down from 'n' to 1 and in each iteration it multiplies 'a' with 'i' and 'i - 1'. This effectively halves the number of multiplications. For even 'n', it multiplies 'a' with 'i' and 'i - 1', and for odd 'n', when 'i' reaches 2, it multiplies 'a' with 2. But note that this optimization will not have a significant impact for small values of 'n'.
