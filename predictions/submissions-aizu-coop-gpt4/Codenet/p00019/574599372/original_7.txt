Code Analysis:

The above code calculates the factorial of a number. This is a very simple program, and the potential performance bottlenecks are limited. However, the main performance issue here is the loop which performs multiplication for each number from 2 to n to calculate the factorial. This can be a bottleneck if n is a very large number.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Using efficient data structures is not applicable here as the problem is straightforward.

2. The computation is not redundant but can be optimized using a mathematical approach. We can use the formula for the factorial of a number and convert the loop to a recursive call which will reduce the time complexity.

3. The loop can be optimized using recursion, and tail recursion can be utilized to make it even more efficient.

4. Compiler optimization is not required here as the code is simple and there are no complex computations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the for loop with a recursive function for calculating factorial. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(1). The reason is that recursion uses a stack to store the function calls, which reduces the time taken to compute the factorial.

2. Use tail recursion to further optimize the recursive function. Tail recursion is a technique where the recursive call is the last operation in the function. This allows the compiler to optimize the function and eliminate the stack.

Trade-offs:

The recursive solution will have a higher memory usage due to the function call stack as compared to the iterative solution. However, the time complexity is significantly reduced, making the program faster.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Using long long to avoid overflow for large n
long long factorial(int n, long long a = 1) {
  // Base case
  if(n == 1 || n == 0)
    return a;
  // Tail recursion
  return factorial(n - 1, n * a);
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  cout << factorial(n) << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, the factorial function uses tail recursion to calculate the factorial of a number. The second argument to the function is used to accumulate the result, allowing the recursion to be tail-recursive. The result is printed directly to the console.
