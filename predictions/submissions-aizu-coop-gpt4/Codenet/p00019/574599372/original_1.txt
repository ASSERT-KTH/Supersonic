Code Analysis:
The provided code is a simple C++ program to calculate the factorial of a number 'n'. It multiplies all numbers from 2 to 'n' in a loop. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The current data structures are appropriate for the task, so no changes are required in this regard.

2. Redundant or Unnecessary Computations: The program currently calculates the factorial in a straightforward way, which is not inefficient. However, it uses a 'long long' variable 'a' to hold the results. For larger factorials, this could easily overflow. 

3. Loops or Recursive Calls: The loop in the program is necessary for calculating the factorial. However, it could be optimized by unrolling it.

4. Compiler Optimizations or Pragma Directives: The use of compiler flags can speed up the execution time. For instance, if you're using the GCC compiler, you can use the -O3 optimization level, which enables all -O2 optimizations and more.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. To avoid overflow, we will calculate the log of the factorial instead of the factorial itself. This will also reduce the size of the results, which will be stored as 'double' instead of 'long long'.
   
2. We will unroll the loop to reduce the number of iterations. Loop unrolling can increase speed by reducing the number of control instructions (like jump, branch, etc.), thus making the loop body larger but faster.

Trade-offs:
1. Calculating the log of a factorial instead of the factorial itself might not be suitable for all uses. However, for large factorials, it is often the only practical solution.
2. Unrolling the loop can make the code longer and slightly harder to read. 

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  double log_factorial = 0.0;
  int i, n;
  cin >> n;
  for (i = 2; i <= n; i += 2) {
    // Unrolling the loop by calculating two terms at a time
    log_factorial += log(i);
    if (i+1 <= n) {
      log_factorial += log(i+1);
    }
  }
  cout << exp(log_factorial) << endl;  // Convert the log factorial back to a regular number
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the code calculates the log of the factorial to avoid overflow, and then converts it back to a regular number for output. It also unrolls the loop, calculating two terms at a time, to reduce the number of iterations.
