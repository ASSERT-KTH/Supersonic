Code Analysis:
The given C++ program calculates the factorial of an input integer 'n'. The computation is done in a linear loop from 2 to 'n', multiplying each integer to a variable 'a'. Although the code is simple and straightforward, it may face performance issues for larger values of 'n' due to potential multiplication overflow and CPU computation overhead.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The current program does not use any complicated data structures, so this is not an area we need to optimize in this case.

2. Redundant Computations: There are no redundant computations in the original code.

3. Loops and Recursive Calls: The loop that calculates the factorial can be optimized by unrolling it to reduce the number of iterations.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations can be used to further enhance the performance of the code. However, care should be taken as it can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Loop Unrolling: Instead of multiplying each number from 2 to 'n', we can unroll the loop to multiply two numbers at a time. This will effectively halve the number of iterations. The trade-off is that the code becomes slightly more complex and less intuitive.

2. Compiler Optimizations: The '-O2' or '-O3' optimization flags can be used when compiling the code to allow the compiler to make automatic optimizations. This could include things like instruction reordering, loop unrolling, and inlining. The trade-off is that the resulting code might behave unexpectedly in certain scenarios, and debugging can be more difficult.

Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  long long a = 1;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  // Loop unrolling
  int i = 2;
  for (; i <= n-1; i += 2) {
    a = a * i * (i+1);
  }

  // If n is odd, multiply the last number
  if (i == n) {
    a = a * i;
  }

  cout << a << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should be compiled with the '-O2' or '-O3' optimization flag to let the compiler make further optimizations.
For example: `g++ -O2 factorial.cpp`
