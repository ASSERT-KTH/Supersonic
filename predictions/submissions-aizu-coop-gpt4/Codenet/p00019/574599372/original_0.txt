This is a simple program in C++ that calculates the factorial of a given number. While this program is small and seemingly simple, there are a few optimization opportunities.

1. **Code Analysis:** 
    - The main inefficiency in this program is the way the factorial is calculated. The calculation is done through a for loop, which multiplies the current result by the loop counter. This is a very costly operation for large numbers.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**
    - Use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the factorial.
    - To reduce the number of multiplications, we could use recursion with memoization. This way, we only compute the factorial of each number once.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
    - We'll use a dynamic programming approach to calculate the factorial. This will involve creating an array to store the factorial of each number up to `n`. The factorial of a number `i` is simply `i` times the factorial of `i - 1`, which we've already calculated and stored in the array. This significantly reduces the number of multiplications we need to perform.
    - This optimization has the advantage of reducing the time complexity of the program. The disadvantage is that it slightly increases the space complexity, as we're storing an additional array. However, the space usage is still manageable and is a reasonable trade-off for the improved performance.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<long long> factorial(n + 1);
  factorial[0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i;
  }

  cout << factorial[n] << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version, we've replaced the expensive multiplication operation inside the loop with a more efficient memory look-up. This reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n), which is a significant improvement for large values of `n`. The space complexity increases from O(1) to O(n), but this is a reasonable trade-off for the improved performance.
