1. Code Analysis:
This program calculates the factorial of a number 'n'. It uses a loop to multiply each number from 2 to 'n' with a variable 'a' that is initially set to 1. The result is printed to the console.

Potential performance bottlenecks include the loop that performs the multiplication operation 'n' times. There is also a potential issue with variable 'a' overflowing if 'n' is a large number, because the factorial function grows very rapidly.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. Use a more efficient data structure: In this case, the data structure isn't a problem, as we're just dealing with primitive data types.
   2. Remove redundant computations: The loop isn't doing any redundant computations, but the way it's multiplying can be optimized.
   3. Optimize loops or recursive calls: The loop can be optimized by using a divide and conquer approach to calculate the factorial. This can significantly reduce the number of multiplications.
   4. Suggest compiler optimizations: The code could benefit from enabling compiler optimizations like -O2 or -O3 in gcc.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Divide and Conquer Approach: Instead of doing 'n' multiplications, we can reduce the number of multiplications by using a divide and conquer approach. We divide the problem into smaller subproblems, solve them independently, and then combine the solutions.
    2. Overflow Handling: To handle potential overflow of variable 'a', we could use a library like the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) that provides data types for large numbers. But for simplicity, we will not include this in our solution.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

long long factorial(int start, int end) {
    if (start > end) 
        return 1;
    if (start == end) 
        return start;
    int mid = (start + end) / 2;
    return factorial(start, mid) * factorial(mid + 1, end);
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    cout << factorial(2, n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have a recursive function 'factorial' which implements the divide and conquer approach. This function takes two parameters, 'start' and 'end', and recursively calculates the factorial of numbers from 'start' to 'end'. The base cases are when 'start' is greater than 'end', in which case the function returns 1, and when 'start' is equal to 'end', in which case the function returns 'start'. Otherwise, the function divides the range into two halves and recursively calculates the factorial of each half, then multiplies the two results together.

By using this divide and conquer approach, we're reducing the number of multiplications and thus improving the efficiency of the code. However, this approach increases the recursion depth to log2(n), which could be an issue for very large 'n'. In practice, this shouldn't be a problem unless 'n' is extremely large.
