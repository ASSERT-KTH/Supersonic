Code Analysis:
The code is a C program that reads a list of numbers from standard input, then for each subsequent number, it calculates the maximum length of the sequence that includes the current number and the previous numbers from the input list. The final result is printed to standard output.

Potential issues with the current implementation:

1. The variable names are not descriptive, which makes the code harder to read and understand.

2. The code uses global variables, which can lead to unwanted side effects and makes debugging more difficult.

3. There are no comments in the code, which makes it difficult to understand the logic and the purpose of each section of the code.

4. The code uses bitwise operators which are difficult to understand and can often lead to subtle bugs.

5. The code uses hardcoded array sizes, which can lead to buffer overflow if the size of the input exceeds the size of the array.

6. The code doesn't use any error checking for the return values of scanf and printf functions. The program may continue to execute with incorrect data if these functions fail for any reason.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the hardcoded array sizes with dynamic memory allocation to handle inputs of any size. 

2. Replace global variables with local variables and pass them as arguments to functions to improve the code's readability and maintainability and to avoid unwanted side effects.

3. Add comments to the code to explain the logic and purpose of each section of the code.

4. Replace bitwise operators with more readable and understandable alternatives.

5. Add error checking for the return values of scanf and printf functions.

Optimized Code Block:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Function to find the maximum length of sequence
int findMaxLength(int* arr, int size, int num) {
    int* diff = malloc(size * sizeof(int));
    int maxLen = 0, temp = 0, currLen = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
        diff[i] = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        temp = diff[i];
        diff[i] = num != arr[i] ? currLen : temp + 1;
        currLen = num != arr[i] ? currLen : temp + 1;

        if (maxLen < currLen)
            maxLen = currLen;
    }

    free(diff);
    return maxLen;
}

int main() {
    int size;
    if(scanf("%d", &size) != 1) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error reading input\n");
        return 1;
    }

    int* arr = malloc(size * sizeof(int));

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
        if(scanf("%d", &arr[i]) != 1) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Error reading input\n");
            return 1;
        }

    int num;
    while (scanf("%d", &num) == 1) {
        int maxLen = findMaxLength(arr, size, num);
        if(printf("%d\n", maxLen) < 0) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Error writing output\n");
            return 1;
        }
    }

    free(arr);
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the code is refactored to improve readability and maintainability. The global variables are replaced with local variables and passed as arguments to functions. The hardcoded array sizes are replaced with dynamic memory allocation. The bitwise operators are replaced with more readable and understandable alternatives. Error checking is added for the return values of scanf and printf functions.
