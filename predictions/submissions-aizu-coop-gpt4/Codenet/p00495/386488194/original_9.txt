This code seems to be doing some form of dynamic programming, possibly solving the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem. The two main areas where we can focus our optimization efforts are:

1. The use of scanf for input
2. The nested for loop for calculations

Here's our plan for optimizing this piece of code:

1. Use `fgets` instead of `scanf`. Reading large chunks of input data with `fgets` is faster than doing so with `scanf` because `scanf` needs to parse the format string for every input, while `fgets` reads the whole line at once.

2. Use an array to store the result of the operation `x - c[i]` which is used twice. This will save computing time.

3. Instead of using the ternary operator for assigning `d[i]`, use an if-else block. This is because the ternary operator is computing `m = u` even when `m < u` is false which is unnecessary and could slow down the performance.

4. Use `printf` instead of `!printf`. The '!' operator is not required as we are not checking the return value of printf.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int c[5004], d[5004], m, t, u, i, f;
char buffer[10000];

int main() {
  // Use fgets instead of scanf for faster input
  fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
  *c = atoi(buffer);

  // Populate c array
  for(int j = 0; j < *c; j++) {
    fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
    c[j+1] = atoi(buffer);
  }

  while(fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin) != NULL) {
    int x = atoi(buffer);
    int diff[5004];
    for (u = i = t = 0; i++ < *c; t = d[i]) {
      diff[i] = x - c[i];
      if (m < u) {
         m = u;
      }
      d[i] = diff[i] ? u : t + 1;
      u = diff[i] ? u : t + 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", m);

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces redundant computations and makes better use of memory. However, it may be slightly more difficult to understand due to the extra array and if-else block used for optimization.
