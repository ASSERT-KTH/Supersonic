The provided code seems to be a solution for the "Longest Common Subsequence" (LCS) problem, where it finds the longest common subsequence from the input sequence. However, there are several areas where we can optimize this code.

Code Analysis:
1. The program uses arrays c and d of size 5004, which are hard-coded. This is inefficient if the input size is smaller or larger than 5004.
2. The program uses global variables which can make it difficult to understand and maintain. 
3. The loops in the code are not optimally written, and readability is poor due to the lack of meaningful variable names and comments.
4. The scanf function is used in a for-loop condition, which may not be intuitive for someone reading the code.
5. The print statement is used to reset the 'm' variable, which is not the best practice.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace hard-coded array sizes with dynamic memory allocation based on the input size. This will reduce unnecessary memory usage.
2. Replace global variables with local variables to improve maintainability and readability.
3. Improve the readability of the code by using meaningful variable names and adding comments.
4. Use a while-loop for reading inputs instead of embedding scanf in the for-loop condition.
5. Reset the 'm' variable in a separate statement, and not as a side effect of the printf statement.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int sequenceLength, i, temp, maxSubsequenceLength = 0;
  int currentNum;
  
  scanf("%d", &sequenceLength);
  
  int* sequence = (int*) malloc((sequenceLength + 1) * sizeof(int));
  int* subsequenceLength = (int*) malloc((sequenceLength + 1) * sizeof(int));
  
  for (i = 1; i <= sequenceLength; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &sequence[i]);
    subsequenceLength[i] = 0; // Initializing the subsequenceLength array to 0
  }

  // Reading inputs for the subsequence search
  while(scanf("%d", &currentNum) == 1) {
    // Looping through the sequence to find the subsequence
    for (i = 1, temp = 0; i <= sequenceLength; temp = subsequenceLength[i], i++) {
      if (currentNum == sequence[i]) {
        subsequenceLength[i] = temp + 1;
      } else if (subsequenceLength[i] < temp) {
        subsequenceLength[i] = temp;
      }
      // Updating the maximum subsequence length
      if (subsequenceLength[i] > maxSubsequenceLength)
        maxSubsequenceLength = subsequenceLength[i];
    }
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", maxSubsequenceLength);

  // Resetting maxSubsequenceLength
  maxSubsequenceLength = 0;

  // Releasing the allocated memory
  free(sequence);
  free(subsequenceLength);

  return 0;
}
```

Here is the explanation for the optimizations:
1. Instead of hard-coded array size, dynamic memory allocation is used to allocate memory based on the input size. This reduces unnecessary memory usage when the input size is less than 5004 and allows handling of inputs larger than 5004.
2. Global variables are replaced with local variables to improve code maintainability and readability.
3. The code is written in a more structured and readable way, with meaningful variable names and added comments to explain the logic.
4. Instead of using scanf within the for-loop condition, a while-loop is used to read inputs until EOF. This improves the readability of the code.
5. The 'maxSubsequenceLength' variable is reset in a separate statement, making the code more intuitive to understand.
6. The allocated memory is released at the end of the program to avoid memory leaks.
