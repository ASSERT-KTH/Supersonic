Before we start optimizing this code, let's first understand what it does. The given code appears to be a solution to an optimization problem, where it is trying to minimize a 'cost' subject to certain constraints. It seems to be a problem of dynamic programming with a complexity of O(N^2).

Here are the potential optimization strategies:

1. **Avoid unnecessary initialization:** The code initializes a large 2D array `dp[2][N + 10] = {}` with zeroes and then fills most of it with `INF`. We can initialize it with `INF` directly using `std::fill`.

2. **Use efficient data structures:** The code uses a vector of pairs `vector<P> mg[2]` to store the magic items. If the order doesn't matter or if we need to frequently find an item, a `std::unordered_map` or `std::map` could be more efficient.

3. **Minimize redundant calculations:** There are some calculations that are repeated multiple times like `min(N, j)`, `dp[k][min(N, j)]`, `dp[k][j - mg[k][i].f] + mg[k][i].s`. These can be stored in temporary variables to avoid repeated computation.

4. **Optimize loops:** The code uses multiple nested loops. Some of these loops are independent and can be parallelized using OpenMP or similar libraries. Also, loop unrolling can be applied to the innermost loop to reduce the overhead of loop control instructions.

5. **Avoid unnecessary input/output operations:** The code reads the name of the magic items but doesn't use them. If the input format allows, we can avoid reading this data to save some time.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define INF 1e9
#define N 100000
using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
typedef long long ll;
int main() {
  int n, m, hp[101];
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> hp[i];
    vector<P> mg[2];
    cin >> m;
    for (int i = 0, cost, dam; i < m; i++) {
      string name, type;
      cin >> name >> cost >> type >> dam;
      if (dam)
        mg[type == "All"].push_back(P(dam, cost));
    }
    int dp[2][N + 10];
    for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
      fill(dp[i], dp[i]+N+10, INF);
    for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++)
      for (size_t i = 0; i < mg[k].size(); i++)
        for (int j = mg[k][i].first; j <= (N / mg[k][i].first + 1) * mg[k][i].first; j++) {
          int min_j = min(N, j);
          dp[k][min_j] =
              min(dp[k][min_j], dp[k][j - mg[k][i].first] + mg[k][i].second);
        }
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
      for (int j = N; j >= 0; j--)
        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j + 1]);
    ll ans = INF;
    for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
      ll cost = dp[1][i];
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        cost += dp[0][max(0, hp[j] - i)];
      ans = min(ans, cost);
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimization strategies proposed here are based on the given code. Depending on the specific problem and input data, other optimization techniques may also be applicable.
