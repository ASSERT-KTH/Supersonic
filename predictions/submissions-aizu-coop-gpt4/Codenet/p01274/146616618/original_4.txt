Here's my analysis and proposed optimizations:

1. INCLUDES: The inclusion of the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>` is not recommended due to its high overhead. We should include only those headers that are actually used in the program.

2. CONSTANTS: The MAX value `N` can be made constant for better clarity and to prevent unintended changes. 

3. DATA STRUCTURES: `mg` is a vector of pairs. We can use `std::array` instead of `std::vector` for faster access and better cache locality. 

4. LOOPS: The nested loop with `min(N, j)` in its body is called multiple times which can be optimized by storing the result in a variable. 

5. REDUNDANT COMPUTATIONS: The expression `(N / mg[k][i].f + 1) * mg[k][i].f` is computed for each iteration, which can be optimized by precomputing it before the loop starts.

6. MEMORY USAGE: The array `dp` is quite large. We should consider whether it's possible to reduce its size.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>
#include <array>

const int INF = 1e9;
const int N = 100000;

typedef std::pair<int, int> P;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
    int n, m, hp[101];
    while (std::cin >> n, n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            std::cin >> hp[i];
        std::array<std::vector<P>, 2> mg;
        
        std::cin >> m;
        for (int i = 0, cost, dam; i < m; i++) {
            std::string name, type;
            std::cin >> name >> cost >> type >> dam;
            if (dam)
                mg[type == "All"].push_back(P(dam, cost));
        }
        
        int dp[2][N + 10] = {};
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
            for (int j = 1; j < N + 10; j++)
                dp[i][j] = INF;
        
        for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++)
            for (int i = 0; i < mg[k].size(); i++) {
                int range = (N / mg[k][i].first + 1) * mg[k][i].first;
                for (int j = mg[k][i].first; j <= range; j++) {
                    int min_val = std::min(N, j);
                    dp[k][min_val] = std::min(dp[k][min_val], dp[k][j - mg[k][i].first] + mg[k][i].second);
                }
            }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
            for (int j = N; j >= 0; j--)
                dp[i][j] = std::min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j + 1]);
        
        ll ans = INF;
        for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
            ll cost = dp[1][i];
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                cost += dp[0][std::max(0, hp[j] - i)];
            ans = std::min(ans, cost);
        }
        std::cout << ans << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Note: Further optimization can be achieved by tailoring the data structures and algorithms to the specific problem at hand. Also, keep in mind that the readability and maintainability of the code are also important factors to consider. This version of the code may have some trade-offs in terms of readability, but it aims to improve the execution speed.
