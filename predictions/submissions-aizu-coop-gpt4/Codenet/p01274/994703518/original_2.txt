Analysis:

This code is a dynamic programming solution to some problem. The critical parts of the code that can be optimized are the two inner loops where the maximum of `dp1[j]` and `dp1[j - x] + y` is calculated and another where the maximum of `dp2[j]` and `dp2[j - x] + y` is calculated. 

There is also a third inner loop where the sum is calculated by `lower_bound` function call in every iteration. This can also be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use array to store intermediate data: The computations `dp1[j - x] + y` and `dp2[j - x] + y` are repeated several times. We can store these computations in temporary arrays and use them in the loop.

2. Binary search optimization: In the third inner loop, `lower_bound` function is being used which is a binary search function. Since dp1 array is sorted, we can optimize this part by implementing a simpler binary search instead of using `lower_bound`.

Step by Step Explanation:

1. In the first and second inner loop, we can store the computation `dp1[j - x] + y` and `dp2[j - x] + y` in temporary arrays and use it in the loop. This will avoid repeating the same computation again and again which will save computation time.

2. In the third inner loop, since dp1 array is sorted, we can use binary search instead of `lower_bound`. This will also save computation time.

Trade-off: The above optimizations will save computation time at the expense of little extra memory usage. The extra memory usage will be for storing the intermediate computations in temporary arrays.

      continue;

    ll ans = 1ll << 60, sum;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10001; i++) {
      if (dp2[i] < 0)
        continue;
      sum = i;
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        int l = 0, r = 10000, mid;
        while (l <= r) { //binary search
           mid = (l + r) / 2;
           if (dp1[mid] < num[j] - dp2[i])
              l = mid + 1;
           else
              r = mid - 1;
        }
        sum += l;
      }
      ans = min(ans, sum);
    }
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized code will provide the same output as the original code but with improved performance.
