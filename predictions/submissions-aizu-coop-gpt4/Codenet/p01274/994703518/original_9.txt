This C++ program is designed to solve a computational problem with a combination of dynamic programming and binary search. It operates on an input set of numbers stored in the `num` array. The main performance bottleneck seems to be the use of two nested for loops, which collectively contribute to a high time complexity of O(n^2). The use of dynamic arrays `dp1` and `dp2` also indicate potential inefficiencies in memory usage.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Efficient Data Structures: The current program uses arrays `dp1` and `dp2` to store intermediate results. However, arrays are not the most efficient data structures when it comes to searching for values. We could use a `std::map` instead, which would take advantage of binary search properties and reduce the search time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

2. Redundant Computations: The program calculates `dp1[j - x] + y` and `dp2[j - x] + y` inside the loop for every `j`. This is redundant because the value of `y` does not change in the loop. We can calculate `dp1[j - x] + y` and `dp2[j - x] + y` once before the loop starts and use the computed value inside the loop.

3. Loops Optimization: Loop unrolling can be used to optimize the for loops. It is a technique used to increase the speed of the loops by reducing the overhead of loop control instructions.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Use of pragma directives or compiler flags like `-O3` can help in optimizing the code further.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <map>
#define ll long long
#define maxn 100009
#define inf 999999999999
using namespace std;
map<ll, ll> dp1;
map<ll, ll> dp2;
char s[25];
int num[105];
int main() {
  int n, m, x, y;
  while (scanf("%d", &n) != EOF) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%d", &num[i]);
    sort(num, num + n);
    dp2.clear();
    dp2[0] = 0;
    dp1.clear();
    scanf("%d", &m);
    bool flag = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      scanf("%s", s);
      scanf("%d", &x);
      scanf("%s", s);
      scanf("%d", &y);
      if (x == 0 && y > 0)
        flag = 1;
      ll val = (s[0] == 'S') ? dp1[x] + y : dp2[x] + y;
      for (int j = x; j <= 10000; j++)
        if (s[0] == 'S')
          dp1[j] = max(dp1[j], val);
        else
          dp2[j] = max(dp2[j], val);
    }
    if (flag) {
      puts("0");
      continue;
    }
    ll ans = 1ll << 60, sum;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10001; i++) {
      if (dp2[i] < 0)
        continue;
      sum = i;
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        sum += lower_bound(dp1.begin(), dp1.end(), num[j] - dp2[i]) - dp1.begin();
      }
      ans = min(ans, sum);
    }
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code uses `std::map` instead of arrays to store intermediate results. This can significantly reduce the time complexity of searching for values. It also avoids redundant computation of `dp1[j - x] + y` and `dp2[j - x] + y` by calculating the value once before the loop starts. The trade-off is that the code may become a bit more complex to understand due to the additional steps. Also, maps in C++ are generally slower than arrays, so this might only be a feasible solution for small inputs.
