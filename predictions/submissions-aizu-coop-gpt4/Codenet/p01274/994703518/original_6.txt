**1. Code Analysis:**

The code represents a dynamic programming problem. It reads a series of operations from the input and performs some operations based on the input. It's making use of two dynamic programming arrays `dp1` and `dp2` to store intermediate results. The maximum value of the dp1 and dp2 arrays is being updated in two inner loops. Then a minimum value is being computed using these dp arrays. 

**2. Optimization Strategy:**

Below are the steps we can take to optimize the code:

A. Use Faster I/O Methods: The usage of `scanf` and `printf` for I/O operations can be slower. We can use faster I/O methods to improve the performance.

B. Avoid Unnecessary Computation: In the code, there are multiple instances where we are computing something repeatedly. We can avoid that by storing the result of the computation and using it later.

C. Use More Efficient Data Structures: Currently, the program utilizes arrays for storing the intermediate results. We can use `vector` which is a more efficient data structure in C++.

D. Compiler Optimization Flags: We can use compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` which enables all optimization flags.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

A. Use Faster I/O Methods:
   - Here we will replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`. However, to make it faster we can use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` at the start of the main function.

B. Avoid Unnecessary Computation:
   - In the code, inside the loops, there are multiple calls to `max` function. Instead of calling `max` function every time, we can store the result in a variable and use it.

C. Use More Efficient Data Structures:
   - We are using arrays to store data which doesn't provide us with a lot of built-in functions. We will replace arrays with `vector` which will provide us with a lot of built-in functions and is also more memory efficient.

D. Compiler Optimization Flags:
   - While compiling the code, we can use `-O2` or `-O3` compiler flags which tells the compiler to perform more optimizations that might take longer to compile or use more memory but should make the executable run faster.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define ll long long
#define maxn 100009
#define inf 999999999999
using namespace std;
vector<ll> dp1(10009);
vector<ll> dp2(10006);
char s[25];
vector<int> num(105);
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, m, x, y;
  while (cin >> n) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> num[i];
    sort(num.begin(), num.end());
    fill(dp2.begin(), dp2.end(), -inf);
    dp2[0] = 0;
    fill(dp1.begin(), dp1.end(), 0);
    cin >> m;
    bool flag = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      cin >> s >> x >> s >> y;
      if (x == 0 && y > 0)
        flag = 1;
      ll max_val = 0;
      if (s[0] == 'S') {
        for (int j = x; j <= 10000; j++){
          max_val = max(max_val, dp1[j - x] + y);
          dp1[j] = max(dp1[j], max_val);
        }
      } else {
        for (int j = x; j <= 10000; j++){
          max_val = max(max_val, dp2[j - x] + y);
          dp2[j] = max(dp2[j], max_val);
        }
      }
    }
    if (flag) {
      cout << "0\n";
      continue;
    }
    ll ans = 1ll << 60, sum;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10001; i++) {
      if (dp2[i] < 0)
        continue;
      sum = i;
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        sum += lower_bound(dp1.begin(), dp1.end() - 1, num[j] - dp2[i]) - dp1.begin();
      }
      ans = min(ans, sum);
    }
    cout << ans << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:

- Using vectors instead of arrays can slightly increase the runtime due to the overhead of managing the extra features that vectors provide.
- Compiler flag can increase the compilation time.
- Fast I/O can sometimes cause issues with interactive problems.
