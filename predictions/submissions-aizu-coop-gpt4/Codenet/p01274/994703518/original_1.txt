1. Code Analysis: 

The given C++ program seems to be solving a dynamic programming problem. It reads input from the standard input and performs calculations on arrays `dp1` and `dp2` based on the input.

The main bottlenecks in this code could come from the following sections:

- The loop where it calculates `dp1` and `dp2` arrays. Especially when it performs a linear scan from `x` to `10000` for each input command. This could be slow if `m` (the number of commands) is large.
- The use of `lower_bound` function inside the nested loop, which is again a linear scan. This could be slow if `n` (the number of numbers) is large.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Inefficient Data Structures: The current data structures seem to be efficient enough for the task. There isn't any data structure that could be replaced to increase efficiency.

B. Redundant Computations: There is a redundant computation in the use of `lower_bound` function. Instead of repeatedly finding the lower bound for each number, we could sort `dp1` and `dp2` arrays and then use binary search to find the lower bound.

C. Loops/Recursive Calls: The loops in this code are necessary for the dynamic programming approach. However, the loop where it calculates `dp1` and `dp2` arrays could be optimized by using a prefix sum array.

D. Compiler Optimizations: Using compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` can help the compiler to optimize the code.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Sorting `dp1` and `dp2` Arrays: Sorting these arrays and using binary search instead of `lower_bound` function will reduce the time complexity from `O(n)` to `O(log n)`. This will save computation time when `n` is large.

B. Prefix Sum Array: Using a prefix sum array to calculate `dp1` and `dp2` arrays will save computation time. Instead of calculating the sum from `x` to `10000` for each input command, we can calculate the sum once and use it for all the commands.

C. Compiler Flags: Using compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` can help the compiler to optimize the code.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#define ll long long
#define maxn 100009
#define inf 999999999999
using namespace std;
ll dp1[10009], prefix1[10009];
ll dp2[10006], prefix2[10006];
char s[25];
int num[105];
int main() {
  int n, m, x, y;
  while (scanf("%d", &n) != EOF) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%d", &num[i]);
    sort(num, num + n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10000; i++)
      dp2[i] = -inf;
    dp2[0] = 0;
    memset(dp1, 0, sizeof dp1);
    memset(prefix1, 0, sizeof prefix1);
    memset(prefix2, 0, sizeof prefix2);
    scanf("%d", &m);
    bool flag = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      scanf("%s", s);
      scanf("%d", &x);
      scanf("%s", s);
      scanf("%d", &y);
      if (x == 0 && y > 0)
        flag = 1;
      if (s[0] == 'S') {
        for (int j = x; j <= 10000; j++)
          dp1[j] = max(dp1[j], prefix1[j - x] + y);
      } else {
        for (int j = x; j <= 10000; j++)
          dp2[j] = max(dp2[j], prefix2[j - x] + y);
      }
      // build prefix sum arrays
      for (int j = 1; j <= 10000; j++) {
        prefix1[j] = prefix1[j - 1] + dp1[j];
        prefix2[j] = prefix2[j - 1] + dp2[j];
      }
    }
    if (flag) {
      puts("0");
      continue;
    }
    ll ans = 1ll << 60, sum;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10001; i++) {
      if (dp2[i] < 0)
        continue;
      sum = i;
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        int index = lower_bound(prefix1, prefix1 + 10000, num[j] - prefix2[i]) - prefix1;
        sum += index;
      }
      ans = min(ans, sum);
    }
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we added two prefix sum arrays `prefix1` and `prefix2` to save the sum of `dp1` and `dp2` arrays. We also replaced the `lower_bound` function with a binary search on the prefix sum array. These optimizations should significantly speed up the code.
