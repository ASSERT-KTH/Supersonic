The provided C++ code is quite complex and involves operations with arrays, some conditional statements, sorting, and some I/O operations. From an initial inspection, there are several areas where the code might be improved:

1. **Memory Usage**: The code declares arrays `dp1`, `dp2`, and `num` with fixed sizes which doesn't consider the actual number of elements needed in each run of the program. This could lead to wasted memory. 

2. **Loop Efficiency**: The code contains several nested loops that iterate over the same array. These loops could potentially be optimized.

3. **Repeated Computations**: Inside the nested loops, there are some computations that could be performed once outside the loop and reused. For instance, `num[j] - dp2[i]` is calculated multiple times.

4. **Data Structure**: `std::vector` instead of arrays can be used for dynamic memory allocation.

The following steps can be taken to optimize the code:

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Use `std::vector` instead of arrays to allocate memory dynamically according to the actual number of elements required. 

2. **Reduce Nested Loops**: Try to reduce the number of nested loops. If there are computations that are repeated in every loop iteration, perform them once outside the loop and store the result.

3. **Avoid Repeated Computations**: `num[j] - dp2[i]` is calculated multiple times and can be stored in a variable for use.

4. **Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`:** Disabling the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their C counterparts can speed up input/output operations.

5. **Use `std::cin.tie(NULL)`:** This unties `cin` from `cout`. Tied streams ensure that one stream is flushed automatically before each I/O operation on the other stream. By untieing the streams, we can potentially improve I/O performance.

6. **Compiler Optimizations**: Use compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` when compiling the code to enable compiler optimizations.

7. **Unnecessary Operations**: If any operation does not contribute to the final output, remove it.

Below is the optimized version of the provided code. The changes have been commented and explained.

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false); // faster I/O

      return 0;

      if (s[0] == 'S') {
        for (int j = x; j <= maxn; j++)
          dp1[j] = max(dp1[j], dp1[j - x] + y);
      } else {
        for (int j = x; j <= maxn; j++)
          dp2[j] = max(dp2[j], dp2[j - x] + y);
      }
    }

    if (flag) {

      continue;
    }

    ll ans = 1ll << 60, sum;
    for (int i = 0; i < maxn; i++) {
      if (dp2[i] < 0)
        continue;
      sum = i;
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        ll tmp = num[j] - dp2[i]; // store the result of the computation
        sum += lower_bound(dp1.begin(), dp1.begin() + maxn, tmp) - dp1.begin();
      }
      ans = min(ans, sum);
    }
    cout << ans << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}

Please note that without a specific context, it's hard to measure the performance of this code or propose more specific optimizations. Always test and profile your code to find the actual bottlenecks.
