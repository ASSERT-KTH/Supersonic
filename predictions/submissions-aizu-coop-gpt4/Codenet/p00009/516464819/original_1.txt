1. Code Analysis:

The given code is an implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given limit. It first reads a list of numbers from standard input, generates a list of primes up to the maximum of these numbers, and then for each input number, it counts the number of primes less than or equal to that number. 

Potential performance bottlenecks include:

- Usage of list for storing primes: Lists are not cache friendly and hence can slow down the program.
- Inefficient search for primes: The current approach to count the primes less than or equal to each input number involves a linear search in the list of primes. This can be slow if the number of primes is large.

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Use a more efficient data structure for storing primes: Instead of a list, a vector can be used to store the primes. Vectors are more cache friendly and hence can lead to faster performance.

B. Use binary search to count primes: Instead of linearly searching the list of primes, a binary search can be performed on the vector of primes to count the number of primes less than or equal to each input number. This can significantly speed up the program when the number of primes is large.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Why change from list to vector: Lists in C++ are implemented as doubly linked lists. They do not store their elements contiguously, which means they do not take advantage of spatial locality in cache memory. This can result in poor performance when traversing the list. On the other hand, vectors store their elements contiguously, which can lead to better cache performance.

B. Why use binary search: The current approach to count primes less than or equal to each input number involves a linear search, which has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of primes. By using binary search, we can reduce this time complexity to O(log n), which can significantly speed up the program when the number of primes is large.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void sieve(int n, vector<int> &primes) {
    vector<bool> is_prime(n+1, true);
    for (int i = 3, end = sqrt(n); i <= end; i += 2) {
        if (!is_prime[i])
            continue;
        for (int j = i * i, skip = i * 2; j <= n; j += skip)
            is_prime[j] = false;
    }
    primes.push_back(2);
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i += 2)
        if (is_prime[i])
            primes.push_back(i);
}

int main() {
    vector<int> primes, inputs;
    for (int x; cin >> x;)
        inputs.push_back(x);
    sieve(*max_element(inputs.begin(), inputs.end()), primes);
    for (auto x : inputs) {
        cout << (upper_bound(primes.begin(), primes.end(), x) - primes.begin()) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, I replaced the list with a vector for storing the primes, and I used the STL function `upper_bound` to perform a binary search on the vector of primes. The `upper_bound` function returns an iterator pointing to the first element that is greater than the specified value. By subtracting the beginning iterator of the vector from this returned iterator, we get the count of primes less than or equal to the specified value.
