## Code Analysis

The given program reads inputs from the user, computes prime numbers up to the maximum input value using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, and then for each input, it counts the number of primes less than or equal to the input.

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:

1. Inefficient Data Structure: A list is used to store the prime numbers. Searching a list for each input is a linear operation, which can be expensive for large inputs.

2. Redundant Computations: For each input, the program goes through all the primes each time, which is redundant. We can optimize it by using binary search since the list of primes is already sorted.

## Optimization Strategy

1. Inefficient Data Structures: Instead of using a list to store the prime numbers, we can use a vector which will allow us to use binary search to find the number of primes less than or equal to a given number.

2. Redundant Computations: We can use binary search instead of going through all primes for each input.

3. Compiler Optimizations: We can use the `-O3` flag for the compiler to enable more aggressive optimizations including inline substitutions, loop unrolling, and vectorization.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Replace list with vector: Storing the primes in a vector allows us to use binary search which reduces time complexity from O(n) to O(log n). The trade-off here is that inserting in a vector is slightly slower than inserting in a list, but since we only insert once and then do multiple searches, it's worth the trade-off.

2. Use binary search: Instead of iterating through the primes for each input, we can use binary search to find the number of primes less than or equal to a given number. This reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

3. Compiler optimizations: Using the `-O3` compiler flag enables various optimizations that can improve performance. The trade-off is that the code can become more difficult to debug and understand.

## Optimized Code Block

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void sieve(int n, vector<int> &primes) {
  vector<bool> v(n + 1, true);
  for (int i = 2, end = sqrt(n); i <= end; i++) {
    if (!v[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i)
      v[j] = false;
  }
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
    if (v[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
}

int main() {
  vector<int> primes;
  vector<int> inputs;
  for (int x; cin >> x;)
    inputs.push_back(x);
  sieve(*max_element(inputs.begin(), inputs.end()), primes);
  for (auto x : inputs) {
    cout << lower_bound(primes.begin(), primes.end(), x + 1) - primes.begin() << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, a vector is used to store the primes and binary search is used to count the number of primes less than or equal to each input. The sieve function is also slightly optimized by starting from 2 instead of 3, and incrementing by 1 instead of 2.
