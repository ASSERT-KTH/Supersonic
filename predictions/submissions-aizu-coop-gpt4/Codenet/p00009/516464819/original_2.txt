Analysis:
The code above implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all prime numbers up to a given limit, n. The main() function reads inputs from the user, applies the Sieve to find primes and counts the number of primes less than or equal to each user input. 

There are several areas in the code where performance could be improved:

1. The use of list to store the primes. The list data structure, while excellent for insertion and removal of elements, can be slow for iterating, which is what we do in the main() function. This is due to the fact that list doesn't provide random access to its elements.

2. The way we're checking if a number is a prime in the main() function is inefficient. For each input number, we're iterating over all primes less than or equal to that number. This is time-consuming and unnecessary.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the list data structure with a vector. Vectors provide fast random access to elements which will be beneficial when we iterate over the primes. 

2. Instead of iterating over all primes to check if a number is a prime number, we can use the vector of boolean values (that we already have in the sieve() function) to check if a number is a prime in constant time. 

3. Instead of calculating the count of primes less than or equal to an input number by iterating over the primes, we can use prefix sums. By maintaining an array where every index i stores the count of primes less than or equal to i, we can find the count of primes less than or equal to an input number in constant time.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void sieve(int n, vector<int>& primesCount) {
  vector<bool> isPrime(n + 1, true);
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  for (int i = 3, end = sqrt(n); i <= end; i += 2) {
    if (!isPrime[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i * i, skip = i * 2; j <= n; j += skip)
      isPrime[j] = false;
  }
  primesCount[2] = 1;
  for (int i = 3; i <= n; i += 2) {
    primesCount[i] = primesCount[i-1] + (isPrime[i] ? 1 : 0);
    if (i+1 <= n) {
      primesCount[i+1] = primesCount[i];
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  vector<int> inputs;
  for (int x; cin >> x;)
    inputs.push_back(x);
  int maxInput = *max_element(inputs.begin(), inputs.end());
  vector<int> primesCount(maxInput + 1);
  sieve(maxInput, primesCount);
  for (auto x : inputs) {
    cout << primesCount[x] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this code, the vector primesCount[i] stores the count of prime numbers less than or equal to i. This allows us to look up the count of primes less than or equal to an input number in constant time. This significantly optimizes the code by reducing the time complexity from O(n) to O(1) for each input number.
