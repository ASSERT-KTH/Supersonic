1. Code Analysis:

The given C++ program reads a stream of integers from standard input, finds the maximum number, calculates all the prime numbers up to that maximum number using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, and then for each input number, counts the number of primes less than or equal to it. The main performance bottlenecks in the code are:

    a. The use of a list to store primes: List is a doubly linked list and does not provide constant time access to its elements.
  
    b. Linear search for counting primes: The program counts primes by iterating over the entire list for each input number, which can be optimized by binary search.
  
2. Optimization Strategy:

    a. Use vector instead of list: Vector provides constant time access to its elements and can be more cache friendly because it stores elements in contiguous memory locations.

    b. Use binary search for counting primes: Since the primes are sorted, we can use binary search to count the number of primes less than or equal to the input number.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    a. Replace list with vector: By using vector, we can access its elements in constant time, which can significantly speed up the process of counting primes. However, the trade-off is that adding elements at the end of a vector may occasionally involve resizing the vector and copying all its elements to a new location.

    b. Use binary search: By using binary search, we can reduce the time complexity of counting primes from O(n) to O(log n), where n is the number of primes. The trade-off is that binary search requires the input to be sorted, but in this case, it's not a problem because the primes are always sorted.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void sieve(int n, vector<int> &primes) {
  vector<bool> v(n + 1, true);
  for (int i = 3, end = sqrt(n); i <= end; i += 2) {
    if (!v[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i * i, skip = i * 2; j <= n; j += skip)
      v[j] = false;
  }
  primes.push_back(2);
  for (int i = 3; i <= n; i += 2)
    if (v[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
}

int main() {
  vector<int> primes;
  vector<int> inputs;
  for (int x; cin >> x;)
    inputs.push_back(x);
  sieve(*max_element(inputs.begin(), inputs.end()), primes);
  for (auto x : inputs) {
    // Use lower_bound to find the number of primes less than or equal to x
    int count = lower_bound(primes.begin(), primes.end(), x + 1) - primes.begin();
    cout << count << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized code uses a vector to store the primes and uses the lower_bound function to find the number of primes less than or equal to the input number. The lower_bound function performs a binary search and returns an iterator pointing to the first prime that is not less than x + 1, so subtracting the beginning iterator from it gives the number of primes less than or equal to x.
