**Code Analysis**

The given C++ code reads a list of positive integers from the standard input, calculates the number of primes less than or equal to each of these integers, and outputs these counts. It uses the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate the list of primes.

Several parts of the code can be optimized:

1. The code is storing the prime numbers in a `std::list`. This is inefficient as searching in a list takes linear time. A `std::vector` would be a better choice as it provides random access, which can be used to speed up the search.

2. The list of primes is being iterated for each input number, leading to a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the number of input numbers and m is the number of primes. This can be avoided by storing the count of primes less than or equal to each number in a `std::vector` and directly outputting the counts for each input number.

**Optimization Strategy**

1. Replace `std::list` with `std::vector` for storing the primes.
2. Store the count of primes less than or equal to each number in a `std::vector` and directly output the counts for each input number.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. We replace `std::list` with `std::vector` in the `sieve` function and in the `main` function. This will allow for faster access to the prime numbers.

2. After generating the list of primes, we create a vector `primeCounts` of size `n+1`, where `n` is the maximum input number. `primeCounts[i]` will store the count of primes less than or equal to `i`.

3. For each input number `x`, we can directly output `primeCounts[x]`.

**Optimized Code Block**

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
void sieve(int n, vector<int> &primes) {
  vector<bool> v(n + 1, true);
  for (int i = 2, end = sqrt(n); i <= end; i++) {
    if (!v[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i)
      v[j] = false;
  }
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
    if (v[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
}
int main() {
  vector<int> primes;
  vector<int> inputs;
  for (int x; cin >> x;)
    inputs.push_back(x);
  int maxVal = *max_element(inputs.begin(), inputs.end());
  sieve(maxVal, primes);
  vector<int> primeCounts(maxVal + 1, 0);
  for (int i = 0, j = 0; i <= maxVal; i++) {
    if (j < primes.size() && primes[j] == i)
      j++;
    primeCounts[i] = j;
  }
  for (auto x : inputs)
    cout << primeCounts[x] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, the time complexity for outputting the counts is reduced from O(n*m) to O(n), where n is the number of input numbers. The trade-off is that we use additional memory to store the `primeCounts` vector. However, this leads to a significant improvement in time efficiency.
