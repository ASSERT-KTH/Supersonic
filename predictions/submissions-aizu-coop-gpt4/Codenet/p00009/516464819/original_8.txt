1. Code Analysis
This program takes a list of numbers as input and for each number, it counts the number of prime numbers less than or equal to that number. 

2. Optimization Strategy
    1. Inefficient data structures: The prime numbers are stored in a list. Since the list is traversed multiple times, it would be more efficient to use a data structure with faster traversal like vector.
    2. Redundant computations: The prime number calculation is done once for the maximum input number. However, the program checks for each input number if it is a prime number or not by traversing the list of prime numbers. This is redundant as we can mark the primes in the initial calculation itself.
    3. Loops: Instead of counting the primes for each input number individually, we can calculate the number of primes less than or equal to a number once and store the results. This will save unnecessary traversals of the prime list.
    4. Compiler optimizations: The use of auto keyword in C++11 can help the compiler to determine the type of variable automatically.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation
    1. Replace list with vector: In the sieve function, we will replace list with vector. Vectors are contiguous in memory and traversing them is faster than traversing a list.
    2. Avoid redundant prime checks: We will remove the check for primes in the main function. Instead, we will track the number of primes less than or equal to a number in the sieve function itself.
    3. Store counts of primes: We will create a vector that stores the number of primes less than or equal to a number. This will avoid multiple traversals of the prime list.
    4. Use auto keyword: We will use auto keyword in for-each loops to let the compiler determine the type of variable.

4. Optimized Code Block
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void sieve(int n, vector<int> &primeCounts) {
  vector<bool> isPrime(n + 1, true);
  primeCounts.resize(n + 1, 0);

  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * 2; j <= n; j += i)
        isPrime[j] = false;
    }
    primeCounts[i] = primeCounts[i-1] + isPrime[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  vector<int> inputs;
  for (int x; cin >> x;)
    inputs.push_back(x);

  int maxInput = *max_element(inputs.begin(), inputs.end());
  vector<int> primeCounts;
  sieve(maxInput, primeCounts);

  for (auto x : inputs)
    cout << primeCounts[x] << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version, the sieve function not only calculates the primes but also counts how many primes are less than or equal to each number. This count is stored in the primeCounts vector. In the main function, we just print the prime count for each input number. This version of the code avoids the redundant prime checks and multiple traversals of the prime list. It also uses a more efficient data structure (vector) for storing the primes. The use of auto keyword makes the code cleaner and more readable.
