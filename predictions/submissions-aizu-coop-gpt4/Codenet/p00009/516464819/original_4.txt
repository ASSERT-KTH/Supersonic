Let's start by analyzing the provided code.

The code is a C++ program that takes a series of integers as input and calculates the number of prime numbers less than or equal to each input number. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate the list of prime numbers up to the maximum input number.

Here are some potential optimization points:

1. The `list<int> primes` can be changed to `vector<int> primes` since we are only adding elements at the end and iterating over it. The contiguous memory layout of a vector can improve cache locality and thus improve performance.

2. Input reading can be optimized. Right now the program reads integers one by one and stores them in a vector. Instead, we can store the maximum value and push the other inputs in a vector to avoid the overhead of calling `max_element` function.

3. The calculation of primes for each input number can be optimized. Currently, the program traverses the entire list of primes for each input number. This can be improved by using binary search, as the list of primes is sorted.

4. The nested loop in the 'sieve' function can be optimized. We can avoid checking even numbers, as they are not prime.

5. The `sqrt(n)` is calculated in every iteration of the outer loop in the 'sieve' function. This can be optimized by calculating it once outside the loop.

#### Optimized Code:

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void sieve(int n, vector<int> &primes) {
  vector<bool> v(n + 1, true);
  int end = sqrt(n);
  for (int i = 3; i <= end; i += 2) {
    if (!v[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i * i, skip = i * 2; j <= n; j += skip)
      v[j] = false;
  }
  primes.push_back(2);
  for (int i = 3; i <= n; i += 2)
    if (v[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
}

int main() {
  vector<int> primes;
  vector<int> inputs;
  int max_val = -1;
  for (int x; cin >> x;) {
    inputs.push_back(x);
    max_val = max(max_val, x);
  }
  sieve(max_val, primes);
  for (auto x : inputs) {
    auto it = upper_bound(primes.begin(), primes.end(), x);
    cout << distance(primes.begin(), it) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the input is read and the maximum value is kept track of simultaneously, removing the need for the `max_element` function. The `list<int> primes` has been changed to `vector<int> primes` for better cache locality and performance. The prime counting for each input number is done using binary search (`upper_bound`) instead of linear search, improving the time complexity. The `sqrt(n)` in the sieve function is calculated only once instead of in each iteration. Finally, the prime generation has been optimized to skip even numbers.
