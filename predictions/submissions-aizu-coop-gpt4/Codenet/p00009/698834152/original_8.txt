Code Analysis:
The given code is a C++ program that calculates the number of prime numbers less than or equal to a given number 'n'. The algorithm used is the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which is one of the most efficient ways to find all primes smaller than n. However, the implementation can be optimized for better performance.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The data structures used are arrays of size MAX. Arrays are efficient data structures for this purpose, but the allocation of such a large size (999999) can be optimized.

2. Redundant Computations: The code checks if each number is prime by iterating from 2 to MAX. However, we only need to iterate till the square root of MAX, because a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.

3. Loops: The inner loop can be optimized by starting from 'i*i' instead of '2*i'. The numbers less than 'i*i' would have already been marked in previous iterations.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The use of compiler optimization flags like -O2 or -O3 during the compilation process can help in automatic optimization of the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Reduce the size of arrays: We can reduce the size of the arrays to the maximum number that we need to check for prime, rather than allocating them to the maximum size from the beginning. This can save memory usage.

2. Iterate to the square root of MAX: We can optimize the outer loop by iterating only till the square root of MAX. This is because a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.

3. Optimizing the inner loop: We can optimize the inner loop by starting from 'i*i' instead of '2*i'. The numbers less than 'i*i' would have already been marked in previous iterations.

4. Use Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler flags like -O2 or -O3 to perform automatic optimizations during the compilation process.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#define MAX 999999

using namespace std;

int num_prime[MAX + 1];
bool not_prime_flag[MAX + 1];

int main() {
  int n;
  int limit = sqrt(MAX); // Only iterate till the square root of MAX
  for (int i = 2; i <= limit; ++i) {
    if (!not_prime_flag[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= MAX; j += i) { // Start loop from 'i*i'
        not_prime_flag[j] = true;
      }
    }
    num_prime[i] = num_prime[i - 1] + !not_prime_flag[i];
  }
  // Compute the remaining primes
  for (int i = limit + 1; i <= MAX; ++i) {
    num_prime[i] = num_prime[i - 1] + !not_prime_flag[i];
  }
  
  while (cin >> n) {
    cout << num_prime[n] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, the outer loop iterates only till the square root of MAX, and the inner loop starts from 'i*i'. The numbers less than 'i*i' would have already been marked in previous iterations. This reduces the number of iterations and hence improves the performance of the program.
