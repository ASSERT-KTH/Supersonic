The given code is a program that generates prime numbers up to a maximum limit (MAX) and counts the number of prime numbers up to a given number (n). The performance can be improved by optimizing the prime number generation algorithm and reducing memory usage. 

1. Code Analysis:
    - The prime number generation algorithm is a variant of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, but it is inefficient because it checks multiples of all numbers, not just primes.
    - The arrays `num_prime` and `not_prime_flag` are unnecessarily large, wasting memory. 

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - A. Optimize the prime number generation algorithm.
    - B. Reduce memory usage by using a more efficient data structure.
    - C. Take advantage of compiler optimizations.
    
3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    - A. The prime number generation algorithm can be optimized by only checking multiples of found primes. This is because any number that is not prime is a multiple of some prime number. By skipping non-primes when checking multiples, we can eliminate a significant amount of unnecessary computation. For example, when `i = 4`, we don't need to check its multiples because they are already marked by `i = 2`.
    - B. We can use a bitset instead of a boolean array for `not_prime_flag`, which will significantly reduce memory usage. A bitset uses 1 bit per boolean value, while a boolean array uses at least 1 byte (8 bits) per value. This is a 8x reduction in memory usage.
    - C. Compiler optimizations can be used to further improve performance. For example, the `-O3` flag can be used with the GCC compiler to enable all optimization levels.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#define MAX 999999
using namespace std;

int num_prime[MAX + 1];
bitset<MAX + 1> not_prime_flag;

int main() {
  int n;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= MAX; ++i) {  // only need to check up to sqrt(MAX)
    if (!not_prime_flag[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= MAX; j += i) {  // start from i^2 and increment by i
        not_prime_flag[j] = true;
      }
    }
    num_prime[i] = num_prime[i - 1] + !not_prime_flag[i];
  }
  while (cin >> n) {
    cout << num_prime[n] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs: 

The use of a bitset for `not_prime_flag` reduces memory usage significantly, but it might make the code slightly harder to understand for someone unfamiliar with bitsets. However, the performance gain and memory reduction are significant enough to justify this trade-off.

The optimization of the prime number generation algorithm makes the code more complex and harder to understand for a novice programmer. However, it significantly improves the performance of the program, especially for large inputs, so this trade-off is worth it.
