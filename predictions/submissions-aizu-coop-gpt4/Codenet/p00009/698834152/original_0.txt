Code Analysis:
The provided code is implementing the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which is used to find all prime numbers up to a given limit (in this case, `MAX`). The code correctly implements the algorithm, but there are some points where performance improvements could be made.

1. The outer loop in the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm iterates from 2 to `MAX`. This is inefficient as it is not necessary to check numbers beyond sqrt(`MAX`), because a larger factor of n must be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked.

2. The inner loop is checking all multiples of i by iterating from 2 to `MAX/i`. However, we only need to start this loop from i itself, because all smaller multiples would have already been marked in previous steps.

3. The array `num_prime` is keeping track of the number of primes up to i. This is done in every step of the outer loop. However, this operation can be moved to a separate function, and only called when needed.

4. Although the use of `bool` array for `not_prime_flag` is more space-efficient than using an `int` array, it is not the most cache-friendly data structure. It could be improved.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Change the upper limit of the outer loop from `MAX` to sqrt(`MAX`), and the inner loop to start from i.

2. Move the operation of updating `num_prime` to a separate function, and call it only when needed.

3. Consider using a bitset instead of a `bool` array for `not_prime_flag`. A bitset uses only one bit per boolean value (as opposed to a `bool` which uses 8 bits), which can significantly reduce memory usage for large arrays.

4. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. This can speed up `iostream` operations.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#include <cmath>
#define MAX 999999
using namespace std;
int num_prime[MAX + 1];
bitset<MAX + 1> not_prime_flag;

void calculateNumPrimes(int n) {
  num_prime[n] = num_prime[n - 1] + !not_prime_flag[n];
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int limit = sqrt(MAX + 1);
  for (int i = 2; i <= limit; ++i) {
    if (!not_prime_flag[i]) {
      for (int j = i; i * j < MAX + 1; ++j) {
        not_prime_flag[i * j] = true;
      }
    }
  }
  for (int i = limit+1; i < MAX + 1; i++) {
    calculateNumPrimes(i);
  }
  int n;
  while (cin >> n) {
    calculateNumPrimes(n);
    cout << num_prime[n] << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have reduced the loop limit, moved the `num_prime` calculation to a separate function and switched from a `bool` array to a `bitset` for `not_prime_flag`. This should result in a noticeable improvement in both speed and memory usage.
