This program implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers, then it calculates the prefix sum array of the primes. Finally, it reads input numbers and for each number, it prints the number of primes less than or equal to that number.

The optimization strategy for this code will include:

1. **Avoiding redundant computations:** The value of `sqrt(1000000)` is computed in each iteration, which is not necessary as it remains the same throughout the execution. This value can be computed once and stored in a variable for use in the loop condition.
2. **Optimizing memory usage:** The array `num` is of size 1,000,000 which takes up a significant amount of memory. It is initialized with all elements being 1, and then the non-prime numbers are set to 0. Instead, we could use a `std::bitset` which uses 1 bit per boolean value. This would reduce the memory usage from approximately 4MB (if `int` is 4 bytes) to 125KB.
3. **Improving I/O operations:** The use of `scanf` and `printf` functions for input/output operations can be slow compared to `cin` and `cout` in C++. By using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` we can speed up the I/O operations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

const int N = 1e6;
bitset<N> is_prime;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);
  is_prime.set();  // set all bits to 1
  is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = 0;
  int sqrt_N = sqrt(N);
  for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt_N; i++) {
    if (is_prime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j < N; j += i)
        is_prime[j] = 0;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    is_prime[i] += is_prime[i-1];
  }
  int n;
  while (cin >> n) {
    cout << is_prime[n] << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- The computation of `sqrt(1000000)` is done only once and stored in `sqrt_N`.
- The array `num` is replaced by `bitset<N> is_prime` which uses less memory (1 bit per boolean value).
- The I/O operations are improved by using `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`. Furthermore, `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` is used to speed up the I/O operations.
- The code readability is improved by defining the constant `N = 1e6` to avoid hardcoding the number 1000000 several times in the code.
