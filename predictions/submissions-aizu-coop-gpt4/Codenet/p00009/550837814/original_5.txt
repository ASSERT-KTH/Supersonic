Code Analysis:
This program is designed to calculate the number of prime numbers less than or equal to a given number `n`. The main steps of this program include initializing the array, using the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find primes, and accumulating prime counts. The program reads from the standard input until EOF is reached.

Optimization Strategy:
1. **Inefficient Data Structures**: The array `num` is declared as an integer array with 1 million elements. Each integer consumes 4 bytes, so the total memory consumption is about 4MB. Since the array `num` is used to store binary data (0 or 1), it can be replaced with a boolean array which consumes 1 byte per element, reducing memory usage to 1MB.
2. **Redundant Computations**: The square root computation in the loop `for (i = 2; i < sqrt(1000000); i++)` is redundant. The square root of 1 million is calculated in each iteration. To optimize, we can compute the square root once and store the result in a variable.
3. **Loop Optimization**: The loop `for (i = 1; i < 1000000 - 1; i++)` is used to accumulate prime counts. This loop can be merged with the loop used for the Sieve of Eratosthenes to reduce the number of iterations.
4. **Compiler Optimizations**: Compiler optimizations such as `-O2` or `-O3` can be used to allow the compiler to further optimize the code. However, this is outside the scope of the code itself.

Optimized Code Block:
```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h> // Include boolean data type

int main() {
  int i, j, n;
  bool num[1000000]; // Replace integer array with boolean array
  int primeCount[1000000]; // Store prime counts
  int sqrtLimit = sqrt(1000000); // Calculate square root once

  // Initialize both arrays
  for (i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
    num[i] = true;
    primeCount[i] = i > 1 ? 1 : 0;
  }

  // Sieve of Eratosthenes and accumulate prime counts
  for (i = 2; i < sqrtLimit; i++) {
    if (num[i]) {
      for (j = i * i; j < 1000000; j += i)
        num[j] = false;
      primeCount[i] = primeCount[i - 1] + 1;
    }
    else {
      primeCount[i] = primeCount[i - 1];
    }
  }

  // For numbers greater than sqrtLimit, only accumulate prime counts
  for (i = sqrtLimit; i < 1000000; i++) {
    primeCount[i] = primeCount[i - 1] + (num[i] ? 1 : 0);
  }

  while (scanf("%d", &n) != EOF) {
    printf("%d\n", primeCount[n]);
  }

  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code maintains the functionality of the original code while reducing memory usage and the number of computations. The trade-off here is a slight increase in code complexity due to the addition of another array and an extra condition in the Sieve of Eratosthenes loop. However, the benefits of improved memory usage and performance outweigh this increase in complexity.
