The given code is a simple implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given limit, and then calculate the cumulative sum of prime numbers up to each index, which is used to print the total number of primes up to a given number.

Let's start with the performance analysis and optimization strategy:

1. **Code Analysis**: The code makes use of an array of size 1,000,000. However, it does not efficiently utilize memory as it reserves space that may not be used for smaller inputs.

2. **Optimization Strategy**:
    1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: To reduce memory usage, dynamic memory allocation can be used, which allocates memory at runtime instead of compile-time. This allows memory to be allocated based on the maximum number the user inputs.
    2. **Avoiding sqrt computation in each iteration**: The code computes the square root of 1,000,000 in each iteration of the second for loop. This is an unnecessary computation and can be avoided by calculating it only once before the loop.
    3. **Optimize Input Reading**: Instead of using scanf and printf in a loop, use faster methods of input and output like `getchar_unlocked` and `putchar_unlocked`.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**:

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: This step is to ensure that memory is not wasted. By using dynamic memory allocation, memory is allocated only when needed and can be freed once it is not required. 

2. **Avoiding sqrt computation in each iteration**: The code computes the square root in each iteration, which can be costly. By computing the square root only once and storing the result, this redundant computation is avoided, leading to a speedup in the program.

3. **Optimize Input Reading**: The C standard library functions `scanf` and `printf` are quite slow. By using faster functions like `getchar_unlocked` and `putchar_unlocked`, the speed of the program can be improved significantly.

**Trade-offs**:

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: This can make the code slightly more complex, and if not handled properly, can cause memory leaks. 

2. **Avoiding sqrt computation in each iteration**: This increases the space complexity slightly because an extra variable is used to store the square root value.

3. **Optimize Input Reading**: The functions `getchar_unlocked` and `putchar_unlocked` are non-standard and may not be portable. However, they are much faster than `scanf` and `printf` and can greatly improve the performance of the program.

**Optimized Code Block**:
```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int i, j, n, max = 0;
  int num[max], limit;
  
  while(scanf("%d", &n) != EOF) {
    if(n > max) max = n;
  }
  
  num = (int*)malloc(max * sizeof(int));

  for (i = 0; i < max; i++) {
    num[i] = 1;
  }
  num[0] = num[1] = 0;

  limit = sqrt(max);
  for (i = 2; i <= limit; i++) {
    if (num[i] == 1) {
      for (j = i * i; j < max; j += i)
        num[j] = 0;
    }
  }
  for (i = 1; i < max; i++) {
    num[i + 1] += num[i];
  }

  printf("%d\n", num[n]);
  
  free(num);
  
  return 0;
}
```
Note: This code assumes that the input will be given in a certain way, i.e., all inputs together, followed by all outputs. If the inputs and outputs are interleaved, then the original code cannot be optimized as presented, since we need to know the maximum input before we can compute the primes.
