The provided code is a C++ implementation of a graph-theoretic problem. It seems to implement a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore the graph and solve a problem statement. However, without a clear problem statement, it's not possible to fully understand the context of the optimization. But we can still provide some general optimization strategies that improve the execution time and memory usage of the program.

Optimization Strategy:

1. **Avoid unnecessary memory allocations**: The `vector<vector<int>>` data structures (`field`, `vertex`, `edge`) are being re-allocated in every iteration of the main loop, which is inefficient and can lead to heap fragmentation. Instead, it's possible to allocate these data structures once and reuse them.

2. **Improve DFS algorithm**: The current DFS algorithm repeatedly checks and manipulates the `visited` bitset, which can be inefficient. Also, the algorithm uses recursion, which is not efficient in terms of memory usage. An iterative DFS with an explicit stack can be faster and more memory-efficient.

3. **Use faster data structures**: The `std::set` data structure is used for `memo`, which has a logarithmic time complexity for insertions and lookups. A faster data structure, such as `std::unordered_set` (which has average constant-time complexity for insertions and lookups), could be used instead.

4. **Avoid unnecessary calculations**: The `cut_vertex` function seems to be performing some unnecessary calculations and checks. It's possible that with a better understanding of the problem, these could be reduced or eliminated.

5. **Compiler optimizations**: Enable compiler optimizations by using the `-O2` or `-O3` compiler flag. These flags instruct the compiler to perform optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and others, which can significantly improve the performance of the code.

Here is the optimized code block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int N = 49;
int w, h;
vector<vector<int>> field(N, vector<int>(N));
int size;
vector<vector<int>> vertex(N, vector<int>(N));
vector<vector<int>> edge(N * N);
bitset<N> visited;
unordered_set<unsigned long long> memo;

// ... other functions are the same

bool solve() {
  visited.reset();
  make_graph();
  memo.clear();
  for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y)
    for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x)
      if (!field[y][x])
        return dfs(vertex[y][x], vertex[y][x]);
  return false;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // speed up cin/cout
  cin.tie(NULL);
  while (cin >> w >> h, w | h) {
    for (auto &line : field)
      for (auto &v : line)
        cin >> v;
    cout << (solve() ? "Yes" : "No") << '\n';
  }
}
```

This code should be compiled with `-O2` or `-O3` flag for best performance. Note that these changes are minimal and do not affect the functionality of the original program. The changes simply reduce the number of memory allocations, use a faster data structure for memoization, and speed up cin/cout operations.
