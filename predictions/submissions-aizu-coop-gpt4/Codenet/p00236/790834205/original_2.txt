The given code is a graph traversal program that checks for the existence of a Hamiltonian circuit in a graph. Here are a few areas where the code can be optimized:

1. **Inefficient Data Structures**: The use of `std::set` for memoization in the dfs function can be inefficient due to its logarithmic time complexity for insertions and lookups. Changing this to an unordered_set can bring these operations down to constant time, on average.

2. **Redundant Computations**: The `cut_vertex` and `dfs` functions are repeatedly calculating the count of set bits in the `visited` bitset. This can be optimized by keeping a count of visited vertices that is updated each time a vertex is visited or unvisited.

3. **Inefficiency in DFS**: In the DFS function, there's a loop that checks all vertices for their degree. This can be avoided by using an adjacency list representation with a degree array, allowing for constant-time degree checks.

4. **Repeated Recalculations in DFS**: The DFS function is called recursively without memoization, leading to repeated calculations. This can be optimized by using a memoization technique to store and reuse previous results.

Based on these observations, here's an optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int N = 49;
int w, h;
vector<vector<int>> field;
int size;
vector<vector<int>> vertex;
vector<vector<int>> edge;
bitset<N> visited;
unordered_set<unsigned long long> memo;
vector<int> degree;
int visitedCount; // Track the count of visited vertices

void make_graph() {
  // Same as before...
}

void reachability(const int &from, bitset<N> &visited) {
  // Same as before...
}

bool cut_vertex(const int &from) {
  // Replace dup.count() != size with visitedCount != size
  // Same as before...
}

bool dfs(const int &start, int from) {
  unsigned long long m = visited.to_ullong() * N + from;
  if (memo.count(m))
    return false;
  memo.insert(m);
  if (cut_vertex(from))
    return false;
  for (int u = 0; u < size; ++u) {
    if (u == from || visited[u])
      continue;
    if (degree[u] < 2)
      return false;
  }
  visited.set(from);
  ++visitedCount;
  for (const auto &to : edge[from]) {
    if (to == start && visitedCount == size)
      return true;
    if (visited[to])
      continue;
    if (dfs(start, to))
      return true;
  }
  visited.reset(from);
  --visitedCount;
  return false;
}

bool solve() {
  visited = bitset<N>(0);
  make_graph();
  memo.clear();
  visitedCount = 0;
  degree = vector<int>(size, 0);
  for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y)
    for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x)
      if (!field[y][x]) {
        for (const auto &v : edge[vertex[y][x]])
          ++degree[v];
        return dfs(vertex[y][x], vertex[y][x]);
      }
  return false;
}

int main() {
  // Same as before...
}
```

This optimized version of the code introduces several improvements. It uses `unordered_set` for memoization to speed up insertions and lookups. It maintains a count of visited vertices to avoid repeatedly calculating the bit count of the `visited` bitset. It also maintains a degree array to make degree checks in the DFS function faster. Finally, it uses memoization in the DFS function to avoid repeated calculations.
