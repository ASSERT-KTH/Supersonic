This is a complex piece of code that performs graph operations. It first builds a graph from a given input, then checks for certain properties of the graph (if it contains a cut vertex, among other things), and finally, performs a depth-first search (DFS) to check if the graph has a Hamiltonian cycle. One of the key performance issues here is the heavy use of recursion and the lack of memoization in some functions.

Here is an optimization plan for this code:

1. **Avoiding unnecessary memory allocation:** Every time the `make_graph()` function is called, it re-initializes the `vertex` and `edge` vectors. If the size of these vectors does not change between calls, this is unnecessary and can be avoided.

2. **Optimizing recursion in `reachability()` and `dfs()`:** These functions use recursion, which can be expensive in terms of memory and performance. We can try to convert these recursive functions to iterative functions using a stack to potentially improve performance.

3. **Avoiding redundant computation in `cut_vertex()`:** The `dup.count()` is called in each iteration of the loop, which is unnecessary. We can call it once after the loop ends.

Here's how the optimized code might look:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

const int N = 49;
int w, h;
vector<vector<int>> field, vertex, edge;
bitset<N> visited;
set<unsigned long long> memo;

void make_graph() {
  enum { Y, X };
  const int NEXT[4][2] = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, -1}};
  const int NIL = -1;

  // Clear the existing graph if any
  for (auto &row : vertex)
    fill(row.begin(), row.end(), NIL);
  for (auto &e : edge)
    e.clear();

  int size = 0;
  for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y)
    for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x)
      if (!field[y][x])
        vertex[y][x] = size++;

  for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y)
    for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x) {
      if (vertex[y][x] == NIL)
        continue;
      for (const auto &d : NEXT) {
        int ny = y + d[Y];
        int nx = x + d[X];
        if (ny < 0 || h <= ny || nx < 0 || w <= nx)
          continue;
        if (vertex[ny][nx] == NIL)
          continue;
        edge[vertex[y][x]].push_back(vertex[ny][nx]);
      }
    }
}

void reachability(int from) {
  stack<int> stk;
  stk.push(from);

  while (!stk.empty()) {
    int curr = stk.top();
    stk.pop();

    if (visited[curr]) continue;
    visited.set(curr);

    for (const auto &to : edge[curr])
      if (!visited[to])
        stk.push(to);
  }
}

bool cut_vertex(int from) {
  auto dup = visited;
  dup.set(from);

  for (const auto &to : edge[from]) {
    if (dup[to])
      continue;
    reachability(to);
  }
  return dup.count() != vertex[h-1][w-1] + 1;
}

bool dfs(int start, int from) {
  // Rest of the code remains the same
}

bool solve() {
  visited = bitset<N>(0);
  make_graph();
  memo.clear();

  for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y)
    for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x)
      if (!field[y][x])
        return dfs(vertex[y][x], vertex[y][x]);
  return false;
}

// Rest of the code remains the same
```

As you can see, the `make_graph()` function now reuses the `vertex` and `edge` vectors instead of recreating them. In addition, the `reachability()` function is now iterative. We are also avoiding redundant calls to `dup.count()` in `cut_vertex()`. These changes should improve the performance of the code, especially for large inputs.
