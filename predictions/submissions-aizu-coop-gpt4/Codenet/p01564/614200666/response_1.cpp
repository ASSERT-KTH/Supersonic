The provided code is a complex C++ implementation that uses a type of binary search tree called a Link/Cut tree for network flow analysis. It's hard to optimize such code without a deep understanding of the data structures and algorithms involved, but there are some general practices that might help improve the performance of the code and reduce memory usage.

1. **Code Analysis:**
    1. The code uses a lot of dynamic memory allocation operations (new and delete). These operations are costly in terms of processing time.
    2. The code has many function calls, which lead to overhead due to context switching.
    3. The use of recursive calls in the code can lead to higher memory usage and potential stack overflow issues.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**
    1. **Optimizing memory allocation:** Use a custom memory allocator to speed up dynamic memory allocation operations.
    2. **Reducing function call overhead:** Use inline functions to eliminate the overhead of function calls. Inline functions are a useful optimization feature, where the compiler replaces the function call with the actual code of the function.
    3. **Eliminating recursion:** Convert recursive functions to iterative ones. This can help reduce memory usage and prevent stack overflow. The downside is that it might make the code harder to read and understand.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
    1. **Optimizing memory allocation:** Custom memory allocators can be designed to be faster than the standard new and delete operators by reducing fragmentation, reusing previously allocated blocks, and performing allocations in bulk. However, creating a custom memory allocator requires a deep understanding of memory management, and it can introduce additional complexity into the code.
    2. **Reducing function call overhead:** To inline a function, simply prefix the function definition with the inline keyword. The compiler then replaces all function calls with the function code. This eliminates the overhead of function calls, but it can also increase the size of the binary if the function is large or called many times. Therefore, it's best used for small, frequently called functions.
    3. **Eliminating recursion:** This involves replacing the recursive structure with a loop and a stack or queue data structure. This can reduce memory usage and prevent stack overflow, but it can also make the code more difficult to read and understand.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**
