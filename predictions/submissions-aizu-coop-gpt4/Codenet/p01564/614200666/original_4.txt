This code appears to be implementing a Splay Tree data structure, along with various operations to manipulate it. Here are my observations and recommendations for optimization:

1) **Code Analysis:**

   - The code is using a lot of function calls, which in C++, can be expensive.
   - The code uses dynamic memory allocation for each node in the tree, which can be slow.
   - Some variables are being repeatedly calculated.
   - The code contains a lot of if-else checks in the functions which can slow down the execution.

2) **Optimization Strategy:**

   - Minimize function calls: Replace functions with inline functions where possible. This can reduce the overhead of function calls.
   - Optimize dynamic memory allocation: Consider using a memory pool to allocate nodes for the tree. This can significantly speed up the memory allocation.
   - Reuse computed variables: Store the result of complex computations in variables and reuse them instead of calculating them again.
   - Reduce if-else checks: Simplify the code to minimize the number of if-else checks. This can speed up the execution.

3) **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

   - **Inline functions:** Replace small and frequently used functions with inline functions. By inlining a function, the compiler inserts the complete body of the function in every context where that function is used. But remember, too much inlining can lead to code bloat which can slow down the execution.
   - **Memory Pool:** Instead of dynamically allocating each node individually, allocate a large block of memory at once, and then manually distribute it to each node. When a node is deleted, you can quickly recycle its memory. This can significantly speed up the memory allocation and deallocation.
   - **Reuse Computed Variables:** If a variable is being calculated multiple times, consider storing the result in a variable and reusing it. This is especially helpful if the calculation is complex and requires a lot of CPU cycles.
   - **Reduce If-Else Checks:** If-else checks can slow down the execution of the program. Look for opportunities to simplify the code and reduce the number of if-else checks.

Since you have not provided a specific code block to optimize, I'm unable to provide specific optimizations and the optimized code block. However, my suggestions should provide a good starting point for optimizing your code.
