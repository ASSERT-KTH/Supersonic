This code seems to be implementing a Link-Cut Tree data structure, which is a type of self-adjusting binary search tree used for network flow analysis. It seems to be quite optimized already, but there's still room for improvement.

1. **Code Analysis**
This code is already well-optimized, as it uses efficient data structures (like trees) and algorithms (like splay tree operations). However, there are a few areas that could be made more efficient:

    - Redundant computations in the `update()` function.
    - Memory inefficient usage of `struct LCNode`.
    - Usage of `scanf()` and `printf()` for input and output which are slower compared to `cin` and `cout` with `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`.

2. **Optimization Strategy**

   - In `update()` function, the same values are computed multiple times. We can optimize this by storing the intermediate results in temporary variables.
   - In `struct LCNode`, all member variables are initialized in the constructor. Using a constructor initializer list can speed up the construction of `LCNode` instances.
   - Replacing `scanf()` and `printf()` with `cin` and `cout` combined with `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` will give a significant speedup in I/O operations.

Let's implement these optimizations:

3. **Step-by-step Explanation**

   - In `update()`, we're computing `l->sz + r->sz + 1`, `l->sm + v + r->sm` and `r->sm + v + l->rsm` multiple times. We can calculate these once and store them in temporary variables to avoid redundant computations.
   - In `struct LCNode`, using a constructor initializer list can speed up the construction of `LCNode` instances. This is because with an initializer list, the member variables are initialized immediately rather than being default-initialized and then assigned a value.
   - Replace `scanf()` and `printf()` with `cin` and `cout` combined with `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`. This will disable the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams which can give a significant speedup in I/O operations.
