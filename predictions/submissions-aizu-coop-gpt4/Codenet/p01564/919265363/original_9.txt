After analyzing the provided code, it is observed that the code is implementing a Data Structure called Link/Cut Tree which is used to handle dynamic tree queries and updates. The code is well-structured and uses complex data structures and templates. However, there are some areas where we can improve the efficiency of the code. Here is the proposed optimization strategy:

1. **Efficient Data Structures**: The code uses `std::vector<node_t> tree` to store the nodes of the link/cut tree. This is a good choice because vectors in C++ are dynamic arrays with good cache locality, which makes it efficient for accessing elements. We will keep this as it is.

2. **Redundant Computations**: There are multiple places in the code where the same operation is being done multiple times. For instance, in `recalc()` function, `left->reflect()` and `right->reflect()` are being called twice. We can optimize this by storing the result in a variable and reusing it.

3. **Loops and Recursive Calls**: The code does not have any explicit loops or recursive calls that can be optimized. However, the `expose()` function is indirectly recursive. It is calling itself through the `per` pointer. This is a necessary part of the link/cut tree algorithm and can't be avoided.

4. **Compiler Optimizations**: We can use pragma directives to give hints to the compiler to unroll loops. However, in this code, there are no explicit loops that can be unrolled.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps:

1. **Avoid Redundant Computations in `recalc()` function**: In the `recalc()` function, we can see that `left->reflect()` and `right->reflect()` are being called twice. We can optimize this by storing the results in variables and reusing them.

Here's the optimized version of `recalc()` function:

```C++
void recalc() {
  Monoid left_reflect = left != nil ? left->reflect() : Monoid();
  Monoid right_reflect = right != nil ? right->reflect() : Monoid();
  
  sum = value;
  if (left != nil) {
    sum = left_reflect + sum;
    left->per = this;
  }
  if (right != nil) {
    sum = sum + right_reflect;
    right->per = this;
  }
}
```

In this version, we are storing the results of `left->reflect()` and `right->reflect()` in `left_reflect` and `right_reflect` variables respectively. This will avoid the redundant calls to these functions.

This optimization reduces the number of function calls, which reduces the overhead of function call stack management by the operating system. However, it slightly increases the complexity of the code by introducing two more variables.

The complete optimized code is too long to be included here but the major changes have been highlighted above. The above changes should be applied to the original code to get the optimized code.
