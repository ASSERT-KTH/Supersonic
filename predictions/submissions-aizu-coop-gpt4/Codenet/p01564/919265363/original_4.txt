The given code is a link-cut tree data structure used for dynamic trees, which supports operations like adding an edge, deleting an edge, and finding the maximum sum of a path in the tree. This is a very complex data structure and the optimization of this code requires a deep understanding of the data structure's internals.

The code is already well-optimized as it uses splay trees, which are self-adjusting binary search trees. They bring the element accessed most recently to root using rotations, thereby providing amortized constant time access. 

However, there are a few things that can be improved:

1. **Avoid unnecessary function calls**: Some function calls may be avoided to improve performance. For example, in the `scan` method, it is not necessary to call `std::vector<vis>(tree.size())` every time because the size of the tree never changes. We can initialize the vector once in the constructor and reuse it.

2. **Avoid excessive memory usage**: The `scan` method seems to be debugging code that's no longer used (it is just returning at start). If not needed, we can remove the entire `scan` method and also remove the `std::vector<vis> v;` declaration, which would save both memory and CPU cycles.

3. **Avoid unnecessary `std::swap` calls**: In the `push` method, the `std::swap` operation is costly. We can optimize this by using a bool flag to indicate whether the left and right children are swapped.

4. **Use `std::move` for large objects**: In the `link_cut_tree(std::vector<Monoid> &a)` constructor, we can replace `tree(a.size())` with `tree(std::move(a))`. This will avoid copying large vectors and instead move them, which is faster.

Here's how the optimized code would look like:

```cpp
template <typename Monoid, typename Operand>
class link_cut_tree {
  // ...
public:
  link_cut_tree(uint32 size) : tree(size) {
    v.resize(size);
  }
  link_cut_tree(std::vector<Monoid> &&a) : tree(std::move(a)) {
    for (uint32 i = 0; i < a.size(); ++i) {
      tree[i].value = tree[i].sum = a[i];
    }
    v.resize(a.size());
  }
  // ...
  void push() {
    if (b & 2) {
      if (left != right) {
        node_t *temp = left;
        left = right;
        right = temp;
      }
      left->b ^= 2;
      right->b ^= 2;
      value = ~value;
    }
    if (b & 1) {
      value = value * lazy;
      left->assign(lazy);
      right->assign(lazy);
    }
    b &= ~3;
  }
  // ...
  // remove the scan method
};
```

Please note that the code optimization depends largely on the specific usage scenario. You may need to run benchmarks to determine if these optimizations actually improve performance for your application.
