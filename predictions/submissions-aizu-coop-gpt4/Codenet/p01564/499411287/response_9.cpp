Firstly, let's identify potential performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usage in the given code.

1. The use of the `new` operator to dynamically allocate memory for the `Tree` nodes is inefficient and could lead to memory leaks if not properly managed. A custom memory pool or an object pool can be used to efficiently manage the memory for `Tree` nodes.
2. The `getint` and `putint` functions could be optimized by using faster IO routines such as `scanf` and `printf`.
3. The `push` function in the `Tree` structure might be called unnecessarily even when there are no lazy updates pending. 
4. The use of recursive calls in methods such as `set` and `get` in `Tree` structure can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the dynamic memory allocation of `Tree` nodes with a custom memory pool.
2. Replace `getint` and `putint` functions with faster IO routines.
3. Add a condition to check if there are any lazy updates pending before calling the `push` function.
4. Optimize recursive calls in `set` and `get` methods using tail recursion or iterative methods.
5. Use compiler optimizations such as `-O2` or `-O3` for further optimization.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Dynamic Memory Allocation: The use of the `new` operator to allocate memory for `Tree` nodes can cause performance issues and memory leaks. Instead, we can use a custom memory pool to efficiently manage the memory. This can dramatically improve the performance and memory usage of the program.

2. Faster IO Routines: The `getint` and `putint` functions can be replaced with `scanf` and `printf` functions which are faster and more efficient.

3. Lazy Propagation: In the `push` function, we can add a condition to check if there are any lazy updates pending. This can prevent unnecessary function calls and improve the performance.

4. Recursive Calls: The recursive calls in `set` and `get` methods can be optimized using tail recursion or iterative methods. This can reduce the stack usage and improve the performance of the program.

5. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to instruct the compiler to optimize the code for performance.
