Given the size and complexity of the provided code, it's not feasible to optimize the entire thing within a single response. However, here are a few general areas that could potentially be optimized:

1. **Avoiding unnecessary computations:** Some calculations are repeated multiple times, such as `cross(a, b)` in the `ccw` function. To optimize, you could store the result of such computations in a variable and reuse it whenever necessary.

2. **Reducing the use of heavy STL functions:** The functions `sort()`, `push_back()`, `pop_back()`, and `reverse()` are used many times in the code. These functions are heavy and can slow down the program, especially when used in loops. You should revisit these parts of your code and see if there's a way to achieve the same result with less expensive operations.

3. **Efficient use of data types:** The code uses `double` for most numerical variables. This is often necessary for accuracy, but it also consumes more memory than integer types. It might be useful to review the code and see if some variables can be changed to integer types without losing precision.

4. **Compiler optimizations:** You can use compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to allow the compiler to automatically optimize the generated machine code.

5. **Inlining small functions:** Small functions like `norm()`, `abs()`, `dot()`, `cross()`, `isOrthogonal()`, `isParallel()`, etc., which are called multiple times, can be declared inline to reduce the overhead of function calls.

6. **Avoiding unnecessary data structure:** There are multiple instances in the code where temporary data structures like `Polygon`, `pair<Point, Point>`, `vector<Line>`, etc., are created just to return multiple values. Replacing these with pass by reference or pointer could help save space and time.

Please note that not all of these suggestions may be applicable. Each potential optimization should be considered carefully for its trade-offs, as some might increase the complexity of the code or reduce its readability. Also, remember that it's important to measure the performance of your code before and after each optimization to ensure that it's making a positive difference. 

To illustrate the application of these points, here's an example of how you might optimize the `ccw` function by avoiding repeated computations:

```cpp
int ccw(Point p0, Point p1, Point p2) {
  Vector a = p1 - p0;
  Vector b = p2 - p0;
  double cross_ab = cross(a, b);
  double dot_ab = dot(a, b);
  double a_norm = a.norm();

  if (cross_ab > EPS)
    return COUNTER_CLOCKWISE;
  if (cross_ab < -EPS)
    return CLOCKWISE;
  if (dot_ab < -EPS)
    return ONLINE_BACK;
  if (a_norm < b.norm())
    return ONLINE_FRONT;
  return ON_SEGMENT;
}
```

In this optimized version of the function, the results of `cross(a, b)`, `dot(a, b)`, and `a.norm()` are stored in variables and reused, instead of being computed multiple times.
