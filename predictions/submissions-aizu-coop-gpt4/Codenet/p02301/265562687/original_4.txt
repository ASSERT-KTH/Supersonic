The given C++ program calculates the diameter of the polygon. It reads the number of points and their coordinates from the input, builds the polygon, calculates its convex hull and the diameter of the convex hull.

The program is already optimized with the use of built-in functions and has a well-organized structure. However, there are still a few places where the efficiency can be improved.

1. Code Analysis

The major performance bottlenecks are:

- Use of `std::vector` for representing the polygon. This could be inefficient as vector resizing and reallocation may occur.
- Repetitive calculations, specifically in the `diameter` function where the `cross` function is called twice for the same parameters.
- Recalculating the same values, notably in the `diameter` function where `p[(i + 1) % n]`, `p[(j + 1) % n]` and `abs(p[i] - p[j])` are calculated multiple times.

2. Optimization Strategy

A. Use more efficient data structures: 

- Consider using static arrays if the maximum size is known and array resizing is not required. This could prevent unnecessary dynamic memory allocations.

B. Remove repetitive calculations:

- Store the result of frequently used calculations in a variable and reuse it.

C. Use inline functions:

- Make small functions `inline` to avoid the overhead of function calls. 

3. Step-by-Step Explanation

A. Using efficient data structures:

- If the maximum number of points is known, replace `Polygon` (which is a `std::vector`) with a static array. This can avoid dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

B. Removing repetitive calculations:

- In the `diameter` function, calculate the values of `p[(i + 1) % n]`, `p[(j + 1) % n]` and `abs(p[i] - p[j])` once and store them in variables for reuse.

C. Using inline functions:

- Make simple functions like `norm`, `abs`, `dot`, `cross`, `isOrthogonal`, etc. `inline` if they aren't already. This allows the compiler to replace these function calls with the function's code to avoid the overhead of the function call.

Please note that these optimizations are minimal and the impact on performance may not be noticeable for small inputs. However, for larger inputs or when the program is part of a larger system, these optimizations could become significant.

Let's rewrite the code with the proposed optimizations. As a result, the code becomes slightly more complex, but it's a necessary trade-off for the performance gain. The functionality and output of the original code are preserved.

```cpp
// ... Other parts of the code ...

inline double norm(Vector a) { return a.x * a.x + a.y * a.y; }
inline double abs(Vector a) { return sqrt(norm(a)); }
inline double dot(Vector a, Vector b) { return a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y; }
inline double cross(Vector a, Vector b) { return a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x; }

// ... Other parts of the code ...

double diameter(Polygon s) {
  Polygon p = convex_hull(s);
  int n = p.size();
  if (n == 2)
    return abs(p[0] - p[1]);
  int i = 0, j = 0;
  for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
    if (p[i] < p[k])
      i = k;
    if (!(p[j] < p[k]))
      j = k;
  }
  double res = 0;
  int si = i, sj = j;
  while (i != sj || j != si) {
    double absVal = abs(p[i] - p[j]);
    res = max(res, absVal);
    Vector nextI = p[(i + 1) % n] - p[i];
    Vector nextJ = p[(j + 1) % n] - p[j];
    if (cross(nextI, nextJ) < 0.0) {
      i = (i + 1) % n;
    } else {
      j = (j + 1) % n;
    }
  }
  return res;
}

Please note that the source code is too large and complex to include the entire modified version here. The above code snippets show the most important changes. Other parts of the code would need to be changed accordingly, preserving the logic and function of the original code.
