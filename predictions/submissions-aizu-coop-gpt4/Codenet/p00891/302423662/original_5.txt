The provided code seems to be doing pattern matching on a 2D grid. It reads two grids, one larger than the other, and tries to find all occurrences of the smaller grid in the larger one. The smaller grid is also rotated and flipped during this process.

**Code Analysis:**

1. The code contains numerous nested loops, which can be performance-intensive.
2. The program uses a `vector` to store previously computed hashes. This could be inefficient if many hashes are stored, as `vector` operations can become slow when the vector gets large.
3. The `ppp()` function recalculates the hash for the entire grid every time it is called. This is wasteful, especially considering that the function is called multiple times with the same grid.
4. The `ch()` function, used for rotating the pattern, also seems inefficient due to its nested loops.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Data Structures:** Replace the `vector` used for storing hashes with an `unordered_set`. This data structure allows for efficient O(1) lookup times, which can significantly speed up the code if many hashes are stored.
2. **Redundant Computations:** Instead of recalculating the hash for the entire grid every time `ppp()` is called, calculate it once and store the result. For the pattern, calculate and store its four rotated versions and their flipped versions ahead of time.
3. **Loops:** Consider optimizing loops where possible. For example, the nested loops in `ch()` can be replaced with a single loop that performs rotation in place.
4. **Compiler Optimizations:** Use `-O3` flag when compiling to enable all optimization levels, including loop unrolling and vectorization.

Now, let's proceed with the optimizations in the code.
