The provided code appears to be a solution for a pattern matching problem. The solution uses a rolling hash approach for matching patterns in a 2D array. However, there are several areas in this code that can be optimized.

Here are the key optimization strategies:

1. **Avoiding redundant computations**: The code contains repetitive computations, such as multiplication of the same values. By precomputing these values, we can improve the program's performance.

2. **Unnecessary memory usage**: The code uses a 2D array `roll[1001][1001]` which is defined inside the function `ppp()`. This array is re-initialized every time the function is called, which can be wasteful. We can optimize this by defining it once and reusing it.

3. **Inefficient data structures**: The code uses a vector `used` to store previously seen patterns. Every time a new pattern is identified, the program searches the entire vector to check if it's a duplicate. This can be optimized by using a data structure that supports faster search times, such as a `std::unordered_set`.

4. **Loop unrolling**: The current code contains nested loops that iterate over the patterns. While loop unrolling isn't always beneficial, it can help in this case by reducing the overhead of loop control instructions.

5. **Compiler optimizations**: Use `-O2` or `-O3` compiler optimization flags to allow the compiler to automatically optimize the code.

Here's how the optimized code would look:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define N 3
using namespace std;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
bool im[1010][1010], pa[110][110];
ull roll[1001][1001] = {};
int w, h, p, ans;
unordered_set<ull> used; // change from vector to unordered_set
ull n_pow[1010]; // precomputed powers of N
void ppp() {
  ull a = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < p; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < p; j++)
      a = a * N + pa[i][j];
  if (used.count(a)) // faster check for duplicates
    return;
  used.insert(a); // faster insertion
  for (int j = 0; j < h; j++) {
    ull b = 0, g = n_pow[p]; // use precomputed value
    for (int i = 0; i < p; i++)
      b = b * N + im[j][i];
    roll[j][p - 1] = b;
    for (int i = p; i < w; i++) {
      b = b * N + im[j][i] - im[j][i - p] * g;
      roll[j][i] = b;
    }
  }
  for (int j = p - 1; j < w; j++) {
    ull b = 0, g = n_pow[p]; // use precomputed value
    for (int i = 0; i < p; i++)
      b = b * n_pow[p] + roll[i][j]; // use precomputed value
    if (b == a)
      ans++;
    for (int i = p; i < h; i++) {
      b = b * n_pow[p] + roll[i][j] - roll[i - p][j] * g; // use precomputed value
      if (b == a)
        ans++;
    }
  }
}
// rest of the code remains the same

int main() {
  // precompute powers of N
  n_pow[0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; i++)
    n_pow[i] = n_pow[i - 1] * N;
  // rest of the code remains the same
  return 0;
}
```
The above code reduces redundant computations by precomputing powers of N and stores them in the array `n_pow`. It also avoids unnecessary memory usage by defining the `roll` array only once and reusing it. The `std::unordered_set` data structure is used in place of `std::vector` for storing used patterns, which provides constant time complexity for search and insert operations.
