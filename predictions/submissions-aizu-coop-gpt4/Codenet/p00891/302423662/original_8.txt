The code provided appears to be a solution to a problem involving image rotation and comparison. It reads in two images, rotates the smaller one in 90-degree increments, and checks for matches in the larger image. However, it seems to have performance issues due to inefficient data structures and computations.

1. **Code Analysis:**

The primary performance bottlenecks in this code can be identified as:

   - The `ppp()` function, which appears to be the main computation function, uses two-dimensional arrays `im[1010][1010]`, `pa[110][110]` and `roll[1001][1001]` which may cause memory issues and slow down the computation.
   - The repeated use of nested loops and large array computations in `ppp()`, `ch()`, and the `main()` function.
   - The use of a vector `used` to store computed values, which involves a linear search over the vector to find duplicates, can cause performance issues as the vector grows.
   - The `ch()` and `ch1()` functions, which perform rotations and reflections respectively, involve nested loops and multiple array operations, which can be computationally expensive.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**

   1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** Given the size of the arrays, using a different data structure like `std::unordered_set` for `used` would be more efficient. This would improve the time complexity from O(n) to O(1) for the search operation.
   2. **Redundant Computations:** The computations for base `N` and `g` in `ppp()` and `main()` are repeated. These values can be precomputed and reused.
   3. **Optimizing Loops:** The nested loops in `ppp()`, `ch()`, and `ch1()` can be optimized by reducing the number of operations inside the loop and precomputing values where possible.
   4. **Compiler Optimizations:** Compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` can be used for more efficient code execution.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

   1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** Replace the `used` vector with an `unordered_set` which will optimize the search operation from O(n) to O(1).
   2. **Redundant Computations:** Precompute the values of base `N` and `g` and reuse it in `ppp()` and `main()`.
   3. **Optimizing Loops:** Reduce the number of operations inside the loops in `ppp()`, `ch()`, and `ch1()`. For example, in `ppp()`, the value of `g` is calculated in both the loops. This can be computed once and reused.
   4. **Compiler Optimizations:** Use compiler flags `-O2` or `-O3` to help the compiler optimize the code.

4. **Optimized Code Block:** 

Please note that code optimization is a complex process and the effectiveness of optimizations can vary based on the specific use case, inputs, and execution environment. Therefore, the modified code should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it still meets the requirements and provides improved performance.

```cpp
// ... (code not modified remains same)
typedef unsigned long long ull;
unordered_set<ull> used; // Replacing vector with unordered_set for O(1) search
ull g = 1; // Precompute g value
for(int i = 0; i < p; i++) g *= N;

void ppp() {
  ull a = 0;
  ull roll[1001][1001] = {};
  for (int i = 0; i < p; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < p; j++)
      a = a * N + pa[i][j];
  if (used.count(a)) // Check in unordered set
    return;
  used.insert(a); // Insert in unordered_set
  // ...
  // (Rest of the code remains same)
}

// ... (Rest of the function definitions remain same)

int main() {
  // ...
  while (cin >> w >> h >> p, w) {
    ull n = 1; // Precompute n value
    for(int i = 0; i < p; i++) n *= N;
    // ...
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      ppp();
      ch1();
      ppp();
      ch1();
      ch();
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Remember to compile the optimized code with `-O2` or `-O3` flag for additional compiler optimizations.
