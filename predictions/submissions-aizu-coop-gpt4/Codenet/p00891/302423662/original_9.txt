Here is the analysis and optimization strategies for the given C++ program.

1. **Code Analysis:**
   - This is a pattern matching program that matches a pattern `pa` on an image `im` after rotating and flipping the pattern.
   - It uses the Rolling Hash Technique for pattern matching. The rolling hash is calculated in `ppp()` function.
   - The pattern is rotated and flipped in `ch()` and `ch1()` functions respectively.
   - The image and pattern are read from the input stream in the `main()` function.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**
   - **Data Structure Optimization:** The program uses a 2D array to store the image and pattern. This is efficient for this task and doesn't need optimization.
   - **Redundant Computations:**
     - The program does a lot of multiplications and divisions by `N` to calculate the rolling hash. The powers of `N` can be calculated once and stored in an array to avoid these redundant computations.
     - The rolling hash is calculated for the same flipped pattern twice. This can be avoided by checking if the pattern has already been processed.
   - **Loop Optimization:** The loops in the code are efficiently written. There's no nested loop that can be broken or loop that can be unrolled.
   - **Compiler Optimizations:** Using `-O3` optimization flag during compilation can improve runtime performance.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:** 
   - **Avoiding Redundant Computations:**
     - Create an array `power` of size `p` to store the powers of `N`. `power[i]` will store `N` raised to the power `i`. This will be used while calculating the rolling hash.
     - Create a `set` to store the processed patterns. Before calculating the rolling hash, check if the pattern is already in the set. If yes, return, else add it to the set and calculate the rolling hash.
   - **Compiler Optimization:**
     - Compile the program with `-O3` optimization flag to improve runtime performance.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define N 3
using namespace std;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
bool im[1010][1010], pa[110][110];
int w, h, p, ans;
unordered_set<ull> used;
ull power[1001];

void calc_power() {
  power[0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= p; ++i) {
    power[i] = power[i-1] * N;
  }
}

void ppp() {
  ull a = 0;
  ull roll[1001][1001] = {};
  for (int i = 0; i < p; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < p; j++)
      a = a * N + pa[i][j];
  
  if (used.find(a) != used.end())
    return;
  used.insert(a);

  for (int j = 0; j < h; j++) {
    ull b = 0, g = power[p];
    for (int i = 0; i < p; i++)
      b = b * N + im[j][i];
    roll[j][p - 1] = b;
    for (int i = p; i < w; i++) {
      b = b * N + im[j][i] - im[j][i - p] * g;
      roll[j][i] = b;
    }
  }
  for (int j = p - 1; j < w; j++) {
    ull b = 0, g = power[p], n = power[p];
    for (int i = 0; i < p; i++)
      b = b * n + roll[i][j];
    if (b == a)
      ans++;
    for (int i = p; i < h; i++) {
      b = b * n + roll[i][j] - roll[i - p][j] * g;
      if (b == a)
        ans++;
    }
  }
}
// Rest of the code remains the same
```
Please note that the rest of the code remains the same, so it is not included in the optimized code block. The `calc_power()` function should be called once at the start of the `main()` function.
