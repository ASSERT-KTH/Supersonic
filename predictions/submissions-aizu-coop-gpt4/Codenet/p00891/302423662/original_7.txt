1. Code Analysis: The code seems to be a solution to a problem related to image processing or pattern recognition. It reads two encoded images from the input, decodes them into binary arrays, and then tries to find occurrences of the smaller image (pattern) in the larger one (image). The code uses a rolling hash function to compare parts of the larger image with the pattern. There are loops within loops in the code, which might be the main performance bottlenecks.

2. Optimization Strategy: 

   a. Use `unordered_set` instead of `vector` for `used`: The `used` data structure stores patterns that have been checked. It's inefficient to use a vector for this purpose because checking for existence involves scanning the entire vector. An `unordered_set` can perform this operation much faster.

   b. Avoid unnecessary computations: The code contains repeated computations that can be avoided. For example, the power of N (`g`) is calculated repeatedly inside loops. It's more efficient to calculate it once before the loops.

   c. Optimize loops: The major performance bottleneck in this code probably lies in the nested loops. Loop unrolling can be applied to some extent, but the key to optimizing these loops is to minimize the computations inside them.

   d. Compiler optimizations: Use `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flags when compiling the code. These flags instruct the compiler to optimize the code for speed.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation: 

   a. Replace `vector` with `unordered_set`: The `used` data structure is used to check if a pattern has been processed before. It's currently a vector, so checking for existence requires scanning the entire vector. This operation is inefficient and can be improved by using an `unordered_set` instead. An `unordered_set` can check for existence in constant time, which is much faster.
   
   b. Avoid repeated computations: The power of N (`g`) is calculated repeatedly in loops. This is unnecessary and can be avoided by calculating it once before the loops. This reduces the number of computations inside the loops, which in turn improves performance.

   c. Optimize loops: The nested loops in the code are the main performance bottlenecks. To optimize them, minimize the computations inside the loops. For example, the calculation of `roll[i][j]` can be moved out of the inner loop in the `ppp()` function. Also consider using loop unrolling to further improve performance.

   d. Compiler optimizations: Use `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flags when compiling the code. These flags instruct the compiler to optimize the code for speed.

4. Optimized Code Block: The optimized code is as follows. Changes are marked with comments.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define N 3
using namespace std;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
bool im[1010][1010], pa[110][110];
int w, h, p, ans;
unordered_set<ull> used;  // Change vector to unordered_set
void ppp() {
  ull a = 0;
  ull roll[1001][1001] = {};
  for (int i = 0; i < p; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < p; j++)
      a = a * N + pa[i][j];
  if (used.count(a))  // Check if a pattern was already processed
    return;
  used.insert(a);  // Insert the pattern into the set
  // Calculate g before the loops
  ull g = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < p; i++)
    g *= N;
  for (int j = 0; j < h; j++) {
    ull b = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < p; i++)
      b = b * N + im[j][i];
    roll[j][p - 1] = b;
    for (int i = p; i < w; i++) {
      b = b * N + im[j][i] - im[j][i - p] * g;
      roll[j][i] = b;
    }
  }
  // Calculate n and g before the loops
  ull n = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < p; i++)
    n *= N;
  g = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < p; i++)
    g *= n;
  for (int j = p - 1; j < w; j++) {
    ull b = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < p; i++)
      b = b * n + roll[i][j];
    if (b == a)
      ans++;
    for (int i = p; i < h; i++) {
      b = b * n + roll[i][j] - roll[i - p][j] * g;
      if (b == a)
        ans++;
    }
  }
}
// Rest of the code remains the same
```
Note that the memory usage of the program is already quite efficient, and the changes made above focus on improving the running time. However, these changes may increase the code's complexity and make it harder to understand.
