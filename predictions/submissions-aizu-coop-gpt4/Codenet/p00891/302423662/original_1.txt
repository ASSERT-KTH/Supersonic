The provided code is a complex C++ program that appears to perform pattern matching in a 2D matrix. It reads a pattern and an image, then converts them into binary. The image is then scanned for the presence of the pattern, taking into account rotations and reflections of the pattern. The count of matches is stored in the variable `ans`. 

Here are some potential optimizations:

1. **Inefficient Data Structures**: The program uses an array `used`, a vector of `ull` (unsigned long long) to store the patterns that have been checked already. However, a `set` or `unordered_set` would be more efficient for checking the existence of an element, which happens in the function `ppp()`. It could minimize the time complexity from O(n) to O(1).

2. **Redundant Computations**: The computations of `g` and `n` in function `ppp` are repeated in each iteration, even though their values don't change. They can be computed once and reused.

3. **Compiler Optimizations**: Turning on compiler optimizations like `-O3` can also improve performance.

Here is how the optimized code might look:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define N 3
using namespace std;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
bool im[1010][1010], pa[110][110];
int w, h, p, ans;
unordered_set<ull> used; // Use unordered_set instead of vector
void ppp() {
  ull a = 0;
  ull roll[1001][1001] = {};
  for (int i = 0; i < p; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < p; j++)
      a = a * N + pa[i][j];
  if (used.count(a)) // Check existence in O(1)
      return;
  used.insert(a); // Insert in O(1)
  ull g = pow(N, p); // Compute g once
  for (int j = 0; j < h; j++) {
    ull b = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < p; i++)
      b = b * N + im[j][i];
    roll[j][p - 1] = b;
    for (int i = p; i < w; i++) {
      b = b * N + im[j][i] - im[j][i - p] * g;
      roll[j][i] = b;
    }
  }
  ull n = pow(N, p); // Compute n once
  for (int j = p - 1; j < w; j++) {
    ull b = 0, g = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < p; i++)
      b = b * n + roll[i][j], g *= n;
    if (b == a)
      ans++;
    for (int i = p; i < h; i++) {
      b = b * n + roll[i][j] - roll[i - p][j] * g;
      if (b == a)
        ans++;
    }
  }
}
// Rest of the code remains the same...
```

This code will perform the same actions as the original, but it should do so faster due to the usage of `unordered_set` for pattern checking and the removal of redundant computations. However, keep in mind that using `unordered_set` may increase the memory usage.
