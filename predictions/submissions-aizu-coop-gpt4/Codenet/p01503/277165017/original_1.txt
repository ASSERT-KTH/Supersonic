Code Analysis:
The provided code is a C++ program that seems to be solving a mathematical problem. The code uses Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) and extended Euclidean algorithm for some further computations. The main computation happens in the solve() function where a loop is iterating t/h times.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use of more efficient data structures: The current code does not use complex data structures, so there isn't any opportunity to replace them with more efficient ones.
2. Avoid redundant computations: There are multiple places in the code where we are doing the division operation (like t/u, t/h, etc) multiple times. Division is an expensive operation in terms of CPU cycles, so we should avoid redundant computations.
3. Loop optimizations: There is a loop in the solve() function that is running t/h times. Within the loop, we are performing expensive division and modulo operations. We can try to reduce the number of iterations or optimize the calculations inside the loop.
4. Compiler optimizations: We can suggest compiler to optimize the code with compiler flags like -O2 or -O3.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Avoid redundant computations: In the solve() function, we are computing t/u and t/h multiple times. We can calculate these values once and store them in a variable for later use. This will avoid the expensive division operation being executed multiple times.
2. Loop optimization: In the solve() function, we are performing a division operation inside the loop. We can try to reduce this by calculating the result of the division operation upfront and then just subtracting the values in each iteration.

Trade-offs: The proposed optimizations will not increase the code complexity significantly. It will only replace multiple division operations with single division operation and use that value in the code, which is a simple change. However, depending on the compiler and the architecture, the performance improvement might vary.

The changes in the optimized code are minimal and they mostly involve avoiding the redundant division operations. The functionality and output of the original program are preserved. The optimized code is also well-commented to highlight the changes made.
