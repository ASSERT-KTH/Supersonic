Analysis:
The given code is a C++ program that uses a number of math functions to perform calculations. The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) and extended gcd (ext_gcd) of two numbers, and then uses these calculations in the solve function to calculate a result. However, the code has room for optimization to improve its performance which will be discussed in the following section.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Reuse Computations: The gcd of two numbers is calculated multiple times, which is redundant. We can store the result of each gcd computation and reuse it when needed. This can be achieved by using a map to store the already computed gcds.

2. Loop Unrolling: The solve function contains a loop that iterates t/h times, which could be a large number. Loop unrolling can be applied here to reduce the overhead of loop control.

3. Inline Function: The gcd and ext_gcd functions are called multiple times. By making these functions inline, we can potentially speed up the program by avoiding the overhead of function calls.

4. Avoiding Division: Division is a costly operation in terms of CPU cycles. In the solve function, instead of computing division every time in the loop, we can calculate the reciprocal once and then multiply it.

5. Efficient IO operations: In C++, cin and cout operations are slower than scanf and printf. Since we are focusing on performance, replacing cin and cout with scanf and printf would make IO operations faster.

Optimization Explanation:

1. Reuse Computation:
    - Rationale: Reusing computation will save CPU cycles as we will not calculate the same thing over and over again. 
    - Trade-offs: This will increase memory usage as we need to store the computed gcds. However, the performance gain outweighs the extra memory usage.

2. Loop Unrolling:
    - Rationale: Loop unrolling reduces the overhead of loop control, making the code run faster.
    - Trade-offs: However, it increases the size of the code, making it less readable and maintainable.

3. Inline Function:
    - Rationale: Inline functions can potentially speed up the program by avoiding the overhead of function calls.
    - Trade-offs: It may increase the size of the binary file, as the function's code gets inserted at each point where the function is called.

4. Avoiding Division:
    - Rationale: Division is a costly operation in terms of CPU cycles. By avoiding division, we can speed up the code.
    - Trade-offs: It may increase the complexity of the code.

5. Efficient IO operations:
    - Rationale: scanf and printf are faster than cin and cout, making IO operations faster.
    - Trade-offs: scanf and printf are less safe and less convenient than cin and cout.
