Code Analysis:

The C++ program given takes in five inputs: w, d, n, m, t, and calculates a result based on these inputs. It includes two recursive functions, gcd() and ext_gcd(), which calculate the greatest common divisor and extended greatest common divisor of two numbers, respectively. The main computational part of the program is in the solve() function, which uses a loop that iterates t times, where t is one of the inputs. As t could be a large number, this loop could be a potential performance bottleneck.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use Iterative Functions Instead of Recursive Ones: Recursive calls have overheads, and since gcd and ext_gcd functions are recursive, we can replace them with iterative versions to improve performance.
2. Loop Optimization: The for loop in the solve() function could be optimized by minimizing computations inside the loop and avoiding integer division as much as possible.
3. Avoid Heavy IO Operations: The usage of cin and printf for IO operations can be replaced with faster alternatives like scanf and printf.
4. Use of Global Variables: The variables that are shared across multiple functions could be made global to avoid passing them around in function calls, reducing the overhead of these calls.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace Recursive Functions with Iterative Ones:
   Replace gcd() and ext_gcd() with iterative versions. Recursive functions have an overhead of function calls, and also, they might cause stack overflow for large inputs. Iterative versions of these functions would improve performance and avoid potential stack overflow.
   
2. Loop Optimization:
   The for loop in the solve() function is a potential performance bottleneck as it runs t times. We can minimize the computations inside the loop, for instance, by calculating (t - w) / u outside the loop and storing it in a variable. This would avoid performing the same calculation over and over again in each iteration. Additionally, integer division is a relatively expensive operation, and any opportunity to reduce its usage would help in improving the performance.

3. Use Faster IO Operations:
   Instead of using cin for input and printf for output, we can use scanf and printf, which are faster. This would speed up IO operations.

4. Use Global Variables:
   Variables like m, t, w, d, u, h, tu, th, x, which are shared across multiple functions, could be made global. This would avoid passing them around in function calls, reducing the overhead of these calls.

Trade-offs:

While these optimizations would improve performance, they may make the code a bit more complex and harder to understand. Specifically, global variables could make the code harder to debug and maintain, as they can be changed from anywhere in the code. But in this case, since the program is relatively small, it's a worthwhile trade-off for improved performance.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int MN = 501 * 1000 * 1000;
ll m, t, w, d, u, h, tu, th, x;

ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  while (b) {
    ll tmp = a;
    a = b;
    b = tmp % b;
  }
  return a;
}

void ext_gcd(ll a, ll b, ll &x, ll &y) {
  x = 1, y = 0;
  ll x1 = 0, y1 = 1, a1 = a, b1 = b;
  while (b1) {
    ll q = a1 / b1;
    tie(x, x1) = make_tuple(x1, x - q * x1);
    tie(y, y1) = make_tuple(y1, y - q * y1);
    tie(a1, b1) = make_tuple(b1, a1 - q * b1);
  }
}

void init() {
  m = t - m % t;
  u = gcd(t, w + d), h = gcd(t, m);
  tu = t / u;
  th = t / h;
  ll xx, y;
  ext_gcd(m, t, xx, y);
  x = ((xx % th) + th) % th;
}

int solve() {
  init();
  int res = 0;
  int l = 0;
  int s = 0;
  int th = t / h;
  int upper_bound = (t - w) / u;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i += h) {
    if (s < n) {
      res += max(0, i / u - l);
      l = i / u;
    }
    s += x;
    if (s >= th)
      s -= th;
  }
  res += max(0, upper_bound - l);
  return res;
}

int main() {
  scanf("%lld %lld %d %lld %lld", &w, &d, &n, &m, &t);
  w++;
  d--;
  printf("%.20f\n", 1.0 * solve() / tu);
  return 0;
}
```
