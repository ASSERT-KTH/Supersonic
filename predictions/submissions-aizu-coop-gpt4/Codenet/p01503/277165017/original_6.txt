1. Code Analysis:
The given code seems to be a solution to a competitive programming problem. It's a mathematical problem where we are calculating some form of extended greatest common divisor (ext_gcd) and using it for further calculations in the solve function. 

2. Optimization Strategy:
Looking at the code, there aren't many obvious bottlenecks. The code already uses efficient data structures like `unordered_map` and `vector`. However, some improvements can still be made:

   A. Unnecessary use of mod operation in the `init` function.
   
   B. The `solve` function iterates over the loop by incrementing `i` by `h`. We can change the loop to iterate once only and calculate the value of `i` inside the loop.
   
   C. Some variables are re-declared within the solve function which have already been declared globally.
   
   D. Division operation in the `solve` function can be replaced with multiplication by the reciprocal which is faster.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   A. In the `init` function, the mod operation `%` in `m = t - m % t;` is unnecessary. If `m` is already divisible by `t`, it doesn't change `m`. If `m` isn't divisible by `t`, it just reduces `m` to less than `t`, but the subtraction `t - m` will always result in a number less than `t`, effectively doing nothing for the later calculations. So we can remove it.
   
   B. In the `solve` function, instead of incrementing `i` by `h` in each iteration, we can iterate the loop only once and calculate the value of `i` in the loop body using `i = h * iterationCount;`.
   
   C. Variables `l`, `s` and `th` are re-declared in the `solve` function, which is unnecessary as they have already been declared globally. Removing these will save memory and also avoid confusion.
   
   D. In the `solve` function, the division operations `(i - w) / u` and `(t - w) / u` can be replaced by multiplication with the reciprocal of `u` to speed up the calculations. However, be aware this may introduce rounding errors.

Please note that these optimizations may not significantly improve the performance of the code because the original code was not significantly inefficient. The improvements are minor and may not result in noticeable speedup.
