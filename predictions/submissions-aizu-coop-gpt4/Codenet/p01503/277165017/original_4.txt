This code is highly mathematical, focusing on the computation of greatest common divisors (gcd) and extended gcd, which are used in the `init` and `solve` functions to perform complex calculations. 

Below are some observations and optimization strategies:

1. **Inefficient Recursive Calls:** The `gcd` and `ext_gcd` functions are implemented as recursive functions. Recursion can lead to overhead due to the creation of multiple stack frames. These recursive calls can be replaced with iterative versions to potentially increase performance.

2. **Compiler Optimization:** Using compiler optimization flags can help improve the performance of the code. For instance, you can use `-O2` or `-O3` flags with `g++` to allow for more aggressive optimizations at the cost of increased compilation time.

3. **Use of Input/Output Functions:** The code uses `cin` and `printf` for input and output. These are slower compared to `scanf` and `printf`. So, the use of `scanf` instead of `cin` can marginally improve the performance.

4. **Excessive Use of `int` and `ll` Types:** While necessary for the calculations, the frequent use of `int` and `ll` (long long) can be costly in terms of memory. This isn't necessarily a problem here, but it's worth considering whether all these variables are necessary, or if some of them can be calculated on the fly to save memory.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<ll, ll> P;

ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  while (b != 0) {
    ll rem = a % b;
    a = b;
    b = rem;
  }
  return a;
}

ll ext_gcd(ll a, ll b, ll &x, ll &y) {
  x = 1, y = 0;
  ll x1 = 0, y1 = 1, a1 = a, b1 = b;
  while (b1) {
    ll q = a1 / b1;
    tie(x, x1) = make_pair(x1, x - q * x1);
    tie(y, y1) = make_pair(y1, y - q * y1);
    tie(a1, b1) = make_pair(b1, a1 - q * b1);
  }
  return a1;
}

int main() {
  ll w, d, n, m, t, u, h, tu, th, x;
  scanf("%lld %lld %lld %lld %lld", &w, &d, &n, &m, &t);
  w++;
  d--;
  m = t - m % t;
  u = gcd(t, w + d), h = gcd(t, m);
  tu = t / u;
  th = t / h;
  ll xx, y;
  ext_gcd(m, t, xx, y);
  x = ((xx % th) + th) % th;
  int res = 0;
  int l = 0;
  int s = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i += h) {
    if (s < n) {
      res += max(0LL, (i - w) / u - l);
      l = i / u;
    }
    s += x;
    if (s >= th)
      s -= th;
  }
  res += max(0LL, (t - w) / u - l);
  printf("%.20f\n", 1.0 * res / tu);
  return 0;
}
```

The recursive calls in `gcd` and `ext_gcd` have been replaced with iterative versions. The `init` and `solve` functions have been removed in favor of doing everything within `main`. This reduces function call overhead but also makes the code less modular. The trade-off here is between code modularity and efficiency. Also, `cin` has been replaced with `scanf` for faster input.
