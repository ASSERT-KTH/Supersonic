The code given is an implementation of an extended Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) and its application to a problem. The algorithm is used in the "init" function to calculate certain values which are then used in the "solve" function to compute the result.

Here are some optimization strategies that we can use:

1. **Minimize the number of function calls**: The gcd function is used multiple times in the code. We can avoid these calls by storing the results in a variable for future reuse.

2. **Optimize loops**: The loop in the "solve" function runs t/h times, which can be a huge number. We can optimize this by reducing the number of iterations if possible.

3. **Avoiding division operations**: Division operations are computationally expensive. We can replace the division operations with multiplication operations where possible. 

4. **Inlining small functions**: Inlining small functions like gcd and ext_gcd can speed up the execution time by avoiding the overhead of function calls.

5. **Use faster I/O methods**: If the program is I/O bound, using faster I/O methods like getchar/putchar or fread/fwrite can improve the performance.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. **Store the results of gcd function**: Instead of calling gcd function in the init function, we can store the results of gcd(t, w + d) and gcd(t, m) in the variables u and h respectively.

2. **Replace division with multiplication**: In the "solve" function, replace the division operation i/h with multiplication operation i*th.

3. **Inline gcd and ext_gcd functions**: Since these functions are small and called multiple times, inlining them can improve the performance.

4. **Use faster I/O methods**: Replace cin and printf with scanf and printf to improve I/O performance.
