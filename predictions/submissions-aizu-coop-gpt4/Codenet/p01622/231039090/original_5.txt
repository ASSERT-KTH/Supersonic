Code Analysis:

The provided code is a C++ program that solves a specific problem related to pairs of integers. It starts by reading an integer 'n' from standard input, followed by 'n' pairs of integers. These pairs are stored in an array named 'book'. After reading all pairs, the program sorts them in descending order. Then, it calculates the sum of the first and second elements of each pair (sumf and sums respectively). If the first element of the first pair is less or equal than the half of 'sumf', it outputs the sum of 'sumf' and 'sums'. Otherwise, it calculates a dynamic programming (DP) table, and uses it to find the maximum value 'D' such that 'D' is less or equal than 'd' and 'dp[D]' is non-zero. Finally, it outputs 'sumf' + 'sums' + (d - D).

Optimization Strategy:

1. Redundant calculations: Currently, the code calculates 'sumf' and 'sums' in a separate loop. These calculations can be merged into the input reading loop.

2. Dynamic programming optimization: The code fills a dynamic programming table 'dp' with boolean values. It can be optimized by breaking the loop once the required condition is met.

3. Data structures: The current usage of the pair data structure is efficient and there is no need for a change.

4. Compiler optimizations: Use of faster input/output methods can be considered for further optimization. Here, we are considering 'scanf' and 'printf' instead of 'cin' and 'cout' for faster execution.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
int n, sumf, sums, dp[3000];
P book[1001];

int solve() {
  sumf = 2 * book[0].first - sumf;
  dp[0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    for (int j = sumf - book[i].second; j >= 0; j--)
      if(dp[j]) {
        dp[j + book[i].second] = 1;
        if(j + book[i].second == sumf) 
          return sums + sumf;
      }
  while (!dp[sumf])
    sumf--;
  return sums + sumf;
}

int main() {
  while (scanf("%d", &n), n) {
    sumf = sums = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d%d", &book[i].first, &book[i].second);
      sumf += book[i].first;
      sums += book[i].second;
    }
    sort(book, book + n, greater<P>());
    printf("%d\n", solve());
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. Merged the loops for input reading and sum calculation into a single loop.
2. Used faster I/O methods, i.e., 'scanf' and 'printf' instead of 'cin' and 'cout'.
3. In the dynamic programming loop, added a check to break the loop once we find a 'j' such that 'dp[j]' is 1 and 'j + book[i].second' equals to 'sumf'. This way, we avoid unnecessary computation after finding the required result.
4. Initialized 'dp[0]' to 1 outside the loop to avoid unnecessary iterations.
5. Removed the variable 'D' and used 'sumf' directly to find the maximum value that satisfies the condition 'dp[sumf]' is non-zero.
