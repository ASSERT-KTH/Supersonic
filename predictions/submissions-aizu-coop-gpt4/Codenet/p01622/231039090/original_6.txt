1. Code Analysis:

This program is taking a pair of integers as input repeatedly and then it is sorting these pairs in descending order. The function `solve()` is computing the sum of both elements of the pair and then checking whether twice the first element of the first pair is less than or equal to the sum of all the first elements of the pairs. If it's true then it is returning the sum of all elements of the pairs. Otherwise, it is running a dynamic programming loop to find the maximum sum that can be formed using the second elements of the pairs and not exceeding 'd' (which is twice the first element of the first pair minus the sum of all the first elements of the pairs). Then it is returning the sum of all elements of the pairs plus the difference between 'd' and the maximum sum that can be formed.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    A. Inefficient Data Structures: The data structures used in this program are efficient enough.

    B. Redundant Computations: One optimization we can make is to calculate `sumf` and `sums` while taking the input itself rather than iterating over the array again to calculate them.

    C. Loops and Recursive Calls: The loops are necessary for this program as it is implementing a dynamic programming problem. However, we can optimize the inner loop by starting from 'd' instead of 'd - book[i].s' as any sum beyond 'd' is not useful.

    D. Compiler Optimizations: Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` to speed up the IO operations.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

    A. We can calculate `sumf` and `sums` while taking the input itself. This is more efficient as it avoids an extra loop over the array.

    B. The inner loop can be optimized by starting from 'd' instead of 'd - book[i].s' as any sum beyond 'd' is not useful. This will reduce the number of iterations and hence, improve the performance.

    C. The IO operations can be sped up by using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`. This disables the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams which can make IO operations faster.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
int n;
P book[1001];

int solve() {
  int sumf = 0, sums = 0;
  if (2 * book[0].first <= sumf)
    return sumf + sums;
  int d = 2 * book[0].first - sumf, dp[3000] = {1}, D = d;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    for (int j = d; j >= book[i].second; j--)
      dp[j] |= dp[j - book[i].second];
  while (!dp[D])
    D--;
  return sumf + sums + (d - D);
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    int sumf = 0, sums = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> book[i].first >> book[i].second;
      sumf += book[i].first;
      sums += book[i].second;
    }
    sort(book, book + n, greater<P>());
    cout << solve() << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
