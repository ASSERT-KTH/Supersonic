# Code Analysis
This C++ program seems to be a solution to a competitive programming problem. The program reads a list of pairs of integers from standard input, and then performs an operation (solve) on the pairs. The purpose of the solve function seems to be to find a subset of the pairs that minimizes a certain value, and then return this minimum value. The algorithm used in the solve function is a form of the dynamic programming subset sum problem.

# Optimization Strategy
1. **Avoid using `<bits/stdc++.h>` header:** This header includes almost all standard library headers which increases compilation time significantly. Include only necessary headers.
2. **Avoid global variables:** The use of global variables can lead to issues with variable scope and can make the code harder to debug and maintain. 
3. **Optimize Dynamic Programming Memory Usage:** The dynamic programming array `dp` is recreated on every call to the `solve` function. If `solve` is called many times, this could add a significant overhead. We could reduce this by making `dp` a global variable or by using a dynamic data structure like `std::vector` and resizing it as needed.
  
# Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **Replace `<bits/stdc++.h>` with necessary headers:** The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file is a non-standard header file used by GCC, which includes a large number of standard C++ library headers. Including this file can significantly slow down the compilation process. It's better to include only the headers that are actually used in the program.
2. **Avoid global variables:** The `book` and `n` variables are declared globally. This can make the code harder to read and debug since the variables can be modified from anywhere in the program. It would be better to pass these as arguments to functions where required.
3. **Optimize Dynamic Programming Memory Usage:** The `dp` array is created every time the `solve` function is called. This could lead to a significant overhead, especially if `solve` is called many times. A possible improvement could be to declare `dp` as a global variable and initialize it once at the start of the program. Alternatively, we could use a dynamic data structure like `std::vector` that can be resized as needed, and keep it as a persistent variable between calls to `solve`.

# Optimized Code Block
Below is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef pair<int, int> P;

int solve(const vector<P>& book, int n) {
    int sumf = 0, sums = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        sumf += book[i].first, sums += book[i].second;
    if (2 * book[0].first <= sumf)
        return sumf + sums;
    int d = 2 * book[0].first - sumf, D = d;
    vector<int> dp(3000, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        for (int j = d - book[i].second; j >= 0; j--)
            dp[j + book[i].second] |= dp[j];
    while (!dp[D])
        D--;
    return sumf + sums + (d - D);
}

int main() {
    int n;
    while (cin >> n, n) {
        vector<P> book(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            cin >> book[i].first >> book[i].second;
        sort(book.begin(), book.end(), greater<P>());
        cout << solve(book, n) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, I have replaced the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header with only the necessary headers, moved the global variables `n` and `book` inside functions where required, and replaced the static array `dp` with a `std::vector` which is initialized inside the `solve` function. This should make the code easier to read and debug, and potentially improve performance.
