The given C++ code appears to be a solution to a specific problem in competitive programming. It essentially reads a series of integer pairs from standard input, sorts them in descending order, and then performs a calculation based on the sorted pairs. The 'solve()' function appears to be a dynamic programming solution to a subset sum problem.

Here are the areas where we can optimize the program:

1. Using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes all standard library headers, which increases the compilation time. It is much more efficient to only include the necessary headers.

2. Use of macros: `#define f first` and `#define s second` may make the code more readable, but using macros can lead to problems because they don't respect scope. 

3. Global variables: The use of global variables can make the code harder to understand and debug. In this case, the variables 'n' and 'book' could be local variables within the main function.

4. Redundant calculations: `sumf` is computed twice, but its value doesn't change between the two calculations.

5. Initialization of large arrays: The array `dp` is initialized with 3000 elements, which may be unnecessary depending on the input.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the specific headers needed for the code.
2. Replace macros with the original code.
3. Refactor the code to avoid using global variables.
4. Remove redundant calculations.
5. Initialize the `dp` array dynamically based on the input to save memory.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> P;

int solve(vector<P>& book, int n) {
    int sumf = 0, sums = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        sumf += book[i].first, sums += book[i].second;

    int d = 2 * book[0].first - sumf;
    vector<int> dp(d + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    int D = d;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        for (int j = d - book[i].second; j >= 0; j--)
            dp[j + book[i].second] |= dp[j];
    while (!dp[D])
        D--;
    return sumf + sums + (d - D);
}

int main() {
    int n;
    while (cin >> n, n) {
        vector<P> book(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            cin >> book[i].first >> book[i].second;
        sort(book.begin(), book.end(), greater<P>());
        cout << solve(book, n) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code includes the necessary standard libraries, avoids using macros and global variables, and only initializes the required amount of memory. It also reduces redundant calculations, thus improving the efficiency of the code.
