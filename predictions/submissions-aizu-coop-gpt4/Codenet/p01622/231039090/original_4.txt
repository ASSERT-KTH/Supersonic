1. Code Analysis: 
The given program represents a solution to a dynamic programming problem, where it's finding the minimum possible total sum of the weights of books, given certain conditions. 
The function `solve()` is the core of the problem. It calculates the total sum of the first and second elements of the books, then checks some conditions to return the result. An array `dp` is used to hold information about possible sums. The nested loop inside the `solve()` function poses a potential performance bottleneck and is a key area for optimization.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. The array `dp` is declared inside the `solve()` function, which is called in a loop in the `main()` function. Allocating and deallocating a relatively large array (3000 elements) multiple times can be slow. Moving this array out of the function and reusing it can save some time.
   2. The second loop inside the `solve()` function can be optimized by reducing the range of the loop. Instead of starting from `d - book[i].s`, we can start from `min(d, sumf) - book[i].s`.
   3. Compiler optimizations can be enabled by using the `-O2` or `-O3` flag.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Move the array `dp` outside the `solve()` function and clear it at the beginning of each function call. This will reduce the time spent on memory allocation and deallocation.
   2. Change the starting value of the second loop in the `solve()` function. This will reduce the number of iterations of the loop.
   3. Compile the program with `-O2` or `-O3` flag. Compiler optimizations can reduce the running time of the program.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define f first
#define s second
using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
int n;
P book[1001];
int dp[3000];

int solve() {
  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));  // Clear the dp array
  dp[0] = 1;  // Set the first element to 1
  int sumf = 0, sums = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    sumf += book[i].f, sums += book[i].s;
  if (2 * book[0].f <= sumf)
    return sumf + sums;
  int d = 2 * book[0].f - sumf, D = d;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    for (int j = min(d, sumf) - book[i].s; j >= 0; j--)  // Start from min(d, sumf) - book[i].s
      dp[j + book[i].s] |= dp[j];
  while (!dp[D])
    D--;
  return sumf + sums + (d - D);
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> book[i].f >> book[i].s;
    sort(book, book + n, greater<P>());
    cout << solve() << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Remember to compile this program with `-O2` or `-O3` flag for better performance.
