The given code seems to be a solution for a variant of the knapsack problem, where the cost of books (represented as pairs of integers) needs to be minimized.

Here's the performance optimization strategy:

1. **Redundant Computations**: We can see that the sums of the first and second elements of the pairs are calculated every time in the solve() function. These sums can be calculated once in the main() function and passed as arguments to the solve() function.

2. **Efficient Data Structure**: The std::pair<int, int> array is used to store book data. This is a good choice as it provides constant-time access and modification. However, the STL array could be used over C-style arrays for better safety and additional features.

3. **Compiler Optimization**: The compiler optimization flag -O3 can be used when compiling the program, which enables all compiler optimizations.

4. **Memory Usage**: The dp array in the solve() function is of size 3000 which is initialized every time the function is called. Instead, the size can be dynamically assigned based on the actual size needed.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>

#define f first
#define s second

using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> P;

int n;
array<P, 1001> book;

int solve(int sumf, int sums) {
  if (2 * book[0].f <= sumf)
    return sumf + sums;
  int d = 2 * book[0].f - sumf, D = d;
  
  // Dynamically sized dp array
  array<int, decltype(d)> dp {1}; 
  
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    for (int j = d - book[i].s; j >= 0; j--)
      dp[j + book[i].s] |= dp[j];
      
  while (!dp[D])
    D--;
  return sumf + sums + (d - D);
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    int sumf = 0, sums = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> book[i].f >> book[i].s;
      sumf += book[i].f;
      sums += book[i].s;
    }
    sort(book.begin(), book.begin() + n, greater<P>());
    cout << solve(sumf, sums) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this optimization does not change the underlying algorithm, so the time complexity is the same as the original code. The difference is that some redundant calculations are avoided, making the code more efficient. The memory usage is also optimized by using dynamic sizing. Compiler optimization flags are not included in the code as they are passed during the compilation process.
