Code Analysis:

This code takes a list of pairs of integers as input, with each pair representing a book's two properties. The code's main goal is to sort the books in descending order based on the first property of the pair, then process them to return a certain value. The processing part is done in the function "solve".

Potential performance bottlenecks:

1. The sorting of the array of pairs is an O(nlogn) operation, which can be a bottleneck if n is large. 

2. The nested loop in the 'solve' function iterates through each book and for each book, it iterates from 'd - book[i].s' to 0. This could potentially be a performance issue if 'd - book[i].s' is large.

3. The use of 'dp' array for optimization in the 'solve' function is memory-consuming, as it needs to be as large as the maximum value of 'd', which can be quite large if n is large.

4. The use of 'while' loop to find the largest 'D' such that 'dp[D]' is true can also be a performance issue if 'D' is large.

Optimization Strategy:

1. For the sorting part, if the input pairs are almost sorted or partially sorted, we could use a sorting algorithm like insertion sort which performs well on nearly sorted data, instead of using sort function which has a worst-case complexity of O(nlogn). However, without knowledge of the input data distribution, it is risky to make such assumption and change.

2. The nested loop in the 'solve' function can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm or data structure. One possible way is to use a priority queue to reduce the time complexity.

3. Memory usage can be optimized by using a more space-efficient data structure to replace the 'dp' array. 

4. The 'while' loop to find the largest 'D' can be optimized by keeping track of the largest 'D' during the process of updating the 'dp' array, so that we don't need to check from the maximum 'D' downwards.

Step-by-Step Explanation and Optimized Code Block:

1. Using a priority queue in the solve function:

The nested loop in the 'solve' function essentially tries to find a subset of the second properties of the books (book[i].s) whose sum is closest to but not exceeding 'd'. This can be seen as a variant of the knapsack problem, which can be solved using dynamic programming.

However, the current implementation uses an array 'dp' to store the results of subproblems, which is not space-efficient. A more efficient way is to use a priority queue to store the sums of the second properties of the subsets of the books, and keep updating the priority queue in each iteration.

This way, we can guarantee that the sum of the second properties of any subset of the books will not exceed 'd', and we can keep track of the maximum sum during the process.

Here is the updated 'solve' function:

```
#include <queue>
int solve() {
  int sumf = 0, sums = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    sumf += book[i].f, sums += book[i].s;
  if (2 * book[0].f <= sumf)
    return sumf + sums;
  int d = 2 * book[0].f - sumf;
  priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
  pq.push(0);
  int maxD = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    vector<int> temp;
    while (!pq.empty()) {
      int sum = pq.top() + book[i].s;
      pq.pop();
      if (sum <= d) {
        temp.push_back(sum);
        maxD = max(maxD, sum);
      }
    }
    for (int j : temp)
      pq.push(j);
  }
  return sumf + sums + (d - maxD);
}
```

Trade-off: The main trade-off of this optimization is that it increases the code complexity. However, it reduces the space complexity from O(d) to O(n), and it also reduces the time complexity from O(nd) to O(nlogn) in the worst case.

2. Optimizing the 'while' loop:

Instead of using a 'while' loop to find the largest 'D', we can keep track of the maximum 'D' during the process of updating the 'pq'. This way, we can eliminate the 'while' loop and reduce the time complexity.

Here is the updated 'solve' function:

```
#include <queue>
int solve() {
  int sumf = 0, sums = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    sumf += book[i].f, sums += book[i].s;
  if (2 * book[0].f <= sumf)
    return sumf + sums;
  int d = 2 * book[0].f - sumf;
  priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
  pq.push(0);
  int maxD = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    vector<int> temp;
    while (!pq.empty()) {
      int sum = pq.top() + book[i].s;
      pq.pop();
      if (sum <= d) {
        temp.push_back(sum);
        maxD = max(maxD, sum);
      }
    }
    for (int j : temp)
      pq.push(j);
  }
  return sumf + sums + (d - maxD);
}
```

Trade-off: This optimization does not have any major trade-offs. It reduces the time complexity without increasing the code complexity or memory usage.

Please note that these optimizations are based on the assumptions of the problem. The actual performance gain depends on the specific input data.
