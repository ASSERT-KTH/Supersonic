Here is an overview of the optimization process:

1. **Code Analysis:** The given program appears to be a simplistic implementation of a membership system. The program reads in data about groups and their members, and then uses a depth-first search (DFS) to find all unique members. The main areas that could benefit from optimization are the DFS function and the string processing in the main function.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**
    1. **Inefficient data structures:** The use of a vector in the DFS function for storing and returning the result is inefficient due to the frequent resizing and copying of the vector. This can be replaced with a set to take advantage of its logarithmic insertion and search time complexity.
    2. **Redundant computations:** The DFS function is recursively called for each member of a group, even if that member has already been processed. This can be avoided by checking if a member has already been processed before making the recursive call.
    3. **Loops:** The string processing loop in the main function can be optimized by using string streams instead of manually parsing the input. This can improve readability and performance.
    4. **Compiler optimizations:** The use of the '-O2' or '-O3' flags can provide automatic optimizations such as loop unrolling and function inlining.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
    1. Replace the vector in the DFS function with a set. This eliminates the need for resizing and copying the vector, and also automatically removes duplicate members.
    2. Add a check in the DFS function to avoid processing a member that has already been processed. This reduces the number of recursive calls and thus the running time.
    3. Replace the string processing loop in the main function with a string stream. This simplifies the code and potentially improves performance.
    4. Use the '-O2' or '-O3' optimization flags when compiling the code. These flags enable automatic optimizations that can significantly improve performance.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**
The following is the optimized code taking into account the above mentioned strategies. Please note that it's important to test the optimized code to ensure it still produces the desired output. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <sstream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> involve;
set<int> visited;

void dfs2(int now) {
  if (visited.count(now)) return;
  visited.insert(now);
  
  for (auto i : involve[now]) {
    if (!involve[i].empty()) {
      dfs2(i);
    } else {
      visited.insert(i);
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    int num = 0;
    map<string, int> mp;
    int N;
    cin >> N;
    if (!N) break;

    involve.clear();
    involve.resize(100000);
    visited.clear();

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      string st;
      cin >> st;
      stringstream ss(st);

      string groupname, member;
      getline(ss, groupname, ':');

      if (!mp.count(groupname)) {
        mp[groupname] = num++;
      }

      while (getline(ss, member, ',')) {
        if (!mp.count(member)) {
          mp[member] = num++;
        }
        involve[mp[groupname]].push_back(mp[member]);
      }
    }
    dfs2(0);
    cout << visited.size() - 1 << endl; // subtract 1 because group 0 is also counted
  }
  return 0;
}
```
