Code Analysis:
The given code seems to be performing a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph, which is represented as a list of edges. There are a few optimization opportunities that can be identified:

1. The `isso()` function checks for a number being prime or not. The current approach, iterating till sqrt(n), can be optimized by skipping even numbers after checking for 2.

2. The `powint()` function calculates the power of a number using recursion. This can be optimized using the binary exponentiation method which reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(log(n)).

3. The `dfs2()` function is performing DFS and is generating a vector of integers. This function is creating a lot of temporary vectors which are then being merged. This is an inefficient way of gathering all the nodes visited during the DFS.

4. The `main()` function is using a map to convert group and member names to integer equivalents. This map operation could be expensive in terms of time complexity.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Optimize the `isso()` function to skip even numbers after checking for 2.
2. Use binary exponentiation in `powint()` function to optimize the power calculation.
3. Instead of returning vectors from `dfs2()` function, pass an output vector by reference to the function and let the function fill this vector.
4. In the `main()` function, consider using an unordered_map instead of a map because an unordered_map has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertions and lookups, whereas a map has a time complexity of O(log(n)).

Step-By-Step Explanation:

1. In the `isso()` function, after checking for divisibility by 2, we can increment the counter `i` by 2 in each iteration. This way, we only check the odd numbers, which skips all even numbers, and hence halves the number of iterations.

2. In the `powint()` function, binary exponentiation can be used. This method works by converting the exponent into binary and calculating the power for each binary digit. For each binary digit, the result is squared and if the binary digit is 1, the number `a` is multiplied to the result.

3. In the `dfs2()` function, instead of creating vectors every time a node is visited, we can pass an output vector by reference to the function. So, we will have only one vector that is filled during the DFS.

4. In the `main()` function, by using an unordered_map instead of a map, we can optimize the insertions and lookups. An unordered_map uses a hash table for insertions and lookups which has an average time complexity of O(1).

    vector<int> allnames;
    dfs2(0, used, allnames);
    sort(allnames.begin(), allnames.end());
    const int ans(unique(allnames.begin(), allnames.end()) - allnames.begin());
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have improved the efficiency of the prime number checking function, power calculation function, DFS function, and replaced map with unordered_map. These optimizations will provide a significant performance boost in terms of both execution time and memory usage.
