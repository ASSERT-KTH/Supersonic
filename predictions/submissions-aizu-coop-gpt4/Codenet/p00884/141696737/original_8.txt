This is a fairly complex C++ program, and there seem to be a few areas where it might benefit from optimization. Here are some potential improvements:

1. Code Analysis: The code imports a lot of libraries but only a few of them are actually used. There are also two unused structures `edge` and `aa`, and two unused functions `isso` and `powint`. Moreover, the code includes some redundant computations and multiple iterations over the same data.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Remove unused libraries, structures, and functions.
    2. Use reserve function for vectors to avoid reallocations.
    3. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back` to construct elements in place, avoiding unnecessary copy or move operations.
    4. Minimize the scope of variables.
    5. Use `auto` to simplify type declarations.
    6. Remove redundant computations and unnecessary iterations over the same data.
    7. Use `unordered_map` instead of `map` for faster access times.
    8. Use `unordered_set` instead of `set` for faster access times.
    9. Use return value optimization (RVO) or named return value optimization (NRVO) where possible.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation: 

    1. Removing unused libraries, structures, and functions: This step would make the code cleaner and easier to maintain. It would also reduce the compilation time.

    2. Using the reserve function for vectors: This would preallocate memory for vectors, preventing expensive reallocations and copies when the vector grows.

    3. Using `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: This would construct elements in place, avoiding unnecessary copy or move operations.

    4. Minimizing the scope of variables: This would prevent unnecessary memory usage and improve readability and maintainability of the code.

    5. Using `auto` to simplify type declarations: This would make the code more readable, and it would also make it easier to change the type of variables in the future, if necessary.

    6. Removing redundant computations and unnecessary iterations over the same data: This would improve the running time of the program.

    7. Using `unordered_map` and `unordered_set`: These data structures have faster average access times than `map` and `set`.

    8. Using return value optimization (RVO) or named return value optimization (NRVO): These compiler optimizations can eliminate unnecessary copy or move operations, improving performance.

4. Optimized Code Block: Please find the optimized code block below.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> involve;

vector<int> dfs2(int now, vector<bool>& used) {
  if (used[now]) return vector<int>{};
  used[now] = true;
  vector<int> ans;
  ans.reserve(involve[now].size());
  for (auto i : involve[now]) {
    if (!involve[i].empty()) {
      auto a = dfs2(i, used);
      ans.insert(ans.end(), a.begin(), a.end());
    } else {
      ans.emplace_back(i);
    }
  }
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  while (true) {
    int num = 0;
    unordered_map<string, int> mp;
    unordered_set<int> ed;
    int N;
    cin >> N;
    if (!N) break;
    involve.clear();
    involve.resize(100000);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      string st;
      cin >> st;
      string groupname;
      vector<string> membername;
      int pre;
      for (int j = 0; j < st.size(); ++j) {
        if (st[j] == ':') {
          groupname = st.substr(0, j);
          pre = j;
        } else if (st[j] == ',' || st[j] == '.') {
          membername.push_back(st.substr(pre + 1, j - pre - 1));
          pre = j;
        }
      }
      if (!mp.count(groupname)) {
        mp[groupname] = num++;
      }
      for (auto& name : membername) {
        if (!mp.count(name)) {
          mp[name] = num++;
        }
      }
      for (auto& name : membername) {
        involve[mp[groupname]].emplace_back(mp[name]);
        ed.emplace(mp[name]);
      }
    }
    vector<bool> used(100001, false);
    auto allnames = dfs2(0, used);
    sort(allnames.begin(), allnames.end());
    const int ans = unique(allnames.begin(), allnames.end()) - allnames.begin();
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should significantly improve the performance of the code without changing its functionality. However, there might be some trade-offs, such as increased code complexity and potential readability issues due to the use of `auto` and `emplace_back`.
