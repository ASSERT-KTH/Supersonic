**Code Analysis**

This C++ program implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which is used to find the shortest path from a given source vertex to all other vertices in the graph. The algorithm is widely used in networking to implement routing protocols. However, the Bellman-Ford algorithm has a time complexity of O(V*E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, which can be a performance bottleneck for large graphs.

**Optimization Strategy**

1. **Reducing unnecessary object copies**: In the current implementation, an `edge` object is copied in every iteration of the inner loop. This can be avoided by using a reference to the object instead of copying it.

2. **Avoiding dynamic memory allocation**: `std::vector` is used to store the edges. However, the `push_back()` function can cause dynamic memory allocation and reallocation, which is expensive. As the maximum number of edges is known beforehand (MAX), we can use a fixed-size array to avoid dynamic memory allocation.

3. **Minimizing string concatenation**: The current implementation appends the result to a string (`ans`) in every iteration. String concatenation is expensive as it involves creating a new string and copying the old and new parts into it. Instead, we can directly output the result to `std::cout`.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **Reducing unnecessary object copies**: Instead of copying the `edge` object in every iteration of the inner loop, we can use a const reference to the object, which will avoid the copy operation and save memory and time.
   
2. **Avoiding dynamic memory allocation**: Instead of using `std::vector` to store the edges, we can use a fixed-size array. This way, all memory is allocated at once, avoiding the need for dynamic memory allocation and reallocation.

3. **Minimizing string concatenation**: Instead of appending the result to a string in each iteration, we can directly output the result to `std::cout`. This will avoid the expensive string concatenation operations.

**Optimized Code Block**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
#define MAX 100000
struct edge {
  int s, t, d;
};
edge edges[MAX];
int d[MAX];
int BellmanFord(int startVertex, int vNum, int eNum) {
  fill((int *)d, (d + MAX), __INT_MAX__);
  d[startVertex] = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    bool update = false;
    for (int j = 0; j < eNum; ++j) {
      const edge& e = edges[j];
      if (d[e.s] != __INT_MAX__ && d[e.t] > d[e.s] + e.d) {
        d[e.t] = d[e.s] + e.d;
        update = true;
        if (i == vNum - 1) {
          cout << "NEGATIVE CYCLE" << endl;
          return -1;
        }
      }
    }
    if (!update)
      break;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    if (i > 0)
      cout << " ";
    if (d[i] == __INT_MAX__) {
      cout << "INF";
    } else
      cout << d[i];
  }
  return 0;
}
int main() {
  int vNum, eNum;
  cin >> vNum >> eNum;
  int s, t, w;
  for (int i = 0; i < eNum; ++i) {
    cin >> s >> t >> w;
    edges[i] = {s, t, w};
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    if (BellmanFord(i, vNum, eNum) == -1) {
      return 0;
