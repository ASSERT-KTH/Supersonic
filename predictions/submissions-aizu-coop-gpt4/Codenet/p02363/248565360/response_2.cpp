**Code Analysis:**

The provided code implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which computes the shortest path from a single source to all other vertices in a weighted graph. The algorithm is known for its ability to handle graphs with negative weight cycles.

There are some potential performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the provided code:

1. The code uses a global vector to store the edges of the graph. This vector is not a part of the function that actually uses it, which can make maintenance and debugging more difficult.
2. The global variable `ans` is used to store the output, which can lead to unnecessary memory consumption and potential race conditions in a multi-threaded environment.
3. The algorithm makes unnecessary copies when it iterates through the edges. This can slow down the program, especially when the number of edges is large.
4. The loop for appending the distances to the answer string is separate from the main Bellman-Ford loop. These loops can be merged to avoid some extra iterations.
5. The fixed-size array `d[MAX]` can consume a lot of memory, especially when the actual number of vertices is much less than `MAX`.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. Move the `edges` vector into the `main` function and pass it as a parameter to the `BellmanFord` function to make the code more modular and to avoid unnecessary global variables.
2. Use a local string variable in the `BellmanFord` function to store the result, and return this string to the `main` function. This will reduce memory usage and make the function more self-contained.
3. Use a constant reference when iterating through the edges to avoid unnecessary copies.
4. Merge the loops for the Bellman-Ford algorithm and constructing the answer string.
5. Use a dynamic array for `d` to reduce memory usage.

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Optimized Code Block:**

1. Move the `edges` vector into the `main` function and pass it as a parameter to the `BellmanFord` function:

    This will make the code more modular and easier to maintain. It will also avoid the use of a global variable, which can lead to problems in larger programs or in multi-threaded environments.

    ```cpp
    int BellmanFord(int startVertex, int vNum, const vector<edge>& edges) {
        // ...
    }

    int main() {
        // ...
        vector<edge> edges;
        // ...
    }
    ```

2. Use a local string variable in the `BellmanFord` function to store the result:

    This will reduce memory usage and make the function more self-contained. This also avoids potential race conditions in case the function is used in a multi-threaded environment.

    ```cpp
    int BellmanFord(int startVertex, int vNum, const vector<edge>& edges, string& ans) {
        // ...
        for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
            // ...
            ans.append(to_string(d[i]));
        }
        return 0;
    }
    ```

3. Use a constant reference when iterating through the edges:

    This will avoid unnecessary copies, which can slow down the program when the number of edges is large.

    ```cpp
    for (const edge& e : edges) {
        // ...
    }
    ```

4. Merge the loops for the Bellman-Ford algorithm and constructing the answer string:

    This will avoid some unnecessary iterations, making the program faster.

    ```cpp
    for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
        // ...
        ans.append((d[i] == __INT_MAX__) ? "INF" : to_string(d[i]));
        if (i < vNum - 1) ans.append(" ");
    }
    ```

5. Use a dynamic array for `d`:

    This will reduce memory usage when the actual number of vertices is much less than `MAX`.

    ```cpp
    int* d = new int[vNum];
    // ...
    delete[] d;
    ```
