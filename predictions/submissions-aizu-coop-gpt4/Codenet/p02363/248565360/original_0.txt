**Code Analysis**

This code implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a single starting vertex to all other vertices in a weighted, directed graph. It reads the graph from the input, calls the BellmanFord function for each vertex, and prints out the shortest paths. The BellmanFord function also checks for negative cycles in the graph.

**Optimization Strategy**

1. **Data structures**: The current data structure for storing edges is a vector of structs. This is not the most efficient data structure for this purpose. A more efficient alternative would be to use an adjacency list representation, which could be implemented with a vector of vectors of pairs. Each pair would represent an edge and its weight.

2. **Redundant computations**: In the BellmanFord function, the code repeatedly checks if `d[e.s]` is not `__INT_MAX__`. This is redundant, because if `d[e.s]` is `__INT_MAX__`, then `d[e.t]` would not be greater than `d[e.s] + e.d`.

3. **Loops**: The BellmanFord function has a nested loop structure, which leads to a time complexity of O(VE). This cannot be improved because this is the best possible time complexity for the Bellman-Ford algorithm. However, the loop that appends the distances to the `ans` string is not necessary and can be removed by directly printing the distances.

4. **Compiler optimizations**: To speed up the execution, we can use the `-O2` or `-O3` flag when compiling the code. These flags will enable all optimization options, which will allow the compiler to make the code run faster. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **Change the data structure for storing edges**: Instead of storing the edges in a vector of structs, we can store them in a vector of vectors of pairs. This will allow us to access the edges more efficiently. In the BellmanFord function, we can then iterate over the edges directly from the adjacency list, instead of iterating over all edges for each vertex.

2. **Remove redundant computations**: In the BellmanFord function, we can remove the check if `d[e.s]` is not `__INT_MAX__`. This is redundant because if `d[e.s]` is `__INT_MAX__`, then `d[e.t]` would not be greater than `d[e.s] + e.d`.

3. **Remove the loop that appends distances to the `ans` string**: Instead of appending the distances to the `ans` string, we can print them directly. This will eliminate the need for the loop, and will also eliminate the need for the `ans` string.

4. **Use compiler optimizations**: When compiling the code, we can use the `-O2` or `-O3` flag to enable all optimization options. This will allow the compiler to make the code run faster.

**Trade-offs**

The main trade-off is that by using an adjacency list representation for the graph, the code becomes slightly more complex. However, the performance gain in terms of speed and memory usage outweighs this increase in complexity.

**Optimized Code Block**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits.h>
using namespace std;
#define MAX 100000

vector<vector<pair<int,int>>> adjList(MAX);

int BellmanFord(int startVertex, int vNum) {
  vector<int> d(MAX, INT_MAX);
  d[startVertex] = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    bool update = false;
    for (auto &edge : adjList[startVertex]) {
      int v = edge.first, w = edge.second;
      if (d[v] > d[startVertex] + w) {
        d[v] = d[startVertex] + w;
        update = true;
        if (i == vNum - 1) {
          cout << "NEGATIVE CYCLE" << endl;
          return -1;
        }
      }
    }
    if (!update)
      break;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    if (i > 0)
      cout << " ";
    if (d[i] == INT_MAX) {
      cout << "INF";
    } else
      cout << d[i];
  }
  cout << endl;
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  int vNum, eNum;
  cin >> vNum >> eNum;
  int s, t, w;
  for (int i = 0; i < eNum; ++i) {
    cin >> s >> t >> w;
    adjList[s].push_back({t, w});
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    if (BellmanFord(i, vNum) == -1) {
      return 0;
    }
  }
}
