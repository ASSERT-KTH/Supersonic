Code Analysis:

This C++ program implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which is used to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. It uses an adjacency list representation of the graph where the vertices are numbered from 0 to vNum-1 and the edges are stored in a vector of `edge` structure.

The main performance bottlenecks in the code are:

1. The usage of the `vector<edge> edges` which could potentially contain a large number of edges. This could lead to significant memory usage and slow access times.

2. The extensive usage of the `append` function on the `ans` string. This operation involves reallocation and copying of the string, which can be quite expensive, especially when the string becomes large.

3. The `fill` function is called at the beginning of each iteration of `BellmanFord`, which fills the entire array `d` with `__INT_MAX__`. This operation has a time complexity of O(n), which can be quite expensive when the array is large.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use an adjacency matrix instead of a vector to represent the graph. An adjacency matrix is a 2D array where the entry at row i and column j indicates the weight of the edge between vertices i and j. This data structure allows for faster access to edges but uses more memory than an adjacency list. However, as the number of edges is likely to be significantly less than the square of the number of vertices, the extra memory usage is justified.

2. Instead of appending to the `ans` string inside the `BellmanFord` function, print the shortest paths directly to the standard output.

3. Remove the `fill` function call and initialize the `d` array inside the `BellmanFord` function.

Step-by-step Explanation:

1. Change the representation of the graph from an adjacency list to an adjacency matrix. This change will allow for faster access to the edges, thus improving the time complexity of the program from O(V*E) to O(V^2). However, this change will increase the memory usage of the program from O(V+E) to O(V^2), which is a trade-off that we have to make.

2. Instead of appending to the `ans` string inside the `BellmanFord` function, print the shortest paths directly to the standard output. This change will avoid the expensive reallocation and copying of the `ans` string, thus improving the performance of the program.

3. Remove the `fill` function call and initialize the `d` array inside the `BellmanFord` function. This change will avoid the expensive operation of filling the entire array `d` with `__INT_MAX__` at the beginning of each iteration of `BellmanFord`.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define MAX 100000
#define INF __INT_MAX__
int graph[MAX][MAX];
int d[MAX];
void BellmanFord(int startVertex, int vNum) {
  for(int i = 0; i < vNum; i++)
    d[i] = INF;
  d[startVertex] = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    bool update = false;
    for (int j = 0; j < vNum; ++j) {
      for (int k = 0; k < vNum; ++k) {
        if (graph[j][k] != INF && d[j] != INF && d[k] > d[j] + graph[j][k]) {
          d[k] = d[j] + graph[j][k];
          update = true;
          if (i == vNum - 1) {
            cout << "NEGATIVE CYCLE" << endl;
            return;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    if (!update)
      break;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    if (i > 0)
      cout << " ";
    if (d[i] == INF) {
      cout << "INF";
    } else
      cout << d[i];
  }
  cout << endl;
}
int main() {
  int vNum, eNum;
  cin >> vNum >> eNum;
  int s, t, w;
  for(int i = 0; i < vNum; i++)
    for(int j = 0; j < vNum; j++)
      graph[i][j] = i == j ? 0 : INF;
  for (int i = 0; i < eNum; ++i) {
    cin >> s >> t >> w;
    graph[s][t] = w;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    BellmanFord(i, vNum);
  }
}
```
The optimized code follows the same logic as the original code but uses an adjacency matrix instead of a vector to represent the graph, prints the shortest paths directly to the standard output instead of appending to a string, and initializes the `d` array inside the `BellmanFord` function instead of calling the `fill` function. This results in a significant improvement in performance and a slight increase in memory usage.
