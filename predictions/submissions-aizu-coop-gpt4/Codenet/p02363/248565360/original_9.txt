1. Code Analysis:
   The given code implements Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path from each vertex to all other vertices in a graph. The graph is represented by a list of edges, each containing a start vertex, end vertex, and weight. It checks for negative cycles, and if found, terminates the program.

   Potential performance bottlenecks are:
   - The algorithm has a time complexity of O(|V|.|E|) which is quadratic for dense graphs. 
   - A lot of time is spent in copying edge objects which is unnecessary.
   - The code appends to a string in a loop, which is inefficient operation in terms of time complexity, as it can lead to multiple reallocations and copies.
   - The size of the d array is fixed at MAX, which can lead to wastage of memory if the number of vertices is significantly less than MAX.
   
2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Use pointers to avoid copying of edge objects.
   - Replace the string append operation with a more efficient method.
   - Use dynamic memory allocation for the d array.
   - Use inline functions and compiler optimizations for better performance.
  
3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   - Instead of copying the edge object in the BellmanFord function, we can use a pointer to iterate over the edges. This will save time as we avoid object copying.
   - Instead of appending to the string 'ans' in a loop, we can use an ostringstream which is faster as it avoids multiple reallocations and copies.
   - Instead of a fixed size array 'd', we can use a vector which is dynamically allocated. This will save memory as we only allocate as much memory as we need.
   - We can use inline functions for small, frequently used functions like the BellmanFord function for better performance.
   - We can use compiler optimizations like -O3, which enables all optimization flags, including inline functions.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;
struct edge {
  int s, t, d;
};

vector<edge> edges;
ostringstream ans;
vector<int> d;

inline int BellmanFord(int startVertex, int vNum, int eNum) {
  fill(d.begin(), d.end(), __INT_MAX__);
  d[startVertex] = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    bool update = false;
    for (int j = 0; j < eNum; ++j) {
      edge* e = &edges[j];
      if (d[e->s] != __INT_MAX__ && d[e->t] > d[e->s] + e->d) {
        d[e->t] = d[e->s] + e->d;
        update = true;
        if (i == vNum - 1) {
          cout << "NEGATIVE CYCLE" << endl;
          return -1;
        }
      }
    }
    if (!update)
      break;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    if (i > 0)
      ans << " ";
    if (d[i] == __INT_MAX__) {
      ans << "INF";
    } else
      ans << d[i];
  }
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  int vNum, eNum;
  cin >> vNum >> eNum;
  int s, t, w;
  d.resize(vNum);
  for (int i = 0; i < eNum; ++i) {
    cin >> s >> t >> w;
    edges.push_back({s, t, w});
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    if (BellmanFord(i, vNum, eNum) == -1) {
      return 0;
    }
    ans << "\n";
  }
  cout << ans.str();
}
```
Note: This optimized code should be compiled with -O3 flag for best performance.
