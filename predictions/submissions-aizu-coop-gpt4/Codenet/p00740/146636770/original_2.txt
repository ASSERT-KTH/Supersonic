The provided code seems to be a simulation of some game, where stones are distributed into different bowls, and the aim is to find the bowl that will contain the same number of stones as the initial total. However, there are a few performance bottlenecks:

1. Redundant Initialization: The array stone[] is initialized with 0 in a loop, which is not necessary in C++ as we can directly initialize the array to 0 during declaration.
2. Unnecessary Computations: The nested loops at the end of the code perform a calculation with no effect on the output or any other part of the program. This adds unnecessary computational overhead.
3. Inefficient Looping: The main loop continues indefinitely until the program is terminated manually. This can be optimized to end when there's no more input.

## Optimization Strategy

1. Array Initialization: We can initialize the array stone[] to 0 during declaration to eliminate the need for the initialization loop.
2. Remove Unnecessary Computations: We can eliminate the nested loops at the end of the code, as it doesn't contribute to the output.
3. Loop Optimization: We can use the termination condition (n == 0 && p == 0) to control the main loop, instead of using an infinite loop.

Here's the optimized code with these improvements:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int n, p;
  while (cin >> n >> p && (n != 0 || p != 0)) {
    int stone[50] = {0};
    int bowl = p;
    bool flg = true;
    int ans;
    for (int i = 0; flg; i = (i + 1) % n) {
      if (bowl == 0) {
        bowl += stone[i];
        stone[i] = 0;
      } else {
        stone[i]++;
        bowl--;
        if (bowl == 0 && stone[i] == p) {
          ans = i;
          flg = false;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This code preserves the functionality of the original program, but with improved efficiency. The initialization of stone[] is more efficient, the computational overhead has been reduced by removing the unnecessary computations, and the program terminates when there's no more input.
