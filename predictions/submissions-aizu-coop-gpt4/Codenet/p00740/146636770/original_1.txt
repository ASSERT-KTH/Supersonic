Code Analysis:
Looking at the provided code, we can see several parts that might be optimized for better performance. 

1. The array 'stone' is always initialized to zero at the start of each iteration of the infinite while loop. This can be optimized by moving the declaration and initialization outside the loop.

2. The nested loop at the end of the while loop appears to be useless and can be removed. If it is for delay purposes, it's better to use a real time delay function.

3. The 'flg' variable is being checked in each iteration of the inner for loop. If we can eliminate this check, we can improve the performance of the loop.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Move the initialization of the 'stone' array outside the infinite loop.

2. Remove the nested loop at the end of the while loop.

3. Replace the 'flg' variable with a break statement inside the for loop.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. By moving the initialization of the 'stone' array out of the loop, we avoid the repetitive process of declaring and initializing the array in each iteration. This can significantly reduce memory usage and improve the runtime.

2. The nested loop at the end of the while loop doesn't have any effect on the program's output. Removing it will significantly improve the runtime performance.

3. We can replace the 'flg' variable with a break statement inside the for loop. This eliminates the need to check the 'flg' variable in each iteration, improving the performance of the loop. The 'break' statement will exit the loop as soon as the condition is met.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  int stone[50] = {0};
  int bowl, n, p, ans;
  while (1) {
    cin >> n >> p;
    if(n == 0 && p == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    bowl = p;
    for (int i = 0; ; i = (i + 1) % n) {
      if (bowl == 0) {
        bowl = bowl + stone[i];
        stone[i] = 0;
      } else {
        stone[i]++;
        bowl--;
        if (bowl == 0 && stone[i] == p) {
          ans = i;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

Please note that if the 'stone' array needs to be reinitialized to zero in every loop iteration, then the initialization inside the while loop is necessary and cannot be optimized away.
