Code Analysis:
The program seems to be a simulation of a game where stones are moved between a bowl and an array of stones, until a certain condition is met. However, there is a redundant nested loop that performs a meaningless operation, which would take a significant amount of time due to its size.

Optimization Strategy:
1. We can reduce the size of the `stone` array to `n`, since `n` is the upper bound of its index. This will reduce the memory usage.
2. The loop for initializing `stone` array can be replaced with a function `std::fill_n`, which will be more efficient.
3. The nested loops where `k = i + j` are completely unnecessary as the variable `k` isn't used anywhere else. Removing these loops will drastically improve the running time.
4. The `flg` variable is used to control the loop for stone moving. Instead of using it, we can use a `break` statement to exit the loop when the condition is met.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Reduce array size: The `stone` array is of fixed size 50, but the actual size used is `n`, which is input by the user. By reducing the array size to `n`, we can save memory.
2. Use `std::fill_n`: The loop for initializing `stone` array can be replaced with `std::fill_n(stone, n, 0)`. This function sets the first `n` elements of `stone` array to zero. It can be more efficient than a loop because it can take advantage of specific platform optimizations.
3. Remove unnecessary loops: The nested loops where `k = i + j` perform a calculation that doesn't affect the program's output. Removing these loops will greatly reduce the running time.
4. Use `break` statement: Instead of using a flag variable to control the loop for stone moving, we can use a `break` statement to exit the loop when the condition is met. This makes the code easier to understand and may be slightly more efficient.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>  // for std::fill_n
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  while (true) {
    int n, p;
    cin >> n >> p;
    if (n == 0 && p == 0) {
      return 0;
    }

    int stone[n];
    std::fill_n(stone, n, 0);
    int bowl = p;
    int ans;

    for (int i = 0; ; i = (i + 1) % n) {
      if (bowl == 0) {
        bowl += stone[i];
        stone[i] = 0;
      } else {
        stone[i]++;
        bowl--;
        if (bowl == 0 && stone[i] == p) {
          ans = i;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
Note: This code uses Variable Length Array (VLA) which is not a standard C++ feature. If you're not allowed to use it, you can replace `int stone[n];` with `vector<int> stone(n, 0);` and include `<vector>`.
