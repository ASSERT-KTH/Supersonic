**Code Analysis**

The provided code snippet seems to be a problem-solving algorithm. The major performance bottlenecks in the code are:

1. Unnecessary initialization of the array 'stone' in every iteration of the while loop.
2. The nested loops at the end of the while loop, which do a large number of iterations (1,000,000 * 1,000,000) for a simple addition operation without utilizing the result.
3. The boolean flag 'flg' used to control the for loop which could be optimized.
4. The use of 'cin' for input which is slower compared to other methods.

**Optimization Strategy**

1. Move the initialization of the 'stone' array outside the while loop. Since all elements are set to 0 in each iteration, this operation is redundant and can be done once.
2. Remove the unnecessary nested loops which are performing a simple addition operation 1 trillion (1,000,000 * 1,000,000) times without using the result.
3. Replace the 'flg' controlling the loop with a 'break' statement to exit the loop when the condition is met.
4. Use faster input methods instead of 'cin' for taking inputs.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. Move the 'stone' array initialization outside the while loop. The array is set to 0 in each iteration which is a redundant operation and can be done once. This reduces unnecessary memory write operations in each iteration.
2. The nested loops are doing a simple addition operation without using the result. This is a completely unnecessary operation and removing it will drastically improve the performance.
3. The 'flg' variable is used to control the loop. This is unnecessary as we can directly break the loop when the condition is met. This improves code readability and efficiency.
4. Instead of 'cin' for taking inputs, we can use 'scanf' which is faster. This will speed up the input process.

**Optimized Code Block**

The optimized code, with the above optimizations incorporated, would look like:

```C++
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int stone[50] = {0}; // Initialize the array outside the loop
  int bowl, n, p, ans;
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &p); // Replace cin with scanf
    if (n == 0 && p == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    bowl = p;
    for (int i = 0;; i = (i + 1) % n) { // Removed flg variable
      if (bowl == 0) {
        bowl = bowl + stone[i];
        stone[i] = 0;
      } else {
        stone[i]++;
        bowl--;
        if (bowl == 0 && stone[i] == p) {
          ans = i;
          break; // Replace flg with break
        }
      }
    }
    // Removed unnecessary nested loops
    printf("%d\n", ans); // Replace cout with printf
  }
}
```

In this optimized code, we have removed unnecessary operations and used faster input/output methods, hence improving the overall efficiency of the program.
