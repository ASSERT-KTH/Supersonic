Code Analysis:
1. The first loop initializes an array of 50 integers to zero. This is inefficient because the array is reinitialized with each iteration of the outer infinite loop.
2. There is an unnecessary nested loop that does nothing but increment a variable. This is a significant performance drain.
3. The second loop has a boolean flag that is checked in each iteration, which could be replaced with a break statement for better performance.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Move the array initialization outside the infinite while loop to avoid redundant initializations.
2. Remove the unnecessary nested loop as it does nothing but increment a variable.
3. Replace the boolean flag with a break statement in the second loop.
4. Use pre-increment (++i) instead of post-increment (i++) in the for loop, as pre-increment is faster.
5. Replace the two cin statements with a single cin statement, separated by an and operator, to reduce the number of system calls.

Optimized Code Block:
```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int stone[50];
  for (int k = 0; k < 50; k++) {
    stone[k] = 0;
  }
  while (1) {
    int bowl;
    int n, p;
    if (!(cin >> n >> p) || (n == 0 && p == 0)) {
      return 0;
    }
    bowl = p;
    int ans;
    for (int i = 0; ; i = (i + 1) % n) {
      if (bowl == 0) {
        bowl = bowl + stone[i];
        stone[i] = 0;
      } else {
        ++stone[i];
        --bowl;
        if (bowl == 0 && stone[i] == p) {
          ans = i;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
Explanation:
1. The initialization of the array is moved outside the infinite while loop because the array values are reset at the start of each iteration, and this is unnecessary.
2. The nested loop was removed because it served no purpose and was a significant performance drain.
3. The boolean flag was replaced with a break statement, which improves performance by eliminating the need to check the flag on each iteration.
4. The pre-increment operator is used instead of the post-increment operator, as the former is faster.
5. The two separate cin statements were replaced with a single statement, reducing the number of system calls. This optimizes the code by reducing the time needed to interact with the system.
