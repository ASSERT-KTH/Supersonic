1. Code Analysis:

The given code reads three integer inputs from the standard input. It then checks all integers between `a` and `b` (inclusive) to see if `c` is divisible by each of these integers. If `c` is divisible, it increments the variable `t`. At the end, it prints the value of `t` to the standard output.

Potential performance bottlenecks:
- The loop from `a` to `b` could be a performance bottleneck if `a` and `b` are far apart because it iterates over every integer between `a` and `b`. 

Inefficient memory usage:
- The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `s`, and `t` are all declared at the beginning of the program but `t` is not initialized. This could potentially lead to a bug if `t` is not set to zero before it's used.

2. Optimization Strategy:

1. Change the for loop to start from max(1, a) instead of `a` to avoid division by zero.
2. Initialize `t` to zero at the start to avoid any garbage value.
3. Use prefix increment (++t) instead of postfix (t++) as it's generally faster in C++ as it avoids temporary object creation.
4. Avoid flushing the output buffer unnecessarily by removing `endl` and replacing it with '\n'.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Start the loop from max(1, a) instead of `a` to avoid division by zero. This can be done using the max function from the algorithm library in C++. This will prevent the code from crashing if `a` is zero.
2. Initialize `t` to zero at the start. This is important because `t` is not initialized, which means it could contain any value, leading to incorrect results.
3. Use prefix increment instead of postfix. The reason is that the postfix increment involves a little more work for the compiler â€“ it needs to increment the value of `t` but return the original value, so it must make a copy.
4. Replace `endl` with '\n'. `endl` not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output buffer, which can be slower.

Trade-offs: These optimizations should not introduce any significant trade-offs. The code remains equally readable and correct, but runs more efficiently.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b, c, s, t = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  
  for (s = max(1, a); s <= b; s++) {
    if (c % s == 0) {
      ++t;
    }
  }
  
  cout << t << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
This code has the same functionality as the original one, but it's more efficient and less prone to bugs.
