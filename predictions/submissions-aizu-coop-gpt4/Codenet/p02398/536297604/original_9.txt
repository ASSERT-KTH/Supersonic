1. Code Analysis:
This is a simple program that counts how many factors a number 'c' has in the range from 'a' to 'b'. A key area for optimization is the loop from 'a' to 'b', which checks for divisibility. The modulo operation is quite expensive, and the loop potentially runs many times.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Inefficient Data Structures: There are no complex data structures in use here, so this point doesn't apply.
    2. Redundant Computations: The modulo operation inside the loop is expensive and can be optimized.
    3. Loops: The loop from 'a' to 'b' can be optimized.
    4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations can be used to further optimize the code.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Loop Optimization: Instead of starting the loop from 'a' and going up to 'b', it's more efficient to start from 1 and go up to the square root of 'c'. This is because a larger number cannot divide a smaller one, and all factors of 'c' must be less than or equal to sqrt(c).
    2. Counting Factors: For each factor 'i' of 'c', there are two factors: 'i' and 'c/i'. We need to check if these factors are within the range from 'a' to 'b' and increment the counter 't' accordingly.
    3. Compiler Optimization: We can use the '-O2' or '-O3' compiler options to further optimize the code.

4. Trade-offs: The main trade-off here is a slight increase in code complexity in exchange for a significant improvement in performance. The optimized code might be a bit harder to understand at first glance, but the comments can help clarify its logic.

5. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath> // for sqrt function
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b, c, t = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;

  // Go up to the sqrt of c
  for (int s = 1; s * s <= c; s++) {
    if (c % s == 0) {
      // 's' is a factor of 'c'
      if (s >= a && s <= b) {
        t++;
      }
      // 'c/s' is another factor of 'c'
      if (s != c/s && c/s >= a && c/s <= b) {
        t++;
      }
    }
  }

  cout << t << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This code performs much better than the original, especially when 'b-a' is large and 'c' is a large number with many factors.
