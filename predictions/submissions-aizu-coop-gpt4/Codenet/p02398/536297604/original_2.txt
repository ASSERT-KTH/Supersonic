Analysis:

This is a simple program that reads three integers (a, b, c) from the console and counts how many numbers between a and b (inclusive) are divisors of c. It outputs this count.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient data structures: This program does not use any data structures, so there are no inefficiencies in this regard.

2. Redundant computations: The variable 't' is incremented without being initialized first. This is a serious issue that can lead to undefined behavior. It is not necessarily a performance issue, but it needs to be corrected.

3. Loops or recursive calls: The loop from 'a' to 'b' can potentially be optimized, especially when 'a' is 1 and 'b' is a large number, and 'c' is also a large number. The modulo operation is not fast, especially for large numbers.

4. Compiler optimizations: It does not seem like there are many opportunities for compiler optimizations in this code. The loop cannot be unrolled as the number of iterations is not known at compile time. Pragma directives are also not applicable here.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Initialize 't' to zero. This is necessary to ensure correct results. This won't affect performance but is essential for correct operation.

2. To optimize the loop, we can limit the number of iterations. If 's' is a divisor of 'c', then 's' must be less than or equal to sqrt(c). Thus, we can limit the loop to min(b, sqrt(c)).

3. If 'a' or 'b' is less than 1, we should start the loop from 1 because 0 and negative numbers cannot be divisors.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b, c, s, t = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  a = max(1, a); // ensure a is not less than 1
  for (s = a; s <= min(b, (int)sqrt(c)); s++) {
    if (c % s == 0) {
      t++;
      if(s != c / s && c / s >= a && c / s <= b) t++; // check if the pair divisor falls within the range
    }
  }
  cout << t << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we limit the loop to sqrt(c) and capture both divisors (s and c/s) within the loop. This way, we reduce the number of iterations and modulo operations, especially for large numbers. We also ensure that 't' is initialized to zero to prevent undefined behavior.
