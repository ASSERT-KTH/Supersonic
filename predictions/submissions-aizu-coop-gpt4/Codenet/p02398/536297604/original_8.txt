1. Code Analysis:
The given code block is a simple C++ program that reads three integers a, b, and c from the input. It then counts the number of integers s in the range [a, b] that divide c evenly. The result is printed to the standard output. The potential performance bottlenecks in the code are the for loop which iterates from a to b and the modulus operation inside the loop.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. The current code is using basic data types and doesn't require any change in data structures.
   2. The variable `t` is not initialized before being used. This could lead to unpredictable behavior or incorrect results. Initializing `t` to 0 before the loop should solve this problem.
   3. The loop could be optimized if we know that `a` and `b` are relatively small and `c` is a large number. Instead of checking every single number in the range [a, b] to see if it divides `c`, we could check only the divisors of `c` in that range, which could be significantly fewer.
   4. There are no recursive calls in this program, so no tail recursion or other recursion optimization is needed. Loop unrolling does not seem beneficial in this case as the loop body is already quite small.
   5. Compiler optimizations are generally specified outside of the code, in the build system or command line parameters. For instance, using `-O2` or `-O3` optimization levels in GCC or Clang could lead to performance improvements. However, these optimizations should be used with care, as they might sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Initialize `t` to zero: This will ensure that we are counting from a known value and not from an uninitialized variable.
   2. Instead of iterating over the range [a, b], iterate over the divisors of `c` and count the ones that fall in the range [a, b]. This could be significantly faster if `a` and `b` are small and `c` is a large number.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b, c, t = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt(c); i++) {
    if (c % i == 0) {
      // Check if divisors are in range [a, b]
      if (a <= i && i <= b) {
        t++;
      }
      // Except when c is a perfect square
      int quotient = c / i;
      if (a <= quotient && quotient <= b && quotient != i) {
        t++;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << t << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This code will run faster than the original version when `c` is a large number and `a` and `b` are relatively small. However, note that this optimization might make the code slower if `c` is small and `a` and `b` are large. Always make sure to understand the expected input ranges and trade-offs before applying optimizations.
