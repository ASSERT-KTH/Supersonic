# Code Analysis
The given C++ program reads three integer inputs a, b, and c, and counts the number of integers between a and b (inclusive) that divide c without a remainder. The program then prints this count. The potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient usage of memory in this code are:

1. The variable `t` is not initialized before its usage. This means that the value of `t` is undefined before it's incremented, which can lead to unpredictable results.

2. The loop that iterates from `a` to `b` and performs a modulo operation each time can be a performance bottleneck if `b - a` is large.

# Optimization Strategy
1. Initialize the variable `t` to zero before we use it.

2. Minimize the number of iterations by skipping the numbers which can't be a divisor of `c`. If a number `n` is a divisor of `c`, then `n` must be less than or equal to `sqrt(c)`. This is because a larger factor of `c` must be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been encountered.

3. Use `sqrt` function from `cmath` library for calculating square root.

# Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Initialize `t` to 0: This is necessary to avoid undefined behavior in the program. The count of divisors should start at 0.

2. Use `sqrt` function to limit iterations: We know that a larger factor of `c` must be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been encountered. For example, if `c` is 36, its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. We see that divisors greater than `sqrt(36)` are just multiples of divisors less than `sqrt(36)`. So, we only need to iterate up to `sqrt(c)`.

3. Count divisors greater than `sqrt(c)`: While counting the divisors less than or equal to `sqrt(c)`, if `c` is divisible by the current number, increment `t` by 1. If `c` divided by the current number is also a divisor and it's greater than `sqrt(c)`, increment `t` by 1 again.

# Trade-offs
The optimized solution has a greater code complexity. However, it offers a significant performance improvement, especially when `b - a` is large, by reducing the number of iterations and computations.

# Optimized Code Block
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b, c, t = 0;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;
    int limit = min(b, (int)sqrt(c));
    for (int s = a; s <= limit; s++) {
        if (c % s == 0) {
            t++;
            if (c / s != s && c / s <= b) {
                t++;
            }
        }
    }
    cout << t << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This optimized code block initializes `t`, reduces the number of iterations by iterating only up to `sqrt(c)`, and properly counts the divisors that are greater than `sqrt(c)`.
