**Code Analysis:**

The code takes three integers as input. It runs a loop from `a` to `b` (both inclusive) and checks if `c` is divisible by each number in this range. If `c` is divisible, it increments a counter `t`. At the end, it prints the count.

Potential performance bottlenecks:
1. The loop from `a` to `b` can be a performance issue if `b - a` is a large number.
2. The division operation inside the loop is expensive in terms of CPU cycles.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. Reduce the number of checks in the loop: Instead of starting the loop from `a`, we can start it from the maximum of `a` and `2`. The rationale behind this is that all numbers are divisible by `1`, so this check is not necessary. Also, there are no numbers between `1` and `2`, so we can safely start from `2` (if `a` is less than `2`).

2. Use bitwise operator for division check: We can replace the division operation with a bitwise operation to check if a number is divisible by another. Bitwise operations are faster than arithmetic operations.

3. Initialize `t` before use: In the original code, `t` was not initialized. This can lead to undefined behavior in C++.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Change the loop initialization from `s = a` to `s = max(a, 2)`. Since all numbers are divisible by `1` and there are no numbers between `1` and `2`, we can safely start from `2` if `a` is less than `2`. This reduces the number of iterations of the loop.

2. Replace `c % s == 0` with `(c & (s - 1)) == 0` to use faster bitwise operation instead of division operation. This speeds up each iteration of the loop.

3. Initialize `t` to `0` before using it to avoid undefined behavior.

**Trade-offs:**

1. The bitwise operation `(c & (s - 1)) == 0` only works correctly if `s` is a power of `2`. If `s` is not a power of `2`, it will give incorrect results. So, this optimization is not applicable in this case.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b, c, s, t = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  for (s = max(a, 2); s <= b; s++) {
    if (c % s == 0) {
      t++;
    }
  }
  cout << t << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, the number of iterations of the loop is reduced by starting from `max(a, 2)` instead of `a`. Also, `t` is initialized to `0` before use to avoid undefined behavior.
