1. **Code Analysis:**

This simple C++ program takes three inputs (a, b, c) and counts the number of integers between a and b (inclusive) that are divisors of c. 

Potential performance bottleneck:

- The main performance bottleneck is the for loop, which runs from a to b. This loop has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the difference between b and a.

Inefficient memory usage:

- All variables are used efficiently, and there's no significant memory wastage.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**

   A. Inefficient data structures: The code doesn't actually use any data structures, so there's no scope for optimization in this area.

   B. Redundant computations: The code doesn't have any redundant computations. 

   C. Loops or recursive calls: The loop is a potential area for optimization. However, because this loop does not involve any complex computations, techniques like loop unrolling would likely not offer significant improvements. 

   D. Compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations could help to some extent. For example, we could use the `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flag when compiling the program. 

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

There's no much scope to optimize this code, but we can do minor improvements:

   1. Initialize the count variable 't' to 0. The program currently does not initialize 't', which might lead to undefined behavior.
   2. Use prefix increment (++t) instead of postfix (t++) as it's generally faster in C++, although in this case, as 't' is a primitive data type, the compiler usually optimizes this.
   
Trade-offs: 

- These optimizations do not entail any significant trade-offs.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b, c, s, t = 0; // initialize 't' to 0
  cin >> a >> b >> c;

  for (s = a; s <= b; s++) {
    if (c % s == 0) {
      ++t; // use prefix increment
    }
  }
  
  cout << t << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Remember to use the `-O2` or `-O3` flag when compiling the program for additional performance gains. For example, you could use `g++ -O2 program.cpp` to compile the program.
