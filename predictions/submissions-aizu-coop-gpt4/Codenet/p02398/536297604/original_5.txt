**1. Code Analysis:**

The given C++ program takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It then iterates over the range from a to b (both inclusive), checks whether c is divisible by each of these numbers, and increments a counter t if it is. The final count is then printed. 

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient usage of resources include:

- The variable 't' is not initialized before it is used. This might lead to undefined behavior, as 't' may contain any value before it's first usage.
- The loop runs from 'a' to 'b', regardless of the values of these variables. For large ranges, this can significantly slow down the program.
- The modulus operation is computationally expensive, especially within a loop.

**2. Optimization Strategy:**

- Initialize the variable 't' to zero before usage. This will avoid undefined behavior.
- Limit the range of the loop. If 'c' is smaller than 'a', we don't need to iterate from 'a' to 'b'. We can iterate from 'a' to 'c' instead. Similarly, if 'c' is smaller than 'b', we can iterate from 'a' to 'c'.
- Replace the modulus operation with a comparison operation where possible. 

**3. Step-by-step Explanation:**

- Initializing 't' to zero before usage avoids unpredictable results and ensures that the counter starts from zero.
- By limiting the range of the loop, we dramatically reduce the number of iterations for cases where 'c' is much smaller than 'b'. 
- Replacing the modulus operation with a comparison operation, where possible, reduces the computational cost, as comparison operations are generally faster than modulus operations.

**4. Optimized Code Block:**

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b, c, s, t = 0;  // initialize 't' to zero
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  int limit = min(b, c);  // compute the upper limit for the loop
  for (s = a; s <= limit; s++) {
    if (c != 0 && c < s)  // replace modulus with comparison where possible
      break;
    else if (c % s == 0)
      t++;
  }
  cout << t << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code preserves the functionality of the original program: it counts the number of divisors of 'c' from 'a' to 'b'. It is more efficient due to the reduced range of the loop and the replacement of a modulus operation with a comparison operation.
