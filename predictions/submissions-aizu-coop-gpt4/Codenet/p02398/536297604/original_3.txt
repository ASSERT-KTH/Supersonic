Code Analysis:
The provided code is a simple C++ program that reads three integers (a, b, c), and counts the number of integers between 'a' and 'b' (inclusive) that divide 'c' without leaving a remainder. 

The performance bottleneck lies in the for-loop, which iterates from 'a' to 'b' and checks if 'c' is divisible by each number in that range. This results in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the difference between 'b' and 'a'. 

Another issue is that the variable 't' is not initialized. This can lead to unpredictable behavior since 't' could contain any value present at its memory location before it's assigned a value in the program. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. A more efficient algorithm can be implemented to reduce the time complexity. However, since the problem is directly related to the input size and there's no apparent pattern or redundancy to exploit, the only optimization could be achieved through parallel computing which might complicate the code and require additional resources.

2. Initialize the variable 't' to 0 to avoid any unpredictable behavior.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Initializing the variable 't' to 0: This is a crucial step as it ensures that 't' starts counting from 0. If 't' is not initialized, it may start with any garbage value, and the final count would then be incorrect.

Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b, c, s, t = 0; // Initialize 't' to 0
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  
  // Loop from 'a' to 'b' and check if 'c' is divisible by the current number
  for (s = a; s <= b; s++) {
    if (c % s == 0) {
      t++;
    }
  }
  
  cout << t << endl; // Print the count
  return 0;
}
```

Note: As mentioned before, due to the nature of the problem, significant optimization cannot be achieved without resorting to techniques like parallel computing. Depending on the specific use case and the typical range of values for 'a', 'b', and 'c', it might be more feasible to optimize this code by adjusting the algorithm itself rather than focusing on low-level optimizations.
