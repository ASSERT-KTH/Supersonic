Code Analysis:
The provided code is a C++ program that reads a number z from the user input and then calculates the maximum value of the sum of cubes of two numbers x and y, where x and y are positive integers and their cubes are less than or equal to the cube of z. The result is the difference between the cube of z and the calculated maximum sum.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Data Structures: The data structures used in this code are efficient enough for this task. However, the usage of variables can be improved.

2. Redundant Computations: The calculation `z * z * z` is repeated multiple times in the code. Instead of recalculating it each time, we can store it in a variable and use that.

3. Loops: The nested loop structure is a major performance bottleneck. In its current form, the time complexity is O(n^2), which can be quite slow for large inputs. However, this cannot be optimized without changing the logic of the program.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler flags to improve the performance of the program.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Store the cube of z in a variable: Instead of calculating `z * z * z` in each loop and again at the end of the program, we can calculate it once and store it in a variable. This change reduces redundant computations and improves performance.

2. Use Compiler Optimizations: We can use the `-O3` compiler flag to enable a set of optimizations that increase execution speed.

Trade-offs: The optimization steps proposed are straightforward and do not entail any significant trade-offs. The functionality of the code remains unchanged, and the code complexity is not increased.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll z;
  while (cin >> z && z) {
    ll ans = 0;
    ll zCubed = z * z * z;  // Store the cube of z in a variable
    for (ll x = 1; x * x * x <= zCubed; x++)
      for (ll y = 1; y * y * y + x * x * x <= zCubed; y++)
        ans = max(ans, x * x * x + y * y * y);
    cout << zCubed - ans << endl;  // Use the stored value of z cubed
  }
}
```
This code should be compiled with `-O3` flag for the best performance:
```
g++ -O3 main.cpp
```
This flag tells the compiler to perform high-level optimizations such as function inlining, loop unrolling, and others. These can significantly increase the execution speed of the program.
