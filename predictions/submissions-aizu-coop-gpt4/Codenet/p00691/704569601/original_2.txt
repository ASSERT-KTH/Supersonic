Code Analysis:
The code calculates the maximum possible sum of cubes of two numbers x and y such that their sum is less than or equal to the cube of z. This computation is then subtracted from the cube of z in the main loop. This is done for each z inputted until a zero or non-numeric value is entered. The calculation is performed in a nested loop, which can be a significant performance bottleneck, especially for large values of z.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Redundant Computations: The cube of z is calculated multiple times in the code. This can be optimized by calculating it once and storing the result in a variable.

2. Inefficient Looping: The nested loop iterates from 1 to cube root of z for both x and y. We can optimize this by noting that for each fixed x, y should start from x instead of 1 as we know y < x will have been covered in previous iterations when x was y.

3. Function Optimization: The function `b_pow` is currently not used in the code. But if it was, it could be optimized. It currently uses a recursive approach to calculate power which results in repeated computations. This can be replaced by an iterative approach using binary exponentiation.

Steps to Optimization:

1. Remove the unused `b_pow` function.
2. Calculate `cube_z = z*z*z` once in each iteration and use the result in loop condition and output.
3. Change the start of the second loop to `x` instead of `1`. 

Trade-offs: 
The main trade-off in this optimization is the slight increase in code complexity due to the introduction of the `cube_z` variable and the change in the loop variables. However, this trade-off is justified by a significant improvement in performance.

Optimized Code:

Here is the optimized code following our proposed strategy:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll z;
  while (cin >> z && z) {
    ll ans = 0;
    ll cube_z = z * z * z;
    for (ll x = 1; x * x * x <= cube_z; x++)
      for (ll y = x; y * y * y + x * x * x <= cube_z; y++)
        ans = max(ans, x * x * x + y * y * y);
    cout << cube_z - ans << endl;
  }
}
```
This code will provide the same output as the original but with better performance.
