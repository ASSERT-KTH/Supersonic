Code Analysis:

The given C++ program is a simple application that accepts an input `z` and finds the maximum sum of cubes of two numbers `x` and `y` such that their sum is less than or equal to the cube of `z`. The difference between the cube of `z` and the maximum sum found is then printed out. 

In this code, there are a couple of performance bottlenecks:

1. The two nested loops that iterate over `x` and `y` are inefficient. These loops are using a brute-force approach to find the maximum sum of cubes, which results in a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the cube root of z.

2. The cube of a number is calculated repeatedly in the program - in the loop conditions as well as in the calculation of `ans`. This is an unnecessary computation that can be avoided.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Avoid repeated calculations: The cube of a number is calculated multiple times in the program. These calculations can be stored in variables to avoid repetition.

2. Loop optimization: Instead of starting from 1, y loop can start from x as we know that y should be equal to or greater than x to get the maximum sum. This will reduce the number of iterations.

3. Remove unnecessary function b_pow: The function `b_pow` is defined but not used in the program. This function can be removed.

Optimized Code Block:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll z;
  while (cin >> z && z) {
    ll ans = 0;
    ll z_cubed = z * z * z; // cube of z calculated once and stored in variable
    ll x, y;
    for (x = 1; x * x * x <= z_cubed; x++) {
      ll x_cubed = x * x * x; // cube of x calculated once and stored in variable
      for (y = x; y * y * y + x_cubed <= z_cubed; y++) { // y loop starts from x
        ll y_cubed = y * y * y; // cube of y calculated once and stored in variable
        ans = max(ans, x_cubed + y_cubed);
      }
    }
    cout << z_cubed - ans << endl;
  }
}
```

This optimized code should run faster and use less memory than the original version. The nested loops are more efficient, and the repeated calculation of cube of numbers has been avoided. The function `b_pow` that was not used in the program has been removed, resulting in cleaner code.
