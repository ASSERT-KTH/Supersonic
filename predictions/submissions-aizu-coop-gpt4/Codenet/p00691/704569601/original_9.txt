The above C++ code is computing the maximum sum of cubes of two different numbers less than or equal to a given number's cube and then subtracting this maximum sum from the cube of the given number. The code, however, contains a few potential performance bottlenecks:

1. It uses two nested loops which leads to a time complexity of O(n^2). This can be computationally expensive for large numbers.
2. The function `b_pow()` is computing the power of a number using recursion which can be slow and memory-intensive.
3. The code is computing the cube of the same number multiple times which is redundant.

Optimization Strategy:

1. We can replace the `b_pow()` function with the in-built `pow()` function in C++ which is faster and non-recursive.
2. We can compute the cube of the given number once and store it in a variable to avoid redundant computation.
3. We can simplify the nested loops by avoiding unnecessary computations. Instead of looping up to the cube of the given number, we can loop up to the given number itself because we are dealing with cubes of numbers.
4. We can also add a break statement in the inner loop when the sum of cubes of x and y exceeds the cube of the given number to avoid extra iterations.

Optimization Steps:

1. Replace the `b_pow()` function with the `pow()` function.
2. Compute the cube of the given number once and store it in a variable 'cubeZ'.
3. Simplify the nested loops by looping up to 'z' instead of 'z*z*z'. Add a break statement in the inner loop when the sum of cubes of x and y exceeds 'cubeZ'.
4. The trade-off is that using break may increase code complexity to some extent but it will significantly improve the performance by avoiding extra iterations.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll z;
  while (cin >> z && z) {
    ll cubeZ = pow(z, 3); // Compute the cube of 'z' once and store it
    ll ans = 0;
    for (ll x = 1; pow(x, 3) <= cubeZ; x++) {
      for (ll y = 1; y <= z; y++) {
        ll sumCube = pow(x, 3) + pow(y, 3);
        if (sumCube > cubeZ) // If the sum of cubes exceeds 'cubeZ', break the loop
          break;
        ans = max(ans, sumCube);
      }
    }
    cout << cubeZ - ans << endl; // Subtract the maximum sum of cubes from 'cubeZ'
  }
}
```
This optimized code has a lower time complexity and avoids redundant computations, thereby improving performance and reducing memory usage.
