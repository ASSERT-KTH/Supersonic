This C++ program seems to find the minimal value of (z^3 - i^3 - j^3) for every integer z from 1 to the value of N entered by the user, where i and j are integers less than z and j is the largest integer for which j^3 < (z^3 - i^3). The program then prints the result for the entered N.

The main performance issue in this program is the nested loop in the `calc` function, which makes it have a time complexity of O(N^2). This is coupled with a repeated computation of cube values and inefficient querying of the `tb` array.

Here's a high-level strategy for optimizing the code:

1. Precompute the cube values and store them in a map to achieve O(1) querying.
2. Instead of calculating i^3 and z^3 in each iteration, compute them once and use the computed values in the loop.
3. Use binary search instead of linear search when looking for the largest j^3 < (z^3 - i^3), as `tb` is sorted in ascending order.
4. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0);` to speed up I/O operations.

Optimized code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

map<int, int> tb;
int ans[1112], N;

int nr(int a) {
  auto it = tb.upper_bound(a);
  --it;
  return it->second;
}

int calc(int z) {
  int z3 = z * z * z, ret = z3;
  for (int i = 1; i < z; i++) {
    int i3 = i * i * i, j3 = nr(z3 - i3);
    if (i3 + j3 >= z3)
      break;
    ret = min(ret, z3 - i3 - j3);
  }
  return ret;
}

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0);
  
  for (int i = 1; i < 1112; i++)
    tb[i * i * i] = i * i * i;
  
  for (int i = 1; i < 1112; i++)
    ans[i] = calc(i);
  
  while (cin >> N, N)
    cout << ans[N] << "\n";
}
```

This optimized version should run faster due to the use of a map, binary search, and reduced computational redundancy. The tradeoff is slightly increased code complexity.
