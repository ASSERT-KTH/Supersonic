This C++ program aims to calculate the smallest difference between the cube of a number and the sum of the cubes of two different numbers for a given range. This is done by populating two arrays, `tb[]` and `ans[]` and then printing the value of `ans[N]` for each value of `N` read from the standard input until a zero is encountered. 

Here are some areas of improvement:

1. **Inefficient Data Structures**: The program uses arrays to store intermediate computed values, which is fine for this case. However, the size of the arrays is set to `1112` without any clear justification. This could lead to wastage of space if the required size is less than `1112`, or it could lead to out-of-bounds access if the required size is more than `1112`.

2. **Redundant Computations**: The function `calc(int z)` is called for each `i` from `1` to `1111`, and within each call, it computes `i * i * i` again for each `i` from `1` to `z-1`. These are redundant computations that could be avoided.

3. **Unoptimized Loops**: The loop in `calc(int z)` breaks when `i3 + j3` is greater than or equal to `z3`. This condition can be used to reduce the range of the loop.

4. **Unnecessary Function Calls**: The function `nr(int a)` is called repeatedly within `calc(int z)`. The purpose of this function is to find the greatest cube number less than or equal to `a`. This could be done more efficiently without the need for a function call.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int tb[1112], ans[1112], N;
  
  // Pre-compute and store cubes of numbers in tb array
  for (int i = 1; i < 1112; i++) {
    tb[i] = i * i * i;
  }

  // Pre-compute and store the smallest difference in ans array
  for (int z = 1; z < 1112; z++) {
    int z3 = tb[z], ret = z3;

    // Calculate the upper limit for i
    int max_i = cbrt(z3 / 2);
    for (int i = 1; i <= max_i; i++) {
      int i3 = tb[i];

      // Find the greatest cube number less than or equal to z3 - i3
      int j3 = tb[(int)cbrt(z3 - i3)];
      if (i3 + j3 >= z3)
        break;

      ret = min(ret, z3 - i3 - j3);
    }
    ans[z] = ret;
  }

  // Print the smallest difference for each N read from standard input
  while (cin >> N, N) {
    cout << ans[N] << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version of the code:

1. The redundant computations of `i * i * i` within `calc(int z)` have been avoided by using the pre-computed values in `tb[]` array.
2. The range of the loop in `calc(int z)` has been reduced by calculating the upper limit for `i` using the cube root of `z3 / 2`.
3. The function `nr(int a)` has been removed and its functionality has been integrated within `calc(int z)` using the `cbrt()` function to find the cube root.
4. The function `calc(int z)` has been removed and its functionality has been integrated within `main()` to avoid unnecessary function calls.
