1. Code Analysis:
The provided code calculates cubic numbers for a range of integers (1 to 1111) and stores them in the array `tb`. It also computes a value based on those cubic numbers and stores the results in the array `ans`. The function `calc` iterates from 1 to `z` and computes the minimum difference of cubic numbers and stores the result in `ans[z]`.

There are several potential areas to optimize:
a) Calculating cubic numbers: This is done repetitively in the code, which is inefficient.
b) Using arrays `tb` and `ans`: They are global and use a fixed size, which might consume unnecessary memory when the input `N` is small. 
c) The function `nr`: It iteratively searches for a number from the array `tb`, which could be optimized using a binary search as the array `tb` is sorted.
d) The `calc` function: The `i` loop could be optimized.

2. Optimization Strategy:

a) Pre-compute the cubic numbers only once and store them in a container like std::vector. This avoids calculating the same values multiple times.
b) Use std::vector instead of arrays for `tb` and `ans`. This allows for dynamic memory usage according to the input size `N`.
c) Replace the linear search in `nr` function with binary search to reduce the complexity from O(n) to O(log n).
d) Loop optimization in `calc` function: Instead of starting from 1, start the loop from `z` and move backwards. This ensures that `i3 + j3` is always less than `z3`, eliminating the need for a break condition.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

a) Pre-compute cubic numbers: This step is crucial because the cubic numbers are used multiple times in the code. By pre-computing them, we reduce the redundant computations, leading to a significant performance gain.

b) Use std::vector: By replacing the fixed size arrays with std::vector, we ensure dynamic memory allocation based on the input size. This reduces unnecessary memory usage when the input `N` is small.

c) Binary search in `nr` function: The function `nr` performs a linear search to find a number from `tb`. Since `tb` is sorted, we can use binary search, reducing the search complexity from O(n) to O(log n), which significantly improves the performance.

d) Loop optimization in `calc` function: The loop in `calc` function starts from 1 and goes up to `z`. However, by starting from `z` and going backwards, we ensure that `i3 + j3` is always less than `z3`, eliminating the need for a break condition. This results in fewer iterations and improves the performance.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> tb, ans;

// Function to calculate cubic numbers
void calc_cubic(int N) {
  tb.resize(N+1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)
    tb[i] = i * i * i;
}

// Binary search function to find number
int nr(int a) {
  int low = 2, high = tb.size()-1;
  while (low <= high) {
    int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
    if (tb[mid] > a) 
      high = mid - 1;
    else 
      low = mid + 1;
  }
  return tb[high];
}

// Function to calculate ans
int calc(int z) {
  int z3 = z * z * z, ret = z3;
  for (int i = z; i >= 1; i--) {
    int i3 = i * i * i, j3 = nr(z3 - i3);
    ret = min(ret, z3 - i3 - j3);
  }
  return ret;
}

int main() {
  int N;
  while (cin >> N, N) {
    calc_cubic(N);
    ans.resize(N+1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)
      ans[i] = calc(i);
    cout << ans[N] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code reduces redundant computations, uses dynamic memory allocation, and utilizes binary search for faster lookup, resulting in improved performance and efficient memory usage.
