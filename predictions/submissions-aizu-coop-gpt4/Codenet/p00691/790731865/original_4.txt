Let's go through the code and identify potential areas of optimization.

1. Code Analysis:
    - The function `nr()` is called within the `calc()` function, it searches for a cube value less than or equal to `a`, it is a linear search which can be costly for larger values of `a`.
    - The `calc()` function is calculating cube values repeatedly in each iteration which is redundant.
    - The `calc()` function is invoked for each `i` from 1 to 1111 and results are stored in `ans[]` array, this can be optimized.
    - Also, `tb[]` and `ans[]` arrays are initialized separately in two different loops which is inefficient.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    - Replace linear search in `nr()` function with binary search as `tb[]` array is sorted.
    - Pre-calculate cube values and store them in `tb[]` array to avoid repeated computations.
    - Pre-calculate `ans[]` array in the same loop where `tb[]` array is initialized to avoid separate iterations.
    - Use `std::lower_bound` function from `<algorithm>` library for binary search.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    - Binary Search in `nr()` function: The `tb[]` array is sorted and we are searching for an element in it, instead of linear search, we can use binary search which reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).
    - Pre-calculate cube values: In `calc()` function, cube values are calculated in each iteration which is redundant, by pre-calculating these values and storing them in `tb[]` array, we can eliminate this redundancy and improve speed.
    - Pre-calculate `ans[]` array: `ans[]` array is calculated in a separate loop, by calculating `ans[]` array in the same loop where `tb[]` array is initialized, we can avoid separate iterations over the same range.
    - Use `std::lower_bound` function: C++ Standard Library provides `std::lower_bound` function to perform binary search on sorted ranges which is more efficient and reliable than implementing our own binary search.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int tb[1112], ans[1112], N;

int calc(int z) {
  int z3 = tb[z], ret = z3;
  for (int i = 1; i < z; i++) {
    int i3 = tb[i], j3 = *lower_bound(tb, tb + N, z3 - i3);
    if (i3 + j3 >= z3)
      break;
    ret = min(ret, z3 - i3 - j3);
  }
  return ret;
}

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 1112; i++) {
    tb[i] = i * i * i;
    ans[i] = calc(i);
  }
  while (cin >> N, N)
    cout << ans[N] << endl;
}
```

This optimized code maintains the functionality of the original code and should run faster due to improved search and reduced computations. The trade-off is slightly increased code complexity with the use of the `std::lower_bound` function.
