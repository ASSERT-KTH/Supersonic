Code Analysis:
The provided code is a C++ program that calculates a certain values based on cube operations and stores it in an array. Afterward, it allows user to query the computed values by inputting an index. The main components of the code are:

1. The `nr` function, which finds the largest cube less than or equal to a given number.
2. The `calc` function, which calculates a certain value for every number from 1 to 1111 and stores these values in `ans` array.
3. The `main` function, which fills the `tb` and `ans` array and then takes user queries to output the corresponding array values.

Potential performance bottlenecks include:

1. The `nr` function runs in linear time, as it iterates through the `tb` array until it finds a cube greater than the input.
2. The `calc` function also runs in linear time, as it iterates from 1 to `z`. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use binary search in the `nr` function, instead of linear search. This can reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).
2. Use memoization to store the result of previously computed values so we don't have to compute them again.
3. Remove redundant computations inside the loops. For instance, `z3` is recalculated in every iteration of the `calc` function.
4. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` to speed up I/O operations.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int tb[1112], ans[1112], N;

int nr(int a) {
  int low = 1, high = 1112, mid;

  while (low < high) {
    mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
    if (tb[mid] > a)
      high = mid;
    else
      low = mid + 1;
  }

  return tb[low - 1];
}

int calc(int z) {
  int z3 = z * z * z, ret = z3;
  for (int i = 1; i < z; i++) {
    int i3 = i * i * i, j3 = nr(z3 - i3);
    if (i3 + j3 >= z3)
        break;
    ret = min(ret, z3 - i3 - j3);
  }
  return ret;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  for (int i = 1; i < 1112; i++)
    tb[i] = i * i * i;
  for (int i = 1; i < 1112; i++)
    ans[i] = calc(i);
  while (cin >> N, N)
    cout << ans[N] << '\n';
}
```

Explanation:

1. Binary Search in `nr` function: Instead of running a linear search to find the largest cube less than or equal to `a`, we can use a binary search. This reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n), which is a significant speedup for large n.

2. Memoization: The values of `tb` and `ans` are computed ahead of time and stored. This avoids recomputation of these values, which would be necessary if they were computed on the fly.

3. Remove redundant computations: The value of `z3` is only calculated once, rather than in each iteration of the for loop.

4. Speed up I/O operations: The lines `ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` are used to speed up I/O operations by disabling synchronization between C and C++ I/O streams and untie cin from cout.

Trade-offs: The optimized code is slightly more complex due to the addition of binary search. However, this is a worthwhile trade-off for the significant speedup it provides.
