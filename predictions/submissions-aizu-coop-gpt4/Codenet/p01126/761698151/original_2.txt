The provided C++ code reads and processes a series of inputs in a loop until the user enters three zeros. The main computation involves a two-dimensional array (`amida`), which can be a potential performance issue due to its large size and the way it's being accessed.

1. Code Analysis:
   - The array `amida` is sized [101][1001] and is reinitialized with zeros each time the loop begins. This is an expensive operation and could be optimized.
   - There are two nested loops in the code, which iterates through the `amida` array. This can be optimized.
   - The variables `h`, `p`, and `q` are declared in every iteration but are not used effectively. Only `h` and `p` are used, and `q` is redundant.

2. Optimization Strategy:
    1. Instead of reinitializing the `amida` array to zero in every iteration, we can only reset the elements that have been changed in the previous iteration. This would require maintaining a list of changed elements.
    2. Use `std::vector` instead of a 2D array for better memory management and dynamic size allocation.
    3. Remove the unused variable `q`.
    4. Avoid checking the same condition twice inside the loop; instead, use an `else if` condition.
    5. Use `++a` and `--a` instead of `a++` and `a--` for increment and decrement operations, as they are more efficient.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
    1. Declare a `std::vector` of `std::pair<int, int>` to store the locations of non-zero elements in the `amida` array. At the end of each iteration, we only need to reset these specific locations.
    2. Replace the 2D array `amida` with a 2D `std::vector` for dynamic allocation and better memory management.
    3. Remove the variable `q` as it is not used anywhere in the program.
    4. In the loop where we are checking the values of `amida[a][j]` and `amida[a - 1][j]`, use an `else if` condition so that the second condition is only checked if the first is false.
    5. Use `++a` and `--a` instead of `a++` and `a--` for increment and decrement operations, as they are faster.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m, a;
  vector<vector<int>> amida(101, vector<int>(1001, 0));
  vector<pair<int, int>> changed;

  while (true) {
    cin >> n >> m >> a;
    if (n == 0 && m == 0 && a == 0) {
      break;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      int h = 0, p = 0;
      cin >> h >> p;
      amida[p][h] = 1;
      changed.push_back({p, h});
    }

    for (int j = 1000; j > 0; --j) {
      if (amida[a][j] == 1)
        ++a;
      else if (a > 1 && amida[a - 1][j] == 1)
        --a;
    }

    cout << a << endl;

    // Reset only the changed elements
    for (auto &p : changed)
      amida[p.first][p.second] = 0;
    changed.clear();
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Please note that arrays in C++ are 0-based, so we should check if `a > 1` before accessing `amida[a - 1][j]` to avoid out-of-bound errors.
