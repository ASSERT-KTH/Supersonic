Code Analysis:
The given code is a C++ program that simulates an Amida lottery game, which is a network of lines and intersections. In this game, lines are drawn vertically, and horizontal lines are drawn to connect two neighboring lines. Ball or marker starts from a vertical line and moves down. If it encounters a horizontal line, it moves horizontally to the neighboring vertical line. The process continues until the ball reaches the bottom. Here, 'n' represents the number of vertical lines, 'm' represents the number of horizontal lines, and 'a' is the line from where the ball starts.

The program reads these inputs in an infinite loop until all three values are zero. For each set of inputs, it creates a 2D array representing the game board, reads the horizontal lines' positions, and then simulates the ball's movement from top to bottom.

Potential optimization areas:

1. Unnecessary use of large 2D array irrespective of the number of vertical lines and horizontal lines.

2. The initialization of 2D array in each iteration is costly.

3. Brute force approach to find the path of the ball.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Dynamic Memory Allocation: Instead of creating a large 2D array of size 101x1001 for each iteration, we can create a dynamic 2D array based on the number of vertical lines and horizontal lines. This will reduce the memory footprint of the program.

2. Efficient Initialization: Instead of initializing the 2D array in each iteration, we can reuse the same array for each iteration but make sure to reset the values for the new iteration.

3. Efficient Path Finding: Instead of checking each possible horizontal line for the ball to move, we can directly move the ball to the next horizontal line.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m, a;
  while (true) {
    cin >> n >> m >> a;
    if (n == 0 && m == 0 && a == 0) {
      break;
    }
    // Vector to hold horizontal lines for each vertical line
    vector<vector<int>> amida(n+1, vector<int>(m+1, 0));
    vector<int> heights(m+1, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
      int h = 0, p = 0, q = 0;
      cin >> h >> p >> q;
      amida[p][h] = i;
      heights[i] = h;
    }
    for (int i = m; i >= 1; i--) {
      if (amida[a][heights[i]] == i)
        a++;
      else if (a > 1 && amida[a - 1][heights[i]] == i)
        a--;
    }
    cout << a << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, a vector of vectors is used instead of a 2D array to dynamically allocate memory. We also keep track of the heights of horizontal lines to directly jump to the next horizontal line instead of checking each possible position. This reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(m), where n is the number of possible positions (which is constant, 1000) and m is the number of horizontal lines.
