Code Analysis:
The provided code seems to be a solution to an Amida lottery problem. The code reads three integers, n, m, a, where n and m are the size of the Amida lottery, and a is the initial position. The program then reads m lines, each containing h, p, q where p and q are the positions in the lottery connected by a horizontal line at height h. The goal of the program is to simulate the Amida lottery and output the final position.

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:
1. The line "int amida[101][1001] = {{0}};" is allocating a large 2D array at each iteration, which is quite inefficient in terms of memory usage. 
2. The loops are straightforward and do not seem to contain redundant calculations or inefficient operations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The primary optimization here would be to avoid allocating the memory for the entire 2D array in each iteration. Instead, we can allocate it once outside the infinite loop and reset it to zero at the start of each iteration.
2. We can optimize the I/O operations using faster alternatives to cin and cout.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Move "int amida[101][1001] = {{0}};" outside the infinite loop and reset it to zero at the start of each iteration. This will avoid the memory allocation operation at each iteration, thus saving time. Trade-offs: This increases the code complexity slightly since we now need to manually zero out the array at the start of each iteration.
2. Replace cin and cout with faster alternatives for reading and writing integers. This can significantly speed up the I/O operations. Trade-offs: This makes the code slightly more complex and less readable.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Faster method for reading integers
inline int fast_read() {
    int n = 0;
    char c;
    while ((c = getchar_unlocked()) >= '0') {
        n = 10 * n + (c - '0');
    }
    return n;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // Faster I/O
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n, m, a;
    int amida[101][1001] = {{0}};
    while (true) {
        n = fast_read();
        m = fast_read();
        a = fast_read();
        
        if (n == 0 && m == 0 && a == 0) {
            break;
        }
        
        // Reset the array
        for (int i = 0; i < 101; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < 1001; j++)
                amida[i][j] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int h = fast_read();
            int p = fast_read();
            int q = fast_read();
            amida[p][h] = 1;
        }
        for (int j = 1000; j > 0; j--) {
            if (amida[a][j] == 1)
                a++;
            else if (amida[a - 1][j] == 1)
                a--;
        }
        cout << a << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This optimized code should run faster due to the reduced time spent on I/O operations and memory allocations.
