Code Analysis:
The given code is a C++ program for a console-based game. It reads three integers (n, m, a) from the user in each iteration. If all inputs are zero, it breaks the loop, otherwise, it initializes a 2-dimensional array and fills it with the user inputs. After that, it checks the array's contents in a decreasing order and modifies the variable 'a' accordingly before printing it.

Potential Bottlenecks:
1. The 2D array 'amida' is initialized with a size of 101x1001 in each iteration. This is a huge memory allocation and may lead to performance degradation, especially if the values of m and n are small.

2. The code checks every row from 1000 to 1 in the array, even if the actual number of rows filled with data is much less. This is inefficient and may lead to longer running times.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a more efficient data structure: Instead of using a 2D array, we can use a vector of pairs. Each pair will contain the 'p' and 'h' values, and the vector will contain 'm' such pairs. This will use only as much memory as required.

2. Avoid unnecessary computations: By using an ordered data structure like a map or a set instead of a 2D array, we can avoid checking every row in the array.

3. Optimize loops: We can use a for-each loop to iterate over the vector of pairs. This is simpler and more efficient than using a traditional for loop.

4. Use compiler optimizations: We can add the `-O2` or `-O3` flag when compiling the code to enable compiler optimizations. This can significantly improve the performance of the code.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, m, a;
  while (true) {
    cin >> n >> m >> a;
    if (n == 0 && m == 0 && a == 0) {
      break;
    }
    vector<pair<int, int>> amida;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      int h = 0, p = 0, q = 0;
      cin >> h >> p >> q;
      amida.push_back({p, h});
    }
    sort(amida.begin(), amida.end(), [](const pair<int, int>& a, const pair<int, int>& b) {
      return a.second > b.second;
    });
    for (const auto& [p, h] : amida) {
      if (p == a)
        a++;
      else if (p == a - 1)
        a--;
    }
    cout << a << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
With these optimizations, the code will use less memory and run faster. The functionality and output remain the same as the original code.
