Code Analysis:

The provided code is a simple console application that reads inputs (n, m, a), where it appears to be using 'n' and 'm' as dimensions for a 2D array 'amida'. The 'a' variable is used to track a position in the amida matrix. 

The code then reads 'm' more inputs to fill the array 'amida'. Following that, it traverses the array from the bottom up (from the last row to the first) and depending on the value at the current position, it either increments or decrements the 'a' variable.

Performance Bottlenecks:

1. The code initializes a 2D array of size 101x1001 for every iteration. This is a waste of memory if 'n' and 'm' are significantly smaller than 101 and 1001 respectively.
2. The array is traversed from the bottom up, which may not be cache-friendly as modern CPUs tend to load memory into cache in chunks and in a sequential manner.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Rather than initializing a fixed size 2D array, we can use a dynamic data structure such as std::vector. This will allow us to only use as much memory as required by the inputs, potentially saving a significant amount of memory.
2. To make the code more cache-friendly, we can traverse the 'amida' array from top to bottom rather than from bottom to top.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the 2D array 'amida' with a 2D vector. This will allow us to use only as much memory as required by the inputs. This can improve performance by reducing the amount of memory that needs to be allocated and initialized.
2. Reverse the order of traversal of the 'amida' vector. Instead of traversing from bottom to top, we can traverse from top to bottom. This can potentially improve the cache utilization as modern CPUs tend to prefetch memory in a sequential manner.

Trade-offs:

1. Using a vector instead of an array can lead to a slight overhead due to dynamic memory allocation. However, this overhead is usually negligible compared to the memory savings, especially when 'n' and 'm' are significantly less than 101 and 1001 respectively.
2. Reversing the order of traversal might complicate the logic slightly, but the potential performance gain due to better cache utilization can justify this complication.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m, a;
  while (true) {
    cin >> n >> m >> a;
    if (n == 0 && m == 0 && a == 0) {
      break;
    }
    vector<vector<int>> amida(n+1, vector<int>(m+1, 0)); // Dynamic 2D vector
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      int h = 0, p = 0, q = 0;
      cin >> h >> p >> q;
      amida[p][h] = 1;
    }
    for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) { // Traverse from top to bottom
      if (amida[a][j] == 1)
        a++;
      else if (a > 1 && amida[a - 1][j] == 1)
        a--;
    }
    cout << a << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, I've replaced the 2D array 'amida' with a 2D vector that dynamically sizes itself based on the input values 'n' and 'm'. I've also reversed the order of traversal of the 'amida' vector to traverse from top to bottom rather than from bottom to top. This can potentially improve CPU cache utilization, leading to faster execution times.
