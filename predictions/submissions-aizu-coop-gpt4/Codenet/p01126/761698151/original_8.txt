Code Analysis:

The given code appears to be a problem of a game called "Amida Lottery". The game involves a player starting at a particular position on top of a ladder and then moving downwards. If a player encounters a horizontal line, he/she moves to the adjacent vertical line. The player's final position when he/she gets to the bottom of the ladder is the output.

The code is generally well structured, but there are areas where we can optimize for performance.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The program uses a 2D array `amida[101][1001]` to keep track of horizontal lines in the ladder. This is inefficient as it consumes a lot of memory. A more efficient approach would be to use a map or another data structure that only stores necessary information.

2. Redundant Computations: The ladder is always iterated from top to bottom, even when there are no horizontal lines for a considerable number of steps. This is a redundant computation that can be optimized.

3. Loops and Recursive Calls: The main loop that iterates from the top to the bottom of the ladder could be optimized by skipping over parts of the ladder where there are no horizontal lines.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimization flags can be used to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the 2D array with a more efficient data structure. This reduces memory usage as only necessary information is stored. However, it may slightly increase code complexity.

2. Optimize the main loop by skipping over parts of the ladder where there are no horizontal lines. This reduces unnecessary computations thereby improving performance.

3. Use compiler optimization flags to further optimize the code. This might make the code slightly harder to debug but it often results in more efficient code.

Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // improve IO speed
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, m, a;
  while (true) {
    cin >> n >> m >> a;
    if (n == 0 && m == 0 && a == 0) {
      break;
    }

    map<int, map<int, int>> amida; // Replace 2D array with map
    vector<int> heights; // To store unique heights
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      int h = 0, p = 0, q = 0;
      cin >> h >> p >> q;
      amida[p][h] = 1;
      heights.push_back(h);
    }

    sort(heights.begin(), heights.end(), greater<int>()); // Sort heights in descending order
    heights.erase(unique(heights.begin(), heights.end()), heights.end()); // Remove duplicate heights

    for (auto j : heights) { // Only iterate through existing heights
      if (amida[a][j] == 1)
        a++;
      else if (amida[a - 1][j] == 1)
        a--;
    }

    cout << a << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```
Note: This code assumes that the compiler will optimize some parts of the code. If you are not getting the expected performance improvements, you may consider using compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` when compiling the code.
