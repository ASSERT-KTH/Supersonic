After analyzing the provided C/C++ code, here are the potential improvements that can be made:

1. **Avoiding the use of pow function**: The pow function is computationally expensive. For squaring, simply using multiplication is much faster.
2. **Avoiding the use of sqrt function**: The sqrt function is also computationally expensive. In this case, it's not necessary to calculate the actual distance between two points, but rather compare the distances. So, if we square all the distances being compared, we can avoid the sqrt function.
3. **Unnecessary use of array `d[]`**: The array `d[]` is used to store four values for comparison. However, we can directly compare these values without storing them in an array, thus avoiding memory usage.
4. **Avoiding redundant calculations**: The values `d[2] = ra - rb;` and `d[3] = rb - ra;` are calculated for each iteration but are used only once. They can be computed inside the if-else block where they are used.

Here's the optimized code block implementing the above recommendations:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int k, n;
  double xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb;
  double d;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int ans[n];
  for (k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &xa, &ya, &ra, &xb, &yb, &rb);
    d = (xb - xa) * (xb - xa) + (yb - ya) * (yb - ya);  // Squaring the distance
    ra *= ra;  // Squaring the radii
    rb *= rb;
    if (d > (ra + rb)) {
      ans[k - 1] = 0;
    } else if (ra > (d + rb)) {
      ans[k - 1] = 2;
    } else if (rb > (d + ra)) {
      ans[k - 1] = -2;
    } else {
      ans[k - 1] = 1;
    }
  }
  for (k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
    printf("%d\n", ans[k - 1]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we've potentially reduced the computational complexity by avoiding the use of `pow` and `sqrt` functions, and also reduced memory usage by eliminating the use of the array `d[]`. The logic remains the same and the output should be identical to the original code. The trade-offs include slightly increased complexity in the if-else conditions and the need to square the radii every time (which is still less expensive than repeated `pow` and `sqrt` operations).
