Here is the analysis for the provided code:

- The code is reading "n" number of data sets. Each data set contains six double values which are used to calculate three double values. Based on the calculated values, it sets an int value in the "ans" array. After reading and calculating all data sets, the code prints the "ans" array.
- The code uses dynamic array "ans". In C, it is better to avoid dynamic arrays as they may cause segmentation fault if the array size is larger than the stack size. 
- The code uses an array "d" to store temporary values which are used immediately after calculation. This is unnecessary and increases memory usage.
- The code is using pow() function to square the difference of coordinates. This is more computationally expensive than simply multiplying the values.

Here is the optimization strategy:

1. Replace the dynamic array "ans" with a static array of a large size that can accommodate the maximum number of test cases.
2. Avoid using the array "d" to store temporary values. Instead, calculate and use the values directly in the condition checks.
3. Replace the pow() function with simple multiplication to square the difference of coordinates.
4. Use fast I/O methods to read and write data.

Below is the step-by-step explanation:

1. The dynamic array "ans" is replaced with a static array of size 100000. This is a trade-off between memory usage and the risk of a segmentation fault. If the number of test cases is guaranteed to be less than 100000, this change is safe and avoids potential segmentation faults. This change also ensures that the memory for the array is allocated at compile-time, which is faster than run-time allocation.

2. The array "d" is removed and the values are calculated and used directly in the condition checks. This reduces memory usage.

3. The pow() function is replaced with simple multiplication for squaring the difference of coordinates. This reduces computational complexity as multiplication is faster than the pow() function.

4. The scanf and printf functions are replaced with fast I/O methods (getchar_unlocked and putchar_unlocked). This can significantly improve the performance when reading and writing large amounts of data.

Here is the optimized code:

```C
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAXN 100000

inline int readInt() {
  int n = 0;
  char c;
  while ((c = getchar_unlocked()) < '0');
  do {
    n = (n << 3) + (n << 1) + (c - '0');
  } while ((c = getchar_unlocked()) >= '0');
  return n;
}

inline void writeInt(int n) {
  if (n == 0) {
    putchar_unlocked('0');
    putchar_unlocked('\n');
    return;
  }
  char buf[11];
  buf[10] = '\n';
  int i = 9;
  while (n) {
    buf[i--] = n % 10 + '0';
    n /= 10;
  }
  while (buf[++i] != '\n') putchar_unlocked(buf[i]);
}

int main(void) {
  int k, n, ans[MAXN];
  double xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb, d0, d1, d2, d3;
  n = readInt();
  for (k = 0; k < n; k++) {
    xa = readInt();
    ya = readInt();
    ra = readInt();
    xb = readInt();
    yb = readInt();
    rb = readInt();
    d0 = sqrt((xb - xa) * (xb - xa) + (yb - ya) * (yb - ya));
    d1 = ra + rb;
    d2 = ra - rb;
    d3 = rb - ra;
    if (d0 > d1) {
      ans[k] = 0;
    } else if (d2 > d0) {
      ans[k] = 2;
    } else if (d3 > d0) {
      ans[k] = -2;
    } else {
      ans[k] = 1;
    }
  }
  for (k = 0; k < n; k++) {
    writeInt(ans[k]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This code assumes that the input values for the coordinates and radii are integers. If they can be floating point numbers, the readInt function needs to be replaced with a function that can read floating point numbers.
