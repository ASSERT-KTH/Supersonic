Code Analysis:
The given code reads a set of inputs, conducts a series of mathematical operations, and assigns the results to an array 'ans'. It then prints the values of this array. The primary bottlenecks for this code could be the usage of the pow() function and sqrt() function, the dynamic array allocation, and multiple if-else conditions.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The dynamic array allocation for 'ans' can be replaced with a static array if the upper limit of 'n' is known, as dynamic arrays are slower due to the overhead of memory allocation and deallocation.

2. Redundant Computations: The pow() function, which is computationally expensive, can be replaced with direct multiplication. Also, sqrt() function can be avoided by comparing squares instead of square roots.

3. Loops or Recursive Calls: The loop structure itself is efficient in this case. There's no recursive calls in the code.

4. Compiler Optimizations: One can use -O3 flag for gcc to ensure the compiler optimizes the code for performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace dynamic array with static: If the maximum value for 'n' is known or can be reasonably estimated, we can use a static array instead of a dynamic one. This would reduce the overhead of dynamic memory allocation.

2. Avoid pow() and sqrt() functions: Instead of using pow(x, 2.0) to square a number, we can simply use x*x. This is faster because multiplication is a simpler operation for the processor than the power function. Also, we can avoid sqrt() by comparing squares.

3. Compiler optimization: Using the -O3 optimization flag with gcc will instruct the compiler to optimize the code for speed.

Trade-offs: While these optimizations can potentially speed up the program, they may also make the code more complex and harder to read. In addition, replacing dynamic array with static array could potentially waste memory if 'n' is usually much smaller than its maximum value.

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAXN 1000  // Assuming maximum 'n' is 1000

int main(void) {
  int k, n;
  double xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb;
  double d[4];
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int ans[MAXN];
  for (k = 0; k < n; k++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &xa, &ya, &ra, &xb, &yb, &rb);
    d[0] = (xb - xa)*(xb - xa) + (yb - ya)*(yb - ya);  // Square of distance
    d[1] = (ra + rb)*(ra + rb);  // Square of sum of radii
    d[2] = (ra - rb)*(ra - rb);  // Square of difference of radii
    if (d[0] > d[1]) {
      ans[k] = 0;
    } else if (d[2] > d[0]) {
      ans[k] = 2;
    } else if (d[0] < d[2]) {
      ans[k] = -2;
    } else {
      ans[k] = 1;
    }
  }
  for (k = 0; k < n; k++) {
    printf("%d\n", ans[k]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
