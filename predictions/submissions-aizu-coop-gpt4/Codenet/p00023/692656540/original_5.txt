1. Code Analysis: 

   The provided code calculates the relative positions of two circles in a 2D plane. It uses an array to store the results. The program reads input values for two circles (center coordinates and radius), calculates the distance between the centers and the sum and difference of the radii, and then determines the relative position of the two circles based on these values. 

   Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage might include:
   - The use of `pow` function for squaring which is less efficient than simply multiplying the value by itself.
   - The use of an array `d[]` to store intermediate results which is unnecessary as they can be used directly in the following conditions. 
   - The use of dynamic array `ans[]` which can be a potential source of memory inefficiencies.

2. Optimization Strategy:

    A. Inefficient data structures: 
       - Replace the use of `pow` function with direct multiplication.
       - Remove the array `d[]` and use the calculated values directly in the conditions.
       - Consider using a static array for `ans[]` if the maximum possible value of `n` is known and acceptable.

    B. Redundant or unnecessary computations: 
       - The array `d[]` is unnecessary and can be removed, the calculations can be used directly in the conditions.

    C. Loops or recursive calls: 
       - The loops in the code are necessary for reading the inputs and printing the results, no significant optimization can be done here.

    D. Compiler optimizations: 
       - Compiler optimizations can be dependent on specific compilers and their versions. For GCC, options like `-O2` or `-O3` can be used for general optimizations.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

   1. Replace `pow(xb - xa, 2.0)` with `(xb - xa) * (xb - xa)`. This avoids the overhead of function call and the unnecessary complexity of power calculation for simple squaring.
   
   2. Remove the array `d[]` and use the variables directly in the conditions. This avoids unnecessary memory usage and potential cache misses.

   3. If possible, replace dynamic array `ans[]` with a static array if `n` is known and within acceptable limits. Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation can be costly.

4. Optimized Code:

```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAXN 10000  // Replace with the maximum possible n

int main(void) {
  int k, n;
  double xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb;
  double d0, d1, d2, d3;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int ans[MAXN];
  for (k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &xa, &ya, &ra, &xb, &yb, &rb);
    d0 = sqrt((xb - xa) * (xb - xa) + (yb - ya) * (yb - ya));
    d1 = ra + rb;
    d2 = ra - rb;
    d3 = rb - ra;
    if (d0 > d1) {
      ans[k - 1] = 0;
    } else if (d2 > d0) {
      ans[k - 1] = 2;
    } else if (d3 > d0) {
      ans[k - 1] = -2;
    } else {
      ans[k - 1] = 1;
    }
  }
  for (k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
    printf("%d\n", ans[k - 1]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: In the optimized code, `MAXN` should be replaced with the maximum value `n` can take. If it's not known or very large, consider using a dynamic array or a data structure like a vector in C++.
