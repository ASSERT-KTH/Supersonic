## Code Analysis
The code calculates the distance between two points (xa, ya) and (xb, yb), checks this distance against the sum and the differences of their radii (ra and rb), and stores the result in the ans[] array. Then it prints the results.

Here are a few potential inefficiencies:

1. The code uses pow function to square the distances. This function is not the most efficient way to do this operation.
2. It stores the results in an array before printing them. This is unnecessary if we can print the results immediately once they are calculated.
3. The code uses sqrt function to calculate the distance. This operation might not be needed if we can compare the squares of the distances.
4. The code computes d[2] and d[3] even if d[0] > d[1] is true, which is unnecessary.

## Optimization Strategy
1. Use multiplication operation instead of the pow function to square the distances.
2. Print the results directly instead of storing them in an array. This will save memory.
3. Compare the squares of the distances instead of the distances themselves to avoid the sqrt function.
4. Avoid computing d[2] and d[3] if they are not necessary.

## Optimized Code
Below is the optimized code following the above strategy:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int k, n;
  double xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb;
  double d0_squared, d1_squared, d2_squared, d3_squared;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &xa, &ya, &ra, &xb, &yb, &rb);
    
    d0_squared = (xb - xa) * (xb - xa) + (yb - ya) * (yb - ya);
    d1_squared = (ra + rb) * (ra + rb);
    
    if (d0_squared > d1_squared) {
      printf("%d\n", 0);
      continue;
    }
    
    d2_squared = (ra - rb) * (ra - rb);
    d3_squared = (rb - ra) * (rb - ra);
    
    if (d2_squared > d0_squared) {
      printf("%d\n", 2);
    } else if (d3_squared > d0_squared) {
      printf("%d\n", -2);
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", 1);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code improves the running time by avoiding unnecessary computations and the use of the sqrt and pow functions. It also reduces memory usage by printing the results directly instead of storing them in an array. The trade-off is a slight increase in code complexity due to the additional if-else condition.
