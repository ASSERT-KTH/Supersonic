1. Code Analysis

This program is comparing the distances between two circles and their radii to determine a relationship. It calculates the Euclidean distance between the centers of two circles and compares it with the sum and the absolute difference of their radii. 

The given code does not have major performance issues. However, there are a few potential areas where we can improve code efficiency and readability:

    1. Inefficient memory usage: The array `d[]` is not necessary. We can eliminate it and calculate the values inline.
    2. Redundant computations: The `pow()` function is used to square numbers, which is slower compared to multiplication.
    3. Inefficient data structures: The array `ans[]` is not necessary. We can print the result directly, avoiding the need for this array.

2. Optimization Strategy

    1. Instead of using the `pow()` function to square numbers, we can use multiplication, which is faster.
    2. We can eliminate the `d[]` array and calculate the values inline, which will reduce memory usage.
    3. Instead of storing results in `ans[]` array, we can print the result directly.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation

    1. Replace the `pow()` function with multiplication. This is faster and does not affect the result.
    2. Remove the `d[]` array and calculate the values inline. This will reduce memory usage and make the code cleaner.
    3. Print the result directly instead of storing it in an array. This will reduce memory usage.

4. Optimized Code Block

```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int k, n;
  double xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb;
  double d, sum_radius, diff_radius;

  scanf("%d", &n);

  for (k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &xa, &ya, &ra, &xb, &yb, &rb);

    // Calculate the distance between centers of circles
    d = sqrt((xb - xa) * (xb - xa) + (yb - ya) * (yb - ya));

    // Calculate the sum and difference of the radii
    sum_radius = ra + rb;
    diff_radius = fabs(ra - rb);

    // Compare and print the result
    if (d > sum_radius) {
      printf("0\n");
    } else if (diff_radius > d) {
      printf("%d\n", (ra > rb) ? 2 : -2);
    } else {
      printf("1\n");
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

With these improvements, the code should run faster and use less memory. The trade-off is that it becomes slightly less clear what each condition in the if-else statements is checking for, but the addition of comments can help address this.
