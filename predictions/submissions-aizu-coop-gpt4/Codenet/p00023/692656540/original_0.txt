The given code is a geometric analysis of two circles defined by their centers (xa, ya) and (xb, yb) and their radii ra and rb. The code determines the relationship between the two circles (whether they're separate, one's inside the other, or they intersect) and stores the results in an array, which is then printed out.

The code presents some inefficiencies that we can optimize:

1. Dynamic array creation: The code uses the non-standard Variable Length Array (VLA) feature of C to create an array of 'n' integers. This may lead to a stack overflow for large 'n'. We will use dynamic memory allocation to create the array instead.

2. Repeated computations: The calculation of the distance between the centers of the circles is done using the pow function twice, which is computationally expensive.

3. Unnecessary storage: The distances d[0], d[1], d[2], and d[3] are stored in an array and then compared. We can compare them as soon as we calculate them, avoiding the need for an array.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
  int k, n;
  double xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  
  int* ans = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int)); // Dynamic memory allocation
  
  for (k = 0; k < n; k++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &xa, &ya, &ra, &xb, &yb, &rb);
    
    double d0 = sqrt((xb - xa) * (xb - xa) + (yb - ya) * (yb - ya)); // Replace pow with simple multiplication
    double d1 = ra + rb;
    double d2 = fabs(ra - rb); // Use fabs to find the absolute difference between ra and rb

    if (d0 > d1) {
      ans[k] = 0;
    } else if (d2 > d0) {
      ans[k] = (ra > rb) ? 2 : -2; // If ra is greater than rb, assign 2; otherwise, assign -2
    } else {
      ans[k] = 1;
    }
  }
  
  for (k = 0; k < n; k++) {
    printf("%d\n", ans[k]);
  }
  
  free(ans); // Free the dynamically allocated memory
  return 0;
}
```

This code optimizes memory usage by using dynamic memory allocation and forgoing the array of distances. It also simplifies the pow function to a multiplication and uses the fabs function to simplify the comparisons. Lastly, it correctly frees the dynamically allocated memory to prevent memory leaks. The trade-off is a slight increase in code complexity due to the dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
