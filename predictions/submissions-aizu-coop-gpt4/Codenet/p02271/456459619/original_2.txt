This program is a solution to a subset sum problem using recursive backtracking. For every number, it checks if it can be included or excluded to reach the target sum. However, this method is very inefficient as it has a time complexity of O(2^n), where n is the number of elements. It also re-computes many sub-problems multiple times, resulting in a lot of wastage of computational resources.

## Optimization Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming:** Instead of a recursive solution, we can use dynamic programming to avoid re-computation of subproblems. We can create a 2D array where the state dp[i][j] will be true if there exists a subset of elements from 0 to i with sum equal to j.

2. **Efficient Memory Allocation:** Instead of using calloc to allocate memory, using the new operator is more efficient and idiomatic in C++. 

3. **Input/Output Speed:** Instead of using cin and cout for input/output, using scanf and printf is faster and can save time when dealing with large inputs/outputs.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Dynamic Programming:** We initialize the first column as true, as the sum 0 can always be formed by taking no elements. Then, for every element, we check if we can include it to reach the sum j (dp[i][j] will be true if dp[i-1][j] or dp[i-1][j-arr[i]] is true). If the sum can be formed, we print "yes", otherwise "no".

2. **Efficient Memory Allocation:** We replace the calloc function with the new operator to allocate memory for the array 'N'.

3. **Input/Output Speed:** We replace cin and cout with scanf and printf for faster input/output.

## Optimized Code Block

Following is the optimized code for the problem:

```C++
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int *N;
int n;

bool subsetSum(int sum) {
    bool dp[n+1][sum+1];
    for (int i=0; i<=n; i++)
        dp[i][0] = true;
    for (int i=1; i<=sum; i++)
        dp[0][i] = false;
    for (int i=1; i<=n; i++){
        for (int j=1; j<=sum; j++){
            if (j < N[i-1])
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];
            if (j >= N[i-1])
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] || dp[i - 1][j-N[i-1]];
        }
    }
    return dp[n][sum];
}

int main() {
    int t;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    N = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &N[i]);
    }
    scanf("%d", &t);
    for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
        int p;
        scanf("%d", &p);
        if (subsetSum(p)) {
            printf("yes\n");
        } else {
            printf("no\n");
        }
    }
    delete[] N;
    return 0;
}
```

## Trade-offs

This solution has a space complexity of O(sum*n), which might be a problem for large values of sum and n. But it drastically reduces the time complexity from O(2^n) to O(sum*n) which is a significant improvement. In performance tuning, there is often a trade-off between time and space, and here we opt to use a bit more space to get a huge reduction in time.
