This C++ code is a simple program that takes a series of numbers and checks if a subset of those numbers sums up to a given target value. The key function "solve" makes use of recursion to try all possible subsets. 

1. Code Analysis:

The most obvious performance bottleneck in this code is the recursive function `solve()`. This function has an exponential time complexity due to its recursive nature, which makes it perform poorly for large inputs. It also doesn't take advantage of any previous computations, which leads to a lot of redundant work. 

2. Optimization Strategy:

A. Use Dynamic Programming: We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. This approach can drastically reduce the time complexity from exponential to polynomial. 

B. Avoid Recursion: Recursion is usually expensive in terms of both time and space complexity. By using dynamic programming, we can avoid recursion entirely.

C. Optimize Memory Usage: The current code makes use of a dynamically allocated array "N". This is not necessary and could be replaced by a local array or a vector, which would manage memory more efficiently.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

A. Use Dynamic Programming: The core idea behind dynamic programming is to break down a problem into sub-problems, solve each sub-problem only once, and store their results in case they are needed later. This prevents the need for redundant computations and can drastically improve runtime. The 'solve' function can be re-written to implement this approach.

B. Avoid Recursion: The current recursive implementation of the 'solve' function can be replaced by an iterative one. This will not only make the code more efficient but also easier to understand and debug.

C. Optimize Memory Usage: Instead of using a dynamically allocated array, we can use a local array or a vector. This will not only make the code simpler and less prone to memory leaks but also more efficient as dynamic memory allocation is often slower than stack allocation.

4. Optimized Code Block:

Below is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, t;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> N(n);
  for (int& num : N) {
    cin >> num;
  }
  cin >> t;
  while(t--) {
    int p;
    cin >> p;
    vector<bool> dp(p+1, false);
    dp[0] = true;
    for (int& num : N) {
      for (int j = p; j >= num; --j) {
        dp[j] = dp[j] || dp[j - num];
      }
    }
    if (dp[p]) {
      cout << "yes" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we use a vector "dp" to keep track of whether a sum "j" can be formed by the numbers we have seen so far. We update "dp" in a bottom-up manner. This way, we avoid the need for recursion and also make use of previous computations, thus improving the runtime.
