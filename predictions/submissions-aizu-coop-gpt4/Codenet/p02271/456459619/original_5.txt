This code is a naive solution to a subset-sum problem, which checks if a subset of an array of integers sums up to a certain value. The problem is solved using recursion, which creates a tree of possibilities that have a depth of 'n' (the length of the array). The code has a high time complexity of O(2^n), which is due to the two recursive function calls in the 'solve' function. 

Given the nature of problem, the code can be optimized using dynamic programming to reduce the time complexity to O(n*m), where 'n' is the length of the array and 'm' is the sum to be checked.

Optimization Strategy:

1. **Inefficient Data Structures:** The array 'N' is efficient for this problem. No changes are needed in this aspect.

2. **Redundant Computation:** The recursive calls in the 'solve' function are calculating the same sub-problems multiple times. This can be solved using a dynamic programming approach to store the results of sub-problems and reuse them whenever required.

3. **Loops and Recursive Calls:** The recursive calls in the 'solve' function can be replaced by a loop in the dynamic programming solution.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** No specific compiler optimization is suggested for this code.

Now I'll explain the steps to optimize the code in detail.

1. **Dynamic Programming Array:** We create a boolean array dp[n+1][m+1] where dp[i][j] is true if a subset of array elements from index 0 to i can sum up to j.

2. **Initialize DP Array:** The first row of the DP array is set to false except dp[0][0] because a sum of 0 can be obtained by taking no elements. The first column is set to true because a sum of 0 can always be obtained from any subset.

3. **Fill DP Array:** For each number, we check if we can find a subset of array[0..i-1] with a sum equal to the sum minus the number. If we can, we include the number in our subset. If we can't, then we exclude the number from our subset.

4. **Return Result:** The final answer will be dp[n][m] which means we can find a subset with sum equal to m using elements from 0 to n.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool solve(vector<int> &N, int m) {
    int n = N.size();
    vector<vector<bool> > dp(n + 1, vector<bool>(m + 1, false));

    // Initialize first column as true
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
        dp[i][0] = true;

    // Fill dp table
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
            if (j >= N[i - 1])
                dp[i][j] |= dp[i - 1][j - N[i - 1]];
        }
    }

    // Return result
    return dp[n][m];
}

int main() {
    int n, t;
    cin >> n;

    vector<int> N(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> N[i];

    cin >> t;
    for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
        int p;
        cin >> p;

        if (solve(N, p))
            cout << "yes" << endl;
        else
            cout << "no" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
The above code has a time complexity of O(n*m) and a space complexity of O(n*m) too, where 'n' is the length of the array and 'm' is the sum to be checked. This is a major improvement over the original recursive solution with a time complexity of O(2^n). The trade-off here is that we are using extra space to store the dp table, but considering the time efficiency gained, this is a worthwhile trade-off.
