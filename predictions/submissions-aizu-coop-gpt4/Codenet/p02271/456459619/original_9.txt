The given code is solving the Subset Sum problem, which is a classic problem in computer science. Given a set of integers and a target integer `t`, it checks if there's a subset of the given set that sums up to `t`.

### Code Analysis
The current implementation uses a recursive function `solve()` that checks all possibilities. It's a typical implementation using depth-first search (DFS). However, this code has a major performance issue: it does not remember previously computed values, which leads to a high number of repeated calculations, especially for large inputs. This issue can be resolved using dynamic programming (DP) to store previously computed results.

### Optimization Strategy
The following steps are proposed to optimize the code:

1. Replace the recursive function with an iterative one that uses dynamic programming.
2. Use a boolean array `dp[]` to store whether a sum is reachable.
3. The size of the array `dp[]` should be the maximum possible sum, plus one.
4. Initialize `dp[0]` as true, and the rest as false.
5. Iterate over the array `N[]`, and for each number, iterate over the `dp[]` array in reverse order. If `dp[j]` is true, set `dp[j + N[i]]` to true.
6. After filling `dp[]`, return the value of `dp[t]`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation
1. The recursive function call is replaced with an iterative loop which is usually faster as it avoids the overhead of function calls.
2. The dynamic programming array `dp[]` is used to avoid redundant calculations. Once a certain sum is found to be possible, it is stored in the `dp[]` array, and the same information is used later without re-calculation.
3. Iterating over the `dp[]` array in reverse order ensures that each number is used only once. This is equivalent to the original recursive function where each number can be used at most once.
4. The initialization of `dp[0]` as true represents the case where we can form a sum of zero by choosing no numbers.

### Optimized Code Block

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, t;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> N(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> N[i];
  }
  cin >> t;
  vector<int> dp(20000, false);
  dp[0] = true;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = dp.size() - 1; j >= N[i]; j--) {
      dp[j] = dp[j] || dp[j - N[i]];
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    int p;
    cin >> p;
    if (dp[p]) {
      cout << "yes" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this code assumes that the maximum sum is less than 20000. You might need to adjust this value according to your specific problem.
