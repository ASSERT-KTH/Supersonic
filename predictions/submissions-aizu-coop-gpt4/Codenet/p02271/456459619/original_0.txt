The given program seems to be solving a variant of the Subset Sum Problem. It's given a set of numbers and a target sum, and it needs to determine whether a subset of the numbers can sum up to the target.

Code Analysis:
1. The current solution uses recursion to solve the problem. For each number, it makes two recursive calls, one including the number in the sum and one excluding it. This results in an exponential time complexity due to overlapping subproblems.

2. It does not use any memoization or dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems, causing redundant computations.

3. The use of dynamic memory allocation for `N` is not a bottleneck, but it does require manual memory management.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use Dynamic Programming: The current solution can be optimized using a dynamic programming approach. This will avoid redundant computations and reduce the time complexity from exponential to polynomial.

2. Avoid Dynamic Memory Allocation: The use of dynamic memory allocation is not necessary in this case. An STL container such as `std::vector` can be used instead.

3. Compiler Optimizations: The `-O2` or `-O3` compiler flags can be used for additional performance optimization.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> N;
int n;

bool solve(int target) {
  vector<vector<bool>> dp(n+1, vector<bool>(target+1, false));
  dp[0][0] = true;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= target; j++) {
      if (j < N[i]) {
        dp[i+1][j] = dp[i][j];
      } else {
        dp[i+1][j] = dp[i][j] || dp[i][j-N[i]];
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[n][target];
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> n;
  N.resize(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> N[i];
  }
  cin >> t;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    int p;
    cin >> p;
    if (solve(p)) {
      cout << "yes" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The Dynamic Programming approach creates a 2D table `dp` of size `(n+1)x(target+1)`. `dp[i][j]` is true if there exists a subset of elements from `N[0]` to `N[i-1]` with sum equal to `j`.
2. The first row is initialized to `false` except `dp[0][0]` which is `true`, representing an empty subset with sum 0.
3. The table is then populated row by row. For each number at index `i` and each target sum `j`, if `j` is less than `N[i]`, `dp[i+1][j]` is set to `dp[i][j]`. Otherwise, `dp[i+1][j]` is true if either `dp[i][j]` is true or if `dp[i][j-N[i]]` is true.
4. The result is `dp[n][target]`, which tells whether a subset with sum `target` can be formed from the first `n` numbers.
5. `std::vector` is used instead of dynamic memory allocation for `N`, avoiding the need for manual memory management.
6. The `-O2` or `-O3` compiler flags can be used for additional performance optimization. These flags tell the compiler to perform more aggressive optimizations such as function inlining and loop unrolling.

Trade-offs:
1. The Dynamic Programming approach uses more memory than the recursive approach. However, it significantly reduces the time complexity.
2. The code becomes a bit more complex due to the introduction of the `dp` table.
3. The compiler optimizations can sometimes lead to longer compilation times and larger executable sizes. However, they often result in significant performance improvements.
