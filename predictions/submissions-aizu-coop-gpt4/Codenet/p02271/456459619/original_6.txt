1. **Code Analysis:**

The provided code constitutes a simple subset sum problem. The recursive function `solve()` checks if there's a subset in array `N` that sums up to a given number `m`. However, the function employs a brute force approach, which is highly inefficient as it has a time complexity of O(2^n), where `n` is the size of the array. This is because in the worst-case scenario, it explores all possible subsets.

2. **Optimization Strategy:**

The main optimization strategy here would be to reduce the time complexity of the `solve()` function. This can be achieved by using dynamic programming, which provides a more efficient time complexity of O(n*m) as it avoids redundant computations by storing and reusing previous results.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

    1. Replace the recursive `solve()` function with an iterative one that uses a two-dimensional boolean array, `dp[][]`. The idea is to construct this array in a bottom-up manner such that `dp[i][j]` will be `true` if there is a subset of `N[0..i-1]` with sum equal to `j`, and `false` otherwise. Initially, all values in `dp[][]` are set to `false`.

    2. Set all values in `dp[i][0]` to `true` for `i=0` to `n` (inclusive) because there is always an empty subset with sum 0.

    3. For each number from `N[]`, we update our `dp[][]` array to include the sum `j` such that `j` is greater than or equal to the current number and there is a subset with sum `j-current_number`.

    4. The final solution will be in `dp[n][m]`.

4. **Optimized Code Block:**

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool solve(vector<int>& N, int m) {
    int n = N.size();
    vector<vector<bool>> dp(n + 1, vector<bool>(m + 1, false));

    for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
        dp[i][0] = true;

    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for(int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
            if(N[i-1] <= j)
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-N[i-1]] || dp[i-1][j];
            else
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];
        }
    }
    return dp[n][m];
}

int main() {
    int n, t;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> N(n);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> N[i];
    }
    cin >> t;
    for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
        int p;
        cin >> p;
        if(solve(N, p))
            cout << "yes" << endl;
        else
            cout << "no" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, I've also replaced the `calloc` call with `vector`, a safer and more idiomatic C++ data structure for dynamic arrays. This eliminates potential memory leaks that can occur with manual memory management and is more efficient in terms of memory allocation. This change, however, does not significantly affect the program's performance.

The trade-off here is that the code is a bit more complex due to the use of dynamic programming. However, the significant increase in efficiency makes it well worth it.
