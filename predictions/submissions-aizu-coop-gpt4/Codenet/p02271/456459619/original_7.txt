## Code Analysis
The given code is a C++ program that implements a solution for the subset-sum problem. It recursively checks if there is a subset of the elements in the array N that adds up to a given number. 

The solve function uses recursion to explore two possibilities for each element: including it in the sum or not. This implementation results in an exponential time complexity of O(2^n), which is very inefficient for large values of n.

## Optimization Strategy
1. **Change Data Structures:** The current data structure is an integer array. No change is needed here as it is already efficient for the task at hand.

2. **Remove Redundant Computations:** The recursive approach is leading to many redundant computations as it tries to solve the same sub-problems multiple times. We can use dynamic programming to store the results of sub-problems and avoid recalculations.

3. **Optimize Recursive Calls:** As stated above, the problem can be solved using dynamic programming to avoid redundant recursion.

4. **Compiler Optimizations:** Using the `-O3` flag with the g++ compiler can help perform compiler-level optimizations.

## Step-By-Step Explanation
1. **Use Dynamic Programming:** We can solve this problem using a dynamic programming approach, where we construct a table dp[i][j] which is true if a subset of {N[1], N[2], ..., N[i]} has a sum equal to j.

2. **Trade-offs:** The dynamic programming approach will increase the space complexity to O(n*m), where n is the number of elements and m is the target sum. However, it will decrease the time complexity to O(n*m) as well, which results in a significant improvement for large inputs.

## Optimized Code Block
```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, t;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  vector<int> N(n, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &N[i]);
  }
  scanf("%d", &t);
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    int p;
    scanf("%d", &p);
    vector<vector<bool>> dp(n+1, vector<bool>(p+1, false));
    dp[0][0] = true;
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
      dp[i][0] = true;
      for(int j=1; j<=p; j++){
        if(j<N[i-1]) dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];
        else dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] || dp[i-1][j-N[i-1]];
      }
    }
    if (dp[n][p]) {
      cout << "yes" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
}
```
In the optimized code, we changed the `solve` function to a dynamic programming solution. We constructed a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is `true` if a subset of `{N[1], N[2], ..., N[i]}` has a sum equal to `j`. This change significantly reduces the time complexity from exponential to polynomial.
