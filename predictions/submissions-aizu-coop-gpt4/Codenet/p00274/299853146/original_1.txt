Code Analysis and Optimization Strategy:

1. The program seems to read a series of integers from the standard input. The first integer 'n' represents the size of the series, followed by 'n' integers. For each series, the program calculates a value 's', which is equal to the number of non-zero elements in the series, and checks if there is at least one element greater than or equal to 2 ('flg' variable). If so, it prints 's+1', else it prints 'NA'.

2. The program uses a while(1) loop for continuous input until a series of size '0' is input. This is efficient and does not need to be changed.

3. The 's' variable is initially set to the size of the series and then decreases every time a '0' is encountered in the series. Instead of doing this, we can set 's' to '0' initially and increment it every time a non-zero element is encountered. This will reduce the number of operations.

4. The variable 't' is set to '0' at the end of each iteration but it is never used in the program. This is unnecessary and can be removed.

5. The 'flg' variable is checked after the loop to decide what to print. Instead, we can print the result immediately when 'flg' is set to '1' and break the loop. This will save unnecessary iterations of the loop.

6. The 'h' variable is declared but never used. This can be removed.

Optimized Code Block:

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int s = 0, n, k, i, flg;
  while (1) {
    flg = 0;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    s = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &k);
      if (k != 0) {
        s = s + 1;
      }
      if (k >= 2) {
        printf("%d\n", s + 1);
        flg = 1;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (flg == 0) {
      printf("NA\n");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. We removed the unused variables 'h' and 't'.
2. We changed the approach to calculate 's'. Instead of decrementing 's' each time a '0' is encountered, we initialize 's' to '0' and increment it each time a non-zero integer is encountered. This reduces the number of operations.
3. As soon as we find a number greater than or equal to 2, we print the result 's+1' and break the loop, saving unnecessary iterations.
4. If we do not find any number greater than or equal to 2 in the series, we print "NA".

Trade-offs: The optimized code is slightly more complex due to the introduction of the break statement inside the loop. However, this increase in complexity is justified by the potential for a significant speedup in the case of large series with an early occurrence of a number greater than or equal to 2.
