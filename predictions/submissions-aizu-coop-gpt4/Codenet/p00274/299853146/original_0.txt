The provided code accepts an integer 'n'. It then accepts 'n' more integers, and for each one, it checks if the integer is not equal to 0, it decrements the count of 'n'. If any of the integers is greater than or equal to 2, it sets the flag to 1. If the flag is 1, it prints the final count of 'n' plus one, otherwise it prints "NA". 

The code runs in linear time complexity O(n) with constant space complexity O(1). Therefore, it is generally efficient. However, let's identify possible areas for optimization:

1. **Redundant Variable**: The variable 't' is initialized and reset, but never actually used, so it can be removed.
2. **Input Validation**: Currently, the code doesn't check for successful input from `scanf()`. Adding a check will make the code more robust.
3. **Early Termination**: If 'k' equals 2 or greater, the code can break out of the loop early because it has found what it needs and there's no need to process further inputs.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int n, k, i, flg;
  
  while (1) {
    flg = 0;
    
    // Validate input
    if(scanf("%d", &n) != 1)
      break;
      
    if (n == 0)
      break;
      
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      // Validate input
      if(scanf("%d", &k) != 1)
        break;
      
      if (k == 0) {
        n = n - 1;
      }
      else if (k >= 2) {
        flg = 1;
        break; // Early termination
      }
    }
    
    if (flg == 1) {
      printf("%d\n", n + 1);
    } else {
      printf("NA\n");
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

1. **Redundant Variable**: I removed the unused variable 't', which optimizes memory usage.
2. **Input Validation**: I added input validation for `scanf()`, improving overall robustness.
3. **Early Termination**: I added a `break` statement for early termination when 'k' is greater than or equal to 2, which can significantly improve performance when 'n' is large.
