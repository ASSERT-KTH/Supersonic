Code Analysis:
The provided code is a console application that repeatedly reads an integer `n` from the user, followed by `n` more integers. It counts the number of non-zero inputs and then checks if any of the `n` inputs was greater than or equal to 2. If so, the code increments the non-zero count by 1 and prints it. Otherwise, it prints "NA". This continues until the user enters `n = 0`.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Unnecessary Variables: The code has some variables (`h`, `t`) that are not used and can be removed.
2. Redundant Computations: The variable `s` is initially assigned `n` and then decremented every time a zero is encountered. Instead, we can initialize `s` to zero and increment it every time a non-zero is encountered, which might be more efficient if zeros are less frequent.
3. Inefficient Flow Control: The `flg` variable is used to track if any input is greater than or equal to 2. This is used to decide whether to print `s + 1` or "NA". Instead of keeping track of this with a flag, we can just break out of the loop as soon as we encounter a number greater than or equal to 2, and print `s + 1` immediately. If the loop completes without breaking, we can print "NA". This can significantly reduce the number of iterations in some cases.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove Unused Variables: Removing unused variables `h` and `t` will reduce memory usage.
2. Count Non-Zeros: Instead of decrementing `s` whenever a zero is encountered, we increment `s` whenever a non-zero is encountered. This change might improve performance if zeros are less frequent than non-zeros.
3. Early Exit: If we encounter a number greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the loop and print `s + 1` immediately. This can reduce the number of iterations in the loop and thus improve performance. If the loop completes without breaking, we print "NA".

Trade-offs:
The proposed optimizations make the code slightly more complex. However, they can significantly improve performance, particularly for large input sizes. The memory usage is also slightly improved by removing unused variables.

Optimized Code Block:
```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int n, k, s, i;
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    s = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &k);
      if (k != 0) {
        s++;
        if (k >= 2) {
          printf("%d\n", s + 1);
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    if (i == n) {
      printf("NA\n");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
