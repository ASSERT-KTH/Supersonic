```
The changes made in the code are as follows:
1. Instead of computing the maximum attack value in a loop, a variable `mm` is used to keep track of the maximum value.
2. The `attack` array is not sorted and is not required to be sorted. Therefore, there is no need to sort it.
3. The variable `mm` is used instead of `attack[k]` in the calculation of `x`.
4. The output statements are not changed.
