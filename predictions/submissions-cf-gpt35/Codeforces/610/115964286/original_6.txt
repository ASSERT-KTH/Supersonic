```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    long long n;
    cin >> n;
    if (n % 2 != 0) {
        cout << "0";
    } else {
        cout << (n / 4);
    }
    return 0;
}
``` 

Explanation:
- The `bits/stdc++.h` header is not recommended to use as it includes all the standard library headers which may increase the compilation time and memory usage. Instead, include only the required headers.
- Use `NULL` instead of `0` for `cin.tie` and `cout.tie` to avoid a compiler warning.
- The `FASTIO` macro is not required as it is only used once in the code.
- Use `long long` instead of `ll` for better readability.
- Instead of calculating `(n / 2) - 1` and then dividing by 2, we can simply calculate `n / 4`, which is more efficient.
