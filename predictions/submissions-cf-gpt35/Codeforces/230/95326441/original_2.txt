Explanation:

The previous code had two functions, one for the sieve of Eratosthenes (for finding prime numbers) and one for a recursive power function. However, these functions were never called in the code. Thus they were removed.

The new code uses a binary search function instead of the sqrt() function for finding the square root of a number. This is because a binary search function has a logarithmic time complexity, while sqrt() has a constant time complexity. This improves the running time of the code.

The isPrime() function was also optimized by removing the unnecessary check for numbers less than or equal to 1, since they are not prime. Additionally, the loop was changed to only iterate up to the square root of n, since any factors of n above the square root must have a corresponding factor less than the square root. This also improves the running time of the code.

Finally, the logic of the main function was simplified to directly check if a number is both a perfect square and a prime number. This removes the need for an extra variable and an additional check.
