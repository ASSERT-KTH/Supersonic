Explanation:
- The original code is already quite optimized and there are not many changes that can be made.
- The only change I made is to correct the size of the "dp" array. The original size was set to N = 2 * 1e5 + 10, but the loop for "j" goes up to 200005, so I changed the size to match that.
- Other than that, the code is already efficient and there are no further optimizations that can be made.
