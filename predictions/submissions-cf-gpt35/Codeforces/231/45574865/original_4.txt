Here is the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, hasil = 0;
    cin >> n;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int temp = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
            int y;
            cin >> y;
            if (y == 1) {
                temp++;
            }
        }
        if (temp >= 2) {
            hasil++;
        }
    }
    
    cout << hasil;
    return 0;
}
```

I have moved the declaration of the `temp` variable inside the outer loop to ensure that it is reset to 0 for each iteration. This eliminates the need to manually reset it to 0 after each inner loop iteration.

I have also moved the declaration of the `y` variable inside the inner loop to ensure that a new `y` variable is created for each iteration. This avoids potential issues with stale values from previous iterations.

These changes improve the readability and maintainability of the code without sacrificing performance or memory usage.
