```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int temp, n, m, a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> temp;
      temp % 2 ? a++ : c++;
    }
    cin >> m;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      cin >> temp;
      temp % 2 ? b++ : d++;
    }
    cout << (long long)a * b + (long long)c * d << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
I removed the `bits/stdc++.h` header file which is not a standard header file and is not recommended to be used in the code. Instead, I added the required header files. I also removed the `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` statements as they can actually slow down the program. Finally, I added the `(long long)` typecasting to the arithmetic expression to prevent integer overflow.
