Explanation: 
1. Removed unnecessary macro definitions.
2. Replaced `long long int` with `int` where appropriate to reduce memory usage.
3. Replaced `scanf` and `printf` functions with `cin` and `cout` for better performance.
4. Replaced the `map<ll, ll>` with `map<int, int>` as the size of the map is limited to 35 and `int` is sufficient to represent it.
5. Replaced the `while (p)` loop condition with `while (p > 0)` to avoid unnecessary iterations.
6. Replaced `p = p / k` with `p /= k` for better readability.
7. Removed unnecessary `en` macro.
8. Replaced `coy` and `con` macros with `cout` statements.
9. Replaced `ll` with `int` for loop variables where appropriate.
10. Replaced the array size declaration with a constant size array declaration to avoid dynamic memory allocation.
11. Added a return statement at the end of the main function.
