```cpp

    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);

    vector<long long> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
  
    multiset<long long> s;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        auto it = s.lower_bound(a[i]);
        if (it != s.end()) {
            s.erase(it);
        }

Explanation: 
1. Removed unnecessary headers.
2. Removed macros and replaced them with their actual code.
3. Removed unnecessary typedefs and constants.
4. Removed the `mod` and `pow` functions since they are not used.
5. Removed the `debug` macro since it is not used.
6. Removed the `Main` function and moved its code to the `main` function.
7. Removed the unnecessary loop for `q` since it is always 1.
8. Removed the `bits/stdc++.h` header as it is not recommended to use.
