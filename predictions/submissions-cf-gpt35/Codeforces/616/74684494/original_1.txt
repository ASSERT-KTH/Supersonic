Explanation: 
1. I added constants `MAX_N` and `MAX_X` to represent the maximum values for `n` and `x` respectively. This allows for better code readability and prevents magic numbers.
2. I changed the array sizes to use the constants `MAX_N` and `MAX_X` instead of hardcoding the sizes.
3. I removed unnecessary headers `algorithm` and `iostream` since they are not used in the code.
4. I removed the `using namespace std;` statement since it is generally considered bad practice.
5. I added comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.
6. Overall, the optimizations made in this code are minimal as the original code is already quite efficient.
