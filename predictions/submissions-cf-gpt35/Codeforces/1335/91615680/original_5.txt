    int maks = 0, temp = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
      if (arr[i]) {
        temp++;
        if (arr[i] > maks)
          maks = arr[i];
      }
    }

Explanation:
1. Replaced the fixed size array `arr` with a vector to avoid potential buffer overflow.
2. Removed the unnecessary initialization of `arr` inside the while loop since it is already initialized at the beginning of each iteration.
3. Replaced the range-based for loop with a regular for loop to avoid the overhead of iterating over the whole vector.
4. Replaced the variable `x` with `i` in the second for loop to improve readability.
5. Used `arr.size()` instead of hardcoding the size of the array in the second for loop.
6. Limited the scope of variables `t`, `n`, and `x` to their respective loops.
7. Removed the unnecessary `using namespace std;` directive to avoid polluting the global namespace.
