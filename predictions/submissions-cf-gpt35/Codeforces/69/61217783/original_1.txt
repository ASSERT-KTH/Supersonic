```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int sum_x = 0, sum_y = 0, sum_z = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x, y, z;
    cin >> x >> y >> z;
    sum_x += x;
    sum_y += y;
    sum_z += z;
  }
  if (sum_x == 0 && sum_y == 0 && sum_z == 0) {
    cout << "YES";
  } else {
    cout << "NO";
  }
  return 0;
}

Explanation: The given code does not have any major performance or memory usage issues. It reads an integer `n` from the user, and then reads `n` sets of three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`. It calculates the sum of `x`, `y`, and `z` separately using three variables `sum_x`, `sum_y`, and `sum_z`. Finally, it checks if all the sums are zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly. The code is already optimized and there is no need for further improvements.
