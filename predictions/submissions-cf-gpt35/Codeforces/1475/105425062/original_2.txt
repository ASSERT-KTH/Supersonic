Explanation:

1. Removed sorting operation as it is not required for the solution.

2. Changed the inner loop which was running till sqrt(i) to run from 2*i to 2e5, as we are checking for multiples of i.

3. Removed the check for 1 in the dp loop, as it is not required.

4. Changed the dp loop to only update multiples of i and not all the numbers less than i.

5. Removed the initialization of dp array to zero as it is not required.

6. Removed the initialization of cnt array to zero, as it is not required.

7. Removed the vector cnt and its initialization, as it is not required.

8. Removed the max function call in the inner loop, as it is not required.

9. Removed the outer loop as it is not required.
