Optimizations:
- Removed unnecessary header files
- Removed `LSOne` macro as it was unused
- Changed the `vector<long long>` to `vector<int>` as the array size is limited to 2e5+1, which is well within the bounds of an `int`.
- Removed the `cnt[v[i]]++` line from the loop and added it in the if statement that checks if `dp[curr] == 0`. This optimization only performs the count of the number of times each value occurs once, instead of twice.
- Removed the double loop that calculates the divisors and changed it to a single loop.
- Changed the loop condition from `i < dp.size()` to `i < v.size()` as elements beyond `n` are not being processed.
- Replaced the `max(dp[i], max(dp[j], dp[i / j]))` line with `dp[j] += curr_cnt` and `dp[curr / j] += curr_cnt` to avoid the expensive `max` function calls and extra comparisons.
- Changed `long long` to `int` as the values being stored in the vectors are well within the bounds of an `int`.
