Explanation: 

1. Removed unnecessary includes and typedefs.
2. Removed the custom sort functions as they are not used in the code.
3. Changed the map type from `ll` to `int` to reduce memory usage.
4. Removed unused constants.
5. Changed the `map` and `sum` types from `ll` to `int` to reduce memory usage.
6. Removed the `sort` function for strings as it is not used in the code.
7. Removed the `using namespace std` directive as it is considered a bad practice.
8. Removed unnecessary comments and fixed indentation for better readability.
