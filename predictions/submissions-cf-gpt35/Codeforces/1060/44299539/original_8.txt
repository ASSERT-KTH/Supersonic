I made the following changes to the program:

1. Removed the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard header file and is not recommended to be used.

2. Added the line `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can lead to a significant improvement in the program's performance.

3. Added the line `cin.tie(nullptr)` to untie cin from cout, which can lead to a small improvement in the program's performance.

4. Changed the initialization of `s_n` and `s_m` to `1e18` instead of `10e10`. This ensures that the variables are initialized to a large enough value and avoids overflow.

5. Added curly braces around the for loops that calculate `s_n` and `s_m`, to make the code more readable and to avoid potential issues with multiple statements being executed inside a loop without braces.

6. Changed the output statement to `cout << ans << '\n'` to avoid flushing the output buffer unnecessarily.
