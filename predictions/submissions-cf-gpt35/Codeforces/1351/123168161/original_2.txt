```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int a1, b1, a2, b2;
    cin >> a1 >> b1 >> a2 >> b2;
    int max1 = max(a1, b1), max2 = max(a2, b2);
    if (max1 == max2 && min(a1, b1) + min(a2, b2) == max1)
      cout << "YES\n";
    else
      cout << "NO\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation: 

- `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` are used to optimize the input/output streams in C++ which results in faster input/output operations.
- Replacing `endl` with `"\n"` is faster because `endl` flushes the output buffer which takes extra time. 
- There is no need to include the header file `bits/stdc++.h` as it is not a standard header file and is not supported by all compilers. It is better to include specific header files that are required for the program.
