```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int d, k, n;
    std::cin >> d >> k >> n;
    n = n * (n + 1) / 2;
    n = n * d;
    if (n > k) {
        std::cout << n - k;
    } else {
        std::cout << "0";
    }
}
```

Optimizations made:
- Removed unnecessary include statements.
- Removed the unnecessary "using namespace std" statement.
- Removed the unnecessary <stdio.h> include statement.
- Changed the data type of variables from "long" to "int" since they are not required to be long.
- Removed the unnecessary check `(n - k) > 0` and simplified the if condition to `n > k`.
- Changed `cout << "0"` to `std::cout << "0"` for consistency.
- Used `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `cin` and `cout` respectively.
