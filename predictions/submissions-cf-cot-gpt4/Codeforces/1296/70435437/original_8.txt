The given C++ code is a test case checker for a certain problem. It reads an integer value as the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n and then reads n more integers. It checks if these integers are odd or even and stores the counts in an array a. If there are no odd numbers or if there are even numbers of even numbers and no odd numbers, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES". 

Here are the steps to optimize the code:

1. Precompute the results of the ternary operator: The ternary operator inside the cout statement is a bit complex. It's better to precompute it and store the result in a bool variable. This makes the code more readable and avoids potential issues with operator precedence. 

2. Reduce the number of array operations: Currently, the code is incrementing the array elements for each input number. This can be avoided by using two separate integer variables to store the counts of odd and even numbers. 

3. Remove unnecessary ios_base::sync_with_stdio and cin.tie statements: These statements are used to speed up the input/output operations by unsynchronizing C++ standard streams with C standard streams and by untieing cin from cout. However, in this case, these statements are not necessary because the input/output operations are not that heavy. Removing these statements can make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int test;
  cin >> test;
  while (test--) {
    int n, odd = 0, even = 0;
    cin >> n;
    for (int temp, i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> temp;
      if(temp % 2 == 0)
        even++;
      else
        odd++;
    }
    bool result = !(odd == 0 || (even == 0 && (odd % 2 == 0)));
    cout << (result ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
