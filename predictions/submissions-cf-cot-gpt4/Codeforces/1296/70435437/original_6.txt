There are several steps to optimizing this C/C++ program:

1. Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` directive: This header file is quite large and includes more libraries than you need, which can slow down the compilation time. It's also not standard and not supported by some compilers. Instead, include only the libraries you need, which in this case are `iostream`.

2. Use standard array instead of C-style array: The current array `a` is a C-style array. While this isn't inherently bad, using a `std::array` can provide benefits such as bounds checking and compatibility with C++ algorithms.

3. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program currently calculates `temp % 2` twice. You can store the result in a variable to avoid calculating it twice.

4. Avoid unnecessary operations: The program currently increments `i` in the for loop condition. This is not necessary and can be done in the loop body instead.

Here's the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    int test;
    cin >> test;
    while (test--) {
        int n;
        array<int, 2> a = {};
        cin >> n;
        for (int temp, i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            cin >> temp;
            int mod = temp % 2;
            a[mod]++;
        }
        cout << (a[1] == 0 || (a[0] == 0 && (a[1] % 2 == 0)) ? "NO\n" : "YES\n");
    }
}
```

This code does the exact same thing as your original program, but with a few optimizations to reduce memory usage and running time.
