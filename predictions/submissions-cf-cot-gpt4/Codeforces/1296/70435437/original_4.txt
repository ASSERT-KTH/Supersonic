Here are the steps to optimize this code:

1. The array initialization `int a[2] = {};` is inside the while loop. This means that for each test, the array is initialized. This can be avoided by initializing the array outside the while loop and resetting it to 0 at the beginning of each test. This can improve the running time.

2. The condition `a[1] == 0 || (a[0] == 0 && (a[1] % 2 == 0))` can be simplified by using De Morgan's law. This doesn't have a huge impact on performance, but it makes the code cleaner and easier to understand which is always a good optimization.

3. There is no need to use `bits/stdc++.h` as it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increases the compilation time. Instead, we can include only necessary libraries: `iostream`.

The optimized code should look like this:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  int test;
  cin >> test;
  
  int a[2];
  
  while (test--) {
    a[0] = a[1] = 0;
    
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    for (int temp, i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> temp;
      a[temp % 2]++;
    }
    
    cout << (!(a[1] == 0 || (a[0] == 0 && (a[1] % 2 == 0))) ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
  }
}
```

Please note that these are just minor optimizations and the actual performance gain might not be significant.
