This program reads a series of test cases. Each test case consists of a series of integers. The program checks if there is an odd number of odd integers or an even number of odd integers and no even integers. If it is, it outputs "YES", otherwise it outputs "NO".

Here are some steps that can be taken to optimize this code:

1. The temp variable is declared in every iteration of the loop, which is unnecessary. We can declare it outside the loop to reduce the overhead of memory allocation and deallocation.

2. The i++ < n condition in the for loop checks the condition before incrementing the loop counter. It would be better to increment the counter after the loop body is executed.

3. The condition in the cout statement is complex and involves multiple bitwise operations. We can simplify it by adding an if-else statement that checks the condition and outputs the result instead.

4. We can avoid using namespace std, because it includes the entire standard library. We can include only the necessary libraries, i.e., iostream.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);
    std::cout.tie(NULL);
    int test;
    std::cin >> test;
    while (test--) {
        int n, a[2] = {};
        std::cin >> n;
        int temp;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            std::cin >> temp;
            a[temp % 2]++;
        }
        if (a[1] == 0 || (a[0] == 0 && a[1] % 2 == 0)) {
            std::cout << "NO\n";
        } else {
            std::cout << "YES\n";
        }
    }
}
```
This optimized program should run faster and use less memory than the original one.
