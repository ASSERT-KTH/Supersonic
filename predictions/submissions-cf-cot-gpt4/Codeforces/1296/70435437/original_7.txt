The optimizations for this program are:

1. We can avoid using the "bits/stdc++.h" header file because it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which increases the compilation time. Instead, we will include only the libraries that we need, such as "iostream".

2. The array 'a' is initialized with a size of 2 and all its elements are set to zero. This is not necessary because in C++, all elements of an array are automatically initialized to zero.

3. We can reduce the number of times we are accessing the array 'a' by storing 'temp % 2' in a variable and then using that variable to access the array.

4. We can also remove the unnecessary brackets in the 'cout' statement and use '\n' instead of endl to avoid the unnecessary flushing of the output buffer.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int test;
  cin >> test;
  while (test--) {
    int n, a[2];
    cin >> n;
    for (int temp, i = 0, index; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> temp;
      index = temp % 2;
      a[index]++;
    }
    cout << (a[1] == 0 || a[0] == 0 && a[1] % 2 == 0 ? "NO\n" : "YES\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

After these optimizations, the program will use less memory and run faster compared to the original version.
