First let's understand what the given code does. The program is taking a number of test cases as input. For each test case, it takes an integer 'n' as input, then it takes 'n' numbers as input. It's checking whether any number is even or odd by taking mod of 2. The result is incrementing in array 'a' at 0th index for even and 1st index for odd number. Finally, it's checking whether all the numbers are even or all are odd and even in quantity, if yes then printing "NO" otherwise "YES".

Optimizations:

1. Unnecessary usage of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of files which increases the compilation time. It's better to include only those header files which are being used in the program.

2. Unnecessary usage of `using namespace std;`: This can cause name collisions which could lead to bugs in larger projects. It's better to use std:: before cin, cout, etc.

3. Temp variable declaration can be moved out of the loop to avoid continuous memory allocation and deallocation in each iteration.

4. The `i++ < n` in the for loop is confusing and not a usual way to write loops. It's better to use `i < n` and then increment 'i' inside the loop.

5. The `a[temp % 2]++` can be replaced with simple condition check and increment the counter for odd and even numbers.

6. The condition in the last cout statement is confusing. It can be simplified for better readability.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);
  int test;
  std::cin >> test;
  while (test--) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    int even_count = 0, odd_count = 0;
    int temp;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> temp;
      if(temp % 2 == 0)
        even_count++;
      else
        odd_count++;
    }
    if (odd_count == 0 || (even_count == 0 && odd_count % 2 == 0)) {
      std::cout << "NO\n";
    } else {
      std::cout << "YES\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code is easier to read and understand, and more efficient in terms of memory usage and performance.
