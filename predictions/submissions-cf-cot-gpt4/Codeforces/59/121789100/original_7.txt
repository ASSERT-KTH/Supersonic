Here are the optimization steps:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increases the compilation time. Instead, use only the libraries that are needed. In this case, we will use `#include <iostream>`, `#include <algorithm>`, `#include <string>` and `#include <cctype>`.

2. Instead of using short data type for 'i' and 't', use int. It's because by default, the size of int is 4 bytes and short is 2 bytes. So, the CPU can handle the 4 bytes in one go, but for short, it has to break it down into two 2 bytes. Hence, int is faster than short.

3. Use prefix increment (++i) instead of postfix increment (i++) in loop. It's faster because it doesn't need to keep a copy of the previous value around.

4. Instead of calling `s.size()` in each iteration of the loop, calculate it once and store it in a variable.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>
#include <cctype>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string s;
  cin >> s;

  int lowerCount = 0, sSize = s.size();

  for (int i = 0; i < sSize; ++i) {
    if (s[i] > 96)
      ++lowerCount;
  }

  int upperCount = sSize - lowerCount;

  if (lowerCount < upperCount)
    transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), ::toupper);
  else
    transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), ::tolower);

  cout << s;
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The type of `s[i]` is `char`, so it's comparing ASCII values. ASCII value 96 corresponds to the character '`', so `s[i] > 96` checks if the character is a lowercase letter.
