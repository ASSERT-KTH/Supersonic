Here are the steps to optimize the given program:

1. Instead of using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a lot of unnecessary header files, we should only include the ones we need. This will decrease the compilation time.
2. We're using `short` as the type of `i` and `t`. However, if the size of `s` exceeds the maximum value that a `short` can represent, we would experience an integer overflow. To prevent this, we can use `size_t` which is the best type to represent sizes and is guaranteed to represent the size of any object in memory.
3. The loop that counts the lowercase letters can be optimized by using standard algorithms from the C++ Standard Library. We can use `std::count_if` to count the lowercase letters in one line, thus making the code more readable and efficient.
4. There's no need for `i = s.size() - t;` if we directly compare `t` with `s.size() / 2`. This will reduce memory usage.
5. Using `std::endl` to create a new line also flushes the stream, which can be costly in terms of performance. We can simply use `'\n'` to achieve the same effect without the performance cost.
6. We should return a meaningful exit code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cctype>

int main() {
  std::string s;
  std::cin >> s;
  
  auto count = std::count_if(s.begin(), s.end(), ::islower);

  if (count < s.size() / 2)
    std::transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), ::toupper);
  else
    std::transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), ::tolower);
  
  std::cout << s << '\n';
  
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program is not only more efficient but also more readable, which is always a desirable characteristic in programming.
