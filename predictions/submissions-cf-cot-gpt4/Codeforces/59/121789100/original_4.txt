This program is written in C++ and it's already quite optimized, but we can still do a few small modifications to it:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because it includes a lot of unnecessary headers in the program which increases the compilation time. Instead, include only those headers which are required.

2. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` before the cin statement to speed up the I/O operations.

3. Instead of `s.size()`, use a single variable to store the size of the string. This will save time as the size of the string will be computed only once.

4. Avoid using `transform` function twice in the program. Instead, decide the transformation function (`::toupper` or `::tolower`) beforehand based on `t` and `i` and then apply the transformation.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cctype>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  string s;
  cin >> s;
  
  short i, t = 0;
  short size = s.size();
  for (i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    if (s[i] > 96)
      t++;
  }
  
  i = size - t;
  auto trans = (t < i) ? ::toupper : ::tolower;

  transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), trans);
  cout << s;
  
  return 0;
}
```
