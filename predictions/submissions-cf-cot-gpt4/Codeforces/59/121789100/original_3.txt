This C++ program converts a string to uppercase or lowercase based on the number of uppercase and lowercase characters. If the number of lowercase characters is more than or equal to the number of uppercase characters, it converts the entire string to lowercase. Otherwise, it converts the string to uppercase.

The program is already quite optimized, but there are a couple of small improvements we can make:

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes almost all standard library header files in C++. It's not recommended for production code because it increases compilation time and memory usage. Instead, include only the necessary headers.

2. `short i, t = 0;`: There's no need to declare `i` and `t` as short. In most systems, the size of `short` and `int` is the same, but `int` operations are usually faster.

3. `for (i = 0; i < s.size(); i++)`: In C++, it's more efficient to use prefix increment (++i) than postfix (i++) in for loops.

4. `i = s.size() - t;`: This line is calculating the number of uppercase characters. Instead of calculating it this way, we can calculate it directly in the for loop.

5. `transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), ::toupper);` and `transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), ::tolower);`: These lines are transforming the string to uppercase or lowercase. Instead of applying the transformation to the entire string, we can apply it only to the characters that need to be transformed. But in this case, since it's required to do the transformation on the entire string, we leave it as it is.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::string s;
    std::cin >> s;
    int lower = 0, upper = 0;
    for (char c : s) {
        if (islower(c))
            lower++;
        else 
            upper++;
    }

    if (lower >= upper)
        std::transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), ::tolower);
    else
        std::transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), ::toupper);

    std::cout << s;
    return 0;
}
```
