This C++ program is designed to examine the input string and count the number of lowercase and uppercase letters. If there are more uppercase letters, it converts the whole string to uppercase. If there are more lowercase letters or the counts are equal, it converts the whole string to lowercase.

Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of files, which increases the compilation time. We'll replace it with only the headers we need, which are `#include <algorithm>`, `#include <iostream>`, and `#include <string>`.

2. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);`: This can speed up I/O operations as it unties `cin` and `cout` from `scanf` and `printf`.

3. Avoid using `std::endl`: `std::endl` causes a flush operation, which is usually unnecessary and can slow down your program. We can replace it with "\n".

4. Use prefix increment operator instead of postfix: In C++, the prefix increment operator (++i) is generally more efficient than postfix (i++), because the postfix increment involves a copy of the value before the increment.

5. Use 'auto' for the string size: By using 'auto', it will automatically take the size of the string in a suitable format.

6. Use a single line for transform: Instead of using two separate lines for transform function for both conditions, we use a single line with a ternary operator.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::string s;
  std::cin >> s;
  short t = 0;
  for (auto i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
    if (s[i] > 96)
      ++t;
  }
  auto u = s.size() - t;
  transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), t < u ? ::toupper : ::tolower);
  std::cout << s << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
