This program is pretty optimized, but we can do some small improvements. Here are the steps of optimization:

1. Instead of using `std::vector<int> pref(n + 1);` and then filling it up, you can use the `std::vector::assign` function to initialize and fill the vector at the same time, which can be slightly faster.

2. Instead of using the `max` and `min` functions when updating `pref` in the first loop, you can use simple `if` conditions to check the ranges, which can be a little faster.

3. Instead of incrementing `i` twice in the last loop (once in the while condition and once in the while body), you can increment it once at the end of the while body, which should reduce the number of increment operations.

4. The `if (cnt > 0)` condition inside the while loop is not necessary. The `cnt` variable is always greater than 0 when this condition is checked, so you can remove this condition.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef long double ld;
#define ceil(n, m) ((n / m) + (n % m ? 1 : 0))
#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()
#define rall(x) (x).rbegin(), (x).rend()
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k, ans = 0;
    string s;
    cin >> n >> k >> s;
    vector<int> pref;
    pref.assign(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      if (s[i] == '1') {
        if (i - k >= 0) pref[i - k] += 1;
        if (i + k + 1 <= n) pref[i + k + 1] += -1;
      }
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
      pref[i] += pref[i - 1];
    for (int i = 0; i < n;)
      if (pref[i] == 0) {
        int cnt = 0;
        while (i < n && pref[i] == 0) {
          ++cnt;
          ++ans, cnt = -1 * k;
          ++i;
        }
      } else {
        ++i;
      }
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
}
```
Here we have made minor improvements to the original code. The performance gain might not be substantial because the original code was already quite efficient. However, these small improvements can add up in larger programs or when the program is run many times.
