This is a well-written program that finds the minimum number of "1"s to change to "0"s in a binary string. Here are some optimizations that can be done:

1. Avoid Recalculation: We can avoid the redundant calculation of min(n, i + k + 1) and max(0, i - k) by computing them once and storing them in variables.

2. Remove if condition inside while loop: The if condition inside the last while loop (if(cnt > 0)) always evaluates to true because cnt is always incremented before checking this condition. So, you can remove this condition.

3. Reserve Memory for Vector: The size of the vector is known before the loop begins, so we can reserve memory for it using the reserve() function to prevent reallocation of memory when elements are inserted into the vector. This can be a significant optimization when dealing with large amounts of data.

4. Use '\n' instead of endl: This is a small optimization, but it can make a difference in programs that involve a lot of output to the console. The reason is that endl forces a flush of the output buffer, while '\n' does not.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef long double ld;
#define ceil(n, m) ((n / m) + (n % m ? 1 : 0))
#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()
#define rall(x) (x).rbegin(), (x).rend()
int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n, k, ans = 0;
        string s;
        cin >> n >> k >> s;
        vector<int> pref(n + 1);
        pref.reserve(n+1);
        int lower_bound, upper_bound;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            if (s[i] == '1') {
                lower_bound = max(0, i - k);
                upper_bound = min(n, i + k + 1);
                pref[lower_bound] += 1;
                pref[upper_bound] += -1;
            }
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            pref[i] += pref[i - 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (pref[i] == 0) {
                int cnt = 0;
                while (i < n && pref[i] == 0) {
                    ++cnt;
                    ++ans, cnt = -1 * k;
                    ++i;
                }
            }
        }
        cout << ans << '\n';
    }
}
```
