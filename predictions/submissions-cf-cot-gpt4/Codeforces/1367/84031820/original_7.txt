This code is already quite optimized in terms of memory usage as it only uses a single vector 'pref' to carry out calculations and store the results. However, there are some modifications that can be done to make it more efficient.

1. Avoid using <bits/stdc++.h>: This header file includes a large number of standard C++ libraries. While it's convenient for small coding tasks or competitive programming, it can significantly slow down the compilation process. Include only the necessary libraries.

2. Avoid using "using namespace std": This line can lead to name clashes because it imports all entities in the standard namespace. 

3. Inline functions: The 'max' and 'min' functions are called in a loop. Inlining these functions can save the overhead of function calls.

4. Reserve capacity for vector: If you know the size of the vector beforehand, reserving the capacity can prevent unnecessary reallocations and copies as the vector grows.

5. Avoid unnecessary computations: The condition 'cnt > 0' in the second loop is always true because 'cnt' is initialized to 0 and only incremented. So, we can remove this condition.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k, ans = 0;
    std::string s;
    std::cin >> n >> k >> s;
    std::vector<int> pref(n + 1);
    pref.reserve(n+1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      if (s[i] == '1')
        pref[std::max(0, i - k)] += 1, pref[std::min(n, i + k + 1)] += -1;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
      pref[i] += pref[i - 1];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      if (pref[i] == 0) {
        int cnt = 0;
        while (i < n && pref[i] == 0) {
          ++cnt;
          ++ans, cnt = -1 * k;
          ++i;
        }
      }
    std::cout << ans << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Remember, these are minor improvements and may not lead to drastic changes in performance. The overall logic and complexity of the program are the main factors affecting its performance.
