The given C/C++ program reads a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a number of strings and performs some processing on them. It seems to be counting some specific pattern in the input string. 

Here are some steps to optimize this code:

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` statement is known to slow down the compilation process because it includes all the standard library headers. Instead, include only the necessary headers.

2. The usage of `typedef` can be replaced with `using` which is more modern and recommended in C++.

3. The `ceil(n, m)` macro is unnecessary because the same result can be achieved by using `(n + m - 1) / m` to round up to the nearest integer.

4. The `all(x)` and `rall(x)` macros are not used in the code, so they can be removed.

5. The `ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` are used to speed up I/O operations. They are not needed in this code because we don't have a lot of I/O operations.

6. The use of `vector<int> pref(n + 1);` is not efficient. Instead, use an array `int pref[n+1] = {0};`.

7. The while loop to count the number of '1's can be optimized by using a for loop and break statement when the condition fails.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
using ld = long double;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k, ans = 0;
    string s;
    cin >> n >> k >> s;
    int pref[n + 1] = {0};
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      if (s[i] == '1')
        pref[max(0, i - k)] += 1, pref[min(n, i + k + 1)] += -1;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
      pref[i] += pref[i - 1];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      if (pref[i] == 0) {
        int cnt = 0;
        for (; i < n && pref[i] == 0; ++i, ++cnt)
          if (cnt > 0)
            ++ans, cnt = -1 * k;
      }
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
}
```
