This program is quite optimized already, but we can still make a few small modifications to improve it.

Optimization Steps:

1. We can save some memory by declaring the x and y arrays with the exact size we need. The size is given by the input n, which is read at the beginning of the main function. We can move the declaration of these arrays after reading n.

2. Instead of using the function `abs()` to make all y values positive, we can simply check if the y value is less than zero and, if true, multiply by -1. This will avoid the function call.

3. We can also optimize the `isOk()` function slightly. The sqrt() function call can be expensive in terms of time complexity. We are calling sqrt() inside a loop, which can be heavy if the number of iterations is high. We can instead calculate sqrt(k * k) once, store it in a variable, and use that inside the loop. This will reduce the number of sqrt() calls from n to 1.

4. The binary search loop in the main function can be replaced by a while loop that continues until the difference between l and r is less than a small value, say 1e-9. This will make the loop stop when the answer is accurate enough, instead of running it a fixed number of times.

5. The `printf()` function is slower than `cout` in C++. Therefore, we can replace `printf()` calls with `cout`.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

      return 0;
    } else {

    }
  }
  long double l = 0, r = 100000000000000000.0;
  while (r - l > 1e-9) {
    long double mid = (l + r) / 2.0;
    if (isOk(mid, x, y)) {
      r = mid;
    } else {
      l = mid;
    }
