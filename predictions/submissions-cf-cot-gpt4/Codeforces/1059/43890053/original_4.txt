This program seems to be some sort of binary search algorithm for a computational geometry problem, and it's already quite optimal. However, there are still some minor improvements we can make here.

Optimization Steps:

1. Unnecessary Headers: The program includes many headers that it doesn't use. Removing these headers will not affect the runtime, but it will decrease compile time and make the code cleaner.

2. Magic Numbers: A magic number is a bare-naked number that appears in the source code without clear meaning. It's usually best to define it as a constant.

3. Type Casting: The type casting to (long double) in isOk function is unnecessary since the variables are already of type double.

4. Memory Allocation: The arrays x and y are allocated for 100,000 + 10 elements, but the maximum value of n is 2000 + 10. You can allocate only n elements after reading n which will save memory.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int inf = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
const int maxn = 2000 + 10;
const double MAX_LIMIT = 100000000000000000.0;
double *x, *y;
int n;
bool isOk(double k) {
  double l = -MAX_LIMIT, r = MAX_LIMIT;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (y[i] > k * 2) {
      return false;
    }
    double tmp = sqrt(k * k - (k - y[i]) * (k - y[i]));
    l = max(l, x[i] - tmp);
    r = min(r, x[i] + tmp);
  }
  return l < r;
}
int main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  x = new double[n];
  y = new double[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf", &x[i], &y[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (y[i] * y[n - 1] < 0) {
      printf("-1\n");
      delete[] x;
      delete[] y;
      return 0;
    } else {
      y[i] = abs(y[i]);
    }
  }
  double l = 0, r = MAX_LIMIT;
  double mid = (l + r) / 2.0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    mid = (l + r) / 2.0;
    if (isOk(mid)) {
      r = mid;
    } else {
      l = mid;
    }
  }
  printf("%.10lf\n", mid);
  delete[] x;
  delete[] y;
}
```

Be sure to delete dynamically allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.
