The program seems to be well-optimized. However, there is a potential improvement in terms of memory usage that could be done.
The program uses two large arrays x and y to store input data. Depending on the maximum input size expected, it might be better to use dynamic allocation for these two arrays, which would allow us to use only the necessary amount of memory, rather than reserving a large block up front.

The optimization steps would be as follows:

1. Replace the static arrays `x` and `y` with dynamic arrays (or `std::vector`).
2. Allocate memory for `x` and `y` after reading the value of `n`, the number of elements to be stored in them.
3. Deallocate the memory at the end of the main function to prevent memory leaks.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <deque>
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#define line printf("---------------------------\n")
#define mem(a, b) memset(a, b, sizeof(a))
#define pi acos(-1)
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int inf = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
const int maxn = 2000 + 10;
double *x, *y; // Changed from static array to pointer
int n;
bool isOk(long double k) {
  long double l = -100000000000000000.0, r = 100000000000000000.0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (y[i] > k * 2) {
      return false;
    }
    double tmp = sqrt(k * k - (k - y[i]) * (k - y[i]));
    l = max(l, (long double)(x[i] - tmp));
    r = min(r, (long double)(x[i] + tmp));
  }
  return l < r;
}
int main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  x = new double[n]; // Allocating memory
  y = new double[n]; // Allocating memory
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf", &x[i], &y[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (y[i] * y[n - 1] < 0) {
      printf("-1\n");
      delete [] x; // Deallocating memory
      delete [] y; // Deallocating memory
      return 0;
    } else {
      y[i] = abs(y[i]);
    }
  }
  long double l = 0, r = 100000000000000000.0;
  long double mid = (l + r) / 2.0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    mid = (l + r) / 2.0;
    if (isOk(mid)) {
      r = mid;
    } else {
      l = mid;
    }
  }
  printf("%.10Lf\n", mid);
  delete [] x; // Deallocating memory
  delete [] y; // Deallocating memory
}
```

Please note that the dynamic memory allocation and deallocation done in this code assume that the system has enough memory to allocate these arrays. If the system runs out of memory, `new` will throw a `std::bad_alloc` exception, which should be handled appropriately in a production-level code.
