Optimization Steps:

1. You have included many libraries that you are not using in the code. Including unnecessary libraries can slow down the compilation time. So, we will remove them.

2. The `y[i] = abs(y[i]);` operation is unnecessary as y[i] is always positive or zero due to the previous condition `if (y[i] * y[n - 1] < 0)` which is checked for all elements of y[] in the loop.

3. You are calculating `mid = (l + r) / 2.0;` twice, one outside the loop and one inside the loop. We can remove the one that is outside the loop which will save us one unnecessary operation.

4. You have defined `const int maxn = 2000 + 10;` but you are not using it in your code. We will remove this line.

5. You are using double precision for x[] and y[] arrays but in function isOk() you are using long double precision. We can use long double for x[] and y[] arrays as well.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#define line printf("---------------------------\n")
#define mem(a, b) memset(a, b, sizeof(a))
#define pi acos(-1)
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int inf = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
long double x[100000 + 10], y[100000 + 10];
int n;
bool isOk(long double k) {
  long double l = -100000000000000000.0, r = 100000000000000000.0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (y[i] > k * 2) {
      return false;
    }
    long double tmp = sqrt(k * k - (k - y[i]) * (k - y[i]));
    l = max(l, (long double)(x[i] - tmp));
    r = min(r, (long double)(x[i] + tmp));
  }
  return l < r;
}
int main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%Lf %Lf", &x[i], &y[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (y[i] * y[n - 1] < 0) {
      printf("-1\n");
      return 0;
    }
  }
  long double l = 0, r = 100000000000000000.0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    long double mid = (l + r) / 2.0;
    if (isOk(mid)) {
      r = mid;
    } else {
      l = mid;
    }
    if(i == 100) printf("%.10Lf\n", mid);
  }
}
```
