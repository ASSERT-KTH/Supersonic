Here are the steps for the optimization:

1. The program includes a lot of libraries that don't seem to be used. Removing these unnecessary includes will speed up compile time and reduce the amount of memory used by the program.

2. The program uses two very large arrays `x` and `y` of size `100000 + 10`. These arrays are using stack memory which is limited. If `n` is smaller, we can allocate memory dynamically which can save memory.

3. The variables `l` and `r` are declared as `long double` which is unnecessary as the given values can be stored in `double` which will save memory.

4. The `double tmp` is calculated twice in `isOk()`. We can store it in a variable to save processing time.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#define line printf("---------------------------\n")
#define mem(a, b) memset(a, b, sizeof(a))
#define pi acos(-1)
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int inf = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
const int maxn = 2000 + 10;

int n;
double *x, *y;

bool isOk(double k) {
  double l = -1e18, r = 1e18;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (y[i] > k * 2) {
      return false;
    }
    double tmp = sqrt(k * k - (k - y[i]) * (k - y[i]));
    l = max(l, x[i] - tmp);
    r = min(r, x[i] + tmp);
  }
  return l < r;
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  x = new double[n];
  y = new double[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf", &x[i], &y[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (y[i] * y[n - 1] < 0) {
      printf("-1\n");
      delete[] x;
      delete[] y;
      return 0;
    } else {
      y[i] = abs(y[i]);
    }
  }
  double l = 0, r = 1e18;
  double mid = (l + r) / 2.0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    mid = (l + r) / 2.0;
    if (isOk(mid)) {
      r = mid;
    } else {
      l = mid;
    }
  }
  printf("%.10lf\n", mid);
  delete[] x;
  delete[] y;
}
```

Make sure to release the dynamically allocated memory after use to prevent memory leaks.
