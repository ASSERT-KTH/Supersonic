Here are the optimizations that can be applied to the given program:

1. Remove unnecessary libraries: The program includes a lot of libraries which are not used at all. These libraries should be removed.

2. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment: In C++, pre-increment (i.e., ++i) is usually faster than post-increment (i.e., i++) because post-increment involves a copy operation. In this code, the difference might not be significant, but it's a good habit to use pre-increment operators.

3. Avoid recalculating the same value: In the isOk function, the value of (k - y[i]) is calculated twice. It can be calculated once and stored in a variable for further use.

4. Use const variables: Constants like 100000000000000000.0 are used multiple times in the program. These should be declared as constant variables at the beginning of the program.

5. Avoid using magic numbers: The number 100 is used in the last for loop in the main function which is not clear why this number is used. It would be better to define it as a constant with a meaningful name.

Here is the optimized code after applying the above optimizations:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#define PI acos(-1)
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
const int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int MAXN = 2000 + 10;
const long double MAX_VALUE = 100000000000000000.0;
const int ITERATION_COUNT = 100;

double x[100000 + 10], y[100000 + 10];
int n;

bool isOk(long double k) {
  long double l = -MAX_VALUE, r = MAX_VALUE;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (y[i] > k * 2) {
      return false;
    }
    double k_y_i = k - y[i];
    double tmp = sqrt(k * k - k_y_i * k_y_i);
    l = max(l, (long double)(x[i] - tmp));
    r = min(r, (long double)(x[i] + tmp));
  }
  return l < r;
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%lf %lf", &x[i], &y[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (y[i] * y[n - 1] < 0) {
      printf("-1\n");
      return 0;
    } else {
      y[i] = abs(y[i]);
    }
  }
  long double l = 0, r = MAX_VALUE;
  long double mid = (l + r) / 2.0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= ITERATION_COUNT; ++i) {
    mid = (l + r) / 2.0;
    if (isOk(mid)) {
      r = mid;
    } else {
      l = mid;
    }
  }
  printf("%.10Lf\n", mid);
}
```
