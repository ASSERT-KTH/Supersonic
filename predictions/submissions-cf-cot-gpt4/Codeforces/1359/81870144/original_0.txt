The given code is pretty optimized in terms of time complexity. However, there are a few changes we can make to improve memory usage and readability:

1. map<ll, long long> dp[N] : This is an array of maps where each map is defined on the entire possible range of 'll'. But in the algorithm, we only use a range of -30 to +30 for all maps. So, we could replace maps with a 2D array of size n x 61. This will significantly reduce the memory usage as we don't have to store the keys for each element.

2. The macro definitions are making the code harder to read. We could remove them and directly use the types and functions. This will help improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

3. The debugging code block is not needed in the optimized version as it's not contributing to the functionality of the code.

4. Variables like 'eps', 'pi', 'inf', 'mod2', 'mod1', 'R', 'tx', 'ty', 'rev_to' are not being used in the code, so they can be removed.

5. Functions like sqr, qb, gcd, binpow, binmult are also not used in the code, so they can be removed.

6. The 'fast_io' macro is used to speed up the I/O operations by untieing cin from cout and avoiding the flushing of cout before each cin. But it can cause problems when we want to interactively take input from the user and print output to the user.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#define endl "\n"
#define ll int
#define ld long double
#define N 1e5 + 1

using namespace std;

signed main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> a(n);
  for (auto &z : a)
    cin >> z;
  
  vector<vector<long long>> dp(n+1, vector<long long>(61));
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = -30; j <= 30; j++) {
      ll to = max(a[i], (ll)j) + 30;
      dp[i + 1][to] = max(dp[i + 1][to], dp[i][j + 30] + a[i]);
    }
  }
  
  long long ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = -30; j <= 30; j++) {
      ans = max(ans, (dp[i][j + 30] ? dp[i][j + 30] - j : 0));
    }
  }
  
  cout << ans;
  
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the code uses less memory, is more readable, and maintains the same time complexity as the previous version.
