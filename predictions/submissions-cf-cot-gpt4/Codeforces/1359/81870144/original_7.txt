The given C++ program reads an array of integers, then performs a series of operations on each element in the array. It maintains a 2D array (dp) to store the intermediate results and finally outputs the maximum value in the dp array. 

The main potential for optimization in this program lies in the two nested loops that iterate over the range [-30, 30] for each element in the array. This results in a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the size of the input array and m is the constant 61 (range from -30 to 30 inclusive).

Here are the steps for optimization:

1. Remove unnecessary macros: Macros like `#define ll int` and `#define ld long double` are not only confusing (since they redefine commonly used types), but can also lead to unintended errors. It's best to use the type names directly for clarity.

2. Minimize usage of std::map: The program uses std::map for dp array, but this is not efficient because std::map has a logarithmic time complexity for insertion and access. Instead, you can use a 2D array or a vector of vectors, which offer constant time complexity for these operations. But in this case, since the range of j is constant and small, we can use a 2D array.

3. Reduce loop range: In the second main loop, there's no need to iterate from 0 to n. We only need to check the n-th element because we're only interested in the maximum value after considering all elements from the array.

Let me now provide you with the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

const int N = 1e5 + 1;
const int INF = 1e9 + 7;
long long dp[N][61]; // Change map to 2D array

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // Fast I/O
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (auto &z : a)
        cin >> z;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= 60; j++) {
            int to = max(a[i], j);
            dp[i + 1][to] = max(dp[i + 1][to], dp[i][j] + a[i]);
        }
    }

    long long ans = 0;
    // Only check the n-th element
    for (int j = 0; j <= 60; j++) {
        ans = max(ans, dp[n][j] - j);
    }

    cout << ans << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

Please note that the maximum value for 'j' is 60 instead of 30. Because in the original code, `ll to = max(a[i], (ll)j);` this line can set 'to' to a value much greater than 30 (it can go up to the maximum value of a[i]). So, in the optimized version, I'm considering the range [0, 60] for 'j'. 

Also, I've assumed that the values in array 'a' are non-negative. If they can be negative, then you would need to adjust the ranges accordingly. However, the general idea of the optimizations would remain the same.
