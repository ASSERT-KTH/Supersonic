The code provided is quite complex and has multiple parts that can be optimized. Here are the steps for optimization:

1. Remove Unused Macro Definitions: Many of the macros defined in the code are not used, so they can be removed to improve readability and reduce memory usage.

2. Replace Map with Array: The code uses a map to store dynamic programming states, which is inefficient in terms of both time and memory usage. By replacing it with a 2D array, we can improve the performance.

3. Remove Unused Variables: The code contains a lot of unused variables and constants. By removing them, we can reduce memory usage.

4. Simplify Loops: Some loops in the code iterate more times than necessary. We can simplify them to improve running time.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define fast_io                                                                \
  cin.tie(0);                                                                  \
  cout.tie(0);                                                                 \
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);

const int N = 1e5 + 10;
const int RANGE = 65;
long long dp[N][RANGE];

signed main() {
  fast_io;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (auto &z : a)
    cin >> z;
    
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 30; j++) {
      int to = max(a[i], j) + 30;
      dp[i + 1][to] = max(dp[i + 1][to], dp[i][j + 30] + a[i]);
    }
  }
  
  long long ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 30; j++) {
      ans = max(ans, (dp[i][j + 30] ? dp[i][j + 30] - j : 0));
    }
  }
  
  cout << ans;
  cerr << endl
       << "Time execute: " << clock() / (double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC << " sec"
       << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of changes:

1. Removed all unused macros and variables.
2. Replaced `dp` map with 2D array and adjusted the range of `j` in loops to match the range of the array.
3. Simplified the loops to only iterate from 1 to 30 (inclusive) instead of -30 to 30.
4. Adjusted the calculations inside the loops to account for the change in range of `j`.
