This program is quite complex with a lot of unused code, so I will simplify it as much as possible. 

1. Code clean-up: There are unnecessary macros, typedefs, and code blocks that are not used in the main program. Those will be removed.

2. Use of vectors instead of map: A 2D map is used for dp, which can be replaced by a 2D vector. Maps in C++ are generally slower due to tree-based implementation and extra features.

3. Reducing the scope of variables: Variables like 'to' can be declared within the scope they are used, this will save memory as they will be destroyed after the scope ends.

4. Avoiding unnecessary operations: In the loop calculating 'ans', the condition 'dp[i][j] ? dp[i][j] - j : 0' can be replaced by 'dp[i][j] - j' because if 'dp[i][j]' is zero, then the result is zero anyway.

Here's the optimized program:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#define ll int
#define ld long double

using namespace std;

ll inf = 1e18 + 2, mod2 = 998244353, mod1 = 1e9 + 7;

signed main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    
    ll n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<ll> a(n);
    for (auto &z : a)
        cin >> z;
    
    vector<vector<long long>> dp(n+1, vector<long long>(61, 0));
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = -30; j <= 30; j++) {
            ll to = max(a[i], (ll)j) + 30;
            dp[i + 1][to] = max(dp[i + 1][to], dp[i][j + 30] + a[i]);
        }
    }
    
    long long ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = -30; j <= 30; j++) {
            ans = max(ans, dp[i][j + 30] - j);
        }
    }
    
    cout << ans;
    
    return 0;
}
```

Note: The map keys were changed from -30 to 30 to 0 to 60 (by adding 30) to use them as indices in the 2D vector.
