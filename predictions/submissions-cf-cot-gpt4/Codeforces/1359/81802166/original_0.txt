The provided code is a complex C++ program that uses a brute-force approach to calculate the maximum subarray sum. The main optimization for this program is to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm. 

The current algorithm iterates over all possible values of 'F' and for each 'F', it finds the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm which takes O(n) time. Hence, the overall time complexity of the program is O(61*n) which can be reduced to O(n) by modifying the algorithm.

Optimization can be done as follows:

1. The code uses multiple #define shortcuts for various operations which can be confusing and can cause issues during debugging. It's better to use the actual functions and operators as it is for readability and maintainability.

2. The 'maxSubArraySum' function uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum. However, it also checks for an additional condition (M==F) which requires it to keep track of the maximum element (M) in the subarray. This additional check can be removed as it is not needed for finding the maximum subarray sum.

3. The 'main' function iterates over all possible values of 'F' from -30 to 30 and for each 'F', it finds the maximum subarray sum and updates the result (R). This is a brute-force approach and can be optimized. Since 'F' is the maximum element in the subarray, there is no need to check for all values of 'F'. We can instead find the maximum element in the array (max_ele) and then iterate from '1' to 'max_ele' for 'F'. This will reduce the number of iterations significantly when 'max_ele' is much less than 30.

4. The use of 'bits/stdc++.h' is discouraged as it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries and can slow down the compilation time. It's better to include only the required libraries.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef long long int lli;
lli n;
vector<lli> a;

lli maxSubArraySum() {
    lli max_so_far = a[0];
    lli curr_max = a[0];
  
    for (lli i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        curr_max = max(a[i], curr_max+a[i]);
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, curr_max);
    }
    return max_so_far;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    lli T = 1;
    while (T--) {
        cin >> n;
        a.resize(n);
        for (lli i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i];
        lli max_ele = *max_element(a.begin(), a.end());
        lli R = 0;
        for (lli i = 1; i <= max_ele; i++) {
            for (lli j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (a[j] > i) a[j] = 0;
            }
            R = max(R, maxSubArraySum());
        }
        cout << R << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, the 'maxSubArraySum' function finds the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm without any additional checks. The 'main' function finds the maximum element in the array (max_ele) and then iterates from '1' to 'max_ele' for 'F'. For each 'F', it sets all elements in the array that are greater than 'F' to '0' and then finds the maximum subarray sum. This reduces the number of iterations and hence the time complexity of the program.
