Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove unused MACRO definitions: The code includes definitions for 'll', 'mod', 'pii', 'N', 'forn', and 'pb' macros which are not used anywhere in the code. Removing them will improve readability and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary casting: There are multiple instances where values are unnecessarily casted to long double 'ld'. As these values are already of type long double, these casts can be removed.

3. Avoiding array index out of bounds: The original code attempts to access ar[-1] and pref[-1] which is incorrect and may lead to undefined behavior. We need to fix this.

4. Reduce redundant calculations: The sum calculation in the loop involves repetitive division and multiplication. We can store the result of the division and multiplication in a temporary variable to avoid repeating these operations.

5. Use std::array or std::vector instead of C-style arrays: This can help to avoid errors related to array index out of bounds.

Now let's apply these optimizations to the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef pair<long long, long long> pll;

int main(void) {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  int n, p;
  cin >> n >> p;
  vector<pll> ar(n);
  vector<long long> pref(n);
  long double sum = 0;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ll a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    ar[i].second = b / p - (a - 1) / p;
    ar[i].first = b - a + 1;
    pref[i] = (i == 0) ? ar[i].first : pref[i - 1] * ar[i].first;
  }
  
  long double temp = (long double)1 / ar[0].first;
  sum += temp * 2 * ar[0].second;
  
  temp = (long double)ar[n - 1].second / ar[n - 1].first;
  sum += temp * (ar[n - 2].first - ar[n - 2].second) / ar[n - 2].first;
  sum += temp * (ar[0].first - ar[0].second) / ar[0].first;
  
  for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    temp = (long double)ar[i].second / ar[i].first;
    sum += temp;
    sum += temp * (ar[i - 1].first - ar[i - 1].second) / ar[i - 1].first;
  }
  
  cout << setprecision(6) << fixed;
  cout << sum * 2000 << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program does the same thing as the original but is more efficient and has better coding practices.
