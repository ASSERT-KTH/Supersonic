Here are the steps to optimize the code:

1. Variable "j" is only used to store the input before pushing it into the vector. It can be removed, and the input can be directly pushed into the vector.

2. Pre-allocation of memory for vector "v" can save time during the "push_back" operations. Since we know the size "n" in advance, we can reserve that space.

3. The size of the vector "v" is called multiple times. It's more efficient to store the size in a variable and use it instead of calling "v.size()".

4. The array "t" is an auxiliary array that is just used to store whether a peak has been found or not. This array can be eliminated by updating the vector "v" directly.

5. The loop that fills the vector "v" and the loop that fills the array "t" can be combined into a single loop.

6. "cin" and "cout" are slower for I/O, we can use fast input/output methods instead.

7. It is better to avoid using "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" because it includes a lot of unnecessary headers which increase compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary headers.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<ll> v;
    v.reserve(n);

    ll prev = 0, curr, next;
    cin >> curr;
    for (ll f = 1; f < n; f++) {
      cin >> next;
      if ((curr > prev) && (curr > next)) {
        v.push_back(1);
      } else {
        v.push_back(0);
      }
      prev = curr;
      curr = next;
    }
    v.push_back(0); // last element is always not a peak

    for (ll o = 1; o < n; o++) {
      v[o] += v[o-1];
    }

    ll ans = 0, left = 0;
    for (ll l = 0; l <= n - k; l++) {
      ll peaks = v[l + k - 2] - (l > 0 ? v[l - 1] : 0);
      if (peaks > ans) {
        ans = peaks;
        left = l;
      }
    }

    cout << ans + 1 << " " << left + 1 << "\n";
  }
}
```
