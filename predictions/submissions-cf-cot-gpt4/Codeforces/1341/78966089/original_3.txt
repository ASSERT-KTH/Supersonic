Optimization Steps:

1. Remove the use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file is quite large and including it increases the compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary header files.

2. Preallocate memory for vector v. This will avoid multiple reallocations during runtime when we push elements into the vector.

3. We can merge the two loops where we are filling up vectors `v` and `t`. This will reduce the runtime.

4. The vectors `v` and `t` are unnecessarily large. We can reduce their size to `n` to save memory.

Optimized Program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll j, k, n;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<ll> v(n), t(n, 0);
    for (ll i=0; i<n; i++) {
      cin >> v[i];
      if (i>0 && i<n-1 && (v[i] > v[i - 1]) && (v[i] > v[i + 1]))
        t[i] = 1;
    }
    ll sum = 0;
    for (ll o = 0; o < n; o++) {
      sum = sum + t[o];
      v[o] = sum;
    }
    ll ans = 0, left = 1;
    for (ll l = 0; l <= n - k + 1; l++) {
      if (ans < v[l + k - 2] - v[l]) {
        ans = v[l + k - 2] - v[l];
        left = l + 1;
      }
    }
    cout << ans + 1 << " " << left << " \n";
  }
}
```
Note: `#define pb push_back` was removed as it was not used in the optimized program.
