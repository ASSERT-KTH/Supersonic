Optimization Steps:

1. The first step will be to remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes more files than necessary, which increases the compile time. We will include only the necessary headers.

2. We will use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` to disable synchronization of C and C++ standard streams. By default, all standard streams are synchronized, which means you can mix input/output of `printf/scanf` and `cin/cout`. Disabling the synchronization can lead to faster I/O operations which can be useful in problems where high I/O operations are required.

3. The vector `v` is being resized repeatedly in a loop when `push_back` method is used. Instead, we can directly use the `vector` constructor to create a vector of size `n` and input the values directly.

4. In the loop where `sum` is calculated and `v[o]` is updated, we can use `+=` operator to make it more readable and concise.

5. `v.size()` is called multiple times in the loops. Instead, we can store it in a variable and use it. This might seem minor, but when the size of the vector is large, it can save significant time.

Optimized Program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    ll j, k, n;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<ll> v(n), t(n, 0);
    
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> v[i];
    }
    
    for (ll f = 1; f < n - 1; f++) {
      if ((v[f] > v[f - 1]) && (v[f] > v[f + 1]))
        t[f] = 1;
    }
    
    ll sum = 0;
    for (ll o = 0; o < n; o++) {
      sum += t[o];
      v[o] = sum;
    }
    
    ll ans = 0;
    ll left = 1;

    for (ll l = 0; l <= n - k + 1; l++) {
      if (ans < v[l + k - 2] - v[l]) {
        ans = v[l + k - 2] - v[l];
        left = l + 1;
      }
    }
    
    cout << ans + 1 << " " << left << " \n";
  }
}
```
