The program can be optimized for running time by reducing the number of accesses to the vector v. In the original program, v is read three times in each loop iteration: once for v[f], once for v[f-1], and once for v[f+1]. This can be reduced to two reads per iteration by storing v[f] in a temporary variable.

Here's how to optimize the code:

1. Store v[f] in a temporary variable to reduce the number of accesses to the vector v.

2. Remove the unnecessary vector initialization. In the original code, vector v is declared and then immediately overwritten in the next line. This is unnecessary and can be omitted.

3. Merge the two for-loops into one. The first for-loop calculates the 't' vector and the second for-loop calculates the prefix sum and updates the 'v' vector. These calculations can be done in the same loop to reduce the number of iterations.

4. Use pre-increment (--n) instead of post-increment (n--) in the while loop. This is a minor optimization, but pre-increment is generally faster than post-increment in C++ because it does not need to make a copy of the original value.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
#define pb push_back
int main() {
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll j, k, n, f_prev, f, f_next;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<ll> v, t(n, 0);
    cin >> f_prev;
    v.pb(f_prev);
    --n;
    cin >> f;
    v.pb(f);
    ll sum = 0;
    while (--n) {
      cin >> f_next;
      v.pb(f_next);
      if ((f > f_prev) && (f > f_next))
        t[v.size() - 2] = 1;
      sum += t[v.size() - 2];
      v[v.size() - 2] = sum;
      f_prev = f;
      f = f_next;
    }
    ll ans = 0;
    ll left = 1;
    for (ll l = 0; l <= v.size() - k + 1; l++) {
      if (ans < v[l + k - 2] - v[l]) {
        ans = v[l + k - 2] - v[l];
        left = l + 1;
      }
    }
    cout << ans + 1 << " ";
    cout << left << " \n";
  }
}
```
