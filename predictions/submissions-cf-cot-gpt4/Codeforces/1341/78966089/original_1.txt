The optimization steps are as follows:

1. Avoid using `v.size()` in each iteration of the loop, instead store it in a variable and use it. This is because `v.size()` is an O(1) operation but it involves function call overhead. So, calling it once and storing the result in a variable is more efficient.

2. Use prefix sum technique to calculate the sum in the array `t`. By this, we can avoid the usage of another loop to calculate the sum.

3. Instead of using `push_back` function to insert elements in the vector, we can use `[]` operator which is faster than `push_back`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll j, k, n;
    cin >> n;
    cin >> k;
    vector<ll> v(n), t(n, 0);
    for(ll i=0; i<n; i++){
      cin >> j;
      v[i] = j;
    }
    for (ll f = 1; f < n - 1; f++) {
      if ((v[f] > v[f - 1]) && (v[f] > v[f + 1]))
        t[f] = 1;
    }
    for (ll o = 1; o < n; o++) {
      t[o] += t[o-1];
    }
    ll ans = 0;
    ll left = 1;
    for (ll l = 0; l <= n - k + 1; l++) {
      ll current = t[l + k - 2] - (l ? t[l-1] : 0);
      if (ans < current) {
        ans = current;
        left = l + 1;
      }
    }
    cout << ans + 1 << " ";
    cout << left << " \n";
  }
}
```
This optimized program reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) and also reduces space complexity.
