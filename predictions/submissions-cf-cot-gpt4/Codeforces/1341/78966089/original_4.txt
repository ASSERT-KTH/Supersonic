Here are some steps to optimize the program:

1. The vector `v` is initialized with an empty vector, and then elements are pushed back one by one. This step can be optimized by directly initializing `v` with size `n`. This will reduce the number of memory allocations and thus speed up the program.

2. The vector `t` is updated in a separate loop from where it's used. These two loops can be merged into one to save time.

3. The loop where `ans` and `left` are calculated can be optimized by eliminating the repetitive calculation of `v[l + k - 2] - v[l]`. Instead, calculate it once and use the result.

4. The use of `v.size()` can be replaced with `n` because the size of the vector `v` is always `n`.

5. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is generally discouraged because it includes all the standard library headers, increasing the compilation time. Include only the necessary headers.

6. Instead of using `using namespace std;`, it's better to use `std::` before the standard library functions and classes. This will avoid name conflicts and make the code cleaner.

7. For the `cout` statements, you can use a single statement instead of three to reduce the function call overhead.

Here's the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll j, k, n;
    std::cin >> n >> k;
    std::vector<ll> v(n);
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      std::cin >> v[i];
    }
    std::vector<ll> t(n, 0);
    ll sum = 0;
    for (ll f = 1; f < n - 1; ++f) {
      if ((v[f] > v[f - 1]) && (v[f] > v[f + 1])) {
        t[f] = 1;
      }
      sum += t[f];
      v[f] = sum;
    }
    ll ans = 0;
    ll left = 1;
    ll temp;
    for (ll l = 0; l <= n - k; ++l) {
      temp = v[l + k - 2] - v[l];
      if (ans < temp) {
        ans = temp;
        left = l + 1;
      }
    }
    std::cout << ans + 1 << " " << left << " \n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
