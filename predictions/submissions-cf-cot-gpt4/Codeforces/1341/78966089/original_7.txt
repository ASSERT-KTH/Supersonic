Let's go through the code and find the areas where we can optimize it.

The first thing that stands out is the use of the `push_back` function, which is dynamically resizing the vector. This can be quite expensive in terms of time complexity if the vector needs to be resized often. We can avoid this by initializing the vector with n elements. 

Another area that can be optimized is the unnecessary use of `v.size()`. The size of the vector `v` is not changing so we can store it in a variable and use it in the loop. 

We can also optimize the part where we are calculating the sum and updating the vector `v` in two separate loops. These loops can be combined into one, resulting in a decrease in time complexity.

The optimized code would look like this:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll j, k, n;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<ll> v(n), t(n, 0);
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> v[i];
    }
    for (ll f = 1; f < n - 1; f++) {
      if ((v[f] > v[f - 1]) && (v[f] > v[f + 1]))
        t[f] = 1;
    }
    ll sum = 0;
    for (ll o = 0; o < n; o++) {
      sum += t[o];
      v[o] = sum;
    }
    ll ans = 0;
    ll left = 1;
    for (ll l = 0; l <= n - k; l++) {
      if (ans < v[l + k - 1] - (l > 0 ? v[l - 1] : 0)) {
        ans = v[l + k - 1] - (l > 0 ? v[l - 1] : 0);
        left = l + 1;
      }
    }
    cout << ans + 1 << " " << left << "\n";
  }
}
```
Here, the vector `v` is initialized with `n` elements. The values are immediately read into the vector, saving the time of resizing the vector. The calculation of the sum and updating the vector `v` is done in a single loop. Also, the size of the vector `v` is stored in the variable `n` and used in the loop.
