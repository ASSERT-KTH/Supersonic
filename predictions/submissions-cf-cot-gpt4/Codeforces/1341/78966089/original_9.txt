Optimization steps:

1. Input optimization: Instead of reading the input with cin, it is better to use scanf. It is faster because cin needs to synchronize with the standard C libraries while scanf doesn't. 

2. Output optimization: Similarly, instead of using cout to print the output, it is better to use printf. It is faster because cout needs to synchronize with the standard C libraries while printf doesn't.

3. Avoid unnecessary computations: The size of the vector v is used multiple times in the program. We can store the size in a variable to avoid calling v.size() multiple times.

4. Consecutive cin operations can be merged into one line for brevity and faster execution.

5. The variable 'left' is assigned the value '1' before the loop starts and then potentially reassigned within the loop. We can move the initial assignment into the else part of the if condition inside the loop to avoid unnecessary assignment.

6. Replace push_back function with array-like assignment for vector 'v'. This can be faster as push_back may potentially require resizing and copying of the vector when it exceeds its capacity.

Optimized program:

```C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll t;
  scanf("%lld", &t);
  while (t--) {
    ll j, k, n;
    scanf("%lld %lld", &n, &k);
    vector<ll> v(n), t(n, 0);
    for(ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      scanf("%lld", &j);
      v[i] = j;
    }
    for (ll f = 1; f < n - 1; f++) {
      if ((v[f] > v[f - 1]) && (v[f] > v[f + 1]))
        t[f] = 1;
    }
    ll sum = 0;
    for (ll o = 0; o < n; o++) {
      sum = sum + t[o];
      v[o] = sum;
    }
    ll ans = 0;
    ll left;
    for (ll l = 0; l <= n - k + 1; l++) {
      if (ans < v[l + k - 2] - v[l]) {
        ans = v[l + k - 2] - v[l];
        left = l + 1;
      } else if (ans == 0) {
        left = 1;
      }
    }
    printf("%lld ", ans + 1);
    printf("%lld \n", left);
  }
}
```
