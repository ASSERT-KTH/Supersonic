Step 1: Combining two loops

In the given program, we have two separate loops to do two different tasks. The first loop is to check if the element at every index i in vector v is greater than its adjacent elements. If it is, we set t[i] to 1. The second loop is to calculate the prefix sum of vector t and store it in vector v. These two tasks can be combined into a single loop, saving time and making the program more efficient.

Step 2: Avoiding unnecessary operations

In the second loop (which will be combined with the first loop in the optimized code), we are doing the operation v[o] = sum, regardless of whether the condition in the first loop was satisfied or not. This operation can be avoided if the condition was not satisfied.

Step 3: Optimizing I/O operations

The program has two separate cout statements to output the results. These two outputs can be combined into a single cout statement, which can reduce the time taken for output operations.

Step 4: Avoiding unnecessary memory usage

The vector v is used to store input values, and then it is used to store the prefix sum of vector t. We can directly use it to store the prefix sum without using an additional vector t, which can save memory.

Here is the optimized code with all the above optimizations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
int main() {
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll j, k, n;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<ll> v(n);
    for (ll &i : v)
      cin >> i;
    ll sum = 0;
    for (ll f = 1; f < n - 1; f++) {
      if ((v[f] > v[f - 1]) && (v[f] > v[f + 1]))
          v[f] = ++sum;
      else
          v[f] = sum;
    }
    ll ans = 0, left = 1;
    for (ll l = 0; l <= n - k + 1; l++) {
      ll current = v[l + k - 2] - (l > 0 ? v[l - 1] : 0);
      if (ans < current) {
        ans = current;
        left = l + 1;
      }
    }
    cout << ans + 1 << " " << left << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
