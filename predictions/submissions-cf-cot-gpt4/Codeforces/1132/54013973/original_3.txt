The program given is a C++ program which reads an integer from the input, then reads that many integers, sorts them, performs a prefix sum on the sorted array, then reads another integer from the input, and for that many times, reads another integer from the input and uses it to calculate a value from the prefix sum array, which it then outputs.

Here are the possible optimization steps:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of libraries which increases the compilation time, and it is non-standard. Include only the libraries that you need.

2. Avoid using `#define fast ...` macro: It is used to speed up the I/O operations, but it might cause issues with interactive problems. It is better to use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(NULL);` in the main function.

3. Remove `#define ll long long int` and `#define pb push_back`: These macros make the code harder to read for those who are not familiar with them. It's better to use `long long` and `push_back` directly.

4. Use zero-based indexing: In C++, arrays and vectors should be zero-indexed. This will also avoid the need to create an extra unused space in the vector.

5. Avoid repeated calculation in the loop: In the loop where it calculates the output, it calculates `n-x+1` and `n-x` twice. Calculate them once and store them in variables.

6. Remove unnecessary semicolon at the end of the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<long long> a(n);
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  for (long long i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    a[i] += a[i - 1];
  }
  long long m;
  cin >> m;
  long long x;
  for (long long i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> x;
    long long nx = n - x;
    long long nx1 = nx + 1;
    cout << a[n - 1] - a[nx1] + a[nx] << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program should run faster and use less memory than the original program.
