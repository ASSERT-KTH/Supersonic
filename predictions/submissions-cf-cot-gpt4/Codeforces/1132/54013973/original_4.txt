Here are the steps to optimize the provided code:

1. Header File: Do not include "bits/stdc++.h" as it includes all C++ libraries which leads to increase in program size and compilation time. Include only those libraries that are needed.

2. Macro 'fast': Remove 'srand(time(NULL));', it is used to generate random numbers and it is not used in this program.

3. cin and cout: Use 'scanf' and 'printf' instead of 'cin' and 'cout' for faster input and output.

4. Vector: Instead of using a vector, use an array to save memory consumption.

5. Reduce calls to 'cin' and 'cout': To reduce the time, use "\n" instead of 'endl' as it flushes the output buffer every time it is called which takes time.

6. Unnecessary calculation: The calculation 'a[n - x + 1]' is unnecessary and can be removed.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <algorithm>

#define ll long long int

int main() {
  ll n;
  scanf("%lld", &n);
  ll a[n + 1];
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    scanf("%lld", &a[i]);
  }
  std::sort(a+1, a+n+1);
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    a[i] += a[i - 1];
  }
  ll m;
  scanf("%lld", &m);
  ll x;
  for (ll i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    scanf("%lld", &x);
    printf("%lld\n", a[n] - a[n - x]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
