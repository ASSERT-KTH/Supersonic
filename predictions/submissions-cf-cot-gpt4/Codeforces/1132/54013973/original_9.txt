Step 1: Don't use `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because it includes many unused libraries, which will increase your compile time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries. In this case, we could use `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`, `#include <algorithm>` and `#include <ctime>`.

Step 2: Instead of using `#define fast ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0); srand(time(NULL));`, use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(NULL);` as it will speed up the `cin` and `cout` processes.

Step 3: Replace `#define ll long long int` and `#define pb push_back` with `using ll = long long int;` and `using pb = push_back;`, which will improve the readability of your code.

Step 4: Instead of reading input inside the loop, read the entire input at once. This helps to reduce the overhead of function calls.

Step 5: Instead of sorting the entire vector, use a priority queue to keep track of the smallest `n` elements.

Step 6: The loop that calculates prefix sums can be eliminated by calculating them on the fly while reading the input.

Step 7: Use `'\n'` instead of `endl` to speed up output.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <ctime>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long int;

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  srand(time(NULL));
  
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> a(n + 1, 0);
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    a[i] += a[i - 1];
  }
  sort(a.begin() + 1, a.end());
  
  ll m;
  cin >> m;
  ll x;
  for (ll i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> x;
    cout << a[n] - a[n - x + 1] + a[n - x] << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that some of the suggestions depend on the specific problem constraints and may not always lead to a faster program. Also, some of the changes don't necessarily make the program run faster, but they make the code cleaner and easier to understand.
