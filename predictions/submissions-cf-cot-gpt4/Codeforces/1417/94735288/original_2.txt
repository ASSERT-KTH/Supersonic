This code is already quite optimized, but a few changes might improve it further. Here are the steps to optimize the provided code snippet:

1. Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header and include only the necessary headers. This will reduce the compilation time as the compiler does not have to compile all libraries included in `bits/stdc++.h`. This change won't have an impact on the program's runtime, but it's a good practice to include only the required headers.

2. Declare the array `a` dynamically. By doing so, we can avoid unnecessary memory allocation which can save memory space.

3. The variable `curMid` is always set to 1 before the loop, implying that it doesn't hold any value from the previous function calls. We can move its declaration within the loop to emphasize its scope and lifecycle.

4. `endl` is slower than `\n` because it causes a flushing stream. It's unnecessary to flush the stream here, so let's replace `endl` with `\n`.

Now, let's implement these changes:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#define int long long
#define hell 1000000007
#define F first
#define S second
#define gcd(a, b) __gcd((a), (b))
#define lcm(a, b) ((a) * (b)) / gcd(a, b)
#define ONLINE_JUDGE
#define ios ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);
using namespace std;

int expo(int base, int exponent, int mod = hell) {
  int ans = 1;
  base %= mod;
  while (exponent != 0) {
    if (exponent & 1)
      ans = (1LL * ans * base) % mod;
    base = (1LL * base * base) % mod;
    exponent >>= 1;
  }
  return ans % mod;
}

int inverse(int x) { return expo(x, hell - 2, hell); }

void solve() {
  int n, t;
  cin >> n >> t;
  int* a = new int[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int curMid = 1;
    int r;
    if (t % 2 == 0 && a[i] == t / 2) {
      r = (curMid++) % 2;
    } else if (2 * a[i] < t) {
      r = 0;
    } else {
      r = 1;
    }
    cout << r << " ";
  }
  cout << "\n";
  delete[] a;
}

signed main() {
  ios
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
      freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
}
```
Please note that even though these changes may not significantly improve the performance of the code, they contribute to making it cleaner and more efficient. Also, the performance depends on various factors like the compiler, hardware, and the input size.
