The given C/C++ program is already quite optimized. However, there are a few points where we can still make some changes to make it a bit faster and more memory efficient.

1. Use `vector<int>` instead of array for dynamic size: In the `solve()` function, the array `int a[n]` is used. Here, `n` is not a constant, so it can be more efficient to use a `vector<int>` instead. This can avoid potential stack overflow issues for large inputs.

2. Use `reserve()` function for vector: If we know the size of the vector beforehand, we can use the `reserve()` function to allocate all the required memory at once, instead of reallocating memory every time the vector's size is increased.

3. Avoid using `endl`: The `endl` manipulator not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output buffer. This can slow down the program. Instead, we can use "\n" to insert a newline without flushing the output buffer.

4. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(0);` outside `main()`: These lines are used to speed up I/O operations in C++. However, they should be used outside the `main()` function to ensure that they are executed before any I/O operations.

5. Remove unnecessary macros: The `F` and `S` macros are not used in the program, so they can be removed.

Here is the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define int long long
#define hell 1000000007
#define gcd(a, b) __gcd((a), (b))
#define lcm(a, b) ((a) * (b)) / gcd(a, b)
#define ONLINE_JUDGE
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);                                            
cin.tie(0);                                                                  
cout.tie(0);
using namespace std;
int expo(int base, int exponent, int mod = hell) {
  int ans = 1;
  base %= mod;
  while (exponent != 0) {
    if (exponent & 1)
      ans = (1LL * ans * base) % mod;
    base = (1LL * base * base) % mod;
    exponent >>= 1;
  }
  return ans % mod;
}
int inverse(int x) { return expo(x, hell - 2, hell); }
void solve() {
  int n, t;
  cin >> n >> t;
  vector<int> a;
  a.reserve(n);
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int temp;
    cin >> temp;
    a.push_back(temp);
  }
  int curMid = 1;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int r;
    if (t % 2 == 0 && a[i] == t / 2) {
      r = (curMid++) % 2;
    } else if (2 * a[i] < t) {
      r = 0;
    } else {
      r = 1;
    }
    cout << r << " ";
  }
  cout << "\n";
}
signed main() {
  ios
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
      freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
}
