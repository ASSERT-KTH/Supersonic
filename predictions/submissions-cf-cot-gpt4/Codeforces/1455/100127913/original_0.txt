The main optimization here would be to change the way that `moves` is calculated. Currently, it's calculated in a while-loop that increments `moves` one by one until it reaches the appropriate value. This is very inefficient and can be replaced with a formula to calculate the value directly.

The inequality `moves * (moves + 1) / 2 < x` is equivalent to solving the quadratic equation `moves^2 + moves - 2x < 0`. Solving this for `moves` gives us `moves = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8x)) / 2`. Since `moves` must be an integer, we can use the `ceil` function to round up to the nearest integer.

Next, the condition `if (moves * (moves + 1) / 2 == x + 1) moves++;` can be simplified. We are incrementing `moves` if the result of the formula equals `x+1`. However, we've already used `ceil` function in our formula which guarantees that the result will be greater than or equal to `x`. So, `moves` will never equal to `x+1` and the condition will always be false. Therefore, this condition can be removed.

The optimized program is as follows:
