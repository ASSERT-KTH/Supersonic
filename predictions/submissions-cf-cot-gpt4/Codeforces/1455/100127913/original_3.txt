The program calculates and prints the minimum number of moves required to reach a given target. The current algorithm used is inefficient as it uses an iterative approach which results in O(n) complexity. This can be optimized using a binary search approach which will reduce the complexity to O(log n).

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Replace the while loop with binary search to reduce time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).
2. Instead of calculating the sum of numbers each time in the while loop, use the formula n*(n+1)/2 where 'n' is the mid value of the binary search. This reduces time complexity and uses less memory.
3. Remove unnecessary macros.
4. Don't use `bits/stdc++.h` because this header file includes quite a lot of files, and it will slow down the compile time as the compiler will have to process a lot. Include only those header files which are actually required.
5. Use '\n' instead of endl to prevent flushing the buffer every time, which can cause a significant speed difference.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    long long x;
    cin >> x;
    long long lo = 0, hi = 2e9;
    while (hi - lo > 1) {
      long long mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
      if (mid * (mid + 1) / 2 < x) {
        lo = mid;
      } else {
        hi = mid;
      }
    }
    if (hi * (hi + 1) / 2 == x + 1)
      hi++;
    cout << hi << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code is more efficient in terms of running time and memory usage. It uses a binary search algorithm to find the answer which reduces the time complexity. It also removes unnecessary macros and includes only the necessary header files which help to reduce the memory usage.
