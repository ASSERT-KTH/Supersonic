The program you've provided calculates the minimum number of moves needed to reach a certain value 'x'. This is done by incrementally increasing the 'moves' variable and checking whether the sum of all integers from 1 to 'moves' is less than 'x'. The loop breaks when this sum becomes equal to or exceeds 'x'. However, in the special case where the sum equals 'x+1', an extra move is needed.

Here are some steps to optimize the program:

1. Avoiding division operation: The expression `moves * (moves + 1) / 2` is used to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 'moves'. However, the division operation is more costly in terms of time complexity. This can be optimized by multiplying first and then dividing, i.e., `(moves * (moves + 1)) >> 1` where '>>' is the right shift operator.

2. Avoiding repeated computation: The same expression `moves * (moves + 1) / 2` is calculated twice. Instead, we can store the result in a variable and use it.

3. Minimizing library usage: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file which includes most of the standard library in C++. However, this increases the compilation time and memory usage. It's better to include only those libraries which are needed.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    long long x;
    cin >> x;
    long long moves = 0, sum = 0;
    while (true) {
      sum = (moves * (moves + 1)) >> 1;
      if (sum < x)
        moves++;
      else
        break;
    }
    if (sum == x + 1)
      moves++;
    cout << moves << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The optimization provided here is relatively small and may not lead to a significant improvement in the program's efficiency. The main bottleneck in the original program is the while loop, which has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)). Any major optimization would require a more efficient algorithm to calculate the minimum number of moves, which would necessitate a more substantial modification to the program.
