The C/C++ program calculates the minimum number of moves to reach a target value `x`.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes a lot of unnecessary files, which increases the compilation time. Include only the necessary header files.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This exposes the program to namespace collisions.

3. Reduce the number of macros: Macros are preprocessor directives and it's better to use constants or inline functions instead of macros. 

4. Use prefix increment: Prefix increment is faster as it avoids unnecessary temporary object creation.

5. Reduce unnecessary calculations: The same calculation `moves * (moves + 1) / 2` is performed twice in the loop. We can store this value in a variable and use it.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using ll = long long;
const ll MOD = 1000000007;

inline void fast_io() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);
}

int main() {
  fast_io();
  int t = 1;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    ll x;
    std::cin >> x;
    ll moves = 0;
    ll curr = 0;

    while (true) {
      if (curr < x) {
        ++moves;
        curr += moves;
      } else {
        break;
      }
    }

    if (curr == x + 1) {
      ++moves;
    }

    std::cout << moves << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized version, we include only the necessary libraries and avoid namespace pollution by removing `using namespace std`. We made macros into constants and inline function for optimization. We also store the value of `moves * (moves + 1) / 2` in a variable `curr` to avoid duplicate calculations, and we use prefix increment which is faster than postfix increment.
