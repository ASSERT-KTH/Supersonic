The main optimization in this program can be achieved by reducing the time complexity.

The while loop in the original program has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)) which can lead to slower execution times when 'x' is large. This is because for each iteration it calculates the sum of the first 'moves' natural numbers until it becomes greater than or equal to 'x'. 

This can be optimized by using a direct mathematical formula to calculate the value of 'moves'. The sum of the first 'n' natural numbers can be calculated by 'n*(n+1)/2'. If this sum is 'x', then solving the quadratic equation 'n^2 +n - 2x = 0' will give us the value of 'n'. Using the quadratic formula 'n = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)', we can calculate 'moves' in constant time.

The optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize "trapv"
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#define fio ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL)
#define ll long long
#define ull unsigned long long
#define ui unsigned int
#define vi vector<int>
#define vll vector<ll>
#define pb push_back
#define ld long double
#define mp make_pair
#define pii pair<int, int>
#define mod 1000000007
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define repp(i, a, n) for (int i = a; i < n; i++)
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define input(arr, n) for (ll i1 = 0; i1 < n; i1++) cin >> arr[i1]
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
using namespace __gnu_pbds;
#define ordered_set tree<ll, null_type, less_equal<ll>, rb_tree_tag, tree_order_statistics_node_update>
int main() {
  fio;
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll x;
    cin >> x;
    ll moves = (ll)ceil((-1.0 + sqrt(1 + 8.0 * x)) / 2.0);
    if (moves * (moves + 1) / 2 == x + 1)
      moves++;
    cout << moves << endl;
  }
}
```

Please note that in the optimized program, the 'moves' is calculated using the quadratic equation and not through the loop. Also, the '+' operator has precedence over the '/' operator, so there is no need for extra parentheses in the formula for 'moves'. The 'ceil' function is used to round up the result to the nearest integer.
