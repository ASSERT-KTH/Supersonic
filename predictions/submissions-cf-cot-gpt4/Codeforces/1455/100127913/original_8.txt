The provided code is quite optimized, but there are a few minor tweaks we can make to improve readability, and potentially performance:

1. The `while(1)` loop is a bit risky because it can lead to an infinite loop if not handled correctly. It would be better to replace it with a `for` loop with a condition that ensures termination. This also makes the code easier to read.

2. Use of macros like `#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)` can make the code harder to read for those not familiar with the macro. It's better to just write out the for loop.

3. The `#pragma GCC optimize "trapv"` is compiler-specific and may not be understood by all C++ compilers. It's generally better to avoid such compiler-specific directives unless they're absolutely necessary.

4. The `else break;` after the `if` condition in the while loop is not necessary. The loop will automatically terminate once the condition is false without needing the `break`.

Here's the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define ll long long

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    int t = 1;
    cin >> t;

    while (t--) {
        ll x;
        cin >> x;
        ll moves = 0;

        for (;moves * (moves + 1) / 2 < x; moves++);

        if (moves * (moves + 1) / 2 == x + 1)
            moves++;

        cout << moves << endl;
    }
}
```
This version of the program is a bit cleaner and easier to read, and should have the same, if not better, performance as the original.
