The current program calculates number of moves in a loop, which significantly slows down program execution for large inputs. A more efficient approach is to calculate the number of moves using mathematical formulas, thus avoiding the need for loops. This optimization greatly reduces the running time of the program.

Here's an explanation of the steps:

1. We calculate the number of moves using the formula: `moves = (-1 + sqrt(1+8*x))/2`. This formula is derived by solving the quadratic equation `moves*(moves+1)/2 = x` for moves. The `sqrt` function may sometimes give inaccurate results due to rounding errors, so we use `ceil` to always round up to the nearest integer.

2. We then check if `moves*(moves+1)/2 == x+1`. If it is true, we increment the moves by 1.

3. Finally, we output the number of moves.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize "trapv"
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
#define fio ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL)
#define ll long long
#define mod 1000000007

int main() {
  fio;
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll x;
    cin >> x;
    ll moves = ceil((-1.0 + sqrt(1+8.0*x))/2.0);
    if (moves * (moves + 1) / 2 == x + 1)
      moves++;
    cout << moves << endl;
  }
}
```
Please note that we removed some unused code (like unused macros and includes) from the original program, as it unnecessarily increases the size of the program and can potentially slow down compilation.
