Here are some optimizations you can apply to this code:

1. Remove unused macros and functions: There are a lot of macros and functions defined that are not actually used in the code. Removing them will reduce the size of the code and potentially make it easier for compilers to optimize the remaining code.

2. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`, `cin.tie(NULL);`, and `cout.tie(NULL);` to untie cin and cout from each other. This can speed up I/O operations.

3. Avoid unnecessary vector push_back operations: In the solve function, you push the elements into vector x one by one which may cause reallocation many times. Instead, you can first calculate the number of elements you are going to push and then use `vector::reserve` to allocate enough space at once.

4. Use prefix increment instead of postfix increment in loops: Prefix increment is usually more efficient than postfix increment because postfix increment needs to create a temporary copy of the object.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define vi vector<int>
#define forn(i, a, b) for (i = a; i <= b; ++i)
#define sz(s) (int)s.size()

int32_t main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int t, T = 1;
  cin >> T;
  forn(t, 1, T) {
    int i, n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;
    vi a(n);
    forn(i, 0, n - 1) cin >> a[i];
    i = 0;
    int ans = 0;
    vi x;
    x.reserve(n);
    while (i < n) {
      while (i + 1 < n and a[i] < a[i + 1])
        ++i;
      x.push_back(a[i]);
      while (i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])
        ++i;
      x.push_back(a[i]);
      ++i;
    }
    forn(i, 0, sz(x) - 2) {
      if (i & 1)
        ans -= x[i];
      else
        ans += x[i];
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
