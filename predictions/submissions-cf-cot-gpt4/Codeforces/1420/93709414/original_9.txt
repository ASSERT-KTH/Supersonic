The program's optimization can be achieved in terms of memory consumption and execution time. 

Here are the steps to optimize this code:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: `bits/stdc++.h>` is not a standard library and it might cause a slower compilation process because it includes all the standard libraries, which increases the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries for your program.

2. Avoid defining unnecessary macros: Macros like `pii`, `vi`, `vpii`, `usi`, `uspii`, `mii`, `umii`, `pqmx`, `pqmn`, `setbits`, `tzbits`, `lzbits`, `pbits`, `gcd`, `lcm`, `endl`, `sz`, `sp` are not used in the program. It's better to remove them to clean up the code.

3. Avoid using too many global variables/constants: `mod`, `inf`, `PI`, `eps`, `N` are global constants that are not used in the program. It's better to declare constants and variables only when you need them.

4. Inline functions: Functions like `powerm`, `power`, `powerNeg`, `modinv` are not used in the program. It's better to remove them to clean up the code.

5. Use `auto` for iterators: When iterating over containers, it's a good practice to use `auto` to avoid specifying the full type name.

6. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: `emplace_back` constructs the object in-place, whereas `push_back` creates a temporary object and then moves it. Therefore, `emplace_back` generally has better performance than `push_back`.

7. Remove unnecessary `else` statement: In the `powerNeg` function, the `else` statement is unnecessary because the function returns in the preceding `if` statement.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  vector<int> x;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ) {
    while (i + 1 < n && a[i] < a[i + 1]) {
      i++;
    }
    x.emplace_back(a[i]);
    while (i + 1 < n && a[i] > a[i + 1]) {
      i++;
    }
    x.emplace_back(a[i]);
    i++;
  }
  int ans = 0;
  for(int i = 0; i < x.size() - 1 ; i++) {
    if (i % 2 == 1) {
      ans -= x[i];
    } else {
      ans += x[i];
    }
  }
  cout << ans << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  while(T--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the above optimizations are based on the current code. The final optimized code may still have room for improvement based on the actual requirements of the program.
