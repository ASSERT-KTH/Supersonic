This C++ program is already efficient. However, there are some minor optimizations that can be done:

1. Reduce the use of Macros: Using `#define` for every little thing is not always a good practice as it can lead to code that is harder to read and debug. We can replace some of them with inline functions, enum, or constant variables.
2. Avoid global variables: The global constant `mod` and `N` can be moved inside the `main()` function. They are not used by multiple functions or across translation units. Global variables have a program-wide scope which can lead to naming clashes and make code harder to understand and debug.
3. Unnecessary use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This is a GCC specific library that includes most standard library headers. It's generally a bad idea to include it, because it can lead to slower compile times and portability issues. Include only headers that you need.
4. Use `std::endl` judiciously: `std::endl` not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output stream, which can be a costly operation. We can replace it with `'\n'` where flushing is not necessary.
5. Unnecessary use of vector `x`: This vector is used to store the peak and the trough of the array `a`. But we can directly calculate the `ans` inside the while loop without storing the values in `x`.

Here is the optimized version of your code:
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>

using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

void solve() {
    ll n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;
    vector<ll> a(n);
    for(ll i=0; i<n; i++)
        cin >> a[i];
    ll i = 0;
    ll ans = 0;
    ll temp;
    while (i < n) {
        while (i + 1 < n and a[i] < a[i + 1])
            i++;
        temp = a[i];
        while (i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])
            i++;
        ans += temp - a[i];
        i++;
    }
    cout << ans << '\n';
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    ll t=1;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version of the program, we have eliminated unnecessary macros, avoided the global variable, included only necessary headers, replaced `std::endl` with '\n', and removed the unnecessary usage of vector `x`.
