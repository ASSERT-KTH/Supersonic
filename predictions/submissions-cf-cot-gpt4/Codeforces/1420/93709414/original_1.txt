This code is already quite optimized, but there are still some tweaks that can be made to improve its performance:

1. Remove Unused Code: There are a lot of defined functions and macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these to make the code cleaner and easier to read. This won't improve the performance of the code, but it's a good practice to remove unused code.

2. Use Reserve Function for Vector: In the code, a vector `x` is used which size is not defined initially and it grows dynamically. This can be a little bit costly in terms of runtime because every time an element is inserted, a check is performed to see if the vector has enough space to accommodate the new element. If it doesn't, then a new block of memory has to be allocated, the old elements have to be copied to the new memory location, and the old memory has to be deallocated. By using the `reserve` function, we can allocate enough memory in advance to avoid dynamic resizing.

3. Avoid Using `endl`: The `endl` not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the stream. This can be quite expensive in terms of performance, especially in a loop. Instead, we can use `'\n'` to insert a newline.

4. Use Pre-increment Instead of Post-increment: Pre-increment (`++i`) is generally faster than post-increment (`i++`) because post-increment involves keeping a copy of the original value, incrementing the value, and then returning the un-incremented copy for use in the rest of the expression. In contrast, pre-increment simply increments the value and returns the result.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define vi vector<int>
#define forn(i, a, b) for (i = a; i <= b; ++i)
#define sz(s) (int)s.size()
const int N = 2e6 + 5;
void solve() {
  int i, j;
  int n, q;
  cin >> n >> q;
  vi a(n);
  forn(i, 0, n - 1) cin >> a[i];
  i = 0;
  int ans = 0;
  vi x;
  x.reserve(n);
  while (i < n) {
    while (i + 1 < n and a[i] < a[i + 1])
      ++i;
    x.push_back(a[i]);
    while (i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])
      ++i;
    x.push_back(a[i]);
    ++i;
  }
  forn(i, 0, sz(x) - 2) {
    if (i & 1)
      ans -= x[i];
    else
      ans += x[i];
  }
  cout << ans << '\n';
}
int32_t main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int t, T = 1;
  cin >> T;
  forn(t, 1, T) { solve(); }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: Even though the code is now more optimized, the actual performance improvement might be very small, and in some cases, it might be unnoticeable. It's also important to note that modern compilers are quite advanced and many of these optimizations might be already done by the compiler itself.
