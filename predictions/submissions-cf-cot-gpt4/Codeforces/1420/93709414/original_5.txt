The given program doesn't have much room for optimization, but a few potential improvements could be:

1. Avoiding multiple function calls: In the 'solve' function, 'sz(x)' is called multiple times within the 'forn' loop. The 'sz(x)' function could be computed once and stored in a variable to avoid multiple computations. 

2. Reducing the number of operations: In the 'solve' function, instead of checking 'i & 1' to decide whether to add or subtract, the value could be added unconditionally, and subtracted only when 'i & 1' is true.

3. Improving readability: The 'forn' and 'nfor' macros could be replaced with standard 'for' loops for better readability and consistency with standard C++ coding practices. 

4. Using vector::reserve: To prevent multiple reallocations during the vector resizing, 'x.reserve(n)' could be added before the 'while' loop where elements are pushed into 'x'. 

5. Replacing 'endl' with '\n': 'endl' causes a flush operation which can be costly in terms of performance. It can be replaced with '\n' which doesn't cause a flush operation.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
...
#define dbg(x...)                                                              \
  cout << "[" << #x << "]=[";                                                  \
  _print(x)
...

int32_t main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int t, T = 1;
  cin >> T;
  for(t=1; t<=T; t++) { solve(); }
  return 0;
}

void solve() {
  int i, j;
  int n, q;
  cin >> n >> q;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for(i=0; i<=n-1; i++) cin >> a[i];
  i = 0;
  int ans = 0;
  vector<int> x;
  x.reserve(n);
  while (i < n) {
    while (i + 1 < n and a[i] < a[i + 1])
      i++;
    x.push_back(a[i]);
    while (i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])
      i++;
    x.push_back(a[i]);
    i++;
  }
  int size = x.size();
  for(i=0; i<=size-2; i++) {
    ans += x[i];
    if (i & 1)
      ans -= 2 * x[i];
  }
  cout << ans << '\n';
}
```
