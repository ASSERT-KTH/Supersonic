The provided code can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Remove unused preprocessor macros, typedefs, and functions: The code contains many unused #define macros, typedefs and functions which unnecessarily increase its size. We will remove them for optimization.

2. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: This header file includes a lot of libraries which can significantly slow down the compilation process. Instead, we'll include only the necessary libraries.

3. Optimize the `solve()` function: In the solve function, a vector `x` is being used to store the values temporarily and then calculate `ans`. Instead of doing this, we can calculate `ans` on the fly while iterating through `a[]` thus avoiding the extra space usage by `x`.

4. Avoid using `std::endl`: `std::endl` not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output. This is unnecessary overhead if you're writing a lot of data. Instead, we can use `'\n'`.

Here is the optimized code based on the above points:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

#define int long long
#define vi vector<int>
#define forn(i, a, b) for (i = a; i <= b; i++)

using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int i, j;
  int n, q;
  cin >> n >> q;
  vi a(n);

  forn(i, 0, n - 1) cin >> a[i];

  i = 0;
  int ans = 0;
  while (i < n) {
    while (i + 1 < n and a[i] < a[i + 1])
      i++;
    int v1 = a[i];
    while (i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])
      i++;
    int v2 = a[i];

    ans += v1 - v2;
    i++;
  }
  cout << ans << '\n';
}

int32_t main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  int t, T = 1;
  cin >> T;
  
  forn(t, 1, T) { solve(); }
  
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code should run faster and use less memory than the original code.
