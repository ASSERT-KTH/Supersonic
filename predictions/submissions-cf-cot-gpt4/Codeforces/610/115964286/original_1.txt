The given program uses a defined macro "FASTIO" to speed up I/O operations. This is an optimization in itself and doesn't need modification.

The division operation in the else clause can be optimized. Instead of performing two division operations, we can do it in one step which will make the program run faster.

Step 1: Remove the #define FASTIO and other related statements. There are no heavy I/O operations in this program, hence these statements are unnecessary and removing them will save memory.

Step 2: In the else clause, instead of performing two division operations, we can do it in one step by dividing the number by 4. This will speed up the program.

The optimized program will look like this:

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  if (n % 2 != 0) {
    cout << "0";
  } else {
    cout << n / 4;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note that we replaced ll (long long) with its full form for better readability and understanding. Using full form instead of short form like 'll' can help avoid confusion and make the code more maintainable.
