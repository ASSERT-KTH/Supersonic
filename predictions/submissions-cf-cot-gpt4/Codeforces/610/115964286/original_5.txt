Before we start the optimization, it's important to note that the original program is a simple one. It takes an input number 'n' from the user, checks if the number is even or odd. If it's odd it prints '0', else it performs an operation on the number and displays the result.

Here are a few steps to optimize the program:

1. Inclusion of `<bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file in C++ includes most of the libraries which makes the program heavy and increases the compilation time. So, it's better to include only those libraries which are being used in the program. In this case, we are using only `iostream` for input/output operations.

2. Macro `FASTIO`: This macro is used to speed up the input/output operations in C++. This is only necessary when our program handles large amounts of input/output. In this case, our program only does a few input/output operations, so this macro is not necessary.

3. Use of `ll` for `long long`: This is a good practice to shorten the `long long` datatype to `ll` using `#define`. It doesn't really affect the performance of the program but it makes the program easier to read and write.

4. The if-else construct can be replaced with a ternary operator to make the code cleaner. However, this does not necessarily optimize the code in terms of performance.

Here is the optimized code based on these steps:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  cout << (n % 2 != 0 ? 0 : ((n / 2) - 1) / 2);
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we've removed the unnecessary header file and the `FASTIO` macro. We've also simplified the if-else construct to a ternary operator. The performance of this optimized code would be very similar to the original code, but it's cleaner and easier to understand.
