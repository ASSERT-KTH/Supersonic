The given program is already quite efficient in both running time and memory usage, as it only uses a few variables and performs simple operations. However, there is still a small room for optimization.

The provided code is checking if the number `n` is not even. If it's not even, it immediately prints "0". If it is even, it calculates `n/2`, subtracts one and then divides by 2 again. This can be optimized by reducing the number of arithmetic operations:
- Instead of checking `n % 2 != 0` to determine if `n` is odd, we can check `n & 1` which checks the last bit of `n`. If it is 1, `n` is odd. This uses bitwise operations which are faster than arithmetic operations.
- The division operation `((n / 2) - 1) / 2` can be simplified to `n / 4 - 0.5`. However, since we are working with integers, we can't use decimal numbers. Instead, we can use bitwise shift operations. `n >> 2` is the same as `n / 4` and it's faster. After subtracting 1, we should shift right by 1 again to achieve the division by 2.

Let's apply these optimizations to your code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define FASTIO                                                                 \
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);                                            \
  cin.tie(0);                                                                  \
  cout.tie(0);
using namespace std;
int main() {
  FASTIO
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  if (n & 1) {
    cout << "0";
  } else {
    cout << ((n >> 2) - 1) >> 1;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Remember, although these optimizations may slightly improve the performance of your program, they will hardly make a noticeable difference in this case because the operations being optimized are already very fast. In real-world applications, the most effective optimizations often come from algorithmic improvements rather than micro-optimizations like these.
