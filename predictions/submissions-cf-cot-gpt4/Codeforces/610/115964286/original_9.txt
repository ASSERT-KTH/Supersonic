This is already a quite optimized program. However, there are some minor improvements that can be made.

1. Instead of using `#define ll long long`, which can lead to confusion, we will use a `typedef` declaration to alias `long long` as `ll`.
2. The macro `FASTIO` is used to speed up I/O operations, but it could lead to confusion and errors. We will remove it and put its body directly in the `main` function. This doesn't actually save any computational resources, but it can make the code clearer.
3. Instead of using `bits/stdc++.h`, we will include only the necessary libraries. `bits/stdc++.h` is a convenience library that includes many standard libraries, but it can slow down the compilation process and could potentially introduce name conflicts. It's generally recommended to include only the necessary libraries.
4. The division operation `(n / 2)` is performed twice. We can optimize this by storing the result in a variable and reusing it.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

typedef long long ll;

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  ll n;
  cin >> n;

  if (n % 2 != 0) {
    cout << "0";
  } else {
    ll half_n = n / 2;
    cout << half_n / 2 - 1;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
