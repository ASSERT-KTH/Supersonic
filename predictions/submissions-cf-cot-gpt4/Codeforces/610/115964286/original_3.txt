The given C/C++ program is relatively simple and optimal. However, there's a tiny bit of optimization that can be done.

1. Instead of using the `#define` preprocessor to define the macro `FASTIO`, you can directly use the code. This reduces the complexity of the code as there's no need to define a macro for such a small piece of code.

2. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is actually not a standard include. It's a GCC extension that includes all standard library headers at once. This is convenient but can lead to slower compile times because it includes a lot of unnecessary stuff. Therefore, just include what you need, which in this case are `iostream`.

3. Instead of doing `n / 2` twice, you can directly divide `n` by `4`, which will reduce one division operation.

4. You should avoid using the `std` namespace globally. It's a good practice to specify the namespace for each class or function.

The optimized code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);
  
  long long n;
  std::cin >> n;
  if (n % 2 != 0) {
    std::cout << "0";
  } else {
    std::cout << (n / 4);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
