The optimization of this program can be done in the following ways:

1. First, we can avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` which is not a standard header file and includes almost all the standard C++ libraries which increases the compilation time.

2. Instead of using macro `FASTIO` to speed up I/O operations, we can simply put `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(nullptr);` in the main function. This will ensure that these calls are made only once and also makes the code cleaner and more readable.

3. The condition `(n % 2 != 0)` can be written as `(n & 1)` which uses bitwise AND operation which is faster than the modulo operation.

4. The division operation in C++ is costly in terms of time complexity, we can replace it with bitwise shift operation which is faster. `(n / 2)` can be written as `(n >> 1)`.

5. Also, we can use '\n' instead of `std::endl` to print newlines, as `std::endl` causes an unnecessary flush operation which can slow down the output.

So, considering these points, the optimized code would be:

```cpp
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  if (n & 1) {
    cout << "0\n";
  } else {
    cout << ((n >> 1) - 1) >> 1 << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
