Following are the steps to optimize your given C/C++ code:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because this header file includes quite a lot of files, which adds extra compilation time. It's better to include only those libraries which you are actually using.

2. Avoid using `#define FASTIO` macro, it's better to write the code directly in the main function if it's not reused. Also, this macro doesn't significantly improve the performance.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std;` as it causes name collision problems.

4. Change `ll n; cin >> n;` to `ll n = 0; std::cin >> n;`, the variable is initialized, which can prevent potential problems.

5. Use `std::cout << '\n';` instead of `std::cout << endl;` because `endl` causes unnecessary overhead by flushing the stream.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);
  
  long long n = 0;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  if (n % 2 != 0) {
    std::cout << "0" << '\n';
  } else {
    std::cout << ((n / 2) - 1) / 2 << '\n';
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations don't significantly improve the running time or memory usage of this specific program but are general best practices to follow in C++. The time complexity of the original and the optimized program remains O(1) and space complexity also remains O(1).
