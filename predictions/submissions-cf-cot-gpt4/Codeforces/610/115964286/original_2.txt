The program is already quite optimized, but there are a few changes that could be made:

1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file is not standard, is not portable and includes far more than necessary, which increases the compilation time. Include only the necessary headers.
2. Remove `#define ll long long`. Use `long long` directly in your code to improve readability.
3. Remove `#define FASTIO` part. It is used to speed up cin and cout, but in this case, the code only uses cin and cout once, so the speedup is negligible but it decreases the readability of the code.
4. The program could benefit from a more descriptive variable name than `n`. A name like `number` would be more readable.
5. The if/else statement could be rewritten without the else clause. If `n` is odd, the function will return after outputting "0", so there's no need for an else clause. This reduces the level of indentation and makes the code easier to read.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  long long number;
  cin >> number;

  if (number % 2 != 0) {
    cout << "0";
    return 0;
  }
  
  cout << ((number / 2) - 1) / 2;
  
  return 0;
}
```
