The given program checks if a number is even and if it is, it computes and prints the result of the operation `((n / 2) - 1) / 2`. If the number is odd, it prints "0". 

Optimization Steps:

1. We can optimize the code by eliminating unnecessary macro `FASTIO`. This macro currently sets the synchronization of C++'s iostream with C's stdio to false, ties cin with NULL, and cout with NULL. These lines are used to speed up cin/cout but here we are only using cin/cout once each so it does not have any significant impact. In fact, it might confuse readers and maintainers of the code.

2. The current code checks if `n` is odd and then prints "0". This is unnecessary as the expression `((n / 2) - 1) / 2` would yield 0 for odd numbers and there would be no need to check for evenness.

3. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a header file that includes every standard library. In our case, we only use a few of them. Including only the libraries we use can reduce the compilation time and make the code cleaner and more readable.

4. The usage of `ll` as a macro for `long long` doesn't add much to the readability of the code and could potentially cause conflicts with other libraries or parts of the code.

5. The code currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output. These are generally slower than `scanf` and `printf`, so we can switch to those for a bit of speed improvement.

Optimized code:

```C++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  long long n;
  scanf("%lld", &n);
  printf("%lld", ((n / 2) - 1) / 2);
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the effect of these optimizations would be negligible in this small program, but they are good practices to follow in larger programs where they can have a more significant impact.
