The original program takes a number as input and checks if it's even. If the number is even, it divides it by 2, subtracts 1, and then divides the result by 2 again. It then prints this value.

The optimization is to replace the division by 2, which is a bit expensive, with a right shift operation. 

Right shifting a number in binary by one position is equivalent to dividing it by 2. This is because binary is base 2, and thus shifting to the right by one position effectively divides the number by 2.

In the given program, we can replace the division by 2 with the right shift operation. 

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define FASTIO                                                                 \
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);                                            \
  cin.tie(0);                                                                  \
  cout.tie(0);
using namespace std;
int main() {
  FASTIO
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  if (n & 1) {
    cout << "0";
  } else {
    cout << ((n >> 1) - 1) >> 1;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized program, we replaced `n % 2` with `n & 1` which checks the last bit of the number. If the last bit is 1, the number is odd, and if it's 0, the number is even. This is faster than the modulus operation.

Also, the division by 2 is replaced by right shift operation (`>>` operator). This operation is faster than division.
