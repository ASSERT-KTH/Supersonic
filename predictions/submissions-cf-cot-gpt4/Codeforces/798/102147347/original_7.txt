Optimization Steps:

1. The gcd function can be made more efficient by using the Euclidean algorithm, which reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n) in worst case scenario. The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.

2. The program uses a 2D dynamic programming array dp[200000][2], which is initialized to inf and then updated in the main function. However, due to the nature of the updates, the second dimension of the array is not necessary. We can reduce this to a 1D array dp[200000], which will reduce the memory usage of the program.

3. The modulus operator (%) is used multiple times to check if a number is even or odd. However, this operation is slower than bitwise operations. We can replace it with the bitwise AND operator (&), which will check the least significant bit of the number. If the bit is set, the number is odd; otherwise, it's even. This will slightly improve the running time of the program.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

#define ll long long
#define rep(i, n) for (long long(i) = 0; (i) < (n); ++(i))
#define ref(i, a, b) for (long long(i) = (a); (i) <= (b); ++(i))
#define endl '\n'
#define st first
#define nd second
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
const int mx = 2e6 + 5;
int inf = 2e9;
int gcd(int a, int b) {
  if (b == 0)
    return a;
  return gcd(b, a % b);
}
int dp[200000];
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n + 24);
  rep(i, n) { cin >> a[i + 1]; }
  int faust = gcd(a[1], a[2]);
  ref(i, 3, n) { faust = gcd(faust, a[i]); }
  a[n + 1] = 2;
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n + 2; ++i) {
    dp[i] = inf;
  }
  if (faust > 1) {
    cout << "YES" << endl;
    cout << 0 << endl;
    return 0;
  }
  ref(i, 1, n) {
    if (a[i] & 1 and a[i + 1] & 1) {
      if (dp[i - 1] != inf)
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1;
    } else if (a[i] & 1 and !(a[i + 1] & 1)) {
      if (dp[i - 1] != inf) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 2;
      }
    } else if (!(a[i] & 1) and a[i + 1] & 1) {
      if (dp[i - 1] != inf)
        dp[i] = min(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 1] + 2);
    } else if (!(a[i] & 1) and !(a[i + 1] & 1)) {
      if (dp[i - 1] != inf)
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1];
    }
  }
  cout << "YES" << endl;
