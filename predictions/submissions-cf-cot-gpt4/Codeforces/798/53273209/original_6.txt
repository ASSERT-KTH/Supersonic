This program is solving a problem where it finds the minimum number of string rotations to make all the strings in the array equal. There are several ways to optimize this program.

1. The most expensive part of this program is the string rotation operation, which costs O(n) time complexity. We can optimize this by using a deque instead of a vector for storing strings. The rotation operation on a deque only costs O(1) time complexity.

2. The `vector<string> B = A;` operation in the outer loop will cost O(n) time complexity and extra space. We can avoid this by rotating string back after the inner loop.

3. We don't need to use the `counter` variable to count the rotations. The number of rotations is just the value of `z`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<deque<char>> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string x;
    cin >> x;
    A[i] = deque<char>(x.begin(), x.end());
  }
  if (n == 1) {
    cout << 0;
    return 0;
  }
  int ans = INT_MAX;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int totalRotations = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      int rotations = 0;
      while (string(A[j].begin(), A[j].end()) != string(A[i].begin(), A[i].end())) {
        char e = A[j].front();
        A[j].pop_front();
        A[j].push_back(e);
        rotations++;
        if (rotations > 50) {
          cout << -1;
          return 0;
        }
      }
      totalRotations += rotations;
      // Rotate back
      for (int k = 0; k < rotations; ++k) {
        char e = A[j].back();
        A[j].pop_back();
        A[j].push_front(e);
      }
    }
    ans = min(ans, totalRotations);
  }
  cout << ans;
}
```
This version of the program is more efficient because it avoids unnecessary string and vector copying, and it takes advantage of the deque data structure to perform the rotation operation more efficiently.
