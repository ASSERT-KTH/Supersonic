The given program reads a list of strings and performs a character rotation on each string to match a reference string. It then outputs the minimum number of rotations needed to match all strings with the reference string. It seems to perform these rotations for each string in the array as a reference.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Memory usage can be optimized by reserving space for vectors A and B upfront instead of letting them grow dynamically. This will prevent reallocation of memory which is an expensive operation. We know that we will store 'n' elements in the vector so we can use the reserve() function to do this.
2. The copying of vector A to B for each iteration is unnecessary and can be optimized. Instead of copying the entire vector, we can just reset the counter and the string variable.
3. We can use the string's substr function and concatenation to perform the rotation instead of erasing and appending characters one by one. This operation can reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(1).
4. There's no need to use vectors for storing the strings, the array can be used which will reduce the memory footprint of the program.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  string A[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  if (n == 1) {
    cout << 0;
    return 0;
  }
  int ans = 1000001;
  int counter = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string s = A[i];
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      int z = 0;
      while (A[j] != s) {
        A[j] = A[j].substr(1) + A[j][0];
        counter++;
        z++;
        if (z > 50) {
          cout << -1;
          return 0;
        }
      }
    }
    ans = min(ans, counter);
    counter = 0;
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the memory usage is reduced by avoiding unnecessary copying of vectors and using arrays instead of vectors. The running time is reduced by using the substr function to perform the rotation operation.
