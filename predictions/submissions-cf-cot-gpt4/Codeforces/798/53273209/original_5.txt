Optimization Steps:

1. Use `reserve(n)` for `vector<string> A;` to preallocate memory for `n` strings, which avoids reallocations as the vector grows.
2. Instead of copying `A` to `B` in every outer loop iteration (`B = A;`), we can create `B` once and restore only the modified elements. This will significantly reduce memory copying operations.
3. Instead of using `erase` and `+=` to rotate the string, use `substr` and `+` operator. This will reduce the number of in-place modifications of the string, which could be costly.
4. Instead of initializing `int ans = 1000001;`, use `INT_MAX` which is more readable and standard approach.
5. Instead of checking `if (z > 50)` in the innermost loop, we can check `if (B[j].length() < z)`. This is because if string `B[j]` has less than 50 characters, it will never be equal to `s` and we can break the loop early.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<string> B;
  vector<string> A;
  A.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string x;
    cin >> x;
    A.push_back(x);
  }
  if (n == 1) {
    cout << 0;
    return 0;
  }
  int ans = INT_MAX;
  int counter = 0;
  B = A;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string s = A[i];
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      int z = 0;
      while (B[j] != s && B[j].length() >= z) {
        B[j] = B[j].substr(1) + B[j][0];
        counter++;
        z++;
      }
      if (B[j] != s) {
        B[j] = A[j];
      }
    }
    ans = min(ans, counter);
    counter = 0;
  }
  cout << ans;
}
```

Note: The use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;` is generally considered bad practice. It's better to include only the necessary headers and avoid "using namespace" in the global scope.
