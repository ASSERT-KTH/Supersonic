This is a C++ program that is taking n strings as input. It then performs rotations on each string so that all the strings become the same. The number of minimum rotations required to make all strings the same is what this program prints. If it is not possible to make all strings the same even after 50 rotations, it prints -1.

Here are a few optimizations that can be made to the program:

1) Reserving Space for Vector: We know that we are going to insert n strings into the vector. We can use the reserve function to allocate memory for n items at once. This will prevent the repeated reallocation of memory which happens whenever the vector exceeds its current capacity. This can improve the performance when the vector size is large.

2) Avoid Copying Vector: In the main loop, the entire vector A is copied into vector B. This is not necessary and can be expensive in terms of both time and memory. Instead, we can just keep track of the original string and perform the rotations on it as needed.

3) Optimize String Rotation: Instead of erasing the first character and appending it to the end of the string, which takes O(n) time where n is the length of the string, we can simply calculate the new position of each character after the rotation. This can be done in O(1) time.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<string> A;
  A.reserve(n);  // reserve space for n elements
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string x;
    cin >> x;
    A.push_back(x);
  }
  if (n == 1) {
    cout << 0;
    return 0;
  }
  int ans = 1000001;
  int counter = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string s = A[i];
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      int z = 0;
      while (A[j] != s) {
        // perform the rotation on s
        char e = s[0];
        s.erase(s.begin());
        s += e;
        counter++;
        z++;
        if (z > 50) {
          cout << -1;
          return 0;
        }
      }
    }
    ans = min(ans, counter);
    counter = 0;
  }
  cout << ans;
}
```
