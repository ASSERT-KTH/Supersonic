This program seems to be already well-optimized, but we can still do some improvements as follows:

1. You're using `#define` for loop shortcuts, but this leads to unclear code and possible bugs due to scoping issues. It's better to use explicit loops.
2. You're using `using namespace std;` which is considered bad practice as it can lead to naming conflicts. It's better to use `std::` prefix where needed.
3. You're defining some constants like `pi` and `MOD` but they're not used at all. Remove them to reduce clutter.
4. You're using `#define ll long long int`, `#define ll2 int64_t` and `#define dob double`, but you can use the types directly in the code which is more clear.
5. The variable `j`, `k`, `x`, `m` are declared but not used at all. Remove them to reduce clutter.
6. You're using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. Include only what you need, which in this case seems to be `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<climits>`, and `<algorithm>`.
7. You're using `cin.tie(0);`, and `cout.tie(0);` which untie `cin` from `cout`. These are already untied by default in C++ and this statement has no effect. Remove them to reduce clutter.

After applying these optimizations, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    std::string s;
    int64_t n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::cin >> s;
    std::vector<int64_t> left(n + 1, 0), right(n + 1, 0);
    int64_t star = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (s[i] == '.') {
        left[i + 1] = left[i] + star;
      } else {
        star++;
        left[i + 1] = left[i];
      }
    }
    star = 0;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (s[i] == '.') {
        right[i] = right[i + 1] + star;
      } else {
        star++;
        right[i] = right[i + 1];
      }
    }
    int64_t ans = LLONG_MAX;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      ans = std::min(ans, left[i] + right[i]);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      ans = std::min(ans, left[i] + right[i - 1]);
    }
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  }
}
```

The overall logic of the program remains the same. The optimizations done here are mostly about code style and readability, not about performance. The program was already efficient performance-wise.
