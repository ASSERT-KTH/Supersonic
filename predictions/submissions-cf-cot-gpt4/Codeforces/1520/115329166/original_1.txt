The given C++ program seems to be solving a problem where it takes a string of '.' and '*' characters as input and calculates some minimum value based on the positions of '*' characters. 

Here are the optimizations that could be made:

1. Remove unnecessary macros: The program uses a lot of macros which are not necessary and only adds to the cognitive load of understanding the code. For example, the program uses `#define pb(x) push_back(x)`, but `push_back` is not used anywhere in the code. Removing these will make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

2. Reduce the scope of variables: The variables i, j, k, x, n, m are declared globally, but they can be declared within the main function where they are used. This reduces the memory footprint of the program.

3. Use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes almost all standard library header files in C++. Although it's convenient, it increases compilation time as the compiler has to process a lot of unnecessary files. Including only required header files can speed up the compilation time.

4. Unused constant values: The constants pi, nax, MOD are not used anywhere in the program, so they can be removed.

5. Avoid using `using namespace std`: It's generally a bad practice in large projects because it could lead to name clashes.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;
using std::min;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  long long t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    string s;
    long long n;
    cin >> n;
    cin >> s;
    vector<long long> left(n + 1, 0), right(n + 1, 0);
    long long star = 0;
    for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (s[i] == '.') {
        left[i + 1] = left[i] + star;
      } else {
        star++;
        left[i + 1] = left[i];
      }
    }
    star = 0;
    for (long long i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (s[i] == '.') {
        right[i] = right[i + 1] + star;
      } else {
        star++;
        right[i] = right[i + 1];
      }
    }
    long long ans = LLONG_MAX;
    for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      ans = min(ans, left[i] + right[i]);
    }
    for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      ans = min(ans, left[i] + right[i - 1]);
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

This optimized version of the code is cleaner and easier to understand. It also uses less memory and compiles faster. The logic of the code is unchanged.
