Let's go through the code and identify areas where we can optimize:

1. Unnecessary Macro Definitions: This code has a lot of macro definitions that aren't being used anywhere in the code. Removing these will clean up the code and save memory. 

2. Unnecessary Vector Initialization: The vectors `left` and `right` are initialized with `0` with the size of `n+1`. Here, instead of using `vector<ll> left(n + 1, 0), right(n + 1, 0);` we can use `vector<ll> left(n), right(n);` and initialize the first element of vector `left` and last element of vector `right` manually.

3. Unnecessary Variables: There are some variables declared at the top of the main function that are never used. It's best to remove these to save memory.

4. Unnecessary Loops: There are two loops that iterate over the `n` elements of `s` and calculate the minimum value for `ans`. These can be combined into a single loop to save time.

Here's the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
#define ll long long int
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ll t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    string s;
    ll n;
    cin >> n;
    cin >> s;
    vector<ll> left(n), right(n);
    ll star = 0;
    left[0] = 0;
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (s[i] == '.') {
        left[i + 1] = left[i] + star;
      } else {
        star++;
        left[i + 1] = left[i];
      }
    }
    star = 0;
    right[n - 1] = 0;
    for (ll i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (s[i] == '.') {
        right[i - 1] = right[i] + star;
      } else {
        star++;
        right[i - 1] = right[i];
      }
    }
    ll ans = LLONG_MAX;
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      ans = min(ans, left[i] + right[i]);
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

Remember that this code assumes that `s` is at least of size `n`. If this is not the case, you will need to add error checking code.
