The given program is well optimized in terms of algorithmic complexity but there is still some room for optimization, which are mainly related to reducing memory usage. Here are the steps for optimizing the program:

1. Remove unused libraries: The code includes several libraries which are not used in the code. Removing these unnecessary includes can speed up the compile time.

2. Use `reserve()` for vectors: If the size of the vector is known in advance, it is better to reserve the memory in advance to avoid reallocations.

3. Avoid using `std::endl`: `std::endl` not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the stream. It is better to use "\n" to insert a newline, and flush the stream only when it is necessary.

4. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` at the beginning of the main function: This can significantly speed up I/O operations in many situations.

5. Using bitwise operations: In the code, there is a line `__builtin_popcount(b) % 2`. Since the purpose of this operation is to determine if the number of bits in 'b' is odd or even, this can be replaced with a bitwise operation which is faster.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

void solve() {}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<vector<ll>> t(2 * n, vector<ll>(3));
  for(ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    ll l, r;
    cin >> l >> r;
    t[2 * i] = {l, 1, i};
    t[2 * i + 1] = {r + 1, -1, i};
  }
  sort(t.begin(), t.end());
  
  vector<ll> states(1 << n, 0);
  vector<ll> newstates(1 << n, 0);
  states.reserve(1 << n);
  newstates.reserve(1 << n);

  ll sz = 0;
  ll pi = t[0][2], ni;
  ll pp = t[0][0], np;
  vector<ll> streams;
  for(ll i = 0; i < 2 * n; ++i) {
    ni = t[i][2];
    np = t[i][0];
    if (t[i][1] == -1) {
      --sz;
      ll gi = 0;
      while (streams[gi] != ni) {
        ++gi;
      }
      for(ll b = 0; b < (1 << sz); ++b) {
        ll exp1 = ((b >> gi) << (gi + 1)) + (b % (1 << gi));
        ll exp2 = exp1 + (1 << gi);
        newstates[b] =
            max(states[exp1] + ((exp1 & 1) * (np - pp)),
                states[exp2] + ((exp2 & 1) * (np - pp)));
      }
      states = newstates;
      streams.erase(streams.begin() + gi);
    } else {
      streams.push_back(ni);
      for(ll b = 0; b < (1 << sz); ++b) {
        newstates[b] = states[b] + ((b & 1) * (np - pp));
        newstates[b + (1 << sz)] =
            states[b] + ((b & 1) * (np - pp));
      }
      states = newstates;
      ++sz;
    }
    pi = ni;
    pp = np;
  }
  cout << states[0] << "\n";
}
```
