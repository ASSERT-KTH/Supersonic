The first thing that could be optimized in the provided C++ code is the unnecessary usage of extra data structures and operations which could be avoided.

1. There are several template functions which are not used in the code (`printvec`, `printtree`, `printmap`, `chmax`, `chmin`). These are adding to the memory footprint of the code, even though they are not used. Removing these would optimize memory usage.
2. The macro `COUT(x)` is also not used anywhere in the code and can be removed.
3. The definition of unused types such as `ull`, `P`, `triple`, `D` adds to memory usage and can be removed.
4. `streams` vector is used only to find the index of a value and erase it. Instead of `vector`, `unordered_map` can be used to keep track of the indexes which could be faster for lookups and erasures.
5. Avoid copying the entire `states` vector to `newstates` vector in each iteration. Instead, swap the vectors which will be more efficient.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, n) for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i)
#define all(s) s.begin(), s.end()
typedef long long ll;
const ll INF = 1e9;
const ll MOD = 1000000007;
void solve() {}
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  ll n, m, k;
  cin >> n >> m >> k;
  vector<vector<ll>> t(2 * n, vector<ll>(3));
  rep(i, n) {
    ll l, r;
    cin >> l >> r;
    t[2 * i] = {l, 1, i};
    t[2 * i + 1] = {r + 1, -1, i};
  }
  sort(all(t));
  vector<ll> states(1 << k, 0);
  vector<ll> newstates(1 << k, 0);
  ll sz = 0;
  ll pi = t[0][2], ni;
  ll pp = t[0][0], np;
  unordered_map<ll, ll> streamIndexes;
  rep(i, 2 * n) {
    ni = t[i][2];
    np = t[i][0];
    if (t[i][1] == -1) {
      --sz;
      ll gi = streamIndexes[ni];
      rep(b, 1 << sz) {
        ll exp1 = ((b >> gi) << (gi + 1)) + (b % (1 << gi));
        ll exp2 = exp1 + (1 << gi);
        newstates[b] =
            max(states[exp1] + (__builtin_popcount(exp1) % 2) * (np - pp),
                states[exp2] + (__builtin_popcount(exp2) % 2) * (np - pp));
      }
      streamIndexes.erase(ni);
    } else {
      streamIndexes[ni] = sz;
      rep(b, 1 << sz) {
        newstates[b] = states[b] + (__builtin_popcount(b) % 2) * (np - pp);
        newstates[b + (1 << sz)] =
            states[b] + (__builtin_popcount(b) % 2) * (np - pp);
      }
      ++sz;
    }
    pi = ni;
    pp = np;
    states.swap(newstates);
  }
  cout << states[0] << " ";
}
```
