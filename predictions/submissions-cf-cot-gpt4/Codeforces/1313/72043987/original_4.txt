Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. The most significant optimization would be in the usage of vector "streams". This vector is used to keep track of the active intervals. However, each time an interval ends, the program searches for its index in the vector and erases it. This operation is O(n), which is inefficient. We can replace the vector with a set. Set in C++ is implemented as a Binary Search Tree and it provides logarithmic time search, insert and delete operations.

2. Another optimization would be the usage of "states" and "newstates" vectors. These vectors are used to keep track of the best scores for each possible state. However, the program creates a new "newstates" vector in each iteration and then copies it to "states". This is inefficient. Instead, we can use a single array and update it in-place.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <cassert>
#include <cmath>
#include <functional>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define COUT(x) cout << #x << " = " << (x) << " (L" << __LINE__ << ")" << endl
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<ll, ll> P;
typedef tuple<ll, ll, ll> triple;
const ll INF = 1e9;
const ll MOD = 1000000007;
void solve() {}
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  ll n, m, k;
  cin >> n >> m >> k;
  vector<triple> t(2 * n);
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    ll l, r;
    cin >> l >> r;
    t[2 * i] = {l, 1, i};
    t[2 * i + 1] = {r + 1, -1, i};
  }
  sort(t.begin(), t.end());
  vector<ll> states(1 << k, 0);
  ll sz = 0;
  ll pi = get<2>(t[0]), ni;
  ll pp = get<0>(t[0]), np;
  set<ll> streams;
  for (ll i = 0; i < 2 * n; ++i) {
    ni = get<2>(t[i]);
    np = get<0>(t[i]);
    if (get<1>(t[i]) == -1) {
      --sz;
      streams.erase(ni);
    } else {
      streams.insert(ni);
      ++sz;
    }
    for (ll b = 0; b < (1 << sz); ++b) {
      states[b] = max(states[b], states[b + (1 << sz)]) + (__builtin_popcount(b) % 2) * (np - pp);
    }
    pi = ni;
    pp = np;
  }
  cout << states[0] << " ";
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version of the program reduces memory usage by avoiding unnecessary vector copies and reduces running time by replacing a linear time operation with a logarithmic time operation.
