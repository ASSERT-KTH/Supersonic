This program seems to be already quite optimized in terms of algorithmic complexity. It's using bit manipulation which is a very efficient way to handle operations. However, there are still some possible improvements to reduce memory usage and possibly improve running time:

1. Remove unused imports: This program includes a lot of libraries that are not used in the program. These unnecessary imports can be removed to save some memory.

2. Avoid copying in range-based for loops: In the printvec, printtree, and printmap functions, the program copies each element in the container with `for (auto x : v)`. This could be optimized by using references `for (const auto& x : v)`.

3. Avoid multiple calls to `vector::operator[]`: In the main loop, the program calls `t[i][2]` and `t[i][0]` multiple times. You can store these values in variables to avoid multiple calls to `vector::operator[]`, which has a cost.

4. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: When adding elements to the vector `streams`, use `streams.emplace_back(ni)` instead of `streams.push_back(ni)` to construct the element in place and avoid a copy.

5. Reserve memory for vectors: If the size of the vectors `states` and `newstates` is known in advance, you can reserve memory for them with `vector::reserve`, which can improve performance by avoiding reallocations.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

  for (const auto& x : v) {
    cout << x << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
}
#define rep(i, n) for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i)
#define all(s) s.begin(), s.end()

        newstates[b + (1 << sz)] =
