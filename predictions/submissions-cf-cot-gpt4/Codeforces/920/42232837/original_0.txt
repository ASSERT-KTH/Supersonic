This program is designed to solve a mathematical problem. The main optimization steps we can make are to reduce memory usage and improve performance by using better algorithms or data structures. Here are the optimizations step-by-step:

1. Reduce Memory Usage: The program uses an array of booleans `pr` of size `maxn + 100` to mark whether a number is prime or not. This is a sieve algorithm which is efficient but uses a significant amount of memory. To reduce the memory usage, we can use a `bitset` instead of a `bool` array. A `bitset` is an array that compactly stores boolean flags. It uses 1 bit per boolean value instead of 1 byte which is typical for most systems for a `bool` type.

2. Improve Performance: The program is trying to find all prime factors of a number `x`. Instead of dividing `x` by every prime until `sqrt(x)`, we can optimize this by dividing `x` by 2 until it's not divisible anymore and then start from 3 and increment by 2. This will reduce the number of iterations by half.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 1.8e7;
bitset<maxn + 100> pr;
vector<long long> pint, f;

void fac(int x) {
  f.clear();
  while (x % 2 == 0) {
    f.push_back(2);
    x /= 2;
  }
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= x; i += 2) {
    if (x % i == 0) {
      f.push_back(i);
      while (x % i == 0)
        x /= i;
    }
  }
  if (x != 1)
    f.push_back(x);
}

int solve(int val) {
  int ret = 0;
  int lim = 1 << f.size();
  for (int j = 1; j < lim; j++) {
    int tp = 1, ct = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)f.size(); i++) {
      if ((j >> i) & 1) {
        tp *= f[i];
        ct++;
      }
    }
    ret += (ct % 2 ? 1 : -1) * val / tp;
  }
  return val - ret;
}

int cas, x, p, k;
int main() {
  pr.set();
  pr[0] = pr[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i <= maxn; i++)
    if (pr[i])
      for (int j = 2; j * i <= maxn; j++)
        pr[i * j] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i <= maxn; i++)
    if (pr[i])
      pint.push_back(i);
  cin >> cas;
  while (cas--) {
    scanf("%d%d%d", &x, &p, &k);
    fac(p);
    int a1 = solve(x), L = x + 1, R = maxn, ans = 0;
    while (L <= R) {
      int mid = (L + R) / 2;
      int val = solve(mid) - a1;
      if (val >= k)
        R = mid - 1, ans = mid;
      else
        L = mid + 1;
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program will use less memory and perform faster.
