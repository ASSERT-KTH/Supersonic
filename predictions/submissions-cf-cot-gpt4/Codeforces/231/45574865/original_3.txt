This program gets an integer `n` from the user, then it receives `3*n` integers from the user, and for every group of three integers, if at least two of them are `1`, then it increments a counter (`hasil`). At the end, it prints the value of that counter.

The optimization steps would be:

1. As we don't need to keep all the integers in memory, we can remove the `y` variable and directly check the user input in the `if` condition. This would save memory.
2. We can combine the `if (y == 1)` and `if (temp >= 2)` conditions into one to reduce the number of `if` checks, which would save CPU time.
3. We don't need to reset `temp` to `0` at the end of each outer loop iteration, instead, we can declare it inside the outer loop.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, hasil = 0;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int temp = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
      int y;
      cin >> y;
      temp += y == 1;
    }
    hasil += temp >= 2;
  }
  cout << hasil;
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code is more compact and efficient in terms of memory usage and running time. It removes unnecessary variables and reduces the number of `if` condition checks.
