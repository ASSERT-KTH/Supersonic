The provided C++ program reads an integer `n`, and then reads `n` groups of 3 integers. For each group, it checks if there are at least 2 ones and if so, increments a counter.

Optimization steps:

1. Remove unused include statements: The program includes `math.h` and `string.h`, but doesn't use any functions from these libraries, so these can be removed.

2. Minimize the scope of variables: The variable `y` is used only inside the inner loop, so it can be declared inside this loop.

3. Optimize input operations: `cin` is slower than `scanf`, but as we want to make small modifications, we can speed up `cin` by adding `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` at the start of the main function. This makes `cin` and `cout` faster by not synchronizing C++'s standard streams with the C standard streams.

4. Optimize output operations: Instead of printing the result at the end, we can print it right away and return 0. This is a micro-optimization and it's unlikely to have a noticeable impact on performance, but it simplifies the code a bit.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, temp = 0, hasil = 0;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
      int y; 
      cin >> y;
      if (y == 1) {
        temp++;
      }
    }
    if (temp >= 2) {
      hasil++;
    }
    temp = 0;
  }
  cout << hasil;
  return 0;
}
```

Please remember that the optimizations here are quite small and won't make a significant difference in runtime or memory usage for most inputs. This program is already quite efficient. If the input size was significantly larger, we might need to consider other types of optimizations, but for the given task, these small changes are enough.
