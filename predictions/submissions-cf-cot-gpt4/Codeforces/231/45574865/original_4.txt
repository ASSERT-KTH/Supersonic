This program counts how many times at least two '1's have been entered for each of the 'n' iterations.

The optimizations we can apply are:

1. Since temp is only used inside the first loop, it can be declared inside the loop to reduce its scope and improve readability.
2. "temp" is reset to 0 at the end of the outer loop. This can be removed because we're declaring temp inside the outer loop in the first step, which will automatically reset it to 0 at the start of each iteration.
3. We can reduce the number of iterations in the inner loop by breaking it once we know that temp is already 2. This means we've already found 2 '1's and there's no need to continue checking.
4. We can use ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL) to make input and output more efficient. This can significantly improve performance when dealing with large amounts of input/output.
5. The libraries math.h and string.h are included but not used in this program, so they can be removed.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, hasil = 0;
  cin >> n;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int temp = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < 3 && temp < 2; j++) {
      int y;
      cin >> y;
      if (y == 1) {
        temp++;
      }
    }
    if (temp >= 2) {
      hasil++;
    }
  }
  cout << hasil;

  return 0;
}
```
