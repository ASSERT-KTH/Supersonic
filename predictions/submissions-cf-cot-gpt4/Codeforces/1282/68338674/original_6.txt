Step 1: Removing unused headers

Firstly, the program includes many libraries that it does not use. Removing unused headers decreases the compilation time and improves readability.

Step 2: Avoiding macros for simple functions

The program uses macros MAX, MIN, and ABS. Macros should be avoided in C++ because they can lead to various issues such as unintended side effects, lack of type safety, and increased compilation time. In C++, the same functionality can be achieved with inline functions, standard library functions, or simple if/else statements.

Step 3: Removing unused constants

The program defines constants PI, RAND, LINF, and INF which are not used anywhere. Removing them improves readability and slightly reduces memory usage.

Step 4: Avoiding global variables

The program uses global variables N, M, K, Q, A[MAXN], and psum[MAXN]. Global variables should be avoided because they can lead to hard-to-find bugs, especially in large programs. In this program, these variables can be moved inside the main function or passed as parameters to other functions.

Step 5: Using std::vector instead of arrays

In C++, std::vector is generally preferred over arrays because it provides dynamic resizing, range checking, and other useful features. A vector can be used to replace the arrays A and psum.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

#define ll long long
const int MAXN = 2e5 + 5;
const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int func(int pos, int M, int K, const std::vector<int>& A, const std::vector<int>& psum) {
  if (psum[pos] > M)
    return 0;
  int temp = M - psum[pos];
  int cnt = pos;
  for (int i = pos + K; i <= A.size(); i += K) {
    if (A[i] > temp) {
      for (int j = i - K + 1; j <= A.size(); ++j) {
        if (A[j] <= temp) {
          temp -= A[j];
          ++cnt;
        } else
          break;
      }
      break;
    } else {
      temp -= A[i];
      cnt += K;
    }
  }
  return cnt;
}

void solve(int testNum) {
  int N, M, K;
  scanf("%d%d%d", &N, &M, &K);
  std::vector<int> A(N+1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &A[i]);
  }
  sort(A.begin() + 1, A.end());
  std::vector<int> psum(N+1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i)
    psum[i] = psum[i - 1] + A[i];
  if (psum[N] <= M) {
    printf("%d\n", N);
    return;
  }
  int cnt = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i <= N; ++i) {
    cnt = std::max(cnt, func(i, M, K, A, psum));
  }
  printf("%d\n", cnt);
  return;
}

int main() {
  int T;
  scanf("%d", &T);
  for (int t = 1; t <= T; ++t) {
    solve(t);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This program does the same thing as the original one, but it should be faster and less memory-consuming because it avoids global variables, unnecessarily included libraries, and macros. It also uses std::vector instead of arrays for more flexibility and safety.
