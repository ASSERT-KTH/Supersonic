Firstly, let's see what this code does:

The code reads a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the size of an array, a maximum value, and a step size. It then reads in an array of integers and sorts it. 

The function 'func' is used to calculate the maximum number of elements that can be summed without exceeding the maximum value. It does this by firstly checking if the current prefix sum of the array elements exceeds this maximum value. If it doesn't, it iteratively adds elements to the sum, skipping some elements based on the step size.

It then iterates over all starting positions for the sum and keeps track of the maximum number of elements that can be summed.

Here are some potential optimizations:

1. Unnecessary includes: The program includes a number of libraries that are not used in the code. Removing these will decrease the compile time and potentially memory usage.

2. Prefix sum calculation: The prefix sum array is recalculated for every call to 'func'. Instead, we can calculate it once and pass it as a parameter.

3. Maximum elements calculation: The program currently iterates over all starting positions to find the maximum number of elements that can be summed. However, since the array is sorted, we know that if a sum starts at position 'i', then all sums starting at positions less than 'i' will have fewer elements. So we can break the loop as soon as we find a sum that is less than the maximum value.

4. Use of 'scanf' and 'printf': While 'scanf' and 'printf' are generally faster than 'cin' and 'cout', they can be less safe and harder to use. In this case, there is no need for the extra speed, so we can replace them with 'cin' and 'cout' for readability.

Now here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 2e5 + 5;
int N, M, K;
int A[MAXN];
int psum[MAXN];

int func(int pos) {
  if (psum[pos] > M)
    return 0;
  int temp = M - psum[pos];
  int cnt = pos;
  for (int i = pos + K; i <= N; i += K) {
    if (A[i] > temp) {
      for (int j = i - K + 1; j <= N; ++j) {
        if (A[j] <= temp) {
          temp -= A[j];
          ++cnt;
        } else
          break;
      }
      break;
    } else {
      temp -= A[i];
      cnt += K;
    }
  }
  return cnt;
}

void solve(int testNum) {
  cin >> N >> M >> K;
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  sort(A + 1, A + 1 + N);
  psum[0] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i)
    psum[i] = psum[i - 1] + A[i];
  if (psum[N] <= M) {
    cout << N << '\n';
    return;
  }
  int cnt = 0;
  for (int i = N; i >= 0; --i) {
    int new_cnt = func(i);
    if (new_cnt <= cnt)
      break;
    cnt = new_cnt;
  }
  cout << cnt << '\n';
  return;
}

int main() {
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  for (int t = 1; t <= T; ++t) {
    solve(t);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program reduces memory usage by removing unnecessary includes, reduces running time by avoiding unnecessary computations of prefix sums and checking unnecessary starting positions, and improves readability by using 'cin' and 'cout' instead of 'scanf' and 'printf'.
