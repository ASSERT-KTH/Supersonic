The program is already quite optimized, but there are some areas where small changes can be made to slightly improve its performance:

1. Remove unused includes: The program includes a number of libraries that it doesn't actually use. Removing these can speed up the compilation time.

2. Avoid global variables: Global variables can be inefficient, as they require memory to be allocated for the entire lifetime of the program. Instead, we can encapsulate them inside the main function.

3. Use C++ I/O instead of C I/O: The C++ I/O streams (std::cin and std::cout) are generally easier to use and less error-prone than the C-style scanf and printf functions.

4. Use std::array instead of C-style array: std::array is a container that encapsulates fixed size arrays, and is generally safer and easier to use than C-style arrays.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <iostream>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 2e5 + 5;
const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int func(int pos, int M, int K, int N, array<int, MAXN> &A, array<int, MAXN> &psum) {
  if (psum[pos] > M)
    return 0;
  int temp = M - psum[pos];
  int cnt = pos;
  for (int i = pos + K; i <= N; i += K) {
    if (A[i] > temp) {
      for (int j = i - K + 1; j <= N; ++j) {
        if (A[j] <= temp) {
          temp -= A[j];
          ++cnt;
        } else
          break;
      }
      break;
    } else {
      temp -= A[i];
      cnt += K;
    }
  }
  return cnt;
}

void solve(int testNum) {
  int N, M, K;
  cin >> N >> M >> K;
  array<int, MAXN> A;
  array<int, MAXN> psum;
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  sort(A.begin() + 1, A.begin() + 1 + N);
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i)
    psum[i] = psum[i - 1] + A[i];
  if (psum[N] <= M) {
    cout << N << '\n';
    return;
  }
  int cnt = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i <= N; ++i) {
    cnt = max(cnt, func(i, M, K, N, A, psum));
  }
  cout << cnt << '\n';
}

int main() {
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  for (int t = 1; t <= T; ++t) {
    solve(t);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimization steps mentioned above were minor ones and the over-all performance gain from these steps would be negligible in a real-world scenario. The original code was already pretty optimized.
