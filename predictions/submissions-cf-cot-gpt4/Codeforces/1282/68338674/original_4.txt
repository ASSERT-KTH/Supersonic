The given program is trying to solve a problem in a brute force way. Here are the steps to optimize it:

1. Remove Unused Headers: The given program includes a lot of standard C++ libraries. But not all of them are actually used in the code. So, we can remove the unused ones.

2. Inline Functions: The function "func" is called inside a loop in the "solve" function. We can try to inline this function to potentially reduce function call overhead.

3. Avoid Global Variables: The given program uses a lot of global variables like N, M, K, A, psum, etc. Instead of using global variables, we can pass them as function parameters. This could potentially improve the cache performance and make the program easier to read and debug.

4. Replace printf/scanf with cout/cin: In C++, it's generally more efficient to use cout/cin instead of printf/scanf. This is because cout/cin are tied to C++ streams, which can be buffered, and therefore can be faster than printf/scanf.

Now, let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 2e5 + 5;
const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;

inline int func(int pos, int M, int K, int N, int A[], int psum[]) {
  if (psum[pos] > M)
    return 0;
  int temp = M - psum[pos];
  int cnt = pos;
  for (int i = pos + K; i <= N; i += K) {
    if (A[i] > temp) {
      for (int j = i - K + 1; j <= N; ++j) {
        if (A[j] <= temp) {
          temp -= A[j];
          ++cnt;
        } else
          break;
      }
      break;
    } else {
      temp -= A[i];
      cnt += K;
    }
  }
  return cnt;
}

void solve(int testNum) {
  int i, N, M, K, A[MAXN], psum[MAXN];
  cin >> N >> M >> K;
  for (i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  sort(A + 1, A + 1 + N);
  for (i = 1; i <= N; ++i)
    psum[i] = psum[i - 1] + A[i];
  if (psum[N] <= M) {
    cout << N << "\n";
    return;
  }
  int cnt = 0;
  for (i = 0; i <= N; ++i) {
    cnt = max(cnt, func(i, M, K, N, A, psum));
  }
  cout << cnt << "\n";
  return;
}

int main() {
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  for (int t = 1; t <= T; ++t) {
    solve(t);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program should be faster and use less memory than the original one. The main optimization is removing unused headers and global variables, inlining the "func" function, and replacing printf/scanf with cout/cin.
