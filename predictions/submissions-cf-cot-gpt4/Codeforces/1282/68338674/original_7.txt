The existing code is doing multiple unnecessary work that can be optimized:

1. The code unnecessarily includes many headers that are not used anywhere in the code. By removing these, the compilation time will be reduced.

2. The code is sorting the array, which has a time complexity of O(NlogN). However, the sort operation does not seem to be required because we are not performing any operation that needs the array to be sorted.

3. The function `func()` is called N times, and each call to `func()` results in a loop that runs in O(N). This makes the overall time complexity to be O(N^2). We can optimize this to O(N) by keeping track of the maximum count that can be achieved at each position while reading the input and storing these values in an array or vector.

4. There are some macros defined like MAX, MIN and ABS, which are standard library functions and are optimized. It's better to use standard library functions.

5. The code is using `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations. While these functions are faster compared to `cin` and `cout`, they are less safe and more error-prone.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define ll long long
#define LINF 0x3f3f3f3f3f3f3f3f
#define INF 0x3f3f3f3f
#define PI 3.14159265
#define RAND (rand() * rand())
#define CEIL(x, y) (((x) + (y)-1) / (y))
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 2e5 + 5;
const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;
int N, M, K, Q;
int A[MAXN];
int psum[MAXN];
int maxCount[MAXN];
void solve(int testNum) {
  cin >> N >> M >> K;
  psum[0] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    cin >> A[i];
    psum[i] = psum[i - 1] + A[i];
    if (psum[i] > M)
      maxCount[i] = 0;
    else
      maxCount[i] = i;
    if (i > K)
      maxCount[i] = max(maxCount[i], maxCount[i - K]);
  }
  cout << maxCount[N] << "\n";
}
int main() {
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  for (int t = 1; t <= T; ++t) {
    solve(t);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that whether these optimizations will actually improve runtime and memory usage will depend on the specific input data.
