The code uses a lot of preprocessor directives and templates which might make it hard to read and maintain. However, there's not much room for significant optimization in terms of time and space complexity because the overall complexity is already good. 

Here are some minor optimizations and improvements:

1. The 'bits/stdc++.h' header includes a lot of unnecessary headers which can slow down the compile time. It's better to include only the necessary headers.
2. The 'using namespace std' is a bad practice because it can cause naming conflicts.
3. The 'freopen' function is used to redirect the input and output from the console to a file. If it's not necessary, we can remove this.
4. The 'vt', 'us', 'fi', 'se' and other macros are unnecessary and make the code harder to read. It's better to use 'vector', 'unsigned', 'first', 'second' directly.
5. The 'db_problem' macro is not used at all. We can remove this.
6. The 'exit(0)' at the end of the main function is not necessary because the program will exit anyways when it reaches the end of the main function.
7. The 'fastio' macro is unnecessary because cin and cout are already fast enough for most cases.
8. The 'all' macro is unnecessary and makes the code harder to read. It's better to use 'a.begin(), a.end()' directly.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>
#include <utility>

#define ll long long
#define pii pair<int, int>
const ll MaxN = 1e5 + 5;
const ll INF = 1e9;
const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;

using namespace std;

void solve() {
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  int n, k;
  n = s.size(), k = 2;
  vector<pii> a(n, pii(0, 0));
  for (int i = 0; i < n; a[i].second = i, a[i].first = s[i], ++i)
    ;
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  vector<int> res(n, 0);
  vector<vector<int>> g(k + 1, vector<int>());
  for (int i = 0, p = 0; i < n; ++i, ++p) {
    int pos = p % k + 1;
    if (g[pos].size() == 0)
      g[pos].push_back(a[i].second);
    else if (a[i - k].first != a[i].first)
      g[pos].push_back(a[i].second);
    else
      --p;
  }
  int mn = int(g[k].size());
  for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < mn; ++j)
      res[g[i][j]] = i;
  }
  int ans = 0;
  for (auto x : res)
    ans += (x != 0);
  cout << ans / 2 << '\n';
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these are only minor optimizations and improvements. The most important part in optimizing a program is choosing the right data structures and algorithms, which seems to be fine in this case.
