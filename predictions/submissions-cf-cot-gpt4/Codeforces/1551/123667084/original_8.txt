The given program seems to be already optimized in terms of time complexity. However, there are certain things that can be modified slightly to optimize the code further.

1. Avoid using `#define`: It is generally not recommended to use `#define` due to its nature of text substitution which can lead to problems. Instead, we can use inline functions or constants wherever required.

2. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of libraries which may not be used in the program. This can increase the compilation time. Include only the libraries necessary for your program.

3. Reduce the use of templates: Though templates provide a lot of flexibility, they lead to an increase in code size and hence memory usage. Try to reduce their usage wherever possible.

4. Use pre-increment `++i` instead of post-increment `i++` in loops: In C++, pre-increment is faster than post-increment because post-increment involves a copy operation.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

const int MaxN = 1e5 + 5;
const int INF = 1e9;
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const double eps = 1e-5;
const double pi = acos(-1);

void solve() {
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  int n = s.size(), k = 2;
  vector<pair<int, int>> a(n, pair<int, int>(0, 0));
  for (int i = 0; i < n; a[i].second = i, a[i].first = s[i], ++i);
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  vector<int> res(n, 0);
  vector<vector<int>> g(k + 1, vector<int>());
  for (int i = 0, p = 0; i < n; ++i, ++p) {
    int pos = p % k + 1;
    if (g[pos].size() == 0)
      g[pos].push_back(a[i].second);
    else if (a[i - k].first != a[i].first)
      g[pos].push_back(a[i].second);
    else
      --p;
  }
  int mn = int(g[k].size());
  for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < mn; ++j)
      res[g[i][j]] = i;
  }
  int ans = 0;
  for (auto x : res)
    ans += (x != 0);
  cout << ans / 2 << '\n';
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  exit(0);
}
```

In the optimized code, we have removed all the `#define` directives and replaced them with their equivalent code in the program. We have also removed the templates to reduce memory usage. We replaced `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with specific includes. We also replaced post-increment `i++` with pre-increment `++i` in loops.
