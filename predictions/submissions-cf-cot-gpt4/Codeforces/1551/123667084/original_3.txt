The given program is already optimized in most parts. However, there are a few minor improvements that can be made:

1. Remove unnecessary macros: The `init()` and `db_problem()` macros are not used in the code. They can be removed.

2. Directly use the standard library objects: Instead of redefining the existing C++ standard library objects like `vt`, `ll`, `us`, `pb`, `fi`, `se`, `pii`, `db`, it would be better to use the original ones i.e, `std::vector`, `long long`, `unsigned`, `push_back`, `first`, `second`, `pair<int, int>`, `double` respectively. This should make the code more readable and maintainable.

3. Avoid global constants: The constants `MaxN`, `INF`, `MOD`, `eps`, `pi` are global but not used in the code. They can be removed.

4. Avoid unnecessary template functions: The template functions for istream and ostream operators are not used in the code. They can be removed.

5. Pass vector by reference in ostream operator: In the ostream operator for the vector, the vector is passed by value. This results in creating a copy of the vector. You can pass the vector by reference instead to avoid this copy.

6. Avoid using `exit(0)`: The `exit(0)` function is used to terminate the program. However, it is not required in this case because the program will automatically terminate after the `main()` function.

7. Use `++i` instead of `i++`: In the for loop, `++i` can be used instead of `i++`. This is because `i++` involves an extra step of creating a temporary variable to hold the old value of `i`.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define fastio()                                                               \
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);                                                \
  cin.tie(0);                                                                  \
  cout.tie(0)
#define all(a) a.begin(), a.end()

void solve() {
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  int n = s.size(), k = 2;
  vector<pair<int, int>> a(n, pair<int, int>(0, 0));
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    a[i].second = i;
    a[i].first = s[i];
  }
  sort(all(a));
  vector<int> res(n, 0);
  vector<vector<int>> g(k + 1, vector<int>());
  for (int i = 0, p = 0; i < n; ++i, ++p) {
    int pos = p % k + 1;
    if (g[pos].size() == 0)
      g[pos].push_back(a[i].second);
    else if (a[i - k].first != a[i].first)
      g[pos].push_back(a[i].second);
    else
      --p;
  }
  int mn = int(g[k].size());
  for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < mn; ++j)
      res[g[i][j]] = i;
  }
  int ans = 0;
  for (auto x : res)
    ans += (x != 0);
  cout << ans / 2 << '\n';
}

int main() {
  fastio();
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```
Overall, the optimizations made here involve reducing unnecessary code and making the existing code more readable and efficient. The functionality of the program remains the same.
