The given C++ program seems to have a pretty decent structure but there are several things that we can do to optimize it.

1. Firstly, including "bits/stdc++.h" is not recommended. This header file includes almost all standard library header files and hence, increases compilation time. We should only include the libraries that we need.

2. The use of #define for functions like init(), fastio() is not recommended. Macros are not type-safe and can lead to problems.

3. The program uses std::vector a lot. We can save memory by using std::vector::reserve() to reserve enough memory in advance. This would save overhead from vector resizing.

4. The use of std::endl should be avoided as it flushes the output buffer each time, which can be a costly operation. We should use '\n' instead.

5. In the solve() function, the variable 's' is not being modified. We can pass it as a const reference to save memory.

6. The program uses an exit(0) at the end of main(). This is not necessary because returning from main() function will automatically exit the program.

Let's implement these suggestions in the code.

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <string>

using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef vector<pii> vpii;
typedef vector<int> vi;

const ll MaxN = 1e5 + 5;
const ll INF = 1e9;
const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const double eps = 1e-5;
const double pi = acos(-1);

void solve(const string& s) {
  int n = s.size(), k = 2;
  vpii a(n, pii(0, 0));
  for (int i = 0; i < n; a[i].second = i, a[i].first = s[i], ++i);
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());

  vi res(n, 0);
  vector<vi> g(k + 1, vi());
  for (int i = 0, p = 0; i < n; ++i, ++p) {
    int pos = p % k + 1;
    if (g[pos].empty())
      g[pos].push_back(a[i].second);
    else if (a[i - k].first != a[i].first)
      g[pos].push_back(a[i].second);
    else
      --p;
  }

  int mn = int(g[k].size());
  for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i)
    for (int j = 0; j < mn; ++j)
      res[g[i][j]] = i;

  int ans = 0;
  for (auto x : res)
    ans += (x != 0);
  cout << ans / 2 << '\n';
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    solve(s);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
