Optimization Strategy:

1. Skip unnecessary memset: Here, the memset function is used to set the value of the entire arr and ans arrays to 0 for each test case. However, the given code already sets values to these arrays during its operation. Therefore, the memset operation can be skipped, which would save time.

2. Use reserve for vector: The reserve function in vector is used to preallocate enough memory for the vector. This can prevent multiple reallocations during the push_back operation, which could save time.

3. Minimize Modulo Operation: Modulo operation is expensive in terms of CPU time. The color variable is incremented and then the modulo operation is applied. This can be optimized by checking if the color is equal or greater than k, then reset color to 0.

4. Use pre increment: Pre increment operator is faster than the post increment operator in C++. This is because the post increment involves keeping a copy of the previous value that is incremented, which is slower.

5. Directly print the output: Instead of storing the output in ans array and then printing it, we can directly print the output as we get it. This will save memory.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 2e5 + 50;
int arr[maxn];

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> m1;
    int n, k;
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &k);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", arr + i);
      m1[arr[i]].push_back(i);
    }
    int cnt = 0;
    int color = 1;
    for (auto &x : m1) {
      x.second.reserve(x.second.size());
      if (x.second.size() >= k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
          printf("%d ", color);
          if (color >= k) color = 1; else ++color;
        }
        for (int i = k; i < x.second.size(); i++) printf("0 ");
      } else {
        cnt += x.second.size();
      }
    }
    cnt -= cnt % k;
    for (auto &s : m1) {
      for (auto &x : s.second) {
        if (cnt <= 0)
          goto _out;
        printf("%d ", color);
        if (color >= k) color = 1; else ++color;
        if (--cnt <= 0)
          goto _out;
      }
    }
  _out:
    printf("\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: In the optimized program, we are using the phrase 'auto &' in the range-based for loop to avoid unnecessary copying of elements. It increases the efficiency of the program by using references rather than creating copies.
