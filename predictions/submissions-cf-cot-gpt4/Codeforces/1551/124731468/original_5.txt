The program can be optimized for running time by reducing the unnecessary work done inside the loops. 

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the `memset` functions at the start of each test case. These are not needed because each element in `arr` and `ans` is assigned a value before it is used.

2. The second loop through `m1` is not needed. The work done in this loop can be moved into the first loop through `m1`. This reduces the total number of iterations through `m1` from 2 to 1.

3. The `goto` statement can be replaced with a simple `break` statement. `goto` statements can make code difficult to read and understand.

4. The two loops at the end of the program can be combined into one loop. This reduces the total number of iterations through `ans` from 2 to 1.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 2e5 + 50;
int arr[maxn];
int ans[maxn];

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> m1;
    int n, k;
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &k);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", arr + i);
      m1[arr[i]].push_back(i);
    }
    int cnt = 0;
    int color = 0;
    bool break_loop = false;
    for (auto x : m1) {
      if (x.second.size() >= k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < x.second.size(); i++) {
          if (i >= k) {
            ans[x.second[i]] = 0;
          } else {
            ans[x.second[i]] = ++color;
            color %= k;
          }
        }
      } else {
        cnt += x.second.size();
        cnt -= cnt % k;
        for (auto s : x.second) {
          if (cnt <= 0) {
            break_loop = true;
            break;
          }
          ans[s] = ++color;
          color %= k;
          --cnt;
        }
      }
      if (break_loop) break;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      printf("%d ", ans[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces the number of iterations through `m1` and `ans` which reduces the running time of the program. It also removes the use of `memset` at the start of each test case, which reduces the memory usage of the program.
