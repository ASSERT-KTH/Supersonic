This program is already well-optimized in most places, however, there are a few areas where we can make some small tweaks for better performance:

1. **Use of 'scanf' over 'cin':** 'std::cin' and 'std::cout' are slower in comparison to 'scanf' and 'printf'. It's a small optimization, but it can help if your program is dealing with a lot of I/O.

2. **Avoiding unnecessary 'max' operation:** In the program, there is a line 'A[i] = max(A[i], A[i - 1]);' where 'A[i]' is being calculated twice. We can avoid this by calculating it once and storing it in a variable.

3. **Use of 'ios::sync_with_stdio':** By default, the C++ I/O streams are synchronized with the C-style I/O functions. This means that you can freely mix C-style I/O (like 'printf' and 'scanf') with C++ style I/O ('cin' and 'cout'). However, this synchronization causes some overhead. If you're sure that you won't be mixing styles, you can turn this synchronization off using 'ios::sync_with_stdio(false)'.

4. **Use of 'endl' over '\n':** 'endl' causes a flush operation, which can be slower than simply outputting '\n'. Unless you specifically need to flush the output, using '\n' can speed up your code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<ll> vl;
#define all(a) a.begin(), a.end()
#define open_file freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
#define write_file freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#define mem(A, v) memset(A, v, sizeof(A));
#define show(x) cout << x << '\n'
#define forn(i, n) for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define lower(sl) transform(sl.begin(), sl.end(), sl.begin(), ::tolower);
#define upper(su) transform(su.begin(), su.end(), su.begin(), ::toupper);
ll lcm(ll a, ll b) { return a * b / __gcd(a, b); }
int const MAX = (1 << 19);
int A[MAX];
int dp[MAX][19];
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n, m, i;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  forn(i, MAX) A[i] = i;
  forn(i, n) {
    int x, y;
    scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
    A[x] = max(A[x], y);
  }
  dp[0][0] = A[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < (1 << 19); i++) {
    int tmp = max(A[i], A[i - 1]);
    dp[i][0] = A[i] = tmp;
  }
  for (int j = 1; j < 19; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
      dp[i][j] = dp[dp[i][j - 1]][j - 1];
    }
  }
  while (m--) {
    int l, r, nb = 0, x;
    scanf("%d %d", &l, &r);
    for (int j = 18; j >= 0; j--) {
      if (dp[l][j] < r) {
        nb += 1 << j;
        l = dp[l][j];
      }
    }
    if (dp[l][0] >= r)
      nb++;
    else
      nb = -1;
    printf("%d\n", nb);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these are micro-optimizations and may not have a noticeable effect on performance in many cases. However, in programs that deal with a lot of I/O or have tight performance requirements, these kinds of optimizations can make a difference.
