The optimizations that can be made to the provided C/C++ code are:

1. Avoid unnecessary operations: In the original code, the line `A[i] = i;` is not needed because the array A[] is updated with the maximum of current and previous values in the next loop.

2. Use cin/cout consistently: The code uses both cin/cout and scanf/printf for input/output. It's best to stick with one or the other. As cin/cout are more C++-like, we will use these.

3. Limit scope of loop variable: The loop variable 'i' is defined at the beginning of main(), but it's not used outside of the loops. We can declare it within the scope of each loop to improve readability.

4. Remove unused macros: Macros like all(), open_file, write_file, mem(), show(), lower(), upper() are not used in the code. We can remove these to clean up the code.

5. Avoid using bits/stdc++.h: Using this header includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which can increase compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary headers.

Here is the optimized version of the code after applying these modifications:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
ll lcm(ll a, ll b) { return a * b / __gcd(a, b); }
const int MAX = (1 << 19);
int A[MAX];
int dp[MAX][19];

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    A[x] = max(A[x], y);
  }
  dp[0][0] = A[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < MAX; i++) {
    dp[i][0] = A[i] = max(A[i], A[i - 1]);
  }
  for (int j = 1; j < 19; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
      dp[i][j] = dp[dp[i][j - 1]][j - 1];
    }
  }
  while (m--) {
    int l, r, nb = 0;
    cin >> l >> r;
    for (int j = 18; j >= 0; j--) {
      if (dp[l][j] < r) {
        nb += 1 << j;
        l = dp[l][j];
      }
    }
    if (dp[l][0] >= r)
      nb++;
    else
      nb = -1;
    cout << nb << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimizations here are mostly related to code style and readability. The algorithmic complexity of the code has not been changed. If runtime performance is an issue, the algorithm itself might need to be optimized.
