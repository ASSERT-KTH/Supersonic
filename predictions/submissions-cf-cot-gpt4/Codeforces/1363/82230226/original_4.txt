Here are some steps to optimize the given program:

1. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(NULL); std::cout.tie(NULL);` only when necessary. It is used for faster I/O but it can cause unwanted behavior when mixing cin/cout with printf/scanf or reading/inputting data before writing/outputting data.

2. The `max` and `min` macros are unnecessary. The C++ standard library already includes functions for these operations, which are safer and more flexible than macros.

3. The `init()` function is called at the beginning of every test case, clearing all adjacent lists. This function is unnecessary because we can declare the vector array inside the while loop, which automatically creates a new array for each test case.

4. `#define` for `ll` and `ull` can be replaced with `using ll = long long; using ull = unsigned long long;` for better practice and readability.

5. `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` block of code used for reading from a file and writing to a file can be removed if it's not required.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;
using ull = unsigned long long;

int main() {
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll n, x;
    cin >> n >> x;

    vector<vector<ll>> adj(n+1); // moved inside loop to avoid need for init() function

    for (ll i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      ll a, b;
      cin >> a >> b;
      adj[a].push_back(b);
      adj[b].push_back(a);
    }

    if (n == 1 || adj[x].size() == 1 || n % 2 == 0) {
      cout << "Ayush\n";
    } else {
      cout << "Ashish\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This code has the same functionality as the original, but it is more efficient because it avoids unnecessary operations and uses better practices.
