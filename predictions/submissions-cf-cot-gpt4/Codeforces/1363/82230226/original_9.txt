Here are some optimization steps:

1. The "fast" macro which is currently spread across multiple lines can be made into a single line for readability.

2. The use of `#define` for min and max functions can be avoided as C++ STL already provides these functions.

3. The `init` function is clearing the adjacency list for each test case. This can be avoided by declaring the adjacency list inside the while loop, so it gets automatically cleared for each test case.

4. `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` block can be removed if you are not using an online judge. This is used usually to redirect input and output from files when running code in a local environment.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int
#define ull unsigned long long int
#define fast ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);

int main() {
  fast
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    vector<ll> adj[100005];
    ll n, x;
    cin >> n >> x;
    ll i, j, a, b;
    for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      cin >> a >> b;
      adj[a].push_back(b);
      adj[b].push_back(a);
    }
    if (n == 1 || adj[x].size() == 1 || n % 2 == 0) {
      cout << "Ayush\n";
    } else {
      cout << "Ashish\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces the number of operations performed by omitting the clearing of the adjacency list for each test case and simplifying the "fast" macro. Furthermore, it reduces memory usage as it avoids unnecessary declarations.
