The following steps can be taken to optimize the given C/C++ program:

1. Instead of using `#define` for `max()`, `min()`, and `fast`, use inbuilt functions and turn off synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their C counterparts once at the beginning of the execution of the program. This will improve the running time of the program.

2. Remove `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE`. This macro is not needed unless you are judging the program online.

3. Instead of initializing the adjacency list vector at every test case start, we can just clear it after the use in each test case. This will reduce the unnecessary overhead of re-initializing the vector at each test case start.

4. Also, you can make the adjacency list vector local to the main function, because it's not being used elsewhere. This will make the program more readable and maintainable.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int ll;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  ll t;
  cin >> t;

  vector<ll> adj[100005];

  while (t--) {
    ll n, x;
    cin >> n >> x;
    ll i, j, a, b;

    for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      cin >> a >> b;
      adj[a].push_back(b);
      adj[b].push_back(a);
    }

    if (n == 1 || adj[x].size() == 1 || n % 2 == 0) {
      cout << "Ayush\n";
    } else {
      cout << "Ashish\n";
    }

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      adj[i].clear();
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
