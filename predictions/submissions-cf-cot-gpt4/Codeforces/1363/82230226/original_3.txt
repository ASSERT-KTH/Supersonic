Sure, here are the steps I'm taking to optimize the code:

1. You're using the #define directive to define min and max functions, but these functions already exist in the standard C++ library, so these definitions are unnecessary. Removing these will reduce the complexity of the code.

2. Using 'using namespace std;' is considered bad practice because it could lead to conflicts with names in the std namespace. To avoid this, we will remove 'using namespace std;' and prefix std:: to the standard library functions.

3. Your 'init' function is inefficient because it clears the adjacency list every time it is called. If the adjacency list is not used after it's filled, we could just declare it inside the loop. This would save us from having to clear it every time.

4. The #define for 'fast' is unnecessary because modern C++ compilers will automatically optimize for these settings. Removing it will make the code cleaner and easier to read. 

5. It's better to use 'constexpr' instead of '#define' for defining constants because 'constexpr' is type safe.

6. You're using a global array (adj) of vectors, it's not a good practice to use global variables. We can declare it inside main function.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

constexpr long long int MAX_SIZE = 100005;

int main() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);
  
  long long int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    std::vector<long long int> adj[MAX_SIZE];
    long long int n, x;
    std::cin >> n >> x;
    long long int i, j, a, b;
    for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      std::cin >> a >> b;
      adj[a].push_back(b);
      adj[b].push_back(a);
    }
    if (n == 1 || adj[x].size() == 1 || n % 2 == 0) {
      std::cout << "Ayush\n";
    } else {
      std::cout << "Ashish\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
