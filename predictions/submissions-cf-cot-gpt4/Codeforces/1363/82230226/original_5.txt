Step-by-step optimization:

1. Instead of using #define for min and max, use the standard library functions std::min and std::max. The macros do not perform any type checking and they evaluate each argument twice, which could lead to unexpected behavior. The standard library functions are safer and possibly more efficient.

2. Instead of clearing each element of the adj vector individually, you can simply create a new vector when you need to clear the old one. This will save time because you won't need to loop through the entire vector. This can be done by moving the vector inside the main function and recreating it for each test case.

3. Instead of using cin and cout for input and output, use scanf and printf. These functions are faster because they do not synchronize with the C++ standard streams.

4. Do not use 'fast' macro. It is a common myth that this macro significantly speeds up I/O operations. In reality, the difference is negligible and it can cause problems with interactive problems and when mixing cin/cout and scanf/printf.

5. Do not use 'bits/stdc++.h' as it includes more files than necessary, slowing down the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary headers.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
    freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
    freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
    int t;
    scanf("%d", &t);
    while (t--) {
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> adj(100005);
        int n, x;
        scanf("%d%d", &n, &x);
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            int a, b;
            scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
            adj[a].push_back(b);
            adj[b].push_back(a);
        }
        if (n == 1 || adj[x].size() == 1 || n % 2 == 0) {
            printf("Ayush\n");
        } else {
            printf("Ashish\n");
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
