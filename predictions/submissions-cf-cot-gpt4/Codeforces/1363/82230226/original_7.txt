Optimization Steps:

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is quite large and includes nearly all the standard library. Including this slows down the compile time a lot. It's better to include only those libraries which are actually being used in the program.

2. `#define max(a, b) (a > b) ? a : b` and `#define min(a, b) (a < b) ? a : b`: These macros are not used anywhere in the code, so we can remove them.

3. `fast` macro: This macro is good for competitive programming, but generally, it's better to explicitly write these statements in the main function for better readability.

4. `init()` function: This function is clearing all the vectors in each test case. Instead of that, we can just declare the vectors inside the test case loop. In this way, we don't need to clear them in each test case, they will automatically get destroyed after the test case ends which will save memory.

5. Variables `j`, `a`, `b` are not used anywhere, so we can remove those.

6. Instead of using two `freopen()` functions, we can use `ifstream` and `ofstream` for file handling.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int ll;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  ifstream cin("input.txt");
  ofstream cout("output.txt");
  
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    vector<ll> adj[100005];
    ll n, x;
    cin >> n >> x;

    for (ll i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      ll a, b;
      cin >> a >> b;
      adj[a].push_back(b);
      adj[b].push_back(a);
    }

    if (n == 1 || adj[x].size() == 1 || n % 2 == 0) {
      cout << "Ayush\n";
    } else {
      cout << "Ashish\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
