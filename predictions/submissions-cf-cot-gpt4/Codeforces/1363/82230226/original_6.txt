Here are the steps to optimize the given C/C++ program:

1. Remove the `#define` for `min` and `max` functions as they are already present in the standard library.
2. Instead of using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes almost all the standard libraries, include only the required libraries. This can help to reduce the compilation time.
3. `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);` are used to speed up the I/O operations. But in this program, there is no need of these lines because there is no alternating between `cin` and `cout`.
4. The `init()` function is called for each test case to clear the vector. Instead of doing this, declare the `adj` vector inside the while loop, so it will be automatically cleared for each test case.
5. The condition `n == 1 || adj[x].size() == 1 || n % 2 == 0` does not need the `adj[x].size() == 1` check, as it will always be true if `n == 1`.
6. Also, the condition `n == 1 || n % 2 == 0` is equivalent to `n % 2 == 0`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int ll;

int main() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    vector<vector<ll>> adj(100005);
    ll n, x;
    cin >> n >> x;
    ll i, a, b;
    for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      cin >> a >> b;
      adj[a].push_back(b);
      adj[b].push_back(a);
    }
    if (n % 2 == 0) {
      cout << "Ayush\n";
    } else {
      cout << "Ashish\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This code is optimized for both running time and memory usage.
