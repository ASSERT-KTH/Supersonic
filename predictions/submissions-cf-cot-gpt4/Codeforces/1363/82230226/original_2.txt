Optimization Steps:

1. "bits/stdc++.h" header file is a GCC specific library that includes most of the standard libraries. It is heavy and slows down the compilation time. Instead, include only necessary libraries.

2. Using #define for min and max functions is not a good practice. C++ already provides in-built std::min and std::max functions.

3. The 'fast' macro is used to speed up cin and cout operations, but it is not needed since the program doesn't require any fast IO operations.

4. The 'init' function is used to clear the adjacency list for each test case. However, it is not necessary if we declare the adjacency list within the scope of a single test case.

5. The #ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE preprocessor directive is used to redirect inputs from a file to stdin and stdout to a file. This is not needed in the optimized version.

6. Using long long int for all variables is unnecessary and could consume more memory. Use int instead if the value is within the range of an integer.

7. The if clause at the end can be simplified to a single line using a ternary operator.

Optimized Program:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, x;
    std::cin >> n >> x;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> adj(n + 1);
    int a, b;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      std::cin >> a >> b;
      adj[a].push_back(b);
      adj[b].push_back(a);
    }
    std::cout << ((n == 1 || adj[x].size() == 1 || n % 2 == 0) ? "Ayush\n" : "Ashish\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
