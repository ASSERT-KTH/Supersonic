The program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. **Avoid unnecessary clearing of the adjacency list**: The `init()` function is called to clear the adjacency list for every test case. This is unnecessary as the elements from the previous test case are overwritten in the current test case. So, we can remove the `init()` function and its invocation to save computation time.

2. **Avoid using `push_back` to add elements to the adjacency list**: The `push_back` function allocates additional memory every time it is called, which is inefficient. Instead, we can preallocate memory for the adjacency list based on the number of nodes `n`, which will reduce the number of memory allocations and deallocations, and thus increase the speed of the program.

3. **Avoid using macros for `min` and `max` functions**: The standard library functions `std::min` and `std::max` should be used instead of macros, as they are type-safe and their behavior is well-defined.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int
#define ull unsigned long long int
#define fast ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);

int main() {
  fast
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll n, x;
    cin >> n >> x;
    vector<list<ll>> adj(n+1);
    ll i, a, b;
    for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      cin >> a >> b;
      adj[a].push_front(b);
      adj[b].push_front(a);
    }
    if (n == 1 || adj[x].size() == 1 || n % 2 == 0) {
      cout << "Ayush\n";
    } else {
      cout << "Ashish\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program uses `std::list` instead of `std::vector` for the adjacency list, as `std::list::push_front` is more efficient than `std::vector::push_back`. Also, the adjacency list is created inside the loop for each test case, so there's no need to clear it explicitly.
