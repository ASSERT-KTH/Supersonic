Your program is quite optimized, but there are a few changes that can be made to make it even more optimized.

First, the usage of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is generally considered bad practice, because it includes more files than necessary, which can slow down the compilation time. Instead, include only the libraries that you need.

Second, you are calculating the `min(a1, b1)` and `min(a2, b2)` twice, which is unnecessary. You can calculate it once and store the result in a variable to speed up the program.

Finally, using `'\n'` instead of `endl` to print a new line can be faster, because `endl` causes the output buffer to flush, while `'\n'` does not.

Let's apply these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int a1, b1, a2, b2;
    cin >> a1 >> b1 >> a2 >> b2;
    int max1 = max(a1, b1), max2 = max(a2, b2);
    int min1 = min(a1, b1), min2 = min(a2, b2);

    if (max1 == max2 && min1 + min2 == max1)
      cout << "YES" << '\n';
    else
      cout << "NO" << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program should run faster and use less memory than the original.
