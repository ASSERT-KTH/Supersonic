Here are a few steps to optimize the given C++ Program:

1. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h` as it includes too many headers which are often not used in the program. This increases the compilation time.
2. Rather than using `endl` to create a new line, we can use `"\n"`. `endl` flushes the output buffer in addition to providing a newline, which is generally unnecessary and can slow down the output.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int a1, b1, a2, b2;
    cin >> a1 >> b1 >> a2 >> b2;
    int max1 = max(a1, b1), max2 = max(a2, b2);
    if (max1 == max2 && min(a1, b1) + min(a2, b2) == max1)
      cout << "YES\n";
    else
      cout << "NO\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version:

1. I've replaced `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with `#include <iostream>` and `#include <algorithm>`. This will decrease the compilation time.
2. I've used `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to untie C and C++ standard streams, which can speed up the input/output operations.
3. I've replaced `endl` with `"\n"`, which can speed up the output.
