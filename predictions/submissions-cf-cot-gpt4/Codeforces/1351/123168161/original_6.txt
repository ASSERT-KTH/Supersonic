Steps to optimize the above program:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is quite large and including it may increase your compile time significantly. Instead, include only the libraries that you are using in your program.

2. Reduce the usage of `std::endl`: `std::endl` not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output buffer, which can be a slow operation. Use '\n' character instead.

3. Reduce the number of calls to `min` and `max` functions: You're calling `min` and `max` twice with the same parameters. This isn't necessary. You should store their return values in variables and then use those variables.

Here is the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int a1, b1, a2, b2;
    cin >> a1 >> b1 >> a2 >> b2;
    
    int min1 = min(a1, b1);
    int min2 = min(a2, b2);
    int max1 = max(a1, b1);
    int max2 = max(a2, b2);
    
    if (max1 == max2 && min1 + min2 == max1)
      cout << "YES" << '\n';
    else
      cout << "NO" << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version of the program should run faster and use less memory than the original one.
