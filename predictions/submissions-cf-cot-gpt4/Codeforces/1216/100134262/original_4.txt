Step 1: 
Remove unnecessary `#include` statements. Only keep the ones that are used in the program. In this case, we only need `<iostream>`, `<string>`, `<map>`, `<vector>` and `<algorithm>`. This will save a little on compile time and keep the code cleaner.

Step 2:
Remove unnecessary `#pragma` statements. Some of them are specific to certain compilers and may not have any effect, or even slow down the program on other compilers.

Step 3:
Remove unused variables and functions. In this case, `fac` is declared but never used. Similarly, functions `ncr` and `inverse` are declared but never used. Removing them will save memory and make the code easier to understand.

Step 4:
Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL);` only if you need to mix `cin/cout` and `printf/scanf` in your code. In this case, there is no `scanf/printf` usage, so we can remove them.

Step 5:
Avoid using `using namespace std;`. This can lead to name conflicts, where the compiler does not know which version of a function to use. Also, it increases the scope in which names are visible, which can lead to bugs.

Step 6:
Avoid defining macros unless they are really needed. In this case, `in`, `pb`, `mp`, `int`, `fi`, `double`, `se` and `endl` can be replaced with their actual expressions. This makes the code easier to understand and avoids potential conflicts.

Step 7:
Use `constexpr` for constants that are known at compile time. This allows the compiler to optimize the code better.

Step 8:
Optimize the `sieve` function. In the current implementation, the loop goes up to `MAXN` for every `i`. However, it can stop at `sqrt(MAXN)` since any composite number will have a factor less than or equal to its square root.

Step 9:
Optimize the `getfactor` function. We can avoid the map and simply return a vector of factors.

Now, let's see the optimized code.
