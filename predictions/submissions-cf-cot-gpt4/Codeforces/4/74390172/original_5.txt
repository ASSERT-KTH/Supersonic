This code is fairly optimized, but there are a few small changes that could be made to improve it further. Here are the changes I would suggest:

1. Remove the unused constants, typedefs, and function templates. They only increase the compilation time and the size of the executable file. Also, they make the code less readable. In particular, the `bigMod` and `invMod` function templates, and the `POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, `MOD`, `PI`, and `N` constants are not used anywhere in the code.

2. The `FASTER` macro that sets up the standard input/output is only used once, so it can be replaced with direct calls to the functions. This will make the code more readable and slightly smaller.

3. The `unordered_map` is used to keep track of the number of occurrences of each string. Since the map is not used after the loop, it can be cleared just before the program ends to free up memory a bit earlier.

4. The `reserve` and `max_load_factor` functions are used to avoid unnecessary rehashing of the map. However, the chosen values might not be optimal for all inputs. It would be better to set the initial size of the map based on the input size `n` and adjust the load factor accordingly.

5. Instead of checking if a key is in the map and then accessing it, the `operator[]` function can be used directly. This function returns a reference to the value that is associated with a particular key. If the key does not exist, it is inserted into the map with a default-initialized value (which is 0 for integers).

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::unordered_map<std::string, int> mp;
  mp.reserve(n);
  mp.max_load_factor(0.25);
  
  while (n--) {
    std::string ar;
    std::cin >> ar;
    if (mp[ar] == 0) {
      std::cout << "OK\n";
    } else {
      std::cout << ar << mp[ar] << "\n";
    }
    mp[ar]++;
  }
  
  mp.clear();
  
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the effect of these optimizations might not be noticeable for small inputs. For large inputs and complex programs, however, they could significantly improve the performance and/or reduce the memory usage.
