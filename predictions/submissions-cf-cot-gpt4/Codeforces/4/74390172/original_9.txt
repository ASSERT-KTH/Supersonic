The given program is already well-optimized. However, the following changes could be made to slightly improve its efficiency:

1. The standard library header <bits/stdc++.h> is very heavy as it includes every standard library. This might slow down the compilation process. We will replace this with targeted includes.
2. Instead of checking if the element exists in the map and then incrementing its value, we could increment the value directly and check if the value is 1. If it is, print "OK". Otherwise, print the string and the value minus one.
3. We are using a "FASTER" macro to speed up I/O operations, but it makes the code harder to understand. It would be better to put this into the main function for clarity. Also, this macro is tied to cin/cout operations and generally, this type of optimization is not recommended unless the program is heavily I/O bound.
4. We have unused constants and template functions. We should remove those to clean up the code and reduce its memory footprint.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  unordered_map<string, int> mp;
  mp.reserve(1 << 18);
  mp.max_load_factor(0.25);
  
  while (n--) {
    string ar;
    cin >> ar;
    mp[ar]++;
    if(mp[ar] == 1) {
      cout << "OK\n";
    } else {
      cout << ar << mp[ar]-1 << "\n";
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program should perform the same function but with a slight improvement in efficiency.
