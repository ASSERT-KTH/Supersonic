This C++ program is already quite optimized. However, there are a few points that can be improved. 

Optimization Steps:

1. The template functions `bigMod` and `invMod` aren't utilized anywhere in the program. So, we can remove them. This will save the compilation time and memory.

2. The constants `POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, `PI` are also not used in the program. Therefore, we can remove them as well.

3. The macro `FASTER` is used to speed up the standard I/O operations in C++. But it's used only once, so we can place its code directly in the main function to make the code cleaner.

4. The definition of `N` is also not used, so we can remove it.

5. The `unordered_map` is being reserved with a large amount of space `(1 << 18)`. This is a good practice if you expect the map to grow to this size, as it can prevent multiple rehashes. However, if the size of the map is often much less than this, it's just wasted space. You might want to adjust the size depending on the expected inputs.

Optimized Program:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef long double ld;
const ll MOD = 1000000007;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  unordered_map<string, int> mp;
  mp.reserve(1 << 18);
  mp.max_load_factor(0.25);
  while (n--) {
    string ar;
    cin >> ar;
    auto it = mp.find(ar);
    if (it == mp.end()) {
      cout << "OK\n";
      mp[ar] = 1;
    } else {
      cout << ar << it->second << "\n";
      it->second++;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please be aware that the improvements made to the program depend on the specific use case of the program. For instance, the size of the `unordered_map` reservation is entirely dependent on the expected input size.
