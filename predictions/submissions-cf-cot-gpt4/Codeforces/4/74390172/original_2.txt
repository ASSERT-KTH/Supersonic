This program is a C++ program that reads a number n and n strings. For each read string, it checks if it has been seen before. If it hasn't, it prints "OK", otherwise, it prints the string followed by the number of times it has already been seen. The program uses an unordered_map to store the strings and their counts.

The optimization steps can be as follows:

1. Instead of using cout for output, use printf. The reason behind this is that printf is faster than cout. This is because cout is buffered, which means it tends to group output together, while printf writes directly to the output. This buffering can make cout appear slower than printf.

2. Instead of using cin for input, use scanf. Similar to the above point, scanf is faster than cin because it is less buffered.

3. Instead of checking if a string is in the map with find and then accessing it with the [] operator, use insert or emplace. This way, you only do the lookup once and then use the iterator returned by insert or emplace.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef long double ld;
#define endl '\n';
const ll POSITIVE_INFINITY = 9223372036854775807;
const ll NEGATIVE_INFINITY = -9223372036854775807;
const ll MOD = 1000000007;
const ld PI = acos(-1.0);
template <typename T> inline T bigMod(T A, T B, T M = MOD) {
  A %= M;
  T ret = 1;
  while (B) {
    if (B & 1)
      ret = (ret * A) % M;
    A = (A * A) % M;
    B = B >> 1;
  }
  return ret;
}
template <typename T> inline T invMod(T A, T M = MOD) {
  return bigMod(A, M - 2, M);
}
const int N = 200005;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);

  unordered_map<string, int> mp;
  mp.reserve(1 << 18);
  mp.max_load_factor(0.25);

  char ar[N];
  while (n--) {
    scanf("%s", ar);
    auto [it, inserted] = mp.emplace(ar, 0);

    if (inserted) {
      printf("OK\n");
    }
    else {
      printf("%s%d\n", ar, it->second);
      it->second += 1;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that `#define FASTER` macro has been removed because `cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);` is used when we use `cin` and `cout` for input/output and we have replaced them with `scanf` and `printf`. Besides, this macro is not used anywhere else in the program.
