Here's how we can optimize the code:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a huge number of standard C++ libraries, which can increase the compile time. It's better to include only those libraries which are actually used in the program.

2. Use '\n' instead of std::endl: std::endl not only adds a newline character but also flushes the output buffer, which can slow down the program. In our case, we don't need to flush the buffer after every output, so we can use '\n' instead.

3. Avoid using "using namespace std": While this is not a performance optimization, it is considered good practice to avoid this statement in order to prevent name clashes.

4. Avoid using ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false): The use of this statement can lead to issues when mixing stdio with iostream. This is generally not recommended unless you're sure about what you're doing.

5. Avoid repetitive find operation: In the original code, the find operation was called twice if the element was found. The find operation can be expensive, so it should be avoided if not necessary.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef long double ld;

const ll POSITIVE_INFINITY = 9223372036854775807;
const ll NEGATIVE_INFINITY = -9223372036854775807;
const ll MOD = 1000000007;
const ld PI = acos(-1.0);

template <typename T> inline T bigMod(T A, T B, T M = MOD) {
  A %= M;
  T ret = 1;
  while (B) {
    if (B & 1)
      ret = (ret * A) % M;
    A = (A * A) % M;
    B = B >> 1;
  }
  return ret;
}

template <typename T> inline T invMod(T A, T M = MOD) {
  return bigMod(A, M - 2, M);
}

const int N = 200005;

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::unordered_map<std::string, int> mp;
  mp.reserve(1 << 18);
  mp.max_load_factor(0.25);
  while (n--) {
    std::string ar;
    std::cin >> ar;
    auto it = mp.insert({ar, 1});
    if (!it.second) {
      std::cout << ar << it.first->second << '\n';
      it.first->second++;
    } else {
      std::cout << "OK\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code should give the same output as before, but it may run faster and use less memory.
