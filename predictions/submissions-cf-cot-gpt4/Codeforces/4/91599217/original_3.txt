This is a C++ program for a username system. It reads a number `n` and then `n` usernames. For each username, if it's the first time we see it, it prints "OK", otherwise it prints the username followed by the number of times we have seen it before.

Optimization step by step:

1. Since we are using C++11 or later, we can use the `emplace` method to insert a value into the map. This method constructs the element in-place and can be more efficient than `insert`. We can use the `emplace` method in conjunction with the `map::count` function to check if the element was inserted or if it was already there.

2. We can also replace the `ios::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0);` with `ios::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(nullptr);` for better readability.

3. Finally, we can use "\n" instead of `endl` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the cout buffer.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(nullptr);
  int n;
  string s;
  cin >> n;
  map<string, int> db;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> s;
    auto result = db.emplace(s, 1);
    if (result.second) {
      cout << "OK" << "\n";
    } else {
      cout << s << result.first->second++ << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized program, we still create a map of usernames and count the number of times each username appears. For each new username, we try to `emplace` it into the map with a count of 1. If the username was not in the map, `emplace` inserts it and returns a pair where the second element is `true`. If the username was already in the map, `emplace` does nothing and returns a pair where the second element is `false`. Finally, we print the username and the count, and increment the count.
