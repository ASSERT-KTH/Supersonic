The given program takes an integer 'n' as input and then takes 'n' strings as input one by one. It checks if the string is present in the map 'db'. If the string is not present, it prints 'OK' and inserts the string into the map. If the string is already present, it prints the string followed by the count of its occurrence and increments the count in the map.

The program is already quite optimized in terms of running time and memory usage. The use of std::map allows for O(log n) search and insertion operations which is quite efficient for large number of inputs.

However, there are still minor optimizations that can be made:

1. Unnecessary use of std::map::find: The program uses std::map::find to check if a key exists in the map and then uses the subscript operator to access or insert the key. This results in two lookups for the same key which can be avoided.

2. Unnecessary use of std::endl: The program uses '\n' to print a new line. This is more efficient than std::endl as std::endl flushes the output buffer which can be costly in terms of performance.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);
  int n;
  string s;
  cin >> n;
  map<string, int> db;

  while (n--) {
    cin >> s;
    auto result = db.insert({s, 1});
    if (!result.second) {
      cout << s << result.first->second++ << '\n';
    } else {
      cout << "OK" << '\n';
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized program, we use std::map::insert method which returns a pair where the first element is an iterator to the inserted element and the second element is a boolean indicating whether the insertion took place or not. If the insertion did not take place, it means the key already existed in the map. Hence we avoid two lookups in such case.
