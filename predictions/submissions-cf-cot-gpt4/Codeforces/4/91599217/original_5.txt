The given code is already quite optimized. It uses `std::map` which is a balanced binary tree and gives a time complexity of about O(log n) for search, insert and delete operations. 

However, there's a small optimization that can be done. 

Right now, the program is checking if the string `s` exists in the map `db` using `db.find(s) == db.end()`. If `s` does not exist in the map, it inserts `s` into `db`. If `s` exists, it increments the value and prints `s` and its frequency.

We can optimize this by using `std::map::operator[]`. This operator accesses the element with a key equivalent to `s` if it exists. If it does not exist, it inserts a new element with that key.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0);
  int n;
  string s;
  cin >> n;
  map<string, int> db;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> s;
    int &freq = db[s];
    if (freq == 0) {
      cout << "OK" << '\n';
    } else {
      cout << s << freq << '\n';
    }
    ++freq;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, the `map::operator[]` is used which reduces the number of lookups in the map from 2 to 1 in the scenario when the string is already present. This could potentially improve the performance. However, the overall time complexity remains the same due to the nature of the operations and the data structure used. 

As for memory usage, both versions of the program have similar memory usage. They both store the strings and their frequencies in a `std::map`. The memory usage can be influenced by the number of unique strings and their lengths, which is input-dependent and not influenced by the code itself.

So, the optimization here is minor and more about code efficiency and readability rather than a significant runtime or memory usage improvement.
