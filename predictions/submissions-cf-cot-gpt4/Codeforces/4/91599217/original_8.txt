This program is relatively optimized, but there are few minor changes that can improve the performance:

1. Instead of checking `if (db.find(s) == db.end())`, directly use `db[s]++`. This will reduce an unnecessary search in the map. `db[s]++` will either increment the value if the key exists or create a new key with a value of 1.

2. `'\n'` can be replaced with `endl`, which might be slower because it forces a flush operation, but it's generally safer especially when dealing with file I/O operations or if the program may crash and you want to make sure everything is outputted. In this case, we are just outputting to console, so it's safe to use `'\n'`. But in general, it's good to be aware of this difference.

3. `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0), std::cin.tie(0);` these are good for fast IO, but be aware that they make input and output unsynchronized with C's stdio. In this code, we only use C++ style IO, so it's safe to have them. 

4. `std::map` is a balanced binary search tree and its time complexity for insertion and search operations are O(log n). `std::unordered_map` on the other hand uses hashing, so its average case for these operations is O(1), which can be faster than `std::map` if the number of elements (n) is large.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0);
  int n;
  string s;
  cin >> n;
  unordered_map<string, int> db;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> s;
    if (db[s]++ == 0) {
      cout << "OK" << '\n';
    } else {
      cout << s << db[s]-1 << '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we used `unordered_map` instead of `map` for better average case performance. Also, we reduced the number of map operations by using `db[s]++` directly and checking if the previous value was 0 to print "OK".
