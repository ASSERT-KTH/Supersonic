The optimization can be done in the following ways:

1. Passing vector by reference: In the given code, the function `rec(vector<int> A, int p)` is passing vector A by value. This means that a new copy of vector A is created every time the function is called. This increases both the time and space complexity of the program. If we pass vector A by reference, it will avoid unnecessary copying and will improve the time and space efficiency of the program.

2. Avoiding unnecessary vector creation: In the function `rec(vector<int> A, int p)`, vectors B and C are created in every function call. If the size of A is large, this would consume a significant amount of memory. Instead of creating two separate vectors, we can create two indices `countB` and `countC` to count the number of elements that would be pushed to vectors B and C respectively. This would reduce the memory usage.

3. Avoiding unnecessary bitwise operation: In the loop `for (auto x : A)`, the bitwise operation `x & ~((1 << p))` is performed twice for each element. This redundant operation can be avoided by performing the operation once and using its result.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int rec(vector<int>& A, int p) {
  if (p == -1)
    return 0;
  
  int countB = 0, countC = 0;
  int mask = ~(1 << p);
  
  for (auto x : A) {
    int val = x & mask;
    if (x & (1 << p))
      countB++;
    else
      countC++;
  }
  
  if (A.size() == countB) {
    return rec(A, p - 1);
  } else if (A.size() == countC) {
    return rec(A, p - 1);
  } else {
    return (1 << p) + min(rec(A, p - 1), rec(A, p - 1));
  }
  
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  cout << rec(A, 30) << endl;
}
```
Please note that this optimization might not give a significant improvement if the size of vector A is small. However, if the size of vector A is large, this optimization can significantly improve the time and space efficiency of the program. Also, this optimization assumes that the function `rec(vector<int>& A, int p)` is not supposed to modify vector A. If the function is supposed to modify vector A, this optimization might not be applicable.
