The given program is a recursive function that checks bit by bit of the elements in the vector. It separates the numbers into two categories based on whether a particular bit is set or not. Then, it recursively checks the next bit for the category of numbers that has fewer elements. If both categories have the same number of elements, it arbitrarily chooses one category. The base case is when the bit position is -1, which means all bits have been checked.

The main issue with this code is that it uses a lot of memory due to the recursive calls and the creation of new vectors at each recursive level. Instead of creating new vectors B and C, we can use pointers (or iterators) to keep track of the elements in the original vector to reduce the memory usage significantly. 

In addition, instead of checking if the size of A is equal to the size of B or C, we can simply check if B or C is empty. This is because if A's size is equal to B's or C's size, it means the other vector is empty.

The time complexity of this program is O(nlogn), with n being the number of elements in the vector. The space complexity can be improved from O(nlogn) to O(n), with n being the number of elements in the vector.

Let's write the optimized code:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int rec(vector<int>& A, int p, int l, int r) {
    if (p == -1) return 0;
    int mid = partition(A.begin()+l, A.begin()+r, [p](int x) { return !(x & (1 << p)); }) - A.begin();
    if (mid == l || mid == r) return rec(A, p - 1, l, r);
    return (1 << p) + min(rec(A, p - 1, l, mid), rec(A, p - 1, mid, r));
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> A(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> A[i];
    }
    cout << rec(A, 30, 0, n) << endl;
}
```
In this optimized version, the function `rec` takes four parameters: the vector `A`, the bit position `p`, and the left and right boundaries `l` and `r` for the vector. 

Instead of creating new vectors `B` and `C`, it partitions the vector `A` in-place based on whether the bit at position `p` is set or not using the STL function `partition`. The function `partition` rearranges the elements in the range `[l, r)` and returns an iterator pointing to the first element for which the condition (the bit at position `p` is set) is false. 

The function then checks if the partitioned vector is all true or all false by comparing `mid` (the iterator returned by `partition`) with `l` and `r`. If it is, it recursively calls `rec` with `p - 1` and the same range `[l, r)`. 

If `mid` is not equal to `l` or `r`, it means both true and false exist in the vector, and it recursively calls `rec` with `p - 1` and the range `[l, mid)` and `[mid, r)`, and returns the sum of `(1 << p)` and the minimum value returned by the recursive calls. 

This version reduces the space complexity to O(n) by avoiding the creation of new vectors and still maintains the same time complexity O(nlogn).
