The given program is a recursive program that performs a lot of unnecessary vector copy and push_back operations. The primary optimization techniques we can apply are:

1. Passing Vector by Reference: The vector 'A' is passed by value to the function 'rec'. This results in creating a copy of the vector with each recursive call. This is both time-consuming and memory-intensive. Instead, we could pass the vector by reference, which would avoid unnecessary copy operations. 

2. Avoiding Unnecessary push_back Operations: The program creates two new vectors 'B' and 'C' in each recursive call and populates them using push_back operations. Creating these vectors and performing push_back operations are time-consuming and memory-intensive. Instead, we could create these vectors once and pass them to the function.

3. Reserving Memory for Vectors: When you know the likely size of a vector, reserving memory for that size can avoid unnecessary memory re-allocations and improve performance.

Optimized C/C++ Program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int rec(vector<int>& A, int p, vector<int>& B, vector<int>& C) {
  if (p == -1)
    return 0;
  B.clear(); C.clear(); 
  for (auto x : A) {
    if (x & (1 << p))
      B.push_back(x & ~((1 << p)));
    else
      C.push_back(x & ~((1 << p)));
  }
  if (A.size() == B.size()) {
    return rec(B, p - 1, B, C);
  } else if (A.size() == C.size()) {
    return rec(C, p - 1, B, C);
  } else {
    return (1 << p) + min(rec(B, p - 1, B, C), rec(C, p - 1, B, C));
  }
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n), B(n), C(n);
  B.reserve(n); C.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  cout << rec(A, 30, B, C) << endl;
}
```

These optimizations would help to reduce the time complexity of the program by avoiding unnecessary vector copy and push_back operations. Also, they would help to reduce the memory usage of the program by avoiding unnecessary memory allocation for vectors.
