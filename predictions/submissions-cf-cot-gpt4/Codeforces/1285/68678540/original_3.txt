Optimization Steps:

1. The usage of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is discouraged since it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, increasing compile time. Include only necessary headers instead.
2. The vectors `B` and `C` are created and filled up in every recursive call. This is not memory efficient. Instead of creating new vectors, we can just count the number of elements that would have gone into `B` and `C`.
3. Instead of checking if the size of vector `A` is equal to the size of `B` or `C`, we can directly compare the count of `B` and `C` with `n`.

Optimized Program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int rec(const vector<int>& A, int p, int n) {
  if (p == -1)
    return 0;
  int countB = 0, countC = 0;
  for (auto x : A) {
    if (x & (1 << p))
      countB++;
    else
      countC++;
  }
  if (n == countB) {
    return rec(A, p - 1, countB);
  } else if (n == countC) {
    return rec(A, p - 1, countC);
  } else {
    return (1 << p) + min(rec(A, p - 1, countB), rec(A, p - 1, countC));
  }
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  cout << rec(A, 30, n) << endl;
}
```

In this optimized version, we have avoided creating new vectors `B` and `C` in every recursive call. Instead, we just keep track of the counts of `B` and `C` elements. This reduces the memory usage and also improves the runtime as we have removed the overhead of creating and filling vectors in every recursive call. Moreover, we directly pass the count of elements to the recursive function, so it does not need to calculate the size again, reducing the computation time.
