This program takes a series of numbers and for each number, it continuously adds 1 to it until the number satisfies a certain condition: that each non-zero digit in the number should divide the number without leaving any remainder. The program does this by converting the number to a string and checking the condition for each digit in the string.

Optimization Steps:

1. The check function can be optimized. If a digit in the number does not satisfy the condition, we can immediately return false without checking the remaining digits.

2. The check function converts a number to a string for checking. This conversion operation can be avoided for better performance. We can get each digit of the number by doing modulus and division operations.

3. The solve function continuously increments the number until it satisfies the condition. This could be optimized by skipping over numbers that will definitely not satisfy the condition. For example, if the current number ends with 0, we know that the next 9 numbers will not satisfy the condition because they will end with 1, 2, ..., 9, none of which can divide the number. So we can directly add 10 to the number in this case.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define fast ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0)

bool check(long long n) {
  long long temp = n;
  while (temp > 0) {
    int digit = temp % 10;
    if (digit != 0 && n % digit != 0) {
      return false;
    }
    temp /= 10;
  }
  return true;
}

void solve() {
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  while (true) {
    if (n % 10 == 0) {
      n += 10;
      continue;
    }
    if (check(n)) {
      cout << n << "\n";
      break;
    } else
      n++;
  }
}

int main() {
  fast;
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" line is generally discouraged in production code as it includes all standard library headers, which can significantly increase compile times. It is more common in competitive programming to save typing time. For production code, you should include only the specific headers you need.
