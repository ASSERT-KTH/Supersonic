The given program is a brute force solution to find the smallest number `n` that is divisible by each of its digits. It checks every number `n`, `n+1`, `n+2`... until it finds such a number. This approach is inefficient and can be optimized.

Optimization Steps:

1. Function 'check': This function converts the number into a string and checks if it is divisible by each of its digits. Instead of converting the number into a string, we can do this more efficiently by repeatedly dividing the number by 10 and checking the divisibility.

2. Function 'solve': This function increments the number `n` until it finds a number that satisfies the condition. Instead of incrementing `n` by 1, we can increment `n` by the last non-zero digit. This will skip over numbers that would fail the check anyway.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define fast ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0)
typedef long long ll;

bool check(ll n) {
    ll temp = n, digit;
    while (temp != 0) {
        digit = temp % 10;
        if (digit != 0 && n % digit != 0) {
            return false;
        }
        temp = temp / 10;
    }
    return true;
}

void solve() {
    ll n;
    cin >> n;
    while (1) {
        if (check(n)) {
            cout << n << endl;
            break;
        } else {
            n += n % 10 ? n % 10 : 1;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    fast;
    int t = 1;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Please note that the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;` are generally considered bad practice due to the large number of headers they include and the potential for name clashes, respectively. However, they are commonly used in competitive programming for brevity. In production code, it is better to include only the necessary headers and use explicit namespace qualifiers.
