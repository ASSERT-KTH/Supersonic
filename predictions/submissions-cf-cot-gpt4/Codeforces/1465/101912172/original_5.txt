The program you've provided is a competitive programming code snippet which seems to find the smallest number starting from 'n' (inclusive) such that all the digits in the number divide it. It does so by incrementing 'n' and checking every number. The optimization here would be to reduce the number of checks and prevent unnecessary computations.

Optimizations:

1. Including the entire 'bits/stdc++.h' header file is generally a bad practice because it includes all the standard library headers, which can significantly increase the compile time. Instead, it would be better to include only the necessary header files. In this case, we only need 'iostream', 'string', and 'ctime'.

2. The check function converts the number to a string and then iterates over every character in the string. This is not efficient as the number-to-string conversion is unnecessary and time-consuming. A better approach would be to directly iterate over the digits of the number using modulo and division operations.

3. The macro definitions are not recommended in modern C++. It's better to use inline functions or constants.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <ctime>

using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

bool check(ll n) 
{
  ll temp = n;
  while (temp != 0) 
  {
    int digit = temp % 10;
    if (digit != 0 && n % digit != 0) 
      return false;
    temp /= 10;
  }
  return true;
}

void solve() 
{
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  while (1) 
  {
    if (check(n)) 
    {
      cout << n << "\n";
      break;
    } 
    else
      n++;
  }
}

int main() 
{
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) 
  {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
These optimizations should improve the efficiency of the provided program.
