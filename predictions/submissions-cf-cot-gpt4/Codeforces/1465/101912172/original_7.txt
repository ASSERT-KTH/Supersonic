This program is used to find the smallest number 'n' such that each digit of 'n' is a divisor of 'n'. The program is already well-optimized, but there are a few improvements that can be made.

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of files, which increases the compilation time. It is not a standard library and not portable. It's better to include only those libraries which are being used in the program. 

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This can lead to name conflicts in larger projects. It's better to use `std::` before standard library objects.

3. Avoid using `#define` for loop: The macro `#define fo(i, n) for (i = 0; i < n; i++)` is unnecessary, and it can make the code less clear. It's better to use the simple for loop in the code.

4. Avoid using `scanf` and `printf`: Since the code uses C++ features, it's better to use `cin` and `cout` for input/output. 

5. Avoid using global variables: The variable `begtime` is declared as global, it's better to declare it in `main()`.

Optimized code after considering the above points:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <ctime>
#include <utility>
#include <string>

typedef long long ll;
typedef std::pair<int, int> pii;
typedef std::pair<ll, ll> pl;
typedef std::vector<int> vi;
typedef std::vector<ll> vl;
typedef std::vector<pii> vpii;
typedef std::vector<pl> vpl;
typedef std::vector<vi> vvi;
typedef std::vector<vl> vvl;

bool check(ll n) {
  bool flag = true;
  std::string s = std::to_string(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
    if (s[i] == '0')
      continue;
    if (n % (s[i] - '0') != 0) {
      flag = false;
    }
  }
  return flag;
}

void solve() {
  ll n;
  std::cin >> n;
  while (1) {
    if (check(n)) {
      std::cout << n << std::endl;
      break;
    } else
      n++;
  }
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);
  int t = 1;
  std::cin >> t;
  int begtime = clock();
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  std::cout << "\n\nTime elapsed: " << (clock() - begtime) * 1000 / CLOCKS_PER_SEC << " ms\n\n";
  return 0;
}
```
