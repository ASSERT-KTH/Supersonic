The given code seems to be checking for numbers that are divisible by each of their digits. The program is quite optimized already, but there are a few changes that we can make to further optimize it:

1. In the `check` function, instead of converting the integer to a string and then iterating over the string, we can perform the operation directly on the integer itself. This will save us the overhead of string conversion.

2. In the `solve` function, instead of incrementing `n` by 1 in each iteration, we can increment it by the smallest non-zero digit of `n`. This is based on the observation that if `n` is not divisible by a certain digit `d`, then `n+d` will also not be divisible by `d`.

3. The `begtime` variable is declared globally and it's not really used in the code, unless we uncomment the `end_routine()` function, which is commented out. Let's remove it.

4. Avoid using `#define` for loops. It's better to write out the loops explicitly as it makes the code more readable and maintainable.

Optimized Program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pl;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<ll> vl;
typedef vector<pii> vpii;
typedef vector<pl> vpl;
typedef vector<vi> vvi;
typedef vector<vl> vvl;

bool check(ll n) {
    int min_digit = 10;
    ll temp = n;
    while (temp > 0) {
        int digit = temp % 10;
        if (digit == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        if (digit < min_digit) {
            min_digit = digit;
        }
        if (n % digit != 0) {
            return false;
        }
        temp /= 10;
    }
    return true;
}

void solve() {
    ll n;
    cin >> n;
    while (1) {
        if (check(n)) {
            cout << n << '\n';
            break;
        } else {
            n++;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimization of incrementing `n` by the smallest non-zero digit is not implemented here because it can introduce a lot of complexity and might not always give correct results. For example, if `n = 12`, then `n % 2 = 0` but `(n+2) % 2 != 0`.
