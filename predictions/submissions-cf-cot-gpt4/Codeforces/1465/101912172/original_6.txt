This program reads a number 't' and then 't' numbers one by one. For each number 'n' read, it increments 'n' until it finds a number which is divisible by all of its digits, and then prints that number.

Here are a few areas where this program can be optimized:

1. Includes: The program uses `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This is a header file that includes many standard library headers. It increases compilation time and is not recommended, especially when only a few of these headers are actually used in the program. We should only include necessary headers.

2. Macros: There are a lot of macros defined that are not used in the program. For example, `si(x)`, `sl(x)`, `ss(s)`, `sd(n)`, `sf(n)`, `pnl`, `deb(x)`, `deb2(x, y)`, `pb`, `mp`, `F`, `S`, `all(x)`, `tr(it, a)` etc. These can be removed to clean up the code.

3. Variable 'begtime': It is declared and assigned, but never used. It can be removed.

4. The `check` function converts the number to a string and then iterates over each digit. This is not the most efficient way to do this. It would be faster to iterate over the digits of the number directly.

5. The `check` function also has a flag variable that is not necessary. We can return false as soon as we find a digit that does not divide the number, and return true at the end if we haven't found any such digit.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool check(long long n) {
    for (long long t = n; t > 0; t /= 10) {
        long long digit = t % 10;
        if (digit != 0 && n % digit != 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

void solve() {
    long long n;
    cin >> n;
    while (1) {
        if (check(n)) {
            cout << n << "\n";
            break;
        }
        n++;
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int t = 1;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The changes are:

1. Removed unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, and included only `<iostream>` and `<string>`.

2. Removed unused macros.

3. Removed unused variable 'begtime'.

4. Optimized the `check` function to iterate over the digits of the number directly, without converting it to a string.

5. Removed the flag variable from the `check` function, and simplified the logic.

These changes should make the program run faster and use less memory.
