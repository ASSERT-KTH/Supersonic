The C/C++ program given seems to be already optimized in terms of speed with the help of the "-Ofast" and "unroll-loops" options enabled by the GCC pragma directive. The program also uses efficient methods for input and output operations. However, there are still some areas where the program can be optimized for memory usage and readability. 

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unused includes: The given code includes several libraries that aren't used in the code. Removing these will make the code cleaner and potentially reduce the compiled binary size.

2. Replace the macro definitions with type aliases or constexpr: Macros can be difficult to debug and can lead to unexpected results if not used carefully. So, it's better to replace them with type aliases or constexpr for better readability and safety. This will not affect the performance of the program.

3. Avoid unnecessary heap allocations: In the given code, a 2D vector "next" is being created inside the "solve" function which is called in a loop. This vector allocation and deallocation can be avoided to reduce the memory usage.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <chrono>
using namespace std;

constexpr int EPS = 1e-9;
constexpr int INF = 1e9;
constexpr int MOD = 1000000007;
constexpr char ENDL = '\n';
using V = vector<int>;
using ll = long long;

void solve() {
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  int n = s.size();
  int ans = INF;
  vector<vector<int>> next(n, vector<int>(4, -1));
  next[n - 1][s[n - 1] - '0'] = n - 1;
  for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    next[i] = next[i + 1];
    next[i][s[i] - '0'] = i;
    if (next[i][1] == -1 || next[i][2] == -1 || next[i][3] == -1) {
      continue;
    }
    int len;
    if (s[i] == '1') {
      len = max(next[i][2], next[i][3]) - i;
    } else if (s[i] == '2') {
      len = max(next[i][1], next[i][3]) - i;
    } else {
      len = max(next[i][1], next[i][2]) - i;
    }
    ans = min(ans, len);
  }
  if (ans == INF) {
    cout << 0 << ENDL;
  } else {
    cout << (ans + 1) << ENDL;
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  srand(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
  ll TC;
  cin >> TC;
  while (TC--)
    solve();
}
```
Please note that optimizing the "next" vector to avoid unnecessary heap allocations is not directly possible without restructuring the algorithm. If the maximum size of the "next" vector is known and it doesn't vary much, it could be declared as a global variable or as a static variable inside the function to avoid repeated heap allocations.
