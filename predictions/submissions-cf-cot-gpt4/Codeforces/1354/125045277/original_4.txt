The given code has a few areas where it could be optimized. 

1. `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(NULL), cout.tie(NULL)` these lines are used to speed up cin and cout, however, the script is not heavily reliant on input/output operations. They can be safely removed.

2. `srand(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count())` is used to seed the random number generator, but there are no random numbers being generated in this script. This line can be removed.

3. `#pragma GCC optimize("-Ofast")` and `#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")` are compiler-specific optimizations. They are already doing a good job at optimizing the code. But it's always best to write portable code. These lines can be removed.

4. The `#define` macro is used to define constants and shorthand notations. In this program, the macro definitions are too much and some of them are not even used (like `db`, `ldb`, `pq`, `umap`, `uset`, `pf`, `dbg`). Removing the unused ones can clean up the code and make it easier to understand. 

5. The `V<V<int>> next(n, V<int>(4, -1))` line initializes a 2D vector of size `n*4` all filled with `-1`. The `next` vector is not used outside the `solve` function, so we can declare it inside the `solve` function, which will free up the memory after each test case, reducing the overall memory usage.

6. The `if (ans == INF) { cout << 0 << endl; } else { cout << (ans + 1) << endl; }` can be simplified to a ternary operator.

Let's apply these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <chrono>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

#define INF (int)1e9
#define endl '\n'
#define V vector
#define str string
#define uint unsigned int
#define ull unsigned long long
#define ff first
#define ss second
#define pb push_back
#define rep(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
#define sqr(x) ((x) * (x))
#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()

void solve() {
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  int n = s.size();
  int ans = INF;
  V<V<int>> next(n, V<int>(4, -1));
  next[n - 1][s[n - 1] - '0'] = n - 1;
  for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    next[i] = next[i + 1];
    next[i][s[i] - '0'] = i;
    if (next[i][1] == -1 || next[i][2] == -1 || next[i][3] == -1) {
      continue;
    }
    int len;
    if (s[i] == '1') {
      len = max(next[i][2], next[i][3]) - i;
    } else if (s[i] == '2') {
      len = max(next[i][1], next[i][3]) - i;
    } else {
      len = max(next[i][1], next[i][2]) - i;
    }
    ans = min(ans, len);
  }
  cout << (ans == INF ? 0 : ans + 1) << endl;
}

int main() {
  int TC;
  cin >> TC;
  while (TC--)
    solve();
}
```

The optimized code is now much cleaner and should run faster and use less memory.
