This C++ program has several areas that can be optimized. Here are the steps to optimize:

1. Reduce unnecessary macro definitions: Unnecessary macro definitions can make the code harder to read and understand. It would be better to write out the full form where it's used. In this case, for example, "db", "ldb", "pq", "str", "uint", "ull", "umap", "uset", "ff", "ss", "pb", "pf", "dbg", "rep", and "sqr" are not used and can be removed.

2. Reduce the usage of the global scope: The using namespace std statement is generally considered bad practice. The std namespace is not very big but it's like a contract. We are telling the compiler that we can use everything in std without needing to prefix it with std::. This can lead to name clashes.

3. Use const for constant values: The 'INF' variable is a constant and should be defined as such for clarity. It also helps the compiler optimize the code.

4. Avoid unnecessary typecasts: The 'INF' variable is being unnecessarily cast to an int. Just define it as an int.

5. Combine declaration and initialization: Instead of declaring 'n' and 'ans' separately, we can declare and initialize them in one line. This makes the code more efficient and easier to read.

6. Use std::endl sparingly: std::endl is slower than '\n' because it forces a flush operation. Only use it when you actually need to flush the stream.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

constexpr int INF = 1e9;
constexpr char NEW_LINE = '\n';

void solve() {
  std::string s;
  std::cin >> s;
  const int n = s.size();
  int ans = INF;
  std::vector<std::vector<int>> next(n, std::vector<int>(4, -1));
  next[n - 1][s[n - 1] - '0'] = n - 1;
  for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    next[i] = next[i + 1];
    next[i][s[i] - '0'] = i;
    if (next[i][1] == -1 || next[i][2] == -1 || next[i][3] == -1) {
      continue;
    }
    int len;
    if (s[i] == '1') {
      len = std::max(next[i][2], next[i][3]) - i;
    } else if (s[i] == '2') {
      len = std::max(next[i][1], next[i][3]) - i;
    } else {
      len = std::max(next[i][1], next[i][2]) - i;
    }
    ans = std::min(ans, len);
  }
  if (ans == INF) {
    std::cout << 0 << NEW_LINE;
  } else {
    std::cout << (ans + 1) << NEW_LINE;
  }
}

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);
  srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(std::chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count()));
  long long TC;
  std::cin >> TC;
  while (TC--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimization of any program highly depends on what the program is doing. In this case, the provided program is already quite optimized in terms of algorithmic complexity. The changes made here are mostly related to coding practices, clarity, and minor performance improvements.
