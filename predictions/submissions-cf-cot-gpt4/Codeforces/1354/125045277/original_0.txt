The program is already quite efficient, but there are still some places to optimize. 

1. First, you can replace the string comparison in the if-else statements with integer comparisons. It will be faster because integer comparison is quicker than string comparison.

2. Second, you can reduce the number of operations inside the loop by directly updating the 'ans' variable in the loop. This way, you don't need to calculate the length each time and then find the minimum. You can do it in one step.

3. Third, the #define directives are mainly used in C. In C++, it is better to use const or constexpr for constants, and typedef or using for type aliases. These provide type safety and are more readable.

4. Fourth, the 'dbg' macro is unused and can be removed.

5. Fifth, the 'tsc' macro is unnecessary and makes the code harder to read. It can be replaced with a simple loop in the main function.

6. Sixth, the 'srand' function is unused and can be removed.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

constexpr double EPS = 1e-9;
constexpr int INF = 1e9;
constexpr int MOD = 1000000007;
constexpr char endl = '\n';

using V = vector;
using db = double;
using ldb = long double;
using ll = long long;
using pq = priority_queue;
using str = string;
using uint = unsigned int;
using ull = unsigned long long;
using umap = unordered_map;
using uset = unordered_set;

#define ff first
#define ss second
#define pb push_back
#define pf push_front

#define rep(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
#define sqr(x) ((x) * (x))
#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()

void solve() {
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    int n = s.size();
    int ans = INF;
    V<V<int>> next(n, V<int>(4, -1));
    next[n - 1][s[n - 1] - '0'] = n - 1;
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        next[i] = next[i + 1];
        next[i][s[i] - '0'] = i;
        if (next[i][1] == -1 || next[i][2] == -1 || next[i][3] == -1) {
            continue;
        }
        ans = min(ans, max({next[i][1], next[i][2], next[i][3]}) - i + 1);
    }
    cout << (ans == INF ? 0 : ans) << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    ll TC;
    cin >> TC; 
    while (TC--) {
        solve();
    }
}
```
This code should have roughly the same functionality but is more efficient and more idiomatic C++.
