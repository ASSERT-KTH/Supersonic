The given code seems to be well optimized but there are a few areas where we can make some improvements.

1. Reduce the use of Macros: Macros make debugging difficult, hence they should be avoided if possible. We can replace macros with their actual definitions. For example, instead of using #define, we can use const or constexpr for constant definitions. For the sqr function, we can use a simple inline function.

2. Avoid Unnecessary Type Definitions: The code is using type definitions (#define) which might make the code more readable for the programmer, but it's not really good practice. It makes the code less understandable for others.

3. Reduce the use of Vector: The vector 'next' is consuming a lot of memory as it's a 2D vector. We can optimize it by using 3 separate integer arrays, which will reduce the memory usage.

4. Avoid Unnecessary Variable: There is no need of variable 'len'. We can directly calculate the min length in 'ans'.

Here is the optimized version of the given code:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("-Ofast")
#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")
#include <algorithm>
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

const double EPS = 1e-9;
const int INF = (int)1e9;
const int MOD = 1000000007;
const char NEWLINE = '\n';

inline int sqr(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

void solve() {
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    int n = s.size();
    int ans = INF;
    vector<int> next1(n, -1), next2(n, -1), next3(n, -1);
    next1[n - 1] = s[n - 1] == '1' ? n - 1 : -1;
    next2[n - 1] = s[n - 1] == '2' ? n - 1 : -1;
    next3[n - 1] = s[n - 1] == '3' ? n - 1 : -1;

    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        next1[i] = s[i] == '1' ? i : next1[i + 1];
        next2[i] = s[i] == '2' ? i : next2[i + 1];
        next3[i] = s[i] == '3' ? i : next3[i + 1];
        if (next1[i] == -1 || next2[i] == -1 || next3[i] == -1) {
            continue;
        }
        ans = min(ans, max({next1[i], next2[i], next3[i]}) - i);
    }
    if (ans == INF) {
        cout << 0 << NEWLINE;
    } else {
        cout << (ans + 1) << NEWLINE;
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    srand(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
    long long TC;
    cin >> TC;
    while (TC--)
        solve();
}
```
This optimized code reduces the usage of macros, eliminates unnecessary variables, and optimizes memory usage by using separate arrays instead of a 2D vector.
