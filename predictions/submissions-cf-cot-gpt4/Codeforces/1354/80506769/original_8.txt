The code provided is already pretty well-optimized, but there are few things we can do to improve it a bit:

1. **Avoiding unnecessary calculations**: In the code, the variable `p` in the `check` function is always half of the input `l`. We can pass `p` instead of `l` to the function to avoid this division operation inside the function. 

2. **Using Fast IO**: The `iostream` library in C++ is slower than `stdio` library in C. If you want to optimize the program for running time, you can use `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout`. 

3. **Avoiding unnecessary double to integer conversions**: In the code, the index `j` in the loop inside `main` function is an integer number but it is used as a double number when calculating `x` and `y`. We can declare `j` as a double number to avoid these unnecessary conversions.

After doing these optimizations, the optimized code looks like this:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define rep(i, x, y) for (double i = x; i < (y); ++i)
const double esp = 1e-8;
const double pi = acos(-1);
bool check(double p, double x, double y) {
  if (x >= -p and x <= p and y >= -p and y <= p)
    return true;
  return false;
}
signed main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout << setprecision(9) << fixed;
  int ct;
  scanf("%lld", &ct);
  while (ct--) {
    int n;
    scanf("%lld", &n);
    double angle = (pi / n);
    double c = 1 / sqrt(2 - 2 * cos(angle));
    double l = 0, r = 200;
    rep(i, 0, 200) {
      double m = (r + l) * 0.5;
      bool ok = true;
      double p = m/2;
      rep(j, 0, 2 * n) {
        double x = c * cos(j * angle + pi / 4);
        double y = c * sin(j * angle + pi / 4);
        ok = check(p, x, y);
        if (ok == false)
          break;
      }
      if (ok)
        r = m;
      else
        l = m;
    }
    printf("%.9f\n", l);
  }
}
```

Please be aware that, in competitive programming, using `bits/stdc++.h` and `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);` is common and accepted. However, in a production environment, it's better to include only necessary headers and use cin/cout for better code readability and maintainability.
