Optimization Steps:

1. The calculation of "c" and "angle" only depends on "n", and they are calculated in every test case. We can calculate it once before the while loop and store it in a map or array for each possible value of "n". This would significantly speed up the program if "ct" is large.
   
2. The calculation of "x" and "y" in the inner `rep` loop is the same for each "m". We can calculate it before the inner loop and store it in a list. This would avoid unnecessary calculations and speed up the program.

3. Also, instead of using macro `#define int long long`, we can use `typedef long long int` which is better because it follows the scope rules.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int ll;
#define rep(i, x, y) for (int i = x; i < (y); ++i)
#define IOS ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0)
const double esp = 1e-8;
const double pi = acos(-1);

bool check(double l, double x, double y) {
  double p = l / 2;
  if (x >= -p and x <= p and y >= -p and y <= p)
    return true;
  return false;
}

double c[100005], angle[100005];
vector<pair<double, double>> points[100005];

int main() {
  IOS;
  cout << setprecision(9) << fixed;
  rep(i, 1, 100005) {
    angle[i] = (pi / i);
    c[i] = 1 / sqrt(2 - 2 * cos(angle[i]));
    rep(j, 0, 2 * i) {
      double x = c[i] * cos(j * angle[i] + pi / 4);
      double y = c[i] * sin(j * angle[i] + pi / 4);
      points[i].push_back(make_pair(x, y));
    }
  }
  ll ct;
  cin >> ct;
  while (ct--) {
    ll n;
    cin >> n;
    double l = 0, r = 200;
    rep(i, 0, 200) {
      double m = (r + l) * 0.5;
      bool ok = true;
      for(auto point : points[n]) {
        ok = check(m, point.first, point.second);
        if (!ok)
          break;
      }
      if (ok)
        r = m;
      else
        l = m;
    }
    cout << l << "\n";
  }
}
```
This program now calculates "c", "angle" and points only once, and uses those values in each test case, thus reducing the running time. It uses more memory to store these values, but the increase in memory usage is acceptable given the speedup.
