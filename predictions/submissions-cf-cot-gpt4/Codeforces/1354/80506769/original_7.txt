Here are the optimization steps:

1. The `check` function is very simple and used once, so it can be inlined to avoid the function call overhead.
2. Avoiding the use of `and` keyword and using `&&` instead, the compiler can then do short-circuit evaluation. This means that if the first condition fails, the second condition won't be evaluated.
3. The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0)` is needed only if you are mixing `cin/cout` with `printf/scanf`. If no mixing is happening which is the case here, you can remove it.
4. The `bool ok` variable is redundant. It's better to use `break` directly in the loop when the condition isn't met.
5. Calculations that are repeated in a loop and whose values don't change in each iteration (like `pi / 4`) can be moved outside of the loop.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define rep(i, x, y) for (int i = x; i < (y); ++i)
const double esp = 1e-8;
const double pi = acos(-1);

inline bool check(double l, double x, double y) {
  double p = l / 2;
  return x >= -p && x <= p && y >= -p && y <= p;
}

signed main() {
  cout << setprecision(9) << fixed;
  int ct;
  cin >> ct;
  while (ct--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    double angle = (pi / n);
    double c = 1 / sqrt(2 - 2 * cos(angle));
    double l = 0, r = 200;
    double pi_by_4 = pi / 4;  // moved outside of the loop
    rep(i, 0, 200) {
      double m = (r + l) * 0.5;
      rep(j, 0, 2 * n) {
        double x = c * cos(j * angle + pi_by_4);
        double y = c * sin(j * angle + pi_by_4);
        if (!check(m, x, y)) {
          l = m;
          break;
        }
        r = m;
      }
    }
    cout << l << "\n";
  }
}
```
