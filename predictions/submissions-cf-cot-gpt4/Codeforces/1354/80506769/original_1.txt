The given C++ program is solving a geometric problem. It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the number of points in a polygon. It then calculates the optimal radius of a circle that can be inscribed in the polygon.

Optimization Steps:

1. **Remove unnecessary use of `bits/stdc++.h`**: This header file includes a lot of libraries that you may not use in your code, which can lead to increased compilation time. It is better to only include the libraries that you are using. In this case, we are using `iostream`, `cmath`, `iomanip` and `vector`.

2. **Avoid using `#define` for loops**: Instead of using `#define` for loops, using standard for loop is better practice. 

3. **Avoid using `#define` for `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0)`**: Instead of using `#define`, put these lines in the main function, which is more readable.

4. **Remove unnecessary `if` condition in `check` function**: In the check function, you don't need an if condition to return a boolean value. You can directly return the condition.

5. **Use `constexpr` for constants**: Constants `esp` and `pi` should be declared as `constexpr` which tells that their value will be computed at compile time.

6. **Remove unnecessary variable `ok`**: The variable `ok` is unnecessary. You can directly use the check function in the if condition.

7. **Avoid using `long long` when `int` is sufficient**: The variable `ct` and `n` are defined as `long long` but in this context `int` is sufficient.

Now, I will generate the optimized code following these steps. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <iomanip>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

constexpr double esp = 1e-8;
constexpr double pi = acos(-1);

bool check(double l, double x, double y) {
  double p = l / 2;
  return x >= -p && x <= p && y >= -p && y <= p;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  cout << setprecision(9) << fixed;
  int ct;
  cin >> ct;

  while (ct--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    double angle = (pi / n);
    double c = 1 / sqrt(2 - 2 * cos(angle));
    double l = 0, r = 200;

    for (int i = 0; i < 200; ++i) {
      double m = (r + l) * 0.5;
      
      int j = 0;
      for (; j < 2 * n; ++j) {
        double x = c * cos(j * angle + pi / 4);
        double y = c * sin(j * angle + pi / 4);
        if (!check(m, x, y))
          break;
      }
      
      if (j == 2 * n)
        r = m;
      else
        l = m;
    }
    
    cout << l << "\n";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the actual optimization achieved here is really small. The algorithm used in the program is already optimal and the changes made are more of a good coding practice rather than performance optimization.
