Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. The `#define rep(i, x, y) for (int i = x; i < (y); ++i)` macro is used to iterate over a range. However, it's not necessary to define a macro for this. Using a plain `for` loop is clearer and more readable.

2. The `check` function checks if a point (x, y) is within a square of side `l` centered at the origin. Instead of calling the `check` function in each iteration of the loop, you can calculate the maximum absolute x and y coordinates, and then check if they are within the square after the loop. This will reduce the number of function calls, which can be a significant optimization if the function is called many times.

3. The `angle` variable is not changing inside the while loop, so it should be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations.

4. The `bool ok` used to break the inner loop can be replaced with a `break` statement. This will make the code simpler and easier to understand.

5. The lines `#define IOS ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0)` and `cout << setprecision(9) << fixed;` are unnecessary for the given code. They are used for faster I/O operations and specific output formatting, neither of which are needed in this case.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

const double esp = 1e-8;
const double pi = acos(-1);

int main() {
  int ct;
  cin >> ct;
  while (ct--) {
    ll n;
    cin >> n;
    double angle = (pi / n);
    double c = 1 / sqrt(2 - 2 * cos(angle));
    double l = 0, r = 200;
    for (int i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
      double m = (r + l) * 0.5;
      double max_x = 0, max_y = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < 2 * n; j++) {
        double x = c * cos(j * angle + pi / 4);
        double y = c * sin(j * angle + pi / 4);
        max_x = max(max_x, abs(x));
        max_y = max(max_y, abs(y));
      }
      double p = m / 2;
      if (max_x <= p && max_y <= p)
        r = m;
      else
        l = m;
    }
    cout << l << "\n";
  }
}
```
This optimized version reduces the number of function calls and redundant calculations, making it faster and more memory efficient.
