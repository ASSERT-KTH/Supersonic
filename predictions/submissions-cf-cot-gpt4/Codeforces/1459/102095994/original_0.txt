The given program is a dynamic programming solution. There are several points where we can optimize it.

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The header `<bits/stdc++.h>` already includes most of the C++ standard libraries. Including other libraries again is redundant and increases the compilation time. We will remove all the other headers.

2. The `bitset`, `queue`, `stack`, `map`, `set`, `iterator`, `cctype`, `bitset`, `climits`, `cstdio`, `cmath`, `cstring` and `cstdlib` headers are not used in the code, so we will remove these headers.

3. The `koto_memory(a)` macro is not used in the code so we will remove it.

4. The `bp` macro is not used in the code so we will remove it.

5. The `timer` macro is not used in the code so we will remove it.

6. The `deb(x)` macro is not used in the code so we will remove it.

7. The `mp` macro is not used in the code so we will remove it.

8. The `F` and `S` macros are not used in the code so we will remove it.

9. The `vvpii` type alias is not used in the code so we will remove it.

10. The `res(v)` macro is not used in the code so we will remove it.

11. The `total` variable is only used once, so we will use its calculation directly where it's used.

12. The `cap` variable is not used in the code so we will remove it.

13. The `ans` variable is re-initialized to `-inf` in each iteration of the loop `rep(k, 1, n)`. We will move its declaration to inside this loop.

14. There are two return statements in `main()`. We will remove the second one along with unused variables `xx` and `t`.

15. The `pos[N]` array is not used in the code so we will remove it.

Optimized program:

using namespace std;
const int N = 2e2 + 10;

  cin >> n;
  rep(i, 1, n) cin >> a[i] >> b[i];
  vvi dp(N * N, vi(N, -inf));
  dp[0][0] = 0;

    per(c, 100 * 100 + 10, 1) per(k, n, 1) if (c >= a[i]) {
      dp[c][k] = max(dp[c - a[i]][k - 1] + (long double)b[i], dp[c][k]);
    }
  }
  rep(k, 1, n) {
    long double ans = -inf;
    rep(c, 1, 100 * 100 + 10) ans =
        max(min(dp[c][k] + (accumulate(b+1, b+1+n, 0) - dp[c][k]) / 2.0L, (long double)c), ans);
    cout << fixed << setprecision(20) << ans << " ";
  }
