This program is already heavily optimized. However, there may be a few changes that could potentially improve its performance. Here's what we can do:

1. Remove `#define int long long`. This is because the `int` type is used only for loop counters and such, which are unlikely to exceed the limits of a 32-bit signed integer. Using a 64-bit integer type everywhere can slow down the program and increase its memory usage.

2. We can remove unnecessary macros such as `#define vi vector<int>` and `#define pii pair<int, int>` etc. as these are only used once or twice in the code and do not improve readability.

3. The `nCr` function is called only once, and it simply returns an element of the array `l`. So, we can remove this function and use `l[amb][u]` directly in the `solve` function.

4. The `initialize` function is called only once, so we can put its code directly in the `main` function.

5. In the `solve` function, a loop is used to count the number of `+` and `-` characters in the string `b`. We can combine this loop with the next loop which also iterates over `b`.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/detail/standard_policies.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
using namespace std;
using namespace __gnu_pbds;
#define fastio ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);
#define mod 1000000007
#define inf 1000000000000000
#define PI acos(-1.0)
#define endl "\n"
#define ordered_set tree<int, null_type, less<int>, rb_tree_tag, tree_order_statistics_node_update>

int l[1001][1001] = {};

int32_t main() {
  l[0][0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i < 1001; i++) {
    l[i][0] = 1;
    for (int j = 1; j < i + 1; j++) {
      l[i][j] = (l[i - 1][j - 1] + l[i - 1][j]);
    }
  }
  fastio cout << setprecision(15) << fixed;
  int t = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= t; i++) {
    string a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    double prob;
    int apos = 0;
    for (auto i : a) {
      apos += i == '+';
      apos -= i == '-';
    }
    int amb = 0, bpos = 0, r = 0;
    for (auto i : b) {
      amb += i == '?';
      r += i == '+';
      r -= i == '-';
    }
    int diff = apos - r;
    if (amb == 0 and diff == 0) {
      prob = 1;
      cout << prob << endl;
      continue;
    } else if (amb == 0 and diff != 0) {
      prob = 0;
      cout << prob << endl;
      continue;
    }
    int u = (amb + diff) / 2;
    int v = amb - u;
    if ((amb + diff) & 1 or (u < 0 or v < 0)) {
      prob = 0;
      cout << prob << endl;
      continue;
    }
    double q = pow(2, amb);
    double p = l[amb][u];
    prob = p / q;
    cout << prob << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
These changes should make the code slightly faster and use less memory. However, the performance gain will be minimal because the original code was already well-optimized.
