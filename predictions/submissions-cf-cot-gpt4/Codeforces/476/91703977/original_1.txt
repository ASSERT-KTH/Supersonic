The given code is a contest-style code. It's already optimized in terms of time complexity. However, it's a bit messy and can be optimized for readability and memory usage. Here's what we can do:

1. Remove unnecessary macros: The code has a lot of macros that are not used in the program. Removing them will make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

2. Avoid global variables: The array `l[1001][1001]` is a global variable. It's better to avoid global variables when they are not necessary. We will move it inside the `initialize()` function and pass as an argument to the `nCr()` function.

3. Avoid unnecessary heap allocations: In the `solve()` function, a string `b` is copied to check each character. Instead of copying the string, we can directly iterate over it.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations: In the `solve()` function, there are some unnecessary calculations. For example, `u`, `v`, `q`, `p`, and `prob` are calculated even if they are not needed. We will move these calculations inside the conditions where they are needed.

5. Avoid unnecessary memory use: `ld` (long double) is used for `prob` but double is enough for the precision required by this program. We will change `ld` to `double`.

6. Replace `#define` with `typedef`: `#define` is a preprocessor directive which replaces the macro with its value before the program compiles. `typedef` is a keyword which gives an alias to a data type. In this code, `#define` is used to create shortcuts for data types (`int`, `ll`, `ld`, etc.). This could be confusing because it hides the actual types. We will replace them with `typedef`.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

typedef int64_t ll;
typedef double ld;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef vector<pair<int, int>> vpii;
typedef unordered_set<int> uset;
typedef unordered_map<int, int> umap;

int nCr(vector<vector<int>>& l, int n, int r) { return l[n][r]; }

void solve() {
  string a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  double prob;
  int apos = 0;
  for (auto i : a) {
    apos += i == '+';
    apos -= i == '-';
  }
  int amb = 0;
  int r = 0;
  for (auto i : b) {
    amb += i == '?';
    r += i == '+';
    r -= i == '-';
  }
  int diff = apos - r;
  if (amb == 0 and diff == 0) {
    prob = 1;
    cout << prob << endl;
    return;
  } else if (amb == 0 and diff != 0) {
    prob = 0;
    cout << prob << endl;
    return;
  }
  int u = (amb + diff) / 2;
  int v = amb - u;
  if ((amb + diff) & 1 or (u < 0 or v < 0)) {
    prob = 0;
    cout << prob << endl;
    return;
  }
  double q = pow(2, amb);
  double p = nCr(amb, u);
  prob = p / q;
  cout << prob << endl;
}

void initialize(vector<vector<int>>& l) {
  l[0][0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i < 1001; i++) {
    l[i][0] = 1;
    for (int j = 1; j < i + 1; j++) {
      l[i][j] = (l[i - 1][j - 1] + l[i - 1][j]);
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  vector<vector<int>> l(1001, vector<int>(1001, 0));
  initialize(l);

  int t = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= t; i++) {
    solve();
  }

  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the `#pragma` directives, `fastio` macro and file redirections for input/output are removed in the optimized code as they are more relevant for contest-style coding and might not be needed in a general program.
