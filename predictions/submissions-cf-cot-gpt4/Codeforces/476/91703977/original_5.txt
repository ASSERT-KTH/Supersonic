This is a competitive programming problem solution. The code is already optimized for speed with fast I/O operations, usage of "Ofast" pragma directive to enable all optimization flags, and using precalculated binomial coefficients for combinations calculation. However, the code can be optimized for memory usage.

1. Use of global variables: The 2D array 'l' is declared globally and it is initialized with all zeros. This consumes a lot of memory that may not be used in its entirety. Declare 'l' inside the initialize function and return it. This way, 'l' is destroyed after the function call and the memory is freed.

2. Use of 'string' data type: String data types in C++ can consume more memory than character arrays. If the length of the string is known and won't change, use character arrays instead.

3. 'int' data type for loop variables: The variables 'i' and 'j' in loops are declared as long long int. However, the loop limits are less than 1001. Using smaller data types like 'int' or 'short' saves memory.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
void initialize(int l[1001][1001]) {
  l[0][0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i < 1001; i++) {
    l[i][0] = 1;
    for (int j = 1; j < i + 1; j++) {
      l[i][j] = (l[i - 1][j - 1] + l[i - 1][j]);
    }
  }
}

int nCr(int n, int r, int l[1001][1001]) { return l[n][r]; }

void solve() {
  char a[1001], b[1001];
  cin >> a >> b;
  //...rest of the code
}

int main() {
  int l[1001][1001] = {};
  initialize(l);
  //...rest of the code
}
```

Please note that the optimizations mentioned here may not result in significant improvements because modern computers have a large amount of RAM and the compiler may already do some of these optimizations. The actual impact on performance and memory usage will depend on the specific problem and input size.
