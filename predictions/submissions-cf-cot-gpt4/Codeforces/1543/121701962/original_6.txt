This program is already optimized in terms of logic and time complexity. However, we can make some minor changes to further optimize it:

1. `ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);` are used to untie C++'s cin and cout with C's stdin and stdout which makes the program faster. Sometimes, it can lead to unexpected behavior if the program also uses C-style I/O. If you are sure that your program does not use any C-style I/O, you can leave it there. Otherwise, it's safer to remove it.

2. Using an array `int a[n];` is not a good practice in C++. Instead, we can use `vector<int> a(n);` which is more efficient and safer.

3. The boolean variable `x` is used to check whether `sum` is divisible by `n`, but it is not necessary. We can directly check `if (sum % n == 0)` when needed. 

Here is the optimized version:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define fr first
#define sc second
#define rep(i, start, end) for (int i = start; i < end; i++)
#define repb(i, start, end) for (int i = start; i >= end; i--)
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
int gcd(int a, int b) { return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b); }

void solve() {
  int n, sum = 0;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    cin >> a[i];
    sum += a[i];
  }
  if (sum < n) {
    cout << sum * (n - sum) << endl;
  } else if (sum % n == 0) {
    cout << 0 << endl;
  } else {
    int x = sum % n;
    cout << x * (n - x) << endl;
  }
}

signed main() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```
