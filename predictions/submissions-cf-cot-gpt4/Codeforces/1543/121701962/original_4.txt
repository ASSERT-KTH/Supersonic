The program provided is a solution to a competitive programming problem, where basically the task is to find the sum of the array and if the sum is less than the size of the array the output is sum*(n-sum), if the sum is divisible by n the output is 0 and if not the output is x*(n-x) where x is the remainder of the division of sum by n.

The program is already fairly optimized but there are some minor improvements that can be done:

1. Unnecessary usage of macros: Macros like #define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end(), #define rall(x) (x).rbegin(), (x).rend() and #define fr first, #define sc second are defined but not used in the code. So, they can be removed which will decrease the compilation time.

2. Use of bool variable 'x': The bool variable 'x' is used to keep track of whether the sum is divisible by n or not. However, this is unnecessary as we can directly check this condition in the if statement itself. This saves the memory used by the boolean variable.

3. The use of long long int: The datatype 'long long int' is used which takes 8 bytes. If the input constraints are not too high, we can use 'int' instead of 'long long int' which takes only 4 bytes, thus reducing memory usage.

4. Redundant check of !x: There's a redundant check of !x after else if (x), which is unnecessary. If the code reaches else, it means that x is not true, so checking !x is redundant.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define vi vector<int>
#define pb push_back
#define ppb pop_back
#define rep(i, start, end) for (int i = start; i < end; i++)
#define repb(i, start, end) for (int i = start; i >= end; i--)
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
int gcd(int a, int b) { return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b); }
void solve() {
  int n, sum = 0;
  cin >> n;
  int a[n];
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    cin >> a[i];
    sum += a[i];
  }
  if (sum < n) {
    cout << sum * (n - sum) << endl;
  } else if (sum % n == 0) {
    cout << 0 << endl;
  } else {
    int x = sum % n;
    cout << x * (n - x) << endl;
  }
}
signed main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```
