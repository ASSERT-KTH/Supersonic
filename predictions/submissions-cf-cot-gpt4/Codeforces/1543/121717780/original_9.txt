First, let's analyze the code to understand where the possible bottlenecks are:

1. Recursion: The function getAns is using recursion to solve the problem which can be costly both in terms of time and space because it may compute the same sub-problem multiple times. A technique called "memoization" can help to optimize this by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur.

2. Initialization of 2D Array: In the main function, you're initializing the 2D array dp with -1. This is unnecessary if you're not using it anywhere in your code. If it's used somewhere else in your code, using memset function will be faster and more efficient because it uses low-level implementation which makes it faster.

3. Unnecessary Macros: The code has some macros defined but they are not used anywhere in the code. Removing them will make the code cleaner and more readable.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the code:

Step 1: Implement memoization in getAns function:

We'll use the 2D array dp to store the results of function calls. If the function is called again with the same parameters, we'll return the stored result instead of computing it again.

Step 2: Use memset to initialize the 2D array:

We'll replace the nested for loop with a call to memset function.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary macros:

We'll remove the unused macros from the code.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
double c, m, p, v;
double dp[1005][1005];
double eps = 1e-14;

double getAns(int cntC, int cntM, double c, double m, double p, double v) {
  if (c <= eps && m <= eps) {
    return (double)(cntC + cntM + 1);
  }
  
  // Check if the result is already computed
  if (dp[cntC][cntM] > -0.5) {
    return dp[cntC][cntM];
  }

  double temp = 0;
  if (c > eps && m > eps) {
    temp += c * getAns(cntC + 1, cntM, max(0.0, c - v), m + min(c / 2, v / 2),
                       p + min(c / 2, v / 2), v) +
            m * getAns(cntC, cntM + 1, c + min(m / 2, v / 2), max(0.0, m - v),
                       p + min(m / 2, v / 2), v) +
            (cntC + cntM + 1) * p;
  } else if (c > eps) {
    temp += c * getAns(cntC + 1, cntM, max(0.0, c - v), m, p + min(c, v), v) +
            (cntC + cntM + 1) * p;
  } else {
    temp += m * getAns(cntC, cntM + 1, c, m - v, p + min(m, v), v) +
            (cntC + cntM + 1) * p;
  }
  
  // Store the result
  dp[cntC][cntM] = temp;
  return temp;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> c >> m >> p >> v;
    // Initialize the dp array with -1
    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
    cout << setprecision(15) << getAns(0, 0, c, m, p, v) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces the number of function calls by storing and reusing the results of previous calls. It also optimizes the initialization of the 2D array and improves code readability by removing unused macros.
