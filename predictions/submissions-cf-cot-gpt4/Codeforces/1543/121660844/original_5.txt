The program is already quite optimized, but there are few things that could be improved.

1. We can get rid of the `#define` macros for `emplace_back`, `push_back`, `first`, `second`, and `__gcd` as they are not used in the program. This reduces memory usage slightly.

2. The function `prime()` is declared but not used in the program. So, we can remove it to save memory.

3. For the `pow()` function, it's better to use `unsigned long long` for `result` and `x` to prevent overflow.

After these modifications, the optimized program would look like this:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define fast ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;

unsigned long long pow(ll x, ll n) {
  unsigned long long result = 1;
  while (n != 0) {
    if ((n & 1) == 1) {
      result *= x;
      result %= mod;
    }
    x *= x;
    x %= mod;
    n >>= 1;
  }
  return result;
}

int main() {
  fast;
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  while (N--) {
    ll a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    if (a == 0 or b == 0) {
      cout << max(a, b) << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    if (a == b and a != 0) {
      cout << 0 << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    if (b > a)
      swap(a, b);
    cout << a - b << ' ' << min(a % (a - b), a - b - a % (a - b)) << '\n';
  }
}
```
Please, note that the `pow()` function is also not used in the program. If you're sure that it will not be used, you can remove it to save even more memory.
