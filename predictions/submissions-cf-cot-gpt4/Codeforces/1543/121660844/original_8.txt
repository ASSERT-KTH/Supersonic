The given C/C++ program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This includes a lot of unnecessary headers which increase the compile time. Instead, include only those libraries that are required in the code.

2. Remove unused macros: The `eb`, `pb`, `ff`, `ss`, `gcd` macros are not used in the program, so remove them to clean up the code.

3. Avoid using `ios::sync_with_stdio(0)` and `cin.tie(0)`: These two lines are used to speed up I/O operations, but in this program, there are not many I/O operations. So, these lines can be removed.

4. Use `constexpr` for constant expressions: `constexpr` tells the compiler to evaluate the expression at compile time rather than run time, which can speed up the program.

5. Make the `pow` function `inline`: The `pow` function is not used in the program, but if it were, making it `inline` would save the overhead of function calls. 

6. Optimize the `prime` function: The `prime` function is also not used in the program, but if it were, it could be optimized by checking for divisibility only up to the square root of `x`, and by incrementing `i` by 2 instead of 1 after checking for divisibility by 2.

Here is the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

constexpr int mod = 1e9 + 7;

inline int pow(long long x, long long n) {
  long long result = 1;
  while (n != 0) {
    if ((n & 1) == 1) {
      result *= x;
      result %= mod;
    }
    x *= x;
    x %= mod;
    n >>= 1;
  }
  return result;
}

int prime(int x) {
  int res = 0;
  if(x % 2 == 0) {
    while (x % 2 == 0) {
      x /= 2;
      res++;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= x; i += 2) {
    while (x % i == 0) {
      x /= i;
      res++;
    }
  }
  if (x > 2)
    res++;
  return res;
}

int main() {
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  while (N--) {
    long long a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    if (a == 0 or b == 0) {
      cout << max(a, b) << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    if (a == b and a != 0) {
      cout << 0 << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    if (b > a)
      swap(a, b);
    cout << a - b << ' ' << min(a % (a - b), a - b - a % (a - b)) << '\n';
  }
}
```
