Here are the optimization steps:

1. Use `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")` to enable all optimizations that do not require any trade-offs between speed and size, and that do not take a lot of compile time.

2. Remove the `ios::sync_with_stdio(0);` and `cin.tie(0);` lines. They disable the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams, which can lead to unpredictable results if both types of streams are used. There's no need to do this unless you're certain that your program would benefit from it.

3. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(nullptr)` instead of the removed lines. This decouples the C++ streams from their C counterparts, which can speed up input and output operations.

4. Remove the `fast` macro and place its contents in the `main` function where it is used. This makes the code easier to understand and reduces the amount of preprocessing done by the compiler.

5. Instead of using `std::endl`, use `'\n'`. `std::endl` incurs an unnecessary overhead because it forces a flush operation.

6. Declare the variables `a` and `b` outside the while loop. This prevents unnecessary construction and destruction of the variables on each iteration.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define eb emplace_back
#define pb push_back
#define ff first
#define ss second
#define gcd __gcd
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;

#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")

int pow(ll x, ll n) {
  ll result = 1;
  while (n != 0) {
    if ((n & 1) == 1) {
      result *= x;
      result %= mod;
    }
    x *= x;
    x %= mod;
    n >>= 1;
  }
  return result;
}

int prime(int x) {
  int res = 0, i;
  for (i = 2; i * i <= x; i++) {
    while (x % i == 0) {
      x /= i;
      res++;
    }
  }
  if (x > 1)
    res++;
  return res;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);

  int N;
  std::cin >> N;
  ll a, b;
  while (N--) {
    std::cin >> a >> b;
    if (a == 0 or b == 0) {
      std::cout << std::max(a, b) << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    if (a == b and a != 0) {
      std::cout << 0 << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    if (b > a)
      std::swap(a, b);
    std::cout << a - b << ' ' << std::min(a % (a - b), a - b - a % (a - b)) << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;` is discouraged in production code due to its impact on compile times and potential for name clashes.
