The optimization steps are:

1. The `#define fast` macro is used to speed up I/O operations. However, it makes the code less portable and does not always provide a significant performance boost. It can be removed.

2. The `pow` function is not used in the code and can be removed to save space.

3. The `prime` function is also not used in the code and can be removed to save space.

4. The `#define` macros are not used in the code and can be removed to save space.

5. Using `bits/stdc++.h` includes a lot of files which are not necessary for this program. Including only necessary headers will reduce compilation time and memory usage.

6. `or` and `and` are less common and have less support than `||` and `&&`. Replacing them can make the code more portable.

7. Using `'\n'` instead of `endl` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the buffer.

8. The `swap` function is not necessary here as the variables `a` and `b` are not used after the swap.

9. The calculation of `a % (a - b)` and `a - b - a % (a - b)` are repeated. Storing the results in a variable will optimize the performance.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  while (N--) {
    ll a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    if (a == 0 || b == 0) {
      cout << max(a, b) << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    if (a == b && a != 0) {
      cout << 0 << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    ll diff = a > b ? a - b : b - a;
    ll mod = a % diff;
    cout << diff << ' ' << min(mod, diff - mod) << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the above code, I have removed all unused macros and functions, included only the necessary headers, replaced `or` and `and` with `||` and `&&`, removed the unnecessary `swap` function, and stored the repeated calculations in variables.
