Here are some steps to optimize the code:

1. Use "std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)" and "std::cin.tie(NULL)" to speed up cin and cout.

2. The pow function does not make use of the binary exponentiation technique, which can significantly reduce the number of multiplications and hence improve the efficiency of the code.

3. The prime function is not invoked anywhere in the code. If it is not used, removing this function will save space.

4. The use of 'std::endl' can be replaced with '\n' for faster output, because 'std::endl' causes a flush operation which can slow down the output.

5. The macro definitions (#define) can be replaced with const or inline functions for type safety and better readability.

6. The use of "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" is discouraged because it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can slow down the compilation time. Include only the necessary headers.

7. The use of "using namespace std;" is avoided in large programs because it can lead to name conflicts.

8. The swap function can be avoided by using std::min and std::max functions while calculating the result.

The optimized code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

const int mod = 1e9 + 7;

long long fast_pow(long long x, long long n) {
  long long result = 1;
  while (n != 0) {
    if (n & 1) {
      result = (result * x) % mod;
    }
    x = (x * x) % mod;
    n >>= 1;
  }
  return result;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int N;
  std::cin >> N;
  while (N--) {
    long long a, b;
    std::cin >> a >> b;
    if (a == 0 || b == 0) {
      std::cout << std::max(a, b) << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    if (a == b && a != 0) {
      std::cout << 0 << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    long long diff = std::max(a, b) - std::min(a, b);
    std::cout << diff << ' ' << std::min(a % diff, diff - a % diff) << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: If the prime function is needed elsewhere in the code, it can be moved to a different file or modularized in a way that it doesn't need to be included in this file.
