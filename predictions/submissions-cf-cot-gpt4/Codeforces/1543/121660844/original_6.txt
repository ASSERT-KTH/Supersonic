This C/C++ program mainly consists of the pow and prime functions and the main function. It appears to be a solution for a competitive programming problem. It can be optimized for running time and memory usage in the following ways:

1. <bits/stdc++.h>: It's a header file in C++ which includes most of the libraries. It's not a good practice to include this header file because it increases the compilation time and it's not portable. So instead, we can include only the necessary libraries which are used in this program.

2. Avoiding Macros: Macros like #define ll long long and others could be replaced with typedef or using keywords which are more type-safe.

3. pow function: In this function, we can see x is multiplied with itself without any check which may lead to overflow, even though the result is taken modulo mod. We can add a check before multiplying x with itself.

4. prime function: This function is declared but never used in the whole program. So, this function can be removed to save memory.

5. Fast I/O: The use of fast I/O can provide a significant speedup in some cases, but it's not always necessary and can make your code harder to read and debug. If your program isn't I/O bound, then the fast I/O optimization won't provide any benefits and may be better off removed.

6. Redundant checks: There are redundant checks in the while loop of the main function. If a==0 or b==0, then it's also true that a==b and a!=0. So we can remove the check of a==0 or b==0.

After applying these optimizations, here is the optimized version of the program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;

int pow(ll x, ll n) {
  ll result = 1;
  while (n != 0) {
    if ((n & 1) == 1) {
      result *= x;
      result %= mod;
    }
    if (x <= mod / x) { 
      x *= x;
      x %= mod;
    }
    n >>= 1;
  }
  return result;
}

int main() {
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  while (N--) {
    ll a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    if (a == b and a != 0) {
      cout << 0 << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    if (b > a)
      swap(a, b);
    cout << a - b << ' ' << min(a % (a - b), a - b - a % (a - b)) << '\n';
  }
}
```
