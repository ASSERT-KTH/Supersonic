The given code is a C++ program, although it's written in a very C-like style. It appears to be performing some kind of string processing. 

Here are the steps to optimize the code:

1. Instead of executing "s[j + 1] ^ s[i]" twice in the while loop and the following line, we can calculate it once and save it in a variable to optimize the running time.

2. The for loop at the end of the program is calculating the integer division "(x / (x - f[x]) / k)" and "(x - 1) / (x - f[x]) / (k + 1)" twice for each iteration. We can calculate these values once and store them in variables to save computation time.

3. The code uses global variables, which is not a good practice and can lead to bugs and difficulties understanding the code. We should make the variables local to the main function.

4. Also, the import statement is incorrect, it should be "#include" and not "#import". 

Here is the optimized code:

```
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  char s[1000005];
  int f[1000005], n, k, i = 2, j, x = 1;
  scanf("%d%d%s", &n, &k, s + 1);
  while(i <= n) {
    int comp = s[j + 1] ^ s[i];
    while (j && comp)
      j = f[j];
    if(!comp)
      ++j;
    f[i++] = j;
  }
  while(x <= n) {
    int first = (x / (x - f[x]) / k);
    int second = ((x - 1) / (x - f[x]) / (k + 1));
    putchar((first > second) + 48);
    ++x;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized version of the code should execute faster as it avoids redundant computations. It also improves the readability by using local variables and correct include statement.
