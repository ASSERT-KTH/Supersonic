The original program reads a string and performs some computations on it. The first part computes prefix function and the second part prints results of some function. Here are some optimization steps:

1. The `main()` function should return an integer value. It's a good practice to return 0 to indicate successful termination of the program.

2. Instead of using the `putchar()` function to print the output, we can use `printf()`. It is because `putchar()` is slower than `printf()` as it prints one character at a time.

3. Avoid using `scanf()` and `printf()` for single values. Use them for multiple values to reduce I/O calls. This makes a huge impact on the speed.

4. The while loop can be optimized to avoid unnecessary iterations.

Here is the optimized code based on these points:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
char s[1000005];
int f[1000005], n, k, i = 2, j, x = 1;
int main() {
    scanf("%d%d%s", &n, &k, s + 1);
    while (i <= n) {
        if (s[j + 1] == s[i] || j == 0) {
            if (s[j + 1] == s[i])
                ++j;
            f[i++] = j;
        } else {
            j = f[j];
        }
    }
    for (; x <= n; ++x) {
        printf("%d", (((x / (x - f[x]) / k) > ((x - 1) / (x - f[x]) / (k + 1)))) + 48);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should run faster and use less memory than the original one. It makes it easier to maintain and debug by improving the readability and structure of the code.
