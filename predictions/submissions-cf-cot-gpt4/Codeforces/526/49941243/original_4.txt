The original code is performing a string pattern matching algorithm to find occurrences of a pattern in a string. It seems that some of the operations are redundant and can be optimized.

Here's the step-by-step optimization:

1. Optimize String Operations: The bitwise XOR operation on characters to compare them can be replaced by a simpler `!=` operator. This is more readable and won't affect performance.

2. Minimize Recomputation: `x - f[x]` is frequently computed in the loop. We can store the result in a variable to minimize recomputation.

3. Optimize Division Operations: Division is an expensive operation in terms of CPU cycles. If we can optimize the division operations, we'll get a significant speed boost. In this case, since we're just checking the relation between two divisions, we can cross-multiply to get rid of the divisions.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
char s[1000005];
int f[1000005], n, k, i = 2, j, x = 1;
int main() {
  scanf("%d%d%s", &n, &k, s + 1);
  while (i <= n) {
    while (j && s[j + 1] != s[i])
      j = f[j];
    if (s[j + 1] == s[i]) ++j;
    f[i++] = j;
  }
  for (; x <= n; ++x) {
    int diff = x - f[x];
    putchar((((x * (k + 1) > x * k * diff) > ((x - 1) * (k + 1) >= x * k * diff))) + 48);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized program, the bitwise XOR operations are replaced with `!=` and `==` operators for better readability. The `diff` variable is introduced to store the frequently computed `x - f[x]`. The division operations are replaced with multiplication operations to increase performance.
