The given C/C++ program is a string processing program. Here are the steps to optimize the program:

- The algorithm used in the program doesn't seem to have any obvious inefficiencies, so we won't be able to significantly improve its time complexity. The one thing we can do is to reduce the number of operations in the loop by combining the two conditions into a single if statement.
- We can also improve the readability of the code by replacing bitwise XOR with the not equals operator, which is more commonly used for comparison.
- The program uses global variables, which is not good practice. Although this won't improve performance, it's a good idea to move these into the main function to improve the quality of the code. However, based on how the question is worded, it seems this might not be allowed.
- The variable `i` is initialized to 2 outside the loop. It would be clearer to initialize it inside the loop.
- The `putchar` function is called with a complex expression as argument. We can break this expression down into simpler parts, and store the intermediate results in variables. This will improve readability, and might also improve performance by avoiding repeated calculation of the same subexpressions.

Here is the optimized code:

```
#import <cstdio>

int main() {
  char s[1000005];
  int f[1000005], n, k, j = 0, x = 1;

  scanf("%d%d%s", &n, &k, s + 1);

  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    while (j && s[j + 1] != s[i])
      j = f[j];

    if (s[j + 1] == s[i])
      j++;
    f[i] = j;
  }

  for (; x <= n; x++) {
    int a = x / (x - f[x]);
    int b = (x - 1) / (x - f[x]);
    putchar((a / k > b / (k + 1)) + 48);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this code is not completely optimized. The main time complexity comes from the loop and the while loop inside it. If we want to further optimize the code, we would need to use a more efficient algorithm. However, this would likely require a complete rewrite of the program, which goes against the instructions in the question.
