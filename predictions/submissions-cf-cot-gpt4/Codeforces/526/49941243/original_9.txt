The given C/C++ program is using the KMP (Knuth–Morris–Pratt) algorithm for pattern searching. The first loop constructs the failure function (f[] array), and the second loop prints the result based on a certain condition.

Optimization Steps:

1. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment: Pre-increment (++i) is generally faster in C++ than post-increment (i++) because post-increment involves a copy operation.

2. Remove unnecessary operations: The condition `(s[j + 1] ^ s[i]) || ++j;` is unnecessarily complex. It uses the XOR operation to compare characters and then increments j if they are equal. This can be simplified to a normal equality check.

3. Use bitwise operations for multiplication/division: Bitwise shift to the left (<<) and right (>>) can be used for multiplication and division by 2. But it looks like the division by `k` and `k + 1` is not a power of 2, so this optimization is not applicable here.

4. Optimize IO operations: The current program uses scanf and putchar for input and output, these can be optimized by using faster IO operations.

5. Use memset to initialize the array: Using memset is generally faster than a loop for initializing an array.

6. Avoid using global variables: Global variables are slower to access than local variables. The variables `n`, `k`, `i`, `j`, `x` can be declared inside the `main` function.

Now, let's implement these optimizations in code:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
    char s[1000005];
    int f[1000005];
    int n, k;
    scanf("%d%d%s", &n, &k, s + 1);
    memset(f, 0, sizeof(f));

    for (int i = 2, j = 0; i <= n;) {
        while (j && s[j + 1] != s[i])
            j = f[j];
        if(s[j + 1] == s[i])
            ++j;
        f[i++] = j;
    }

    for (int x = 1; x <= n; ++x)
        putchar((((x / (x - f[x]) / k) > ((x - 1) / (x - f[x]) / (k + 1)))) + 48);

    return 0;
}
```

This code is slightly optimized, but the core logic is still the same, which is the most important factor in terms of running time for this program.
