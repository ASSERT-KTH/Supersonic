Before we begin, note that the provided code is quite complex and includes a lot of macros and helper functions. Also, it is important to understand that the code is written in a competitive programming style, which usually favors compactness and speed of writing over readability and maintainability. 

Here are some steps to improve the code:

1. Remove unused functions: The code contains a lot of unused functions and macros. Removing them will make the code cleaner and slightly faster.

2. Avoid using `#define` for simple function-like tasks: It's better to use inline functions or constant variables for simple tasks.

3. Replace `#define` with `constexpr`: The `#define` directive is a source of common C++ problems. It's simple text substitution without regard to syntax. Using `constexpr` for constant expressions is usually better.

4. Avoid using `endl`: `endl` not only inserts a newline character, but it also flushes the output buffer, which can be an expensive operation. When you don't need to flush the buffer, use `'\n'` instead of `endl`.

5. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: This header file includes quite literally the kitchen sink of the standard library. It's not part of the C++ standard and it can significantly increase compilation times.

6. Avoid `using namespace std;`: This can lead to name clashes.

7. Combine declaration and initialization: The code declares a variable and then later assigns a value to it. Itâ€™s more efficient to combine the declaration and the assignment into a single statement.

8. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment: Pre-increment (++i) could be faster than post-increment (i++) in some cases because post-increment needs to create a copy of the original value.

9. Use `reserve()` for vectors if size is known: If you know the size of a vector beforehand, use the `reserve()` function to allocate the memory at once. This can avoid unnecessary re-allocations.

10. Avoid using `return 0;` at the end of main(): It's not necessary to use `return 0;` at the end of the `main()` function. The C++ standard guarantees that it will return 0 by default.
