The given C++ program already includes several performance optimizations using compiler directives (`#pragma GCC optimize(...)`) and the code has been structured to allow the compiler to automatically optimize it further. However, there are still a few improvements that can be made to optimize the program for both running time and memory usage:

1. **Avoid using `std::pow` function**: In the given program, the `std::pow` function is used to compute the power of 2. This function is expensive in terms of computational cost and can be replaced with a bit shift operation (`1 << 31`), which is faster and more efficient.

2. **Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`**: By default, cin and cout are synchronized with the standard C I/O streams. Disabling the synchronization can significantly speed up input/output operations.

3. **Avoid using `std::endl`**: `std::endl` not only inserts a newline character but also flushes the output stream buffer. This can cause unnecessary overhead, especially when printing a large amount of data. It's better to use `'\n'`.

4. **Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`**: `std::map` is a balanced binary tree with O(log n) time complexity for insertions, deletions and searches. `std::unordered_map` is a hash table with expected time complexity of O(1) for these operations. If the order of elements doesn't matter, `std::unordered_map` can be faster.

Here's the improved version of the program:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("O3")
#pragma GCC target("sse4")
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define int long long
#define mod 1000000007
#define yes cout << "YES" << '\n'
#define no cout << "NO" << '\n'
#define pb push_back
#define all(v) (v).begin(), (v).end()
#define read(a, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i]
#define print(a, n) for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) cout << a[i] << " "
#define RUN ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);
#define debug(output) cout << #output << "=" << output << '\n'
using namespace std;
signed main() {
  RUN;
  int test = 1;
  while (test--) {
    int n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;
    vector<int> value(n + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> value[i];
    unordered_map<int, int> mp;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      mp[value[i]]++;
    }
    while (q--) {
      int b;
      cin >> b;
      int sum = 0;
      int t = 1 << 31;
      for (; t >= 1; t = t / 2) {
        int l = min(mp[t], b / t);
        sum += l;
        b = b - (l * t);
      }
      if (b == 0)
        cout << sum << "\n";
      else
        cout << -1 << "\n";
    }
  }
}
```
