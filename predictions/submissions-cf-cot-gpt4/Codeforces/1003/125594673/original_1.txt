Your program seems to be considerably optimized already, but there are a few areas where it could be further improved.

1. **Remove unnecessary macros:** Macros like `yes`, `no`, `pb`, `all`, `read`, `print`, and `debug` are not used in this program. Removing these will slightly decrease the memory footprint of the program.

2. **Avoid unnecessary operations:** The `pow` function in the `while (q--)` loop is computationally expensive and can be replaced with a simple shift operation.

3. **Use array instead of vector:** If the size of the data structure is known beforehand and is not expected to change during runtime, using a simple array instead of a vector can reduce memory usage slightly and improve access time.

4. **Use unordered_map instead of map:** If the order of elements in the map is not important, using an unordered_map can reduce time complexity from O(logN) to O(1) on average for access/insertion/deletion operations.

5. **Remove unnecessary `#pragma GCC optimize`:** The `#pragma GCC optimize` directive is used to specify that GCC should use a specific level of optimization when compiling the program. However, having multiple of these directives can lead to confusion and possible conflicts. In this case, "Ofast" includes "O3", so "O3" can be safely removed.

Here is the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#pragma GCC target("sse4")
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define int long long
#define mod 1000000007
#define RUN                                                                    \
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);                                                     \
  cin.tie(0);                                                                  \
  cout.tie(0);
using namespace std;
signed main() {
  RUN;
  int test = 1;
  while (test--) {
    int n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;
    int value[n + 1];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> value[i];
    unordered_map<int, int> mp;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      mp[value[i]]++;
    }
    while (q--) {
      int b;
      cin >> b;
      int sum = 0;
      int t = 1 << 31;
      for (; t >= 1; t = t / 2) {
        int l = min(mp[t], b / t);
        sum += l;
        b = b - (l * t);
      }
      if (b == 0)
        cout << sum << "\n";
      else
        cout << -1 << "\n";
    }
  }
}
```

Remember, these optimizations are based on the current code and might not be applicable or beneficial depending on the actual inputs and problem constraints.
