The given C++ program is already well optimized in terms of running time and memory usage. However, we can make a few minor improvements:

1. Use 'const' for variables that are not modified, such as 'mod'. This can potentially help the compiler to make optimizations.

2. The 'pow' function in the C++ standard library is potentially inefficient because it works with floating-point numbers. Since we're working with integers and specifically powers of two, we can replace it with a bit shift operation, which is much faster.

3. We can avoid redundant computation by calculating 'b / t' only once.

Here's the optimized version of the original C++ program:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("O3")
#pragma GCC target("sse4")
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define int long long
const int mod = 1000000007;
#define yes cout << "YES" << endl
#define no cout << "NO" << endl
#define pb push_back
#define all(v) (v).begin(), (v).end()
#define read(a, n)                                                             \
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)                                                  \
  cin >> a[i]
#define print(a, n)                                                            \
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)                                                  \
  cout << a[i] << " "
#define RUN                                                                    \
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);                                                     \
  cin.tie(0);                                                                  \
  cout.tie(0);
#define debug(output) cout << #output << "=" << output << endl
using namespace std;
signed main() {
  RUN;
  int test = 1;
  while (test--) {
    int n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;
    vector<int> value(n + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> value[i];
    map<int, int> mp;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      mp[value[i]]++;
    }
    while (q--) {
      int b;
      cin >> b;
      int sum = 0;
      int t = 1 << 31;
      for (; t >= 1; t = t / 2) {
        int l = min(mp[t], b / t);
        b -= l * t;
        sum += l;
      }
      if (b == 0)
        cout << sum << "\n";
      else
        cout << -1 << "\n";
    }
  }
}
```

Please note that these optimizations are quite minor and may not result in noticeable performance improvements. The most significant part of the program's running time is likely the while loop, which has a time complexity of O(n), and this cannot be improved without changing the logic of the program.
