Firstly, we can remove all the unnecessary preprocessor directives at the beginning. They are not needed unless you are specifically targeting some architecture or want to enable specific optimization. The C++ compiler itself is quite good at optimizing the code.

Secondly, the macro `RUN` is a bit misleading as it is setting the synchronization of the standard streams off for faster I/O operations. This could be inlined directly in the `main` function.

Thirdly, the macro `read` is never used in the program, so we can remove it.

Fourthly, the macro `debug` is also never used in the program, so it can also be removed.

Lastly, the `map<int, int> mp;` can be replaced with `unordered_map<int, int> mp;` for faster operations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cmath>

#define int long long
#define mod 1000000007
#define yes cout << "YES" << endl
#define no cout << "NO" << endl
#define pb push_back
#define all(v) (v).begin(), (v).end()
#define print(a, n) for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) cout << a[i] << " "

using namespace std;

signed main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  int test = 1;
  while (test--) {
    int n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;
    vector<int> value(n + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> value[i];
    
    unordered_map<int, int> mp;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      mp[value[i]]++;
    }
    
    while (q--) {
      int b;
      cin >> b;
      int sum = 0;
      int t = pow(2, 31);
      for (; t >= 1; t = t / 2) {
        int l = min(mp[t], b / t);
        sum += l;
        b = b - (l * t);
      }
      if (b == 0)
        cout << sum << "\n";
      else
        cout << -1 << "\n";
    }
  }
}
```
