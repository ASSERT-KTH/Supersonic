There are a few optimizations that can be done in this C++ program:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes a lot of unnecessary headers that increase compilation time. It is better to include only the header files that are necessary.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: It's better to prefix std:: to the standard library functions to avoid naming conflicts.

3. Avoid using `#define`: It's better to use `const` or `inline` functions instead of `#define` for type safety.

4. Reduce the size of `dp` array: Currently, the `dp` array is initialized with size `n+1`. However, it seems that we are only using `n` elements. So, we can potentially reduce the size of the `dp` array to `n`.

5. Remove unnecessary macros: Some macros like `PI`, `EPS`, `MOD`, `INF`, `REP`, `FOR`, `DFOR`, `vb`, `E`, `MAXN` etc. are defined but not used in the program. Removing these macros will make the code cleaner and reduce memory usage.

6. Avoid unnecessary type conversions: The program checks `i % 2 == 0` and `i & 1`, both of which are used to check if `i` is even. We can remove these conversions and just use `i & 1` to check if `i` is even.

7. Use `std::max_element` to get the maximum element: Instead of using `max()` with initializer list, we can use `std::max_element()` to get the maximum element from the dp array.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<int> ar(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      std::cin >> ar[i];
    }
    std::vector<std::vector<long long>> dp(3, std::vector<long long>(n, 0));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      dp[0][i + 1] = dp[0][i] + (i & 1 ? 0 : ar[i]);
      if (i + 2 <= n)
        dp[1][i + 2] = std::max(dp[0][i], dp[1][i]) + ar[(i & 1) ? i + 1 : i];
      dp[2][i + 1] = std::max({dp[0][i], dp[1][i], dp[2][i], dp[2][i + 1]}) +
                     (i & 1 ? 0 : ar[i]);
    }
    auto max_val = std::max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
    std::cout << *max_val << std::endl;
  }
}
```

Note: The proposed program is assuming that the input provided is correct and does not include any error-checking code.
