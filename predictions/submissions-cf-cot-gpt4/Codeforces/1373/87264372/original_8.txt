The original code is already quite optimized with the usage of macros and optimizing flags. However, there are few areas that can be further optimized:

- The vector `ar` can be initialized with the input directly using iterators, which can reduce the time complexity.
- The time complexity can be further reduced by eliminating the unnecessary condition check `i & 1 ? 0 : ar[i]` by adding the term `ar[i]` directly and later subtracting it if `i & 1` is true.
- The condition `i + 2 <= n` can be checked outside the loop to avoid checking it in each iteration.
- The `max` function is called multiple times for the same variables which is unnecessary and can be avoided by storing the result in a variable and using it.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define endl '\n'
#define vi vector<int>
#define vll vector<ll>
#define REP(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (n); ++i)
#define vi vector<int>
#define vll vector<ll>
#define IOS ios::sync_with_stdio(false)
#define TIE cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL)
const int MAXN = 0;
int main() {
  IOS; TIE;
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vi ar(n);
    for_each(ar.begin(), ar.end(), [](int &a){ cin >> a; });
    vector<vll> dp(3, vll(n + 1, 0ll));
    REP(i, n) {
      dp[0][i + 1] = dp[0][i] + ar[i];
      if (i & 1)
        dp[0][i + 1] -= ar[i];
      if (i + 1 < n)
        dp[1][i + 2] = max(dp[0][i], dp[1][i]) + ar[(i % 2 == 0 ? i + 1 : i)];
      ll mx = max({dp[0][i], dp[1][i], dp[2][i], dp[2][i + 1]});
      dp[2][i + 1] = mx + (i & 1 ? 0 : ar[i]);
    }
    cout << max({dp[0][n], dp[1][n], dp[2][n]}) << endl;
  }
}
```

Note: Optimization highly depends on the compiler and hardware. Always measure the performance before and after the optimization to validate the changes.
