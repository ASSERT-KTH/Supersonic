Step 1: Remove unused definitions
First and foremost, there are many definitions in the program that are not used. Removing these will help both in terms of readability and possibly memory usage.

Step 2: Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`
Including `bits/stdc++.h` is generally not recommended as it includes all the standard libraries, which can make the compilation slow. It's better to include only the necessary libraries.

Step 3: Avoid using `using namespace std`
It is a bad practice to use the `std` namespace in a global scope. It might cause name collisions.

Step 4: Avoid macros for simple loops
Macros like `REP` and `FOR` make your code less readable. It's better to use simple `for` loops instead.

Step 5: Use more expressive names
Names like `dp`, `ar`, `n` are not very expressive. Use names that describe what the variable contains or what its purpose is.

Step 6: Use appropriate data types
Avoid using `long long` and `vector<long long>` when an `int` and `vector<int>` is sufficient.

Here's the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;
using std::max;

int main() {
  int test_cases;
  cin >> test_cases;
  while (test_cases--) {
    int array_size;
    cin >> array_size;
    vector<int> array(array_size);
    for (int i = 0; i < array_size; ++i) {
      cin >> array[i];
    }
    vector<vector<int>> dp(3, vector<int>(array_size + 1, 0));
    for (int i = 0; i < array_size; ++i) {
      dp[0][i + 1] = dp[0][i] + (i & 1 ? 0 : array[i]);
      if (i + 2 <= array_size)
        dp[1][i + 2] = max(dp[0][i], dp[1][i]) + array[(i % 2 == 0 ? i + 1 : i)];
      dp[2][i + 1] = max({dp[0][i], dp[1][i], dp[2][i], dp[2][i + 1]}) +
                     (i & 1 ? 0 : array[i]);
    }
    cout << max({dp[0][array_size], dp[1][array_size], dp[2][array_size]}) << endl;
  }
}
```

This version of the program is more readable and does not include unnecessary libraries or use unnecessary data types. It's important to note that these optimizations may not significantly improve the runtime or memory usage, but they will make the code better in terms of best programming practices.
