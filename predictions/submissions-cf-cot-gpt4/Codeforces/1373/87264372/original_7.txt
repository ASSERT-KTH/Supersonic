Before we start optimizing the program, let's make sure we understand what the original program is doing. This program seems to solve a dynamic programming problem. It reads an integer t which represents the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads an integer n and an array of n integers. It then constructs a 3 by (n+1) matrix dp and fills it with values that depend on the input array and the previously computed values in the matrix. Finally, it outputs the maximum value in the last column of the matrix.

Now to the optimizations:

1. Usage of "#include <bits/stdc++.h>": Although this header file includes most of the standard library in one go, it's not a standard header file and is not recommended for production code. It also increases the compilation time. We can include only the libraries that we need.

2. Unnecessary Macros and Definitions: The original program includes a large number of macros and definitions, but most of them are not used in the actual code. Removing these will make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

3. Input/Output Optimization: The program uses cin and cout for input/output, which are slower compared to scanf and printf. We can use scanf and printf for faster I/O.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<ll> vll;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    int t;
    scanf("%d", &t);
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        scanf("%d", &n);
        vi ar(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            scanf("%d", &ar[i]);
        }
        vector<vll> dp(3, vll(n + 1, 0ll));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            dp[0][i + 1] = dp[0][i] + (i & 1 ? 0 : ar[i]);
            if (i + 2 <= n)
                dp[1][i + 2] = max(dp[0][i], dp[1][i]) + ar[(i % 2 == 0 ? i + 1 : i)];
            dp[2][i + 1] = max({dp[0][i], dp[1][i], dp[2][i], dp[2][i + 1]}) + (i & 1 ? 0 : ar[i]);
        }
        printf("%lld\n", max({dp[0][n], dp[1][n], dp[2][n]}));
    }
}
```

Note: While the input/output optimization using scanf and printf instead of cin and cout can provide a speedup in some situations, this may not always be the case, and it depends on the specific problem and environment.
