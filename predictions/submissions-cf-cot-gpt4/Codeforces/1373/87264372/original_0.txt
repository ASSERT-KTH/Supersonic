The program reads an integer t which represents the number of test cases. Each test case is an array of integers. The size of the array is read from the input. After that, the program calculates the cumulative sum of every other element starting from the first one, the maximum sum of every other element starting from the second one, and the maximum sum of the cumulative sum and the maximum sum previously calculated. The maximum of these three sums is printed.

There are several optimizations that can be applied:

1. Removing unnecessary #define Macros: The macros are not used in the code and hence can be removed. Examples are #define PI, #define MOD, #define EPS, etc. Also, the macro #define REP(i, n) is used only once, so it can be replaced with the loop directly. The macro #define all(a) is not used and should be removed.

2. Reducing Memory Usage: The dp array is allocated with a size of n+1 but the maximum index used is n. So the size can be reduced to n. Also, the array dp[1] is not used, so it can be removed.

3. Optimizing Input and Output: The iostream functions are usually slower than the C-style input-output functions. So, replace cin and cout with scanf and printf respectively. 

4. Avoiding the use of std namespace: The using namespace std statement can cause name collisions if the program is combined with other code or libraries, so it's better to avoid it.

The optimized program with the above points is shown below:

```C++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    std::vector<int> ar(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
        scanf("%d", &ar[i]); 
    }
    std::vector<std::vector<ll>> dp(2, std::vector<ll>(n, 0ll));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      dp[0][i] = dp[0][i - 1] + (i & 1 ? 0 : ar[i]);
      if (i + 1 < n)
        dp[1][i + 1] = std::max(dp[0][i - 1], dp[1][i - 1]) + ar[i];
      dp[1][i] = std::max({dp[0][i], dp[1][i - 1], dp[1][i]});
    }
    printf("%lld\n", std::max({dp[0][n - 1], dp[1][n - 1]}));
  }
}
```
