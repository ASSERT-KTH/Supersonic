The given code seems to be already optimized in terms of loop unrolling, macro usage, and compiler directives. But we can do some small changes to make it more efficient:

1. Constants like PI, EPS, INF, MOD, etc. are not used in the whole code, so we can remove these constants to reduce memory usage.

2. The `vector<pair<int, int>>` and `vector<pair<ll, ll>>` are not used in the code, so we can remove these lines to reduce memory usage.

3. The `#define getchar getchar_unlocked` and `#define putchar putchar_unlocked` are not used in the code, so we can remove these macros to reduce the program size.

4. The code has defined some macros like `F`, `S`, `mp`, etc. which are not used in the code. So, we can remove these as well.

5. The code has defined some datatypes like `deque<int>`, `deque<ll>`, `queue<int>`, `priority_queue`, etc. which are not used in the code. So, we can remove these as well.

6. The `const int MAXN = 0;` is not used in the code, so we can remove this line to reduce memory usage.

7. The use of `std::endl` can be replaced by `'\n'` to speed up the output operation. `std::endl` is slower because it forces a flush operation on output, which isn't necessary here.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define REP(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (n); ++i)
#define all(a) a.begin(), a.end()
typedef long long ll;
#define vi vector<int>
#define vll vector<ll>
#define pb push_back
#define vb vector<bool>

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vi ar(n);
    REP(i, n) { cin >> ar[i]; }
    vector<vll> dp(3, vll(n + 1, 0ll));
    REP(i, n) {
      dp[0][i + 1] = dp[0][i] + (i & 1 ? 0 : ar[i]);
      if (i + 2 <= n)
        dp[1][i + 2] = max(dp[0][i], dp[1][i]) + ar[(i % 2 == 0 ? i + 1 : i)];
      dp[2][i + 1] = max({dp[0][i], dp[1][i], dp[2][i], dp[2][i + 1]}) +
                     (i & 1 ? 0 : ar[i]);
    }
    cout << max({dp[0][n], dp[1][n], dp[2][n]}) << '\n';
  }
}
```
