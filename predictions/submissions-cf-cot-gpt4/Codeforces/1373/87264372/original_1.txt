The given C++ program seems to be well-optimized in terms of algorithm. It is using dynamic programming to solve a problem. However, there are still a few small modifications that can be made to optimize it further. 

1. Use of `#include<bits/stdc++.h>`: This is a non-standard header file and including it will include a lot of unnecessary and unused libraries which will increase the compilation time. Therefore, include only the necessary header files.

2. Use of `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")` and `#pragma GCC target("sse,sse2,sse3,ssse3,sse4,popcnt,abm,mmx,avx,tune=native")`: These directives are used to indicate the compiler to optimize the code for specific architecture which may not be available on all systems. Therefore, it's better to remove it.

3. Use of `using namespace std`: It's a bad practice because it can lead to name conflicts.

4. Use of `typedef`: In modern C++, `using` is preferred over `typedef` for type aliasing.

5. Unnecessary macros: Some of the macros in the code are not used. Removing them will make the code cleaner.

6. Use of `getchar` and `putchar`: These can be replaced with `cin` and `cout` for better readability.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;
using std::max;
using std::pair;
using ll = long long;
using vi = vector<int>;
using vll = vector<ll>;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);                                                              
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vi ar(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { cin >> ar[i]; }
    vector<vll> dp(3, vll(n + 1, 0ll));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      dp[0][i + 1] = dp[0][i] + (i & 1 ? 0 : ar[i]);
      if (i + 2 <= n)
        dp[1][i + 2] = max(dp[0][i], dp[1][i]) + ar[(i % 2 == 0 ? i + 1 : i)];
      dp[2][i + 1] = max({dp[0][i], dp[1][i], dp[2][i], dp[2][i + 1]}) +
                     (i & 1 ? 0 : ar[i]);
    }
    cout << max({dp[0][n], dp[1][n], dp[2][n]}) << endl;
  }
}
```
