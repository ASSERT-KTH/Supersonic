This C++ code is a simple depth-first search (DFS) solution for checking if there are two different paths in a grid maze from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. The DFS function checks if it can reach the destination by going either down or right.

Optimization steps:

1. We can optimize the DFS function by removing the unnecessary check `if (x || y)` before setting `vis[x * m + y] = 1`. The condition `if (x || y)` is to avoid setting `vis[0] = 1` in the first call of DFS. But we can remove this check by directly setting `vis[0] = 0` before the first call of DFS.

2. The `vis[maxn]` array is unnecessarily large (10^6 + 5) and it's a global variable, which is not a good practice. Since it's only used in the DFS function, we can move it into the DFS function and make it a static local variable. This way, we can reduce the size of `vis` to `n*m` which is the actual size needed. Static local variables in C++ have a lifespan of the entire program but they are only visible within the scope of the function, which can save memory when the function is not being called.

3. The `q` queue is declared but never used in the code, we can remove it.

4. `#include <stdio.h>` is not needed because the program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output. We can remove it.

5. `using namespace std;` is generally considered bad practice because it can lead to name conflicts. We can remove it and use `std::` prefix where needed.

The optimized code would be:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#define ll long long
typedef std::pair<int, int> pii;
const int maxn = 1e6 + 5;
int n, m, ans;
std::string mz[maxn];
bool dfs(int x, int y) {
  static std::vector<bool> vis(n * m, false);
  if (x >= n || y >= m || mz[x][y] == '#' || vis[x * m + y])
    return false;
  if (x == n - 1 && y == m - 1)
    return true;
  vis[x * m + y] = 1;
  return dfs(x + 1, y) || dfs(x, y + 1);
}
int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> mz[i];
  }
  vis[0] = 0;
  if (!dfs(0, 0))
    std::cout << 0;
  else {
    vis[0] = 0;
    if (!dfs(0, 0))
      std::cout << 1;
    else
      std::cout << 2;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the optimization for memory usage might not be significant in this case because the size of `vis` is determined by the input size, but it's a good practice to allocate only the memory that is needed.
