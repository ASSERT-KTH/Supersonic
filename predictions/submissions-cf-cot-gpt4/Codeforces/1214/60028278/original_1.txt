The provided code is a C++ program that reads a maze from the input and attempts to find a path from the start (0,0) to the end (n-1, m-1) using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. If it can find 2 disjoint paths, it prints "2". If it can only find 1 path, it prints "1". If it can't find any path, it prints "0". 

Optimizations can be done in terms of running time and memory usage.

1. Running Time: The program applies DFS twice to find out the number of disjoint paths. This can be optimized by using a DFS with backtracking and counting the number of paths during one run.

2. Memory Usage: The program uses a boolean visited array "vis" of size `maxn` (1e6 + 5) which is quite large. We can reduce the memory usage by using an unordered_map instead of a boolean array which will only store the cells that have been visited. 

3. Code Optimization: The `#include <stdio.h>` is not needed because we are using `<iostream>` for input and output. Also, the `#define ll long long` is not used in the code, so it can be removed.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef pair<int, int> pii;
const int maxn = 1e6 + 5;
int n, m;
string mz[maxn];
unordered_map<int, bool> vis;
int paths = 0;

void dfs(int x, int y) {
  if (x >= n || y >= m || mz[x][y] == '#' || vis[x * m + y])
    return;
  if (x == n - 1 && y == m - 1) {
    paths++;
    return;
  }
  vis[x * m + y] = 1;
  dfs(x + 1, y);
  dfs(x, y + 1);
  vis[x * m + y] = 0; // Backtracking
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> mz[i];
  }
  dfs(0, 0);
  cout << min(paths, 2);
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program reduces the running time by only applying DFS once and reduces the memory usage by using an unordered_map instead of a boolean array. It also removes unnecessary include statements and defines. The `min(paths, 2)` is used to ensure that the output is always 0, 1, or 2, even if there are more than 2 paths.
