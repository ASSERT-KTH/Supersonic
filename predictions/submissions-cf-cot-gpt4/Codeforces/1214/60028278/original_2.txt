Before starting with the optimization, let's breakdown the code:

1. The code is a C++ program that performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) on a 2D grid/maze.
2. The DFS starts from the top left corner (0,0) and tries to reach the bottom right corner (n-1, m-1).
3. DFS is performed twice. If the destination is reached both times, the program outputs '2'. If it's reached only once, it outputs '1', and if it's not reached at all, it outputs '0'.

Now, let's look at a few optimization steps:

1. Converting DFS to BFS: DFS uses a stack (recursion stack in this case) and can lead to a stack overflow in the worst-case scenario. BFS uses a queue and is safer in this regard. BFS can also find the shortest path more efficiently, although it's not required here.

2. Reducing memory usage: 'vis' array's size is maxn which is 10^6+5, but it only needs to be of size 'n*m'. This can help in saving memory.

3. Avoiding unnecessary operations: In DFS, the condition 'if (x || y) vis[x * m + y] = 1;' is only false for the starting cell. We can remove this condition and set 'vis[0* m + 0] = 1' before DFS.

4. Merging if-else conditions: The main function's if-else conditions can be merged to avoid repeated DFS calls.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
int n, m, ans;
string mz[1005];
queue<pii> q;
bool vis[1005][1005];

bool bfs(int x, int y) {
  if(mz[0][0] == '#') return false;
  memset(vis, false, sizeof(vis));
  q.push({x, y});
  vis[x][y] = true;
  while (!q.empty()) {
    pii p = q.front();
    q.pop();
    if (p.first == n - 1 && p.second == m - 1) return true;
    if (p.first + 1 < n && mz[p.first + 1][p.second] != '#' && !vis[p.first + 1][p.second]) {
      q.push({p.first + 1, p.second});
      vis[p.first + 1][p.second] = true;
    }
    if (p.second + 1 < m && mz[p.first][p.second + 1] != '#' && !vis[p.first][p.second + 1]) {
      q.push({p.first, p.second + 1});
      vis[p.first][p.second + 1] = true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
int main() {
  cin.sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> mz[i];
  }
  int cnt = bfs(0, 0) + bfs(0, 0);
  cout << cnt;
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that this code assumes that the maximum value of 'n' and 'm' is less than or equal to 1000 (which is a common limit in competitive programming). If 'n' and 'm' can be larger, you would need to increase the sizes of 'mz' and 'vis' accordingly.
