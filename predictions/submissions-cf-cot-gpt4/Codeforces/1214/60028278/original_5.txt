The given C/C++ program appears to be a maze solver. It uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to find a path through the maze from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. 

Here are some possible optimizations:

1. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` instead of `cin.sync_with_stdio(false);` for better I/O performance. The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` command helps to untie C++'s `cin`/`cout` streams from the C `scanf`/`printf` functions, which can improve I/O performance.
2. Remove unused libraries, such as `<algorithm>`, `<map>`, and `<queue>`. This won't affect the running time, but it does make the code cleaner and slightly reduces the compilation time.
3. In the `dfs` function, the `vis` array is indexed with `x * m + y`. It's better to change the `vis` array to a two-dimensional array `vis[maxn][maxn]` to avoid multiplication in each call.
4. Remove the unused `q` queue and `ans` integer to save memory.

Here is the optimized program:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
const int maxn = 1e6 + 5;
int n, m;
string mz[maxn];
bool vis[maxn][maxn];
bool dfs(int x, int y) {
  if (x >= n || y >= m || mz[x][y] == '#' || vis[x][y])
    return false;
  if (x == n - 1 && y == m - 1)
    return true;
  if (x || y)
    vis[x][y] = 1;
  return dfs(x + 1, y) || dfs(x, y + 1);
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> mz[i];
  }
  if (!dfs(0, 0))
    cout << 0;
  else {
    vis[0][0] = 0;
    if (!dfs(0, 0))
      cout << 1;
    else
      cout << 2;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: In terms of running time, the biggest improvement could be achieved by changing the DFS algorithm to Breadth-First Search (BFS) or A* algorithm, but it was specified not to completely rewrite the program. Also, consider that recursion may lead to stack overflow for large inputs. In real-world problems, iterative DFS or BFS would be a better choice.
