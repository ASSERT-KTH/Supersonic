Optimization Steps:

1. The program is already quite well optimized, however, there are a few minor changes that we can make.
2. First, instead of using `#define` for constants, we can use `const` keyword. The reason is the `#define` is a preprocessor directive, which means it's not a part of C++, while `const` is a part of the language. This makes `const` safer and more flexible.
3. We should avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because this header file includes quite a lot of headers, many of which might not be used in the actual program. This can slow down the compilation process and increase the binary size.
4. We can remove the `garou99` macro and put its content directly in the main function. This improves readability and avoids unnecessary macro.
5. We can move the `int x` declaration outside of the inner loop. This way, we avoid unnecessary stack allocations and deallocations on each iteration.
6. We can optimize the condition `if (ne & 1 and (ne + o) & 1)` to `if (ne & 1)`. This is because `(ne + o) & 1` will always be `ne & 1`. This is because `o` is always even (it counts zeros), so `(ne + o) & 1` is equal to `ne & 1`, hence the condition can be simplified.

Optimized Program:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

const ll mod = 1e9 + 7;
const ll inf = 1e18;

ll pow(ll p, ll r, ll m) {
  ll ans = 1;
  while (r > 0) {
    if (r & 1) {
      ans = ((ans % m) * (p % m)) % m;
    }
    r = r >> 1;
    p = ((p % m) * (p % m)) % m;
  }
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif

  int T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    ll n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    ll ne = 0, ans = 0, mn = LLONG_MAX, o = 0;
    ll x;
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (ll j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        cin >> x;
        if (x < 0)
          x *= -1, ne++;
        if (x <= 0)
          o++;
        mn = min(mn, x);
        ans += x;
      }
    }
    if (ne & 1)
      cout << ans - 2 * mn;
    else
      cout << ans;
    cout << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
