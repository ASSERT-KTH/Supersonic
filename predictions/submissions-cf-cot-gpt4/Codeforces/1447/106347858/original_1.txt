This program is already quite well optimized, but there are still a few small changes that could be made to slightly improve its efficiency.

1. Avoiding Unnecessary Modulo Operation: In the 'pow' function, 'p' and 'ans' are being modded by 'm' twice in every iteration of the loop. This is unnecessary because the product of two numbers that are less than 'm' will also be less than m^2, so it will not overflow 'int'. We can reduce this to only once per loop iteration.

2. Avoiding to Multiply by -1: In the main function, 'x' is multiplied by -1 every time it is less than 0. This is unnecessary because we can directly subtract 'x' from 'ans' instead of adding.

3. Avoiding to Check the Same Condition Multiple Times: In the main function, the program checks if 'ne' and 'ne + o' are odd twice. We can store this information in a boolean variable to make the program more efficient.

4. Removing unnecessary macro 'garou99': It's not a good practice to use macros for such purposes. It would be more efficient and cleaner to place its contents directly in the main function.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define int long long
#define rep(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < b; i++)
#define mod 1e9 + 7
#define inf 1e18
using namespace std;

int pow(int p, int r, int m) {
  int ans = 1;
  while (r > 0) {
    if (r & 1) {
      ans = (ans * p) % m;
    }
    r = r >> 1;
    p = (p * p) % m;
  }
  return ans;
}

int32_t main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    int ne = 0, ans = 0, mn = INT_MAX, o = 0;
    rep(i, 0, n) {
      rep(j, 0, m) {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        if (x < 0) {
          ne++;
          ans -= x;
        } else {
          ans += x;
          if (x == 0) o++;
        }
        mn = min(mn, abs(x));
      }
    }
    bool isOdd = (ne & 1) && ((ne + o) & 1);
    if (isOdd) ans -= 2 * mn;
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
}
```
