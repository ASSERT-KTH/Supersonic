Here are the optimization steps:

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is generally considered bad practice as it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, increasing the compile time. Instead, I will include only necessary libraries.

2. The `#define int long long` is used to shorten the typing, but it can lead to confusion and bugs. It's better to use `typedef` instead.

3. The `pow` function is not used in the program, so it can be removed.

4. The `garou99` macro is not necessary and makes the code hard to read. The statements it contains could be placed in the main function instead.

5. The `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` block is also unnecessary for the program to function correctly, so it can be removed.

6. It's better to use `std::endl` instead of `'\n'` as the latter does not flush the output buffer.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

typedef long long ll;

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  ll T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    ll n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    ll ne = 0, ans = 0, mn = INT_MAX, o = 0;
    for(ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for(ll j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        ll x;
        cin >> x;
        if (x < 0)
          x *= -1, ne++;
        if (x <= 0)
          o++;
        mn = min(mn, x);
        ans += x;
      }
    }
    if (ne & 1 and (ne + o) & 1)
      cout << ans - 2 * mn << endl;
    else
      cout << ans << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version is more readable and efficient regarding compile time. Notice that the main logic of the program remains unchanged.
