There are several optimizations that can be done in this code:

1. I/O operations: The cin and cout operations are time-consuming. Instead of using cin and cout, we can use faster I/O operations like getchar_unlocked(), putchar_unlocked(), or fscanf() and fprintf().

2. Modulo operation: The modulo operation is computationally expensive. In the given code, the modulo operation is used inside the loop, which makes it even more expensive. We can use a trick that ((a % m) * (b % m)) % m = ((a * b) % m), to reduce the number of modulo operations.

3. Use of std::min: The std::min is used inside a nested loop which can be expensive. We can use a simple if condition to replace it.

4. Use of bitwise operator: The use of bitwise operator for checking if a number is odd or even may seem clever but it is usually slower than directly using the modulus operator. This is because modern CPUs are optimized for arithmetic and logic operations, and can perform modulus operation faster than bitwise operations.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the code. Here is the optimized version of the given code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define int long long
#define rep(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < b; i++)
#define mod 1e9 + 7
#define inf 1e18
#define garou99 ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);
using namespace std;

int pow(int p, int r, int m) {
  int ans = 1;
  while (r > 0) {
    if (r & 1) {
      ans = (ans * p) % m;
    }
    r = r >> 1;
    p = (p * p) % m;
  }
  return ans;
}

int32_t main() {
  garou99;
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int T;
  scanf("%lld", &T);
  while (T--) {
    int n, m;
    scanf("%lld %lld", &n, &m);
    int ne = 0, ans = 0, mn = INT_MAX, o = 0;
    rep(i, 0, n) {
      rep(j, 0, m) {
        int x;
        scanf("%lld", &x);
        if (x < 0)
          x = -x, ne++;
        if (x == 0)
          o++;
        if (x < mn)
          mn = x;
        ans += x;
      }
    }
    if ((ne % 2 == 1) && ((ne + o) % 2 == 1))
      printf("%lld\n", ans - 2 * mn);
    else
      printf("%lld\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
