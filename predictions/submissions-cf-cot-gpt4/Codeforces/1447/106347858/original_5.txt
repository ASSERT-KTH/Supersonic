Sure, here are some minor optimizations that we can apply to this code.

1. Instead of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, include only the libraries that are actually used. This reduces the load time of the program. Here we only need `iostream` and `cmath`.

2. Avoid using `#define int long long`. It's better to be explicit about types. It could lead to bugs that are hard to debug.

3. Use `constexpr` instead of `#define` for constants like `mod` and `inf`. `constexpr` is type safe.

4. The function `pow()` is not used in this program. So we can remove it.

5. The macro `garou99` is not needed and can be removed. `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(NULL);` can be put in the main function.

6. `rep` macro can be replaced with a range-based for loop or traditional for loop.

7. The line `x *= -1, ne++;` is confusing. It's better to use separate lines for readability.

8. `mn = min(mn, x);` is executed even if `x` is less than or equal to 0. We can avoid it by checking if `x` is greater than 0.

9. `cout << '\n';` can be replaced with `std::endl` for more clarity.

Here is the optimized version of the program.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    long long ne = 0, ans = 0, mn = LLONG_MAX, o = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
        long long x;
        cin >> x;
        if (x < 0) {
          x *= -1;
          ++ne;
        }
        if (x <= 0) {
          ++o;
        } else {
          mn = min(mn, x);
        }
        ans += x;
      }
    }
    if (ne & 1 and (ne + o) & 1)
      cout << ans - 2 * mn << endl;
    else
      cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program is more readable, and should run slightly faster and use less memory. The main performance gain is from avoiding unnecessary computations and improving readability.
