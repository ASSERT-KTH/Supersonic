Here are some optimization strategies:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because this header file includes a large number of standard library files, which increases the compilation time. Instead, include only necessary header files, such as `#include <iostream>`, `#include <algorithm>`, `#include <climits>`.
2. Avoid using `#define int long long` because it may lead to confusion. It's better to explicitly state the data type.
3. Remove the `garou99;` line and explicitly write `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` in the main function. It's clearer this way and it will improve the input/output speed of cin/cout.
4. The `pow` function is defined but never used in the program, so it should be removed to save memory.
5. IO operations (cin and cout) are costly. Use them as less as possible. In this context, 'ans' and 'mn' are only updated inside the loop while 'ne' and 'o' are updated for each element. We can move the condition to update 'ans' and 'mn' outside the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif

  long long T;
  cin >> T;

  while (T--) {
    long long n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    long long ne = 0, ans = 0, mn = INT_MAX, o = 0;

    for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (long long j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        long long x;
        cin >> x;

        if (x < 0) {
          x *= -1;
          ne++;
        }
        if (x <= 0) {
          o++;
        }
        mn = min(mn, x);
        ans += x;
      }
    }

    if ((ne & 1) && ((ne + o) & 1)) {
      ans -= 2 * mn;
    }
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized version, the `pow` function, which was never used, has been removed. The macros have been replaced with their actual code to improve readability. The unused `mod` and `inf` macros have been removed as well. Only necessary headers are included. The condition to update 'ans' and 'mn' is moved outside the loop to reduce the number of IO operations.
