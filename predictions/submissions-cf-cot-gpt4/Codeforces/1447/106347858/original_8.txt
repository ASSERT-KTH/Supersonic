The given code is already quite optimized, but a few small improvements can be made:

1. Avoid IO Synchronization: By default, C++ synchronizes the standard C++ streams with their C counterparts. This means that you can freely mix calls to functions like printf and cout in the same program and the output will be as expected. However, this synchronization comes with a performance cost. You can avoid this cost by adding 'std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);' at the beginning of your main function. But be aware, if you disable synchronization, you must avoid mixing calls to functions from <cstdio> and <iostream>.

2. Fast Input/Output: C++ input/output can be slow. You can speed it up by avoiding synchronization with C libraries and untying cin from cout.

3. Avoid Multiplication: In the pow function, the expression ((ans % m) * (p % m)) % m can be simplified to (ans * p) % m. This avoids two unnecessary mod operations.

4. Use bit manipulation: Bit manipulation is faster than arithmetic operations. In the pow function, instead of dividing r by 2 (r = r >> 1), you can shift r one bit to the right (r >>= 1). This is faster than the division operation.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define int long long
#define rep(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < b; i++)
#define mod 1e9 + 7
#define inf 1e18
using namespace std;
int pow(int p, int r, int m) {
  int ans = 1;
  while (r > 0) {
    if (r & 1) {
      ans = (ans * p) % m;
    }
    r >>= 1;
    p = (p * p) % m;
  }
  return ans;
}
int32_t main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    int ne = 0, ans = 0, mn = INT_MAX, o = 0;
    rep(i, 0, n) {
      rep(j, 0, m) {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        if (x < 0)
          x *= -1, ne++;
        if (x <= 0)
          o++;
        mn = min(mn, x);
        ans += x;
      }
    }
    if (ne & 1 and (ne + o) & 1)
      cout << ans - 2 * mn;
    else
      cout << ans;
    cout << '\n';
  }
}
```
