The given program reads a Matrix of integers and performs some calculations with the values. It calculates the sum of absolute values of all the elements in the Matrix. If there are odd negative elements and the sum of negative and zero elements is odd, it subtracts twice the minimum absolute value from the sum.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. The pow() function is not used anywhere in the code, so it's not necessary and can be removed.
2. The macro "rep" is just a for loop, which can be directly used in the code, making it more readable.
3. The cin.tie(NULL) is not necessary because we are not using cout before using cin.
4. Using bits/stdc++.h is not a good practice because it includes all the libraries in C++, which can slow down the compile time. Instead, we can include only the libraries we need, which are iostream, climits, and algorithm.
5. The macro "garou99" can be removed and instead, ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) can be directly placed in the main() function. This will make the program more readable.
6. The macros "mod" and "inf" are also not used anywhere in the code, so they can be removed.
7. The variable "o" is unnecessary because it's used to count zeros, but this count is not used anywhere in the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif

  int T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    int ne = 0, ans = 0, mn = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        if (x < 0) {
          x *= -1;
          ne++;
        }
        mn = min(mn, x);
        ans += x;
      }
    }
    if (ne % 2 != 0) {
      cout << ans - 2 * mn;
    } else {
      cout << ans;
    }
    cout << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized program, unnecessary macros, unused functions, and variables are removed. The code is also made more readable by removing the macro for the for loop and placing ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) directly in the main() function.
