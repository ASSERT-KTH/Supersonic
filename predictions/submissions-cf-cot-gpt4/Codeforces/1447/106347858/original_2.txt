The given code is already quite optimized in terms of algorithmic complexity. However, there are a few changes that can be made to potentially improve performance and memory usage.

1. Pre-calculation: The modulus operation in the pow function can be expensive. We are calculating p % m twice, which is not necessary. We can calculate it once and use the result in both places where it's needed.

2. Avoiding unnecessary operations: In the main function, we are multiplying with -1 to make 'x' positive. Instead, we can use the abs function to avoid unnecessary multiplication operation.

3. Unnecessary conditions: In the main function, condition (ne + o) & 1 is unnecessary. If ne is odd then (ne + o) will also be odd because 'o' is even (0 is even). So we can remove this condition.

4. Unnecessary variable: The 'o' variable is not needed. It is incremented when 'x' is 0 but it is not used in any important computation.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define int long long
#define rep(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < b; i++)
#define mod 1e9 + 7
#define inf 1e18
#define garou99 ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);
using namespace std;

int pow(int p, int r, int m) {
  int ans = 1;
  int pmod = p % m;
  while (r > 0) {
    if (r & 1) {
      ans = (ans * pmod) % m;
    }
    r = r >> 1;
    pmod = (pmod * pmod) % m;
  }
  return ans;
}

int32_t main() {
  garou99;
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    int ne = 0, ans = 0, mn = INT_MAX;
    rep(i, 0, n) {
      rep(j, 0, m) {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        x = abs(x);
        if (x < 0)
          ne++;
        mn = min(mn, x);
        ans += x;
      }
    }
    if (ne & 1)
      cout << ans - 2 * mn;
    else
      cout << ans;
    cout << '\n';
  }
}
```
Please note that the speedup from these optimizations will be quite minimal and may even be unnoticeable in most cases. The original code is already quite efficient.
