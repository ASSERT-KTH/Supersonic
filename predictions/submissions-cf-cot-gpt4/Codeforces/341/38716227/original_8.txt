The given code is an example of a C++ program that uses the Fenwick tree data structure (also known as Binary Indexed Tree) for processing query operations in 2D space. The program is already well optimized in terms of time complexity due to the Fenwick tree's nature, which allows update and query operations in O(log(n)) time. However, there are areas where the code can be optimized further:

1) The usage of '#pragma' directives at the start of the code for compiler-specific optimizations may not be necessary and could potentially limit the portability of the code. 
2) The macro '#define fast ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(NULL)' is used to speed up cin and cout, but the code uses both cin/cout and printf/scanf. It's better to stick to one type for consistency and to avoid potential slowdowns. 
3) The code uses 'long long' for storing array indices and other variables which may be unnecessarily large; 'int' may suffice if the number of elements does not exceed the limit of 'int'. However, if the number of elements is expected to exceed the limit of 'int', 'long long' should be used.
4) Lastly, the code could be refactored for readability, but this doesn't necessarily improve performance.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define mxn 1010
ll multree[mxn][mxn][2], addtree[mxn][mxn][2];

ll yo(ll x) { return (x % 2); }

ll query2(ll tree[mxn][mxn][2], ll x, ll y) {
  ll mul = 0, add = 0;
  for (ll i = y; i > 0; i -= i & -i) {
    mul ^= tree[x][i][0];
    add ^= tree[x][i][1];
  }
  return (mul * yo(y)) ^ add;
}

ll query1(ll x, ll y) {
  ll mul = 0, add = 0;
  for (ll i = x; i > 0; i -= i & -i) {
    mul ^= query2(multree, i, y);
    add ^= query2(addtree, i, y);
  }
  return (mul * yo(x)) ^ add;
}

ll query(ll x1, ll y1, ll x2, ll y2) {
  return (query1(x2, y2) ^ query1(x1 - 1, y2) ^ query1(x2, y1 - 1) ^
          query1(x1 - 1, y1 - 1));
}

void upd2(ll tree[mxn][mxn][2], ll x, ll y, ll mul, ll add) {
  for (ll i = x; i < mxn; i += i & -i) {
    for (ll j = y; j < mxn; j += j & -j) {
      tree[i][j][0] ^= mul;
      tree[i][j][1] ^= add;
    }
  }
}

void upd1(ll x, ll y1, ll y2, ll mul, ll add) {
  upd2(multree, x, y1, mul, mul * yo(y1 - 1));
  upd2(multree, x, y2, mul, mul * yo(y2));
  upd2(addtree, x, y1, add, add * yo(y1 - 1));
  upd2(addtree, x, y2, add, add * yo(y2));
}

void upd(ll x1, ll y1, ll x2, ll y2, ll val) {
  upd1(x1, y1, y2, val, val * yo(x1 - 1));
  upd1(x2, y1, y2, val, val * yo(x2));
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(NULL);
  ll i, j, k, n, m, tt, x1, y1, x2, y2, q, val;
  cin >> n;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    cin >> tt;
    if (tt == 2) {
      cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2 >> val;
      upd(x1, y1, x2, y2, val);
    } else {
      cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
      cout << query(x1, y1, x2, y2) << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
