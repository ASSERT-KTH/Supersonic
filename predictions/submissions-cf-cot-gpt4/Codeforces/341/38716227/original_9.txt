This program is already optimized with various GCC optimization flags and other common C++ techniques. However, minor improvements can still be made, such as limiting the scope of variables, improving readability, and removing unused macros and libraries.

1. Limiting the scope of variables: It's generally a good practice to limit variable scope as much as possible, which can reduce memory usage and prevent errors. The variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `tt`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `q`, and `val` are declared outside of their actual usage scope in the `main()` function. They should be declared within the loop that uses them.

2. Remove unused variables: The `m` variable is declared but never used. We can remove it.

3. Removing unused macros and libraries: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a lot of libraries, many of which are not used in this program. Including this header file may slow down the compilation process, and it's not a good practice because it can lead to name conflicts. We can include only the necessary libraries such as `#include <iostream>`, `#include <cmath>`, and `#include <sstream>`.

4. Improve readability: The `#define` macros are written in a very compact way, which can make the code hard to read. We can improve readability by writing them in a more conventional way.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;

#define F first
#define S second
#define SQ(x) ((x) * (x))
#define nl "\n"

const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
const int mxn = 1010;
const long double eps = 1e-9;
long long multree[mxn][mxn][2], addtree[mxn][mxn][2];

long long yo(long long x) { return (x % 2); }

long long query2(long long tree[mxn][mxn][2], long long x, long long y) {
  long long mul = 0, add = 0;
  for (long long i = y; i > 0; i -= i & -i) {
    mul ^= tree[x][i][0];
    add ^= tree[x][i][1];
  }
  return (mul * yo(y)) ^ add;
}

long long query1(long long x, long long y) {
  long long mul = 0, add = 0;
  for (long long i = x; i > 0; i -= i & -i) {
    mul ^= query2(multree, i, y);
    add ^= query2(addtree, i, y);
  }
  return (mul * yo(x)) ^ add;
}

long long query(long long x1, long long y1, long long x2, long long y2) {
  return (query1(x2, y2) ^ query1(x1 - 1, y2) ^ query1(x2, y1 - 1) ^
          query1(x1 - 1, y1 - 1));
}

void upd2(long long tree[mxn][mxn][2], long long x, long long y, long long mul, long long add) {
  for (long long i = x; i < mxn; i += i & -i) {
    for (long long j = y; j < mxn; j += j & -j) {
      tree[i][j][0] ^= mul;
      tree[i][j][1] ^= add;
    }
  }
}

void upd1(long long x, long long y1, long long y2, long long mul, long long add) {
  upd2(multree, x, y1, mul, mul * yo(y1 - 1));
  upd2(multree, x, y2, mul, mul * yo(y2));
  upd2(addtree, x, y1, add, add * yo(y1 - 1));
  upd2(addtree, x, y2, add, add * yo(y2));
}

void upd(long long x1, long long y1, long long x2, long long y2, long long val) {
  upd1(x1, y1, y2, val, val * yo(x1 - 1));
  upd1(x2, y1, y2, val, val * yo(x2));
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);
  long long n, q;
  cin >> n;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    long long tt, x1, y1, x2, y2, val;
    cin >> tt;
    if (tt == 2) {
      cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2 >> val;
      upd(x1, y1, x2, y2, val);
    } else {
      cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
      cout << query(x1, y1, x2, y2) << nl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}

This program should run faster and use less memory than the original program. However, the exact difference in performance will depend on the specific inputs and the specific computer used to run the program.
