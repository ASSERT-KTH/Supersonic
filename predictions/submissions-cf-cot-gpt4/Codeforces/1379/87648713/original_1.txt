Here are a few optimizations that can be made:

1. **Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`**: This header file includes almost all the standard C++ libraries which increases the compilation time. Include only those libraries which are required in your code.

2. **Avoid using `goto` statement**: It's generally a bad practice to use `goto` as it can make the code difficult to understand and maintain. Instead, you can use loop control statements like `break`.

3. **Avoid string copying**: In the `main()` function, there is an unnecessary string copy operation `ss = s;` inside the loop which increases the memory usage and time complexity. Instead you can make changes directly to `s`.

4. **Avoid unnecessary function calls**: The `counts(ss)` function is called multiple times which increases the time complexity. Instead, you can call it once and store the result in a variable.

5. **Use `continue` to skip iterations**: If a condition is not met, you can use `continue` to skip the remaining code in the loop and start the next iteration immediately.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string p = "abacaba";

int counts(string& s) {
  int c = 0;
  for (size_t i = 0; i <= s.size() - p.size(); i++) {
    if (s.substr(i, p.size()) == p)
      c++;
  }
  return c;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    bool found = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (s[i] == '?' || s[i] == 'a') {
        string temp = s;
        bool ck = false;
        for (size_t j = 0; j < p.size(); j++) {
          if (temp[i + j] != p[j] && temp[i + j] != '?') {
            ck = true;
            break;
          }
          else
            temp[i + j] = p[j];
        }
        if (ck) continue;
        int count = counts(temp);
        if (count == 1) {
          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (temp[i] == '?')
              temp[i] = 'd';
          }
          cout << "YES" << endl;
          cout << temp << endl;
          found = true;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    if(!found)
      cout << "NO" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimization, we have removed the use of `goto` and instead use a boolean variable `found` to check whether a match is found or not. Also, the function `counts` is now called only once per inner loop.  Also, instead of copying the entire string `s` to `ss` in each loop, we now only make a copy when we need to temporarily modify the string.
