This C++ program can be optimized in several ways:

1. Instead of using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, we can include only those headers that are actually needed. This will reduce the compile time.

2. The `string p = "abacaba"` can be declared as a constant because its value doesn't change.

3. In the `counts(string s)` function, the `s` string is passed by value. This means that a copy of the string is created which increases memory usage. It can be passed by reference which will avoid the unnecessary copy.

4. The `counts(string s)` function checks for `p` in `s` and increments `c` if `p` is found. However, it continues to check even after `p` is found. Instead, it can return immediately after finding `p`.

5. In the main function, `string s, ss;` is declared at the beginning. Instead, `ss` can be declared inside the loop where it is used to reduce its scope and improve readability.

6. The variable `ck` is used as a flag to break out of the loop. Instead, we can directly break out of the loop using `break`.

7. The `goto` statement is generally considered bad practice as it makes the program hard to understand and maintain. It can be replaced with a simple control structure.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define endll "\n"
const string p = "abacaba";

int counts(const string& s) {
  int c = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < p.size(); j++) {
      if (s[i + j] != p[j]) {
        break;
      }
    }
    c++;
    if (c == 1)
      return c;
  }
  return c;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    bool found = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      string ss = s;
      if (ss[i] == '?' || ss[i] == 'a') {
        for (int j = 0; j < p.size(); j++) {
          if (ss[i + j] != p[j] && ss[i + j] != '?') {
            break;
          } else
            ss[i + j] = p[j];
        }
        if (counts(ss) == 1) {
          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (ss[i] == '?')
              ss[i] = 'd';
          }
          cout << "YES" << endl;
          cout << ss << endl;
          found = true;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    if (!found)
      cout << "NO" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
