Here are some optimizations that can be applied to this C/C++ code:

1. **Avoid unnecessary memory allocation**: The `memset` function is used to set the entire suf array to 0. However, only the elements up to index m are used in the program. Therefore, you can initialize only the elements of suf array up to index m to 0.

2. **Avoid redundant computation**: The code `suf[m - n + 1]` is computed twice. You can compute it once and store it in a separate variable.

3. **Precompute common subexpressions**: The expression `m - pos + 1` is computed twice. You can compute it once and store it in a separate variable.

4. **Use const where possible**: The variables `n`, `m`, and `q` do not change their values after initialization. Therefore, you can make them const to help the compiler optimize the code.

Now let's apply these optimizations to the C/C++ code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
#define fi first
#define se second
#define mul_mod(a, b, c) a = (a * b) % mod
#define add_mod(a, b, c) a = (a + b) % mod
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int maxn = 2e5 + 10;
const int maxm = 5e5 + 10;
int q;
struct node {
  ll a, b;
} f[maxn];
ll ans;
ll A[maxn], B[maxn];
ll suf[maxn];
int main() {
  scanf("%d", &q);
  while (q--) {
    const int n, m;
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
      scanf("%lld %lld", &f[i].a, &f[i].b);
      A[i] = f[i].a;
    }
    sort(A + 1, A + 1 + m);
    for (int i = m; i >= 1; i--)
      suf[i] = suf[i + 1] + A[i];
    ans = 0;
    const int sufIdx = m - n + 1;
    if (n <= m)
      ans = suf[sufIdx];
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
      ll temp = 0;
      int pos = lower_bound(A + 1, A + 1 + m, f[i].b) - A;
      if (pos <= sufIdx)
        continue;
      temp += suf[pos];
      const int num = n - (m - pos + 1);
      if (f[i].a < f[i].b)
        temp += f[i].a, num--;
      temp += num * f[i].b;
      ans = max(ans, temp);
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
These optimizations should help to improve the performance of the code, but the overall complexity of the algorithm remains the same. It's also important to note that these are micro-optimizations and in practice, they might not have a significant impact on the performance of the code. But they can be helpful in understanding how to write cleaner and more efficient code.
