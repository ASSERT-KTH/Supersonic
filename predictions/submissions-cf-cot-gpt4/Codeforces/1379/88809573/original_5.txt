First, let's go through the code and see what could be optimized:

1. Remove unused includes: The code contains many includes that are not utilized in the code. This increases the compilation time and the size of the executable unnecessarily.

2. Reuse computations: The expression 'm - n + 1' is computed repeatedly in the loop. It should be calculated once and stored in a variable.

3. Avoid using costly operations: 'Lower_bound' function is used which has a time complexity of O(log n). We might be able to avoid this by changing the algorithm.

4. Minimize memory operations: 'memset' function is used to initialize 'suf' array in each iteration of 'q'. Instead, we could initialize this array only when needed, reducing the number of memory operations.

5. Avoid repeated calculation: In the second for loop, 'suf[pos]' is calculated regardless of the condition 'if (pos <= m - n + 1)'. This calculation can be avoided if the condition is true.

6. Simplify calculations: 'num' is calculated with 'n - (m - pos + 1)'. This can be simplified to 'pos - m + n - 1'.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int maxn = 2e5 + 10;
int q;
struct node {
  ll a, b;
} f[maxn];
ll ans;
ll A[maxn], suf[maxn];
int n, m;
int main() {
  scanf("%d", &q);
  while (q--) {
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
      scanf("%lld %lld", &f[i].a, &f[i].b);
      A[i] = f[i].a;
    }
    sort(A + 1, A + 1 + m);
    suf[m + 1] = 0;
    for (int i = m; i >= 1; i--)
      suf[i] = suf[i + 1] + A[i];
    ans = 0;
    int mn = max(1, m - n + 1);
    if (n <= m)
      ans = suf[mn];
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
      ll temp = 0;
      int pos = lower_bound(A + 1, A + 1 + m, f[i].b) - A;
      if (pos > mn) {
        temp += suf[pos];
        int num = pos - m + n - 1;
        if (f[i].a < f[i].b)
          temp += f[i].a, num--;
        temp += num * f[i].b;
        ans = max(ans, temp);
      }
    }
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
