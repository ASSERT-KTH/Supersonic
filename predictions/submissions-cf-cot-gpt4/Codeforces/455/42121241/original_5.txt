This program is pretty optimized already. However, there are some small improvements that we can apply to further optimize the code for running time and memory usage.

Optimization Steps:

1. **Inline Functions:** Making a function inline suggests to the compiler that the function is a good candidate for inlining, which can remove the overhead of the function call and return.

2. **Unnecessary Use of std::deque:** In this case, deque (double-ended queue) data structure is used. However, the usage of deque is not required as we're not taking advantage of its properties of fast insertion and deletion at both ends. We can simply use std::vector instead, which will reduce the overhead of maintaining the double-ended queue.

3. **Avoid Unnecessary Object Creation:** In the split() function, the code creates a new dat object every time the function is called. We can avoid this by checking the condition before creating the new object.

4. **Avoiding Unnecessary Recursion:** The count() function recursively calls itself if p > size(). Instead, we can use a while loop to iterate through the map until we find the element, which will reduce the overhead of recursive function calls.

5. **Avoiding Multiple Scans:** In the main() function, the program scans the input multiple times for different variables. We can reduce this by scanning the input once and storing the results in the appropriate variables.

Now, let's apply these optimization steps to the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;
struct dat {
  static int n;
  vector<int> A;
  map<int, int> M;
  dat *next = NULL;
  inline int count(int p, int x) const {
    map<int, int>::const_iterator it;
    while (p > size()) {
      it = M.find(x);
      if (it != M.end()) p -= size();
    }
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < p; i++)
      ans += A[i] == x;
    return ans;
  }
  inline void insert(int p, int x) {
    if (p > size()) {
      next->insert(p - size(), x);
      return;
    }
    A.insert(A.begin() + p, x);
    M[x]++;
    split();
  }
  // remaining functions remain same...
  void split() {
    if (size() < n << 1)
      return;
    dat *tmp = next;
    if (tmp == NULL) tmp = new dat;
    while (size() > n)
      tmp->push_front(pop_back());
    tmp->next = next;
    next = tmp;
  }
  // remaining functions remain same...
};
int dat::n;
int main() {
  int n, m, last = 0;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  dat::n = ceil(sqrt(n << 2));
  dat *D = new dat, *cur = D;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (cur->size() >= dat::n) {
      cur->next = new dat;
      cur = cur->next;
    }
    int x;
    scanf("%d", &x);
    cur->push_back(x);
  }
  scanf("%d", &m);
  int op, l, r, k;
  while (m-- > 0) {
    scanf("%d%d%d%d", &op, &l, &r, &k);
    l = (l + last - 1) % n + 1;
    r = (r + last - 1) % n + 1;
    k = (k + last - 1) % n + 1;
    if (l > r)
      swap(l, r);
    if (op == 1)
      D->insert(l - 1, D->erase(r));
    else {
      l = D->count(l - 1, k);
      r = D->count(r, k);
      printf("%d\n", last = r - l);
    }
  }
}
```
The optimized program is more efficient in terms of running time and memory usage due to the removal of unnecessary object creation, usage of inline functions, efficient input scanning, and avoiding unnecessary recursion. However, the actual performance benefit can vary depending on the specific inputs and system environment.
