The C++ program seems to be already optimized in terms of its algorithmic approach. It uses a map for counting and iterates through the 2D array only twice. However, there are few small modifications that can be done to further optimize it:

1. Use of `bits/stdc++.h`: This is quite a big header file and slows down the compilation process. We should only include necessary header files.

2. Use of `using namespace std`: It's better to avoid using this statement in larger programs to prevent naming conflicts.

3. Avoid using `#define` for constants and use `const` instead, it is safer and more C++ style.

4. The array `a` could be a vector of vectors. This would prevent declaring a variable-length array, which is not standard in C++. 

5. The macro `fast` is used to speed up cin and cout, but the endl is slower than "\n", so we should replace all endl with "\n".

6. Instead of using `freopen` for redirecting inputs/outputs from files, we can use command line redirection. This would make the program more flexible.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::vector;
using std::map;

using ll = long long;
using pll = std::pair<ll, ll>;

const ll pi = 3.14159265358979323846;

pll ans[2];
vector<ll> sum(2);

void update(int c, int i, int j, ll val) {
  if (val > sum[c]) {
    sum[c] = val;
    ans[c].first = i;
    ans[c].second = j;
  }
}

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<vector<ll>> a(n, vector<ll>(n));
  sum[0] = sum[1] = -1;
  map<ll, ll> cnt, cnt1;
  for(ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for(ll j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      cin >> a[i][j];
      cnt[i + j] += a[i][j];
      cnt1[i - j] += a[i][j];
    }
  }
  
  for(ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for(ll j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      update((i + j) % 2, i, j, cnt[i + j] + cnt1[i - j] - a[i][j]);
    }
  }
  
  cout << sum[0] + sum[1] << "\n";
  for (auto it : ans) {
    cout << it.first + 1 << " " << it.second + 1 << " ";
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  ll t = 1;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the algorithmic part of the program has not been modified as it is already optimized. The modifications were mostly about using more modern C++ style and some safe practices.
