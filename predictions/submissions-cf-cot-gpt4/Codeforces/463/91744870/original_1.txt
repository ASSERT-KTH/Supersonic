The given C/C++ program seems to be already optimized in terms of time and space complexity. The time complexity is O(n^2) due to the two nested loops, which is the best you can achieve considering the program needs to traverse through a 2D matrix. The space complexity is linear, O(n), which is also optimal considering the program needs to store the elements of the 2D matrix.

However, there is a small optimization that can be done in terms of memory usage:

- Instead of using a 2D array to store the input data, we can use a 1D array of pointers. This will save memory because we don't need to allocate all the memory at once but can dynamically allocate memory for each row when the data for that row is read. 

- Also, some unnecessary macros can be removed to make the code cleaner.

Here is the optimized code:

``` cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pll;
typedef vector<ll> vi;
#define fo(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
const double pi = 3.14159265358979323846;
#define fast ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(NULL)
void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  ll** a = new ll*[n];
  vi sum(2, -1);
  pll ans[2];
  map<ll, ll> cnt, cnt1;
  fo(i, n) {
    a[i] = new ll[n];
    fo(j, n) {
      cin >> a[i][j];
      cnt[i + j] += a[i][j];
      cnt1[i - j] += a[i][j];
    }
  }
  fo(i, n) {
    fo(j, n) { 
      ll val = cnt[i + j] + cnt1[i - j] - a[i][j];
      if (val > sum[(i + j) % 2]) {
        sum[(i + j) % 2] = val;
        ans[(i + j) % 2] = make_pair(i, j);
      }
    }
  }
  cout << sum[0] + sum[1] << "\n";
  for (auto it : ans) {
    cout << it.first + 1 << " " << it.second + 1 << " ";
  }
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    delete[] a[i];
  }
  delete[] a;
}

int main() {
  fast;
  ll t = 1;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

The changes include:

- The 2D array "a" is now a 1D array of pointers which are dynamically allocated.
- The "sum" vector is initialized with -1 directly in the declaration.
- The "update" function is replaced by directly updating "sum" and "ans" within the nested loop. This avoids the overhead of function calls.
- The unnecessary macros are removed, and "first" and "second" are used instead of "fi" and "se" for clarity.
- The dynamically allocated memory for the 2D array "a" is freed at the end to avoid memory leaks.
