The given code reads a 2D matrix from the input, calculates the sum of elements along its diagonals, and then finds the maximum sum of two cells such that they are not on the same row, column, or diagonal. The code is already quite optimized; however, we can make a few small changes to further optimize it:

1. Instead of using `cin` and `cout` for I/O, we can use scanf and printf, which are faster.
2. We can avoid using `map` and use 2D arrays instead, which are faster for accessing elements.
3. The inner loop in `solve` function recalculates `cnt[i + j] + cnt1[i - j] - a[i][j]` for each cell in the 2D grid, which can be optimized by calculating it once and storing in a local variable.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
#define mp make_pair
#define pb push_back
#define sq(x) ((x) * (x))
#define fo(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define fi first
#define se second

ll ans[2][2];
ll sum[2];
ll cnt[2 * 1000];
ll cnt1[2 * 1000];

void update(int c, int i, int j, ll val) {
  if (val > sum[c]) {
    sum[c] = val;
    ans[c][0] = i;
    ans[c][1] = j;
  }
}

int main() {
  ll n;
  scanf("%lld", &n);
  ll a[n][n];
  sum[0] = sum[1] = -1;
  memset(cnt, 0, sizeof(cnt));
  memset(cnt1, 0, sizeof(cnt1));
  
  fo(i, n) {
    fo(j, n) {
      scanf("%lld", &a[i][j]);
      cnt[i + j] += a[i][j];
      cnt1[i - j + n] += a[i][j];
    }
  }
  
  fo(i, n) {
    fo(j, n) {
      ll val = cnt[i + j] + cnt1[i - j + n] - a[i][j];
      update((i + j) % 2, i, j, val);
    }
  }
  
  printf("%lld\n", sum[0] + sum[1]);
  printf("%lld %lld %lld %lld\n", ans[0][0] + 1, ans[0][1] + 1, ans[1][0] + 1, ans[1][1] + 1);

  return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimized version of the program still has a complexity of O(n^2) which is same as the original program. The changes are more about making the program efficient in terms of constant factors, not about changing the complexity class.
