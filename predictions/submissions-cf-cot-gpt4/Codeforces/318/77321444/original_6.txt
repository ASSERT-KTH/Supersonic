The given C++ program is already well-optimized in terms of time complexity. Each operation has a constant time complexity, which means it does not depend on the size of the input.

However, there are potential micro-optimizations that could be applied:

1. Avoid unnecessary use of #define: The #define directive is used to define constants or macros that are to be replaced by the preprocessor before compilation. However, in C++, it's generally preferable to use const or inline functions instead of #define.
2. Use const int for integer constants: The 't' variable is set to 1 and never changed. It is better to declare it as a constant.
3. Remove unused vector and pair macros: In your code, you have defined some macros for vector and pair, but they are not used anywhere in your code. Removing these unused macros can make your code cleaner.
4. Avoid using bitwise operations when unnecessary: Bitwise operations can sometimes make code harder to read and understand. Use them only when necessary.
5. Avoid using namespace std: It's generally a good idea to avoid using namespace std in C++ because it can lead to name clashes.

Now, based on these guidelines, I'll provide the optimized version of your code.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);
  const int t = 1;
  for(int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    int n, k;
    std::cin >> n >> k;
    if (n % 2 != 0) {
      if (k <= (n / 2) + 1) {
        std::cout << 2 * k - 1 << "\n";
      } else {
        std::cout << 2 * (k - (n / 2) - 1) << "\n";
      }
    } else {
      if (k <= n / 2) {
        std::cout << 2 * k - 1 << "\n";
      } else {
        std::cout << 2 * (k - n / 2) << "\n";
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code will have the same time complexity but is cleaner and more readable.
