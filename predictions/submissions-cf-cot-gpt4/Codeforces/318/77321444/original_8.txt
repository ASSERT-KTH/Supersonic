Optimization Steps:

1. The first optimization is removing the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file includes almost all standard library headers in C++, which increases the compile time and memory usage. Instead, we should only include necessary headers. In this case, `#include <iostream>` will suffice.

2. The `FAST` macro, which is aimed at speeding up the execution of cin and cout, is not necessary here. The input/output operations are not in a loop, thus the speedup will not be significant. Removing this will make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

3. The `int i, j;` is declared but not used anywhere in the code. We can remove it.

4. The `while (t--)` loop is unnecessary as t is always 1. Removing this loop will make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

5. The `#define vl vector<long long>`, `#define pb push_back`, `#define mp make_pair`, and `#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()` are not used in this program. We can remove these lines to clean up the code.

6. The conditions `(n & 1)` and `(k <= (n / 2) + 1)` are both checked twice, which is unnecessary. We can save the results of these conditions in boolean variables to avoid repeating the calculations.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int32_t main() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  bool n_is_odd = n & 1;
  bool k_less_than_half_n = k <= (n / 2) + (n_is_odd ? 1 : 0);

  if (n_is_odd) {
    cout << (k_less_than_half_n ? 2 * k - 1 : 2 * (k - n / 2 - 1)) << endl;
  } else {
    cout << (k_less_than_half_n ? 2 * k - 1 : 2 * (k - n / 2)) << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program has the same functionality as the original one but uses less memory and is faster because it avoids unnecessary calculations and includes only necessary headers. The code is also cleaner and easier to understand.
