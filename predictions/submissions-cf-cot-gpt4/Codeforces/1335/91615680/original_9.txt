This program is a C++ program that reads a value 't' representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a value 'n' representing the number of elements. It takes 'n' elements as input and counts the number of each element. Finally, it finds the maximum count and the number of different elements and prints out the smaller one after a certain adjustment.

Optimization 1:
The array 'arr' is of size 200001 and is initialized with zero in every iteration of the outer loop. This can be optimized by declaring the array outside of the loop and setting it to zero only when it is needed to be. This will prevent unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation in every iteration.

Optimization 2:
The program is using range-based for loop to traverse through the entire 'arr' array. As the size of the array is 200001, it is wasting time when 'n' is much less than the size of the array. This can be optimized by keeping track of the maximum value of 'x' which will be the maximum index of 'arr' that has been accessed in the current test case. Then we can loop from 0 to this maximum index instead of the size of the array.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int t, n, x;
  int arr[200001] = {0};
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n;
    int max_x = 0;
    while (n--) {
      cin >> x;
      arr[x]++;
      if (x > max_x)
        max_x = x;
    }
    int maks = 0, temp = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= max_x; i++) {
      if (arr[i]) {
        temp++;
        if (arr[i] > maks)
          maks = arr[i];
      }
      arr[i] = 0; // Reset the count for the next test case
    }
    if (temp == maks) {
      maks--;
    }
    cout << min(temp, maks) << endl;
  }
}
```

In this program, the array 'arr' is declared and zero-initialized only once. The maximum index that has been accessed in the current test case is kept track of in 'max_x'. After calculating 'maks' and 'temp', the counts are reset to zero for the next test case. This way, the memory allocation and deallocation and the unnecessary traversals of the 'arr' array are minimized, making the program more optimized regarding running time and memory usage.
