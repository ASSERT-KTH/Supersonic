The provided program takes an integer 't' as input representing the number of test cases. Each test case reads an integer 'n', and 'n' integers afterward. The program counts the frequency of each number 'x' in an array 'arr'. Then, it counts the number of non-zero elements in 'arr' (variable 'temp') and the maximum frequency (variable 'maks'). It then prints the minimum number between 'temp' and 'maks', decrementing 'maks' if 'temp' is equal to 'maks'. 

The main optimization is to replace the array with a map or unordered_map. An unordered_map is efficient in terms of memory because it only stores the elements that are actually present in the input. This also speeds up the frequency counting process because we don't have to iterate over a fixed-size array. However, unordered_map has an average constant-time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations, but in worst case (when the hash function causes a collision) it can go up to O(n).

Let's optimize the program using unordered_map:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int t, n, x;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    unordered_map<int, int> freq_map;
    cin >> n;
    while (n--) {
      cin >> x;
      freq_map[x]++;
    }
    int maks = 0, temp = 0;
    for (auto const &x : freq_map) {
      temp++;
      if (x.second > maks)
        maks = x.second;
    }
    if (temp == maks) {
      maks--;
    }
    cout << min(temp, maks) << endl;
  }
}
```
In the optimized program, 'freq_map' is an unordered_map where each key-value pair represents a number and its frequency. The rest of the program logic remains the same.
