The given code reads a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads a number `n` and `n` more numbers. It then counts the frequency of each number and finds the maximum frequency `maks` and the total number of distinct numbers `temp`. Finally, it prints the minimum of `maks` and `temp`, adjusting `maks` if it equals `temp`.

The optimization that can be applied here relates to the way the frequency of each number is calculated and how the maximum frequency and the count of distinct numbers are found. The given code uses a large array for counting frequencies. This approach results in a large amount of unused memory if the numbers are small, as the array size is fixed to 200001. It also requires a linear scan of the entire array to find the maximum frequency and the count of distinct numbers, which is inefficient.

A more efficient approach would be to use a map (specifically, an unordered_map for constant time complexity on average for lookups and inserts) to count frequencies. This would use only as much memory as needed for the distinct numbers, and finding the maximum frequency and the count of distinct numbers would be done in a single pass over the map.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t, n, x;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    unordered_map<int, int> freq;
    cin >> n;
    while (n--) {
      cin >> x;
      freq[x]++;
    }
    int maks = 0, temp = freq.size();
    for (auto &kv : freq) {
      if (kv.second > maks)
        maks = kv.second;
    }
    if (temp == maks) {
      maks--;
    }
    cout << min(temp, maks) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code performs the same task as the original code but in a more efficient way in terms of both memory usage and running time. It should provide a noticeable improvement if the numbers are small and/or there are many distinct numbers.
