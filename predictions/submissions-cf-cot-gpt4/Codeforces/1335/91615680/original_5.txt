This program reads an integer 't' from the user, then reads 't' sets of numbers. For each set, it reads an integer 'n' and then 'n' integers, increments the count of each integer in the 'arr' array, then prints the minimum between the number of unique numbers and the maximum count of any number.

The main optimizations that can be done here are:

1. `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` - these lines will turn off synchronization with the C standard I/O streams and untie cin from cout, making the I/O operations faster.

2. Use of `std::unordered_map` instead of a large array - in the provided code, the array 'arr' is of fixed size 200001 and initialized to 0 every time. This can take unnecessary time and space if 'n' is small. Using `std::unordered_map` will only use space for the numbers that are actually read, and the map does not need to be cleared every time.

3. The loop that calculates 'maks' and 'temp' iterates over all 200001 elements of 'arr', even if only a few of them have been modified. By storing the numbers in a map, we can iterate only over the numbers that have been read.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t, n, x;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    unordered_map<int, int> counts;
    cin >> n;
    while (n--) {
      cin >> x;
      counts[x]++;
    }
    int maks = 0, temp = 0;
    for (auto &count : counts) {
      temp++;
      if (count.second > maks)
        maks = count.second;
    }
    if (temp == maks) {
      maks--;
    }
    cout << min(temp, maks) << '\n';
  }
}
```
In this optimized version, the size of 'counts' is only as large as the number of unique numbers read, and the loop that calculates 'maks' and 'temp' only iterates over these unique numbers. Also, the I/O operations are faster due to the added lines at the beginning of main.
