The given program reads a number of test cases, followed by the size of an array, and then the elements of the array. For each test case, it counts the frequency of each number, and then calculates a value based on the maximum frequency and the number of distinct numbers. Finally, it outputs the smaller of these two values. There are two main points to optimize this program: the input operation and the use of array for counting frequencies.

1. Using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` before any I/O operation improves I/O efficiency.

2. Instead of using a large array to count frequencies, we can use `std::unordered_map` which uses a hash table internally. It offers constant time average complexity for search, insert, and delete operations compared to linear time complexity for an array. This will save both time and space when the input values are sparse.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int t, n, x;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    unordered_map<int, int> freq;
    cin >> n;
    while (n--) {
      cin >> x;
      freq[x]++;
    }
    int maks = 0, temp = 0;
    for (auto const& x : freq) {
      temp++;
      if (x.second > maks)
        maks = x.second;
    }
    if (temp == maks) {
      maks--;
    }
    cout << min(temp, maks) << endl;
  }
}
```
The optimized program first turns off synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding C standard streams and unties `cin` from `cout`. This can significantly improve the I/O performance. It then replaces the array with an `unordered_map` to count the frequencies of the numbers, which is more efficient for sparse inputs.
