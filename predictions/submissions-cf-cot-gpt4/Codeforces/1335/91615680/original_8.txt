The main optimization that can be done in the given code is to avoid storing and processing all data in memory. Here is how the optimization can be done:

1. Instead of storing all numbers in an array, you can use a map to store only the unique numbers and their counts. This can save a lot of memory if there are many repeating numbers.

2. In the current code, you are traversing the whole array to find the maximum count. This is an O(n) operation. Instead, you can use a max heap to store the counts. Inserting a count into the heap will take O(log n) time, but finding the maximum count will take O(1) time.

3. Instead of counting the total number of unique numbers in the array, you can use the size of the map directly.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t, n, x;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    map<int, int> count_map;
    priority_queue<int> max_heap;
    cin >> n;
    while (n--) {
      cin >> x;
      count_map[x]++;
    }
    for (auto x : count_map) {
      max_heap.push(x.second);
    }
    int maks = max_heap.top(), temp = count_map.size();
    if (temp == maks) {
      maks--;
    }
    cout << min(temp, maks) << endl;
  }
}
```

This optimized version of the code can handle the same inputs as the original version, but it uses less memory and potentially less running time. Please make sure to test this optimized version with several test cases to verify that it works correctly.
