Here are the optimizations that we can make:

1. **Single traversal for 'set' and 'map' operations**: The program traverses the vector 'v' twice, once for inserting elements into the set 's' and second for counting the frequency of each element in the map 'm'. We can combine these two operations into a single traversal.

2. **Removing 'clear' operations**: The 'clear' methods called on 's' and 'm' at the end of each test case are not necessary as these containers will be automatically cleared when they go out of scope at the end of each loop iteration.

3. **Removing unused macros**: The macros 'pb', 'mp', 'deb', 'ff', 'ss', 'mod', 'inf', 'all' and 'MOD' are not used in the program and can be removed.

4. **Removing unused 'fast' macro**: The 'fast' macro is used to speed up I/O operations by detaching 'cin' and 'cout' from their synchronization with C's standard streams. However, in this program, there are not many I/O operations, so this optimization doesn't really make a difference and can be removed.

Here is the optimized program with these changes:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define f(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < b; i++)
#define ll long long
#define endl '\n'
#define vi vector<int>

const int N = 1e6 + 10;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vi v(n);
    f(i, 0, n) cin >> v[i];
    set<int> s;
    map<int, int> m;
    int M = -1;
    for (auto x : v) {
      s.insert(x);
      m[x]++;
      M = max(M, m[x]);
    }
    if (n >= 2 && m.size() == n) {
      cout << 1 << endl;
    } else if (s.size() > M) {
      cout << M << endl;
    } else if (s.size() == M) {
      cout << M - 1 << endl;
    } else {
      cout << s.size() << endl;
    }
  }
}
```

Please note that the optimizations above may not significantly improve the overall performance of the program as the original program was already quite efficient. However, the changes do improve code readability and maintainability, which are important aspects of software development.
