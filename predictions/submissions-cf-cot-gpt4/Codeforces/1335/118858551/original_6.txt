Here are the steps to optimize the given C/C++ program:

1. The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file is not a standard C++ header and it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries. The inclusion of this file can lead to slower compilation times. So, we will replace this with only the necessary header files.

2. The usage of macros like `#define f(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < b; i++)` and `#define deb(x) cout << #x << " " << x << endl;` can be replaced with regular for loop and debug print statements to make the code more readable and maintainable.

3. The constants `mod` and `inf` are not used anywhere in the code. We can remove these constants.

4. We can avoid using `std::endl` to print a newline character to the output. This is because `std::endl` not only inserts a newline character, but also flushes the output buffer which is not necessary and can cause the program to run slower.

5. The vectors `v` and map `m` is being used to count the frequency of each element. Instead, we can directly use a map to count the frequency and hence we can avoid using the extra set `s` which saves memory.

6. There is no need to clear the set and map at the end of each test case because they will automatically be destroyed when they go out of scope.

Here is the optimized version of the given C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

const int N = 1e6 + 10;
const long long MOD = (long long)(1e9) + (long long)(7);

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> v(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> v[i];
    
    map<int, int> m;
    for (auto x : v)
      m[x]++;
      
    int M = -1;
    for (auto it : m) {
      M = max(M, it.second);
    }
    if (n >= 2 && m.size() == n) {
      cout << 1 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    if (m.size() > M) {
      cout << M << '\n';
    } else if (m.size() == M) {
      cout << M - 1 << '\n';
    } else {
      cout << m.size() << '\n';
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
