Here are the steps to optimize the given code:

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes almost all standard library headers which is generally not good practice and could increase your compile time significantly. Include only the headers that you need. 

2. `#define f(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < b; i++)`: Macros are generally not recommended in modern C++ as they could lead to hard to detect bugs.

3. `#define ll long long`: This is an unnecessary macro. Use `long long` directly when required.

4. `#define endl '\n'`: Avoid using `endl` to insert a newline character and flush the stream, use `'\n'` instead. `endl` causes unnecessary overhead by forcing a flush of the output buffer.

5. `#define pb push_back`: This is an unnecessary macro. Use `push_back` directly when required.

6. `#define mp make_pair`: This is an unnecessary macro. Use `make_pair` or `{}` directly when required.

7. `#define vi vector<int>`: This is an unnecessary macro. Use `vector<int>` directly when required.

8. `#define deb(x) cout << #x << " " << x << endl;`: This is a debug macro and should not be included in the final code.

9. `#define ff first`: This is an unnecessary macro. Use `first` directly when required.

10. `#define ss second`: This is an unnecessary macro. Use `second` directly when required.

11. `#define mod 998244353`: This macro is not being used in the code and can be removed.

12. `#define inf 4e18`: This macro is not being used in the code and can be removed.

13. `#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()`: This is an unnecessary macro. Use `v.begin(), v.end()` directly when required.

14. `fast`: This macro is unnecessary and not used in the code, it can be removed.

15. `const int N = 1e6 + 10;`: This constant is not being used in the code and can be removed.

16. `const ll MOD = (ll)(1e9) + (ll)(7);`: This constant is not being used in the code and can be removed.

17. `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);`: These lines are used to speed up input and output in C++, but they are not necessary in this code because there is not a huge amount of input or output. They can be removed to simplify the code.

18. The `set<int> s;` is not necessary. It's only used to get the unique elements in `v` but this can also be done with the `map<int, int>` which is already in the code. This will save memory and time.

19. The `s.clear(), m.clear();` at the end is not necessary, because `s` and `m` are local variables and will be destroyed at the end of each iteration of the while loop.

20. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl` to avoid unnecessary flushes of the output.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> v(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> v[i];
    map<int, int> m;
    for (int x : v)
      m[x]++;
    int M = -1;
    for (const auto& it : m) {
      M = max(M, it.second);
    }
    if (n >= 2 && m.size() == n) {
      cout << 1 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    if (m.size() > M) {
      cout << M << '\n';
    } else if (m.size() == M) {
      cout << M - 1 << '\n';
    } else {
      cout << m.size() << '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code includes only necessary headers, removes unnecessary macros and constants, and removes the usage of a set, which saves memory and time.
