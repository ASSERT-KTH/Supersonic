Optimization Steps:

1. The first thing we can do is to eliminate the usage of `bits/stdc++.h` header file. This header file is quite heavy as it includes all the standard library headers in C++, which increases the compilation time.

2. We can remove the `fast` macro which is used to speed up the cin and cout operations. In most cases, it's not necessary and may lead to bugs (e.g., if you're also using scanf or printf in your code).

3. We're using two separate data structures here: a set `s` and a map `m`. The set `s` is used only for checking the size, but we're inserting into it in a separate loop. Instead, we can insert elements into the map and the set in a single loop.

4. We're unnecessarily clearing the set `s` and map `m` at the end of each test case. These data structures are local to the while loop, so they will be destructed automatically at the end of each iteration.

5. We don't need to calculate the maximum frequency `M` in a separate loop. We can do this while inserting elements into the map.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

#define f(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < b; i++)

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> v(n);
    f(i, 0, n) cin >> v[i];
    set<int> s;
    map<int, int> m;
    int M = -1;
    for (auto x : v) {
      s.insert(x);
      m[x]++;
      M = max(M, m[x]);
    }
    if (n >= 2 && m.size() == n) {
      cout << 1 << endl;
      continue;
    }
    if (s.size() > M) {
      cout << M << endl;
    } else if (s.size() == M) {
      cout << M - 1 << endl;
    } else {
      cout << s.size() << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, we have reduced the number of loops and removed unnecessary operations, which makes the code more efficient in terms of both time and memory.
