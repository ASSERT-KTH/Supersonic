The program you've provided basically reads an array and performs some calculations and conditions on the elements of the array. The main optimizations we can make here are:

1. Reducing the number of traversals: Right now, the program is traversing the array three times: once to insert elements into the set, once to insert elements into the map, and once to find the maximum frequency of an element. We can combine these three traversals into one to reduce the number of operations.

2. Avoiding unnecessary clearing of collections: Right now, the program is clearing the set and map at the end of each test case. This is unnecessary because these collections will be re-initialized for each test case anyway.

3. Reducing the number of lookups: Right now, the program is performing two lookups in the map (m[x]++ and max(M, it.ss)). We can reduce this to one lookup by keeping track of the maximum frequency while we're inserting elements into the map.

Here is the optimized program:

```C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define f(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < b; i++)
#define ll long long
#define endl '\n'
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
#define vi vector<int>
#define deb(x) cout << #x << " " << x << endl;
#define ff first
#define ss second
#define mod 998244353
#define inf 4e18
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define fast ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);
const int N = 1e6 + 10;
const ll MOD = (ll)(1e9) + (ll)(7);
int main() {
  fast;
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vi v(n);
    f(i, 0, n) cin >> v[i];
    set<int> s;
    map<int, int> m;
    int M = -1;
    for (auto x : v) {
      s.insert(x);
      M = max(M, ++m[x]);
    }
    if (n >= 2 && m.size() == n) {
      cout << 1 << endl;
    } else if (s.size() > M) {
      cout << M << endl;
    } else if (s.size() == M) {
      cout << M - 1 << endl;
    } else {
      cout << s.size() << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program has the same functionality as the original program, but it performs fewer operations, so it should run faster and use less memory.
