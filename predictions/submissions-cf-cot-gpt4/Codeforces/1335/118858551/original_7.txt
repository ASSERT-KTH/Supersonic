The original C++ program has a time complexity of O(n), which is already optimal. However, there are some improvements that can be made to reduce memory usage and simplify the code.

Here's the optimization step by step:

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a non-standard header file and it includes a lot of unnecessary files which increases the compilation time. Replace it with the required headers.

2. Unused macros and constants like `pb`, `mp`, `mod`, `inf`, `fast`, `N`, `MOD` are defined. Remove these.

3. The `std` namespace is being used, which could lead to name clashes. It's better to specify `std::` when necessary.

4. The `vector<int> v(n)` is created and populated with user input, but you also create a `set<int> s` and insert all elements of `v` into `s`. The set `s` and vector `v` are both being used to populate the map `m`. This is redundant and you can populate `m` directly with the user input.

5. The clear function is called on the set `s` and map `m` at the end of each test case. This is unnecessary, because `s` and `m` are local variables and they will automatically be destroyed at the end of each iteration of the while loop.

Here's the optimized program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::map<int, int> m;
    int x;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> x;
      m[x]++;
    }
    int M = -1;
    for (auto it : m) {
      M = std::max(M, it.second);
    }
    if (n >= 2 && m.size() == n) {
      std::cout << 1 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    if (m.size() > M) {
      std::cout << M << '\n';
    } else if (m.size() == M) {
      std::cout << M - 1 << '\n';
    } else {
      std::cout << m.size() << '\n';
    }
  }
}
```
