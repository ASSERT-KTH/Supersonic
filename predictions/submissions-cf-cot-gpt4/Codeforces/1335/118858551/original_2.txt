The given C/C++ program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Remove unnecessary usage of data structures: Here, both a set and a map are used to store the elements of the vector. This is unnecessary because the map can be used to accomplish the tasks of both the set and the map. The map stores the elements as keys and their frequencies as values. The number of unique elements can be obtained by finding the size of the map, which is the same as finding the size of the set.

2. Avoid clearing the map and set at the end of each test case: The map and the set are cleared at the end of each test case. This is unnecessary because they will automatically be cleared when the next test case starts. This reduces memory usage.

3. Avoid using macros for simple tasks: Macros like `f(i, a, b)` for simple for loops and `deb(x)` for debugging are unnecessary and can make the code more difficult to read. It's better to just use a simple for loop and print statements.

Now, let's implement these optimizations:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

const int N = 1e6 + 10;
const long long MOD = (long long)(1e9) + (long long)(7);

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> v(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> v[i];

    map<int, int> m;
    for (auto x : v)
      m[x]++;

    int M = -1;
    for (auto it : m) {
      M = max(M, it.second);
    }

    if (n >= 2 && m.size() == n) {
      cout << 1 << endl;
      continue;
    }

    if (m.size() > M) {
      cout << M << endl;
    } else if (m.size() == M) {
      cout << M - 1 << endl;
    } else {
      cout << m.size() << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version of the program has better memory usage and is easier to read.
