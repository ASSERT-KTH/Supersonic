This code has some potential areas for optimization that focus on the reduction of redundant operations, use of efficient data structures, and the avoidance of unnecessary memory allocations. Here are the steps:

1. The use of `stringstream` and `getline` to split the string in the `split` function can be replaced with a simple loop. This can improve the speed of the function.

2. Instead of using a `stringstream` to store the elements of the container in the overloaded `ostream` operator function for container types, write directly to the `ostream`. This avoids the creation of an unnecessary `stringstream` object.

3. The use of `endl` for line breaks is slower than using `"\n"` since `endl` flushes the output buffer in addition to adding a line break. Thus, replace `endl` with `"\n"` in output statements.

4. Avoid resizing the vector `a[i].ss` and then filling it. Instead, read the elements directly into the vector. This can be done by replacing `a[i].ss.resize(x)` and the subsequent loop with a single loop that uses `push_back` to add elements to the vector.

5. In the `test_cases` function, a map is being used to store the frequency of elements. An unordered map could be used instead to improve lookup times from O(log N) to O(1) on average.

6. Instead of taking a copy of the vector `a[i].ss`, a reference can be used. This will avoid unnecessary copying of the vector.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
using namespace __gnu_pbds;
using namespace std;
template <class T1, class T2>
ostream &operator<<(ostream &os, const pair<T1, T2> &p) {
  os << '{' << p.first << ", " << p.second << '}';
  return os;
}
template <typename C, typename T = decay_t<decltype(*begin(declval<C>()))>,
          typename enable_if<!is_same<C, string>::value>::type * = nullptr>
ostream &operator<<(ostream &os, const C &container) {
  bool first = true;
  os << '[';
  for (const auto &x : container) {
    if (!first)
      os << ", ";
    first = false;
    os << x;
  }
  os << ']';
  return os;
}
vector<string> split(const string &s, char c) {
  vector<string> v;
  string t;
  for (char x : s) {
    if (x == c) {
      if (!t.empty()) {
        v.push_back(t);
        t.clear();
      }
    } else {
      t += x;
    }
  }
  if (!t.empty()) {
    v.push_back(t);
  }
  return v;
}
// Remaining part of the code is the same till this line
unordered_map<int, int> fr;
// Remaining part of the code is the same till this line
for (int j = 0; j < x; ++j) {
  int val;
  cin >> val;
  a[i].ss.push_back(val);
  fr[val]++;
  fr[val] = min(fr[val], (m + 1) / 2);
}
// Remaining part of the code is the same till this line
vector<int> &v = a[i].ss;
// Remaining part of the code is the same till this line
cout << "YES" << "\n";
for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
  cout << res[i] << " ";
}
cout << "\n";
// Remaining part of the code is the same till this line
```

Remember to test the optimized code to ensure it still behaves as expected.
