This program is highly optimized from the start. However, I can suggest a few micro-optimizations, such as preallocating memory for vectors and reducing the usage of expensive operations such as division and modulus. Here are the steps:

1. Preallocate memory for vectors: When you know the size of the vector in advance, it's a good idea to preallocate memory to avoid reallocations. For the vector `res`, we can use `vector<int> res(m, -1);` to initialize and preallocate memory at once.

2. Use bitwise shift instead of division or modulus by powers of 2: Bitwise shift operations are faster than division or modulus. In the line `fr[x] = min(fr[x], (m + 1) / 2);`, we can use a right shift to divide by 2.

3. Avoid expensive operations inside loops: In the line `sort(ALL(a), [&](auto &a, auto &b) { return a.ss.size() < b.ss.size(); });`, the size operation is called for each comparison in the sort. It's better to calculate the sizes once outside the sort function and then use this information inside the sort function.

Now, let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>

using namespace __gnu_pbds;
using namespace std;

// The rest of the program remains the same until the test_cases() function

void test_cases() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  vector<pair<int, vector<int>>> a(m);
  map<int, int> fr;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    a[i].ff = i;
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    a[i].ss.resize(x);
    for (auto &x : a[i].ss) {
      cin >> x;
      fr[x]++;
      fr[x] = min(fr[x], m + 1 >> 1); // Bitwise shift instead of division
    }
  }
  vector<int> sizes(m); // Precompute sizes
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    sizes[i] = a[i].ss.size();
  }
  sort(ALL(a), [&](auto &a, auto &b) { return sizes[a.ff] < sizes[b.ff]; }); // Use precomputed sizes
  vector<int> res(m, -1); // Preallocate memory
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int idx = a[i].ff;
    vector<int> v = a[i].ss;
    int mn = 1e18;
    for (int x : v) {
      if (fr[x] > 0) {
        mn = min(mn, fr[x]);
      }
    }
    // The rest of the program remains the same
  }
  // ...
}
// The rest of the program remains the same
```

Keep in mind that these optimizations are relatively small and might not significantly improve the program's performance. The effect of these optimizations might also vary depending on the compiler and the specific problem inputs.
