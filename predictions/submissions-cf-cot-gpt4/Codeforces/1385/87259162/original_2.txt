This program appears to implement a topological sort algorithm on a directed graph, as well as other operations related to the graph processing. Here are some potential optimizations:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This is a header file that includes most of the standard library headers in C++. It's convenient because you don't have to think about which headers you need, but it can slow down compilation time because it includes a lot of unnecessary stuff. Instead, include only the headers you need.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This can lead to name conflicts if the standard library has a function or class with the same name as one of yours. It's better to use the `std::` prefix when you want to use something from the standard library.

3. Avoid using typedefs for common types: This can make your code harder to read for other people, because they have to remember what your typedefs mean. Just use the types directly.

4. Avoid macros: Macros can make your code harder to read and debug. Use functions or constants instead.

5. Avoid using `getchar` and `putchar` for input and output: These functions are very low-level and can make your code harder to read. Use the `>>` and `<<` operators with `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead.

6. Preallocate memory for vectors: If you know the maximum size of your vectors, you can use the `reserve` function to preallocate memory for them. This can reduce the number of memory allocations and deallocations, which can speed up your program.

7. Avoid recalculating values: In your `compute` function, you calculate `topo_order[ts[i]]` twice. You can store the result in a variable and reuse it.

8. Use `std::endl` sparingly: `std::endl` not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output buffer, which can be slow. It's usually better to use `'\n'` for newline.

Here's an optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

const int len = 200001;
std::vector<int> g[len];
std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> directed_edges, undirected_edges;
std::vector<int> ts;
int *topo_order;
bool possible;

void dfs(int node, std::vector<bool> &visited) {
  visited[node] = true;
  for (int next : g[node]) {
    if (!visited[next]) {
      dfs(next, visited);
    }
  }
  ts.push_back(node);
}

void compute(int n, int m) {
  std::vector<bool> visited(n + 1, false);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    if (!visited[i]) {
      dfs(i, visited);
    }
  }
  int order = 0;
  for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; --i) { 
    topo_order[ts[i]] = order++;
  }
  for (const auto &e : directed_edges) {
    if (topo_order[e.first] > topo_order[e.second]) {
      possible = false;
      break;
    }
  }
  if (!possible) {
    std::cout << "NO\n";
    return;
  }
  std::cout << "YES\n";
  for (const auto &p : directed_edges) {
    std::cout << p.first << " " << p.second << '\n';
  }
  for (const auto &p : undirected_edges) {
    if (topo_order[p.first] < topo_order[p.second]) {
      std::cout << p.first << " " << p.second << '\n';
    } else {
      std::cout << p.second << " " << p.first << '\n';
    }
  }
  free(topo_order);
}

void read_and_query() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) { 
    g[i].clear(); 
  }
  int t, u, v;
  directed_edges.clear();
  undirected_edges.clear();
  ts.clear();
  topo_order = (int *)calloc(n + 1, sizeof(int));
  possible = true;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    std::cin >> t >> u >> v;
    if (t == 0) {
      undirected_edges.push_back({u, v});
    } else {
      directed_edges.push_back({u, v});
      g[u].push_back(v);
    }
  }
  compute(n, m);
}

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    read_and_query();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program is simpler and easier to read, and it should also be faster because it avoids unnecessary work.
