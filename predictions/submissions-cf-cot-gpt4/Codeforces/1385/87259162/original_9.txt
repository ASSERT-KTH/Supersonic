The given program is an implementation of an algorithm to determine if a directed acyclic graph (DAG) can be formed from the given directed and undirected edges. 

The program can be optimized for running time and memory usage in the following ways:

1. Avoid unnecessary use of macros: Macros like FORb and FORe are just for loops. They can be replaced with for loops. This is more of a code readability improvement than a performance optimization.

2. Avoid unnecessary vector clearances: In the function "read_and_query", vectors g, directed_edges, undirected_edges, and ts are cleared before every query. But since these vectors are not used after the computation for a query, they don't need to be cleared before every query. They can be local to the "read_and_query" function.

3. Avoid dynamic allocation: The "topo_order" array is dynamically allocated for each query. Since its size is known to be "n+1", it can be allocated on the stack which will avoid the overhead of dynamic allocation and deallocation.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int LL;
typedef unsigned long long ULL;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<LL, LL> plli;
typedef pair<double, double> pdd;

#define MOD1 1000000007LL
#define MOD2 998244353LL
#define EPSILON 0.00001
#define BIG INT_MAX
#define SMALL INT_MIN

// The rest of the functions are omitted for brevity

void compute(int n, int m, vector<int>& ts, vector<pii>& directed_edges, vector<pii>& undirected_edges, int* topo_order, bool& possible, vector<int>* g) {
  vector<bool> visited(n + 1, false);
  for(int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
    if (!visited[i]) {
      dfs(i, visited, g, ts);
    }
  }
  int order = 0;
  for(int i=n-1; i>=0; i--) { topo_order[ts[i]] = order++; }
  for (auto &e : directed_edges) {
    if (topo_order[e.first] > topo_order[e.second]) {
      possible = false;
      break;
    }
  }
  if (!possible) {
    cout << "NO" << endl;
    return;
  }
  cout << "YES" << endl;
  for (auto &p : directed_edges) {
    cout << p.first << " " << p.second << endl;
  }
  for (auto &p : undirected_edges) {
    if (topo_order[p.first] < topo_order[p.second]) {
      cout << p.first << " " << p.second << endl;
    } else {
      cout << p.second << " " << p.first << endl;
    }
  }
}

void read_and_query() {
  int n, m;
  is(n);
  is(m);
  vector<int> g[n+1];
  int t, u, v;
  vector<pii> directed_edges, undirected_edges;
  vector<int> ts;
  int topo_order[n + 1] = {0};
  bool possible = true;
  for(int i=0; i<m; i++) {
    is(t);
    is(u);
    is(v);
    if (t == 0) {
      undirected_edges.push_back({u, v});
    } else {
      directed_edges.push_back({u, v});
      g[u].push_back(v);
    }
  }
  compute(n, m, ts, directed_edges, undirected_edges, topo_order, possible, g);
}

int main() {
  int t;
  is(t);
  while (t--) {
    read_and_query();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the original program had some functions not included in the provided code. For brevity, I have omitted these functions in the optimized code too.
