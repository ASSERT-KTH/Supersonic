This program is a graph algorithm. It uses depth-first search to check if a cycle exists in the graph, and if it doesn't, it reverses the topological sort of the nodes and prints the graph's edges in a particular order. The main optimization to be made here is to avoid redundant computations and unnecessary memory usage.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the #define statements: These macros are used extensively, which can make the code hard to read and debug. We should replace them with their actual code. There is a slight performance overhead when using macros in C/C++.

2. Use 'bool' instead of 'int' for boolean values: The 'int' type uses more memory than the 'bool' type. We should replace 'int' with 'bool' for variables that store boolean values to save memory.

3. Use 'auto' keyword: When we know the type of a variable from its initializer, we can use the 'auto' keyword to have the compiler deduce its type. This can improve code readability and maintainability.

4. Avoid using 'endl': The 'endl' manipulator performs a newline operation and then a flush operation on the stream. A flush operation is usually a costly operation in terms of execution time. Instead, we can use '\n', which only performs a newline operation.

5. Remove the 'precise' macro: This macro is not used in the program, so we can safely remove it to reduce the size of the code.

6. Use 'constexpr' for 'MOD': The 'MOD' constant is known at compile time, so we can make it a 'constexpr' to ensure it's evaluated at compile time.

7. Remove the 'fastio' macro: 'ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);' This line is used to speed up cin/cout, but it's not needed in this program because we're not using cin/cout in a loop. So we can safely remove it.

8. Remove the 'debug' and 'err' macros: These macros are used for debugging and error checking, but they're not used in this program. So we can safely remove them.

9. Remove the 'all' macro: This macro is only used once in the program, so we can replace it with its actual code to improve code readability.

10. Efficient use of 'for' loops: In C++, if you have a for loop that iterates over a container, you can use a range-based for loop instead, which is easier to read and less error-prone.
