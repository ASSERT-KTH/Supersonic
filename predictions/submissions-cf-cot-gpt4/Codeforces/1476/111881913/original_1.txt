The given C/C++ program reads an integer `t` and then `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an array of unsigned long long integers and performs some operations on them. To optimize this program, we can follow these steps:

1. **Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`**: This header file includes almost all the standard C++ libraries, which increases the compilation time. Include only those libraries which are required by your program.

2. **Avoid using `using namespace std`**: This statement brings all the elements in the std namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to name conflicts. It's better to use `std::` where needed.

3. **Use faster I/O methods**: The `cin` and `cout` operations are slower compared to scanf() and printf(). You can make them faster by using `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);`.

4. **Reduce the number of divisions and modulus operations**: Division and modulus operations are much slower than addition and subtraction. You can reduce the number of division and modulus operations by using a variable to store the result of `x / k`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

#define ull unsigned long long int

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    ull n, k;
    std::cin >> n >> k;
    std::vector<ull> v(n);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> v[i];
    }
    
    ull ans = 0;
    ull sum = v[0];

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      if ((v[i] * 100) > sum * k) {
        ull x = v[i] * 100 - sum * k;
        ull division_result = x / k;
        
        if (x % k != 0) {
          division_result++;
        }
        
        ans += division_result;
        sum += division_result;
      }
      
      sum += v[i];
    }
    
    std::cout << ans << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```
