The given code implements a problem where there is an array of unsigned long long integers and for each element, it checks if the current number * 100 is greater than the sum of all previous numbers times k. If the condition is true, it calculates a value x and adds `x/k` or `x/k + 1` to both `ans` and `sum` based on whether `x` is divisible by `k` or not.

The code is already quite optimized, but there are a few areas where it can be slightly improved:

- The main optimization that can be done is removing the `if (x % k != 0)` check inside the loop. The `x/k + 1` can be replaced by `(x + k - 1)/k` which will give the same result but without the need to check if `x` is divisible by `k` or not. This will reduce many modulus operations which are costlier than other basic operations.

- Another improvement could be to use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` at the beginning of the main function. This will speed up the I/O operations in the code.

Here is the optimized code:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ull unsigned long long int
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ull n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<ull> v(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> v[i];
    }
    ull ans = 0;
    ull sum = v[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      if ((v[i] * 100) > sum * k) {
        ull x = v[i] * 100 - sum * k;
        ull add = (x + k - 1) / k;
        ans += add;
        sum += add;
      }
      sum += v[i];
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
Please note that optimizing code for speed may sometimes increase memory usage and vice versa. In this case, the code is optimized for speed and does not increase memory usage.
