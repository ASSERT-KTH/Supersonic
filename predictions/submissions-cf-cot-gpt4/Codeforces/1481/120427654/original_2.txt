The given C++ code is a complex one. Here are some optimizations that we can make:

1. **Avoid Using Too Many Global Variables**: Global variables consume memory for the entire duration of program execution. Therefore, itâ€™s better to avoid them when possible. In this code, variables like 'cul', 'cc', etc. are declared globally, which can be avoided to save memory.

2. **Avoid Using the 'std' Namespace Globally**: Using the 'std' namespace globally can lead to name conflicts, as the compiler can get confused between the 'std' version of the function and the user-defined one.

3. **Avoid Unnecessary Use of Data Structures**: The code uses a map 'mp' where it could use a simple array or vector.

4. **Use 'ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);'**: These lines turn off the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding C standard streams. This can make 'cin' and 'cout' more efficient.

5. **Reuse Variables Whenever Possible**: In the code, the variable 'x' is used to store different data in different contexts. This can be optimized by reusing the variable.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define debug(x) cerr << #x << " " << x << "\n"
#define debugs(x) cerr << #x << " " << x << " "
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast,unroll-loops")
#pragma GCC target("sse,sse2,sse3,ssse3,sse4,popcnt,abm,mmx,avx,tune=native")
const ll NMAX = 100001;
const ll INF = (1LL << 60);
const ll MOD = 1000000007;
const ll BLOCK = 518;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  std::vector<int> v[NMAX], lvl[NMAX], levelecu[NMAX];
  std::map<int, int> mp;
  std::map<int, int> l;
  char cul[NMAX];
  int cc[NMAX];
  int depth, dp[BLOCK][NMAX], cnt[NMAX];
  int n, x;

  cin >> n >> x;
  int a = x, b = n - x;

  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> x;
    v[x].push_back(i);
    v[i].push_back(x);
  }

  // Rest of the code remains same
  // ...

  return 0;
}
```

Note: The actual optimization highly depends on the specific logic of the code, and it is not possible to provide a full optimized version without deeply understanding the logic of the code. The provided optimizations are general practices and may not significantly improve the efficiency of this specific code.
