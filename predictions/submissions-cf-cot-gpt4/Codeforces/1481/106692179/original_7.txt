The code can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Avoid Dynamic memory allocation: In this code, the dynamic memory allocation using variable length arrays (VLA) is done for `h` and `diff`. VLAs are generally not recommended in C++ as they can lead to stack overflows. We can use `std::vector` for dynamic arrays. This will not only prevent stack overflow but also optimize memory usage.

2. Avoid multiple passes over an array: In this code, there are multiple passes over the array h. Instead of using another pass to calculate the sum of `diff`, we can do the sum calculation in the same pass as the calculation of `diff`.

3. The inner loop can be optimized. During each iteration of the while loop, the code searches for the first position where `h[i] < h[i+1]`. Once this position is found, `h[i]` is incremented and the search starts from the beginning of the array. This can be optimized by remembering the last position where `h[i] < h[i+1]` was found and resume the search from the next position. This way, we avoid checking the positions we have already checked in previous iterations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long int
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int tc;
  cin >> tc;
  while (tc--) {
    ll k, sum = 0;
    int n;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<ll> h(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> h[i];
    }
    ll maax = h[n - 1];
    vector<ll> diff(n, 0);
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (h[i] > maax) {
        maax = h[i];
      } else {
        diff[i] = maax - h[i];
        sum += diff[i];
      }
    }
    if (sum < k) {
      cout << "-1\n";
      continue;
    }
    int flag = 0;
    ll ans;
    int start = 0;
    while (k--) {
      flag = 1;
      for (int i = start; i < n; i++) {
        if (i != n - 1 && h[i] < h[i + 1]) {
          h[i]++;
          ans = i + 1;
          flag = 0;
          start = i;
          break;
        }
      }
      if (flag == 1)
          break;
    }
    if (flag == 1)
      cout << "-1\n";
    else
      cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code reduces the number of passes over the array, removes the risk of stack overflow by avoiding VLAs, and reduces the number of iterations in the inner loop.
