Let's optimize the given C/C++ program.

Optimization Steps:
1. Instead of using dynamic arrays (like `ll h[n]` and `ll diff[n]`), we can use `std::vector`. Dynamic arrays in C++ are not recommended as they can lead to undefined behavior. In addition, allocating large arrays on the stack can cause a stack overflow. Vectors are safer and more flexible.

2. In the given code, there is a nested loop where the outer loop runs `k` times and the inner loop runs `n` times. This makes the time complexity of this section O(k*n), which can be expensive when k and n are large. However, as per the given problem, we can optimize this by breaking the loop as soon as we find a valid `i` such that `h[i] < h[i + 1]`. To do this efficiently, we can maintain a variable that keeps track of the last position where we found `h[i] < h[i + 1]`. This way, in the next iteration, we can start directly from this position instead of starting from 0. This will significantly reduce the number of iterations and thus the running time.

3. We can combine the two separate loops of `diff` and `sum` into one. This will reduce the number of iterations over the `n` elements from 2 to 1.

4. We don't need to maintain the `diff` array (or vector) at all. We can calculate the sum directly in the loop where we calculate the `diff`.

Based on these optimization steps, the optimized program would look like this:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long int
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int tc;
  cin >> tc;
  while (tc--) {
    ll k, sum = 0;
    int n;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<ll> h(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> h[i];
    }
    ll maax = h[n - 1];
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (h[i] > maax) {
        maax = h[i];
        continue;
      } else {
        sum += maax - h[i];
      }
    }
    if (sum < k) {
      cout << "-1\n";
      continue;
    }
    int flag = 0;
    ll ans;
    int last_i = 0;  // to keep track of the last valid `i`
    while (k--) {
      flag = 1;
      for (int i = last_i; i < n; i++) {
        if (i != n - 1 && h[i] < h[i + 1]) {
          h[i]++;
          ans = i + 1;
          last_i = i;  // update the last valid `i`
          flag = 0;
          break;
        }
      }
      if (flag == 1)
        break;
    }
    if (flag == 1)
      cout << "-1\n";
    else
      cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
