The given C/C++ program contains a few inefficient usages that can be improved for better running time and memory usage:

1. Usage of Variable Length Arrays (VLA): This program uses VLAs which are not officially supported in C++. Moreover, VLAs are stored on the stack, which is limited in size. It would be more efficient to use the std::vector container which is dynamically allocated and also provides additional functionality.

2. Unnecessary computations: The program is performing unnecessary computations inside the while(k--) loop. The loop iterates over the array for each decrement of k. We can reduce this by maintaining a pointer to the current position where the increment operation was last performed. This way, we don't have to start from the beginning for each decrement of k.

3. Redundant flag checking: The flag is checked in each loop iteration after every h[i] increment. This can be avoided by breaking the loop when the flag is set to 1.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <iostream>
#define ll long long int
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int tc;
  cin >> tc;
  while (tc--) {
    ll k, sum = 0;
    int n;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<ll> h(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> h[i];
    }
    ll maax = h[n - 1];
    vector<ll> diff(n, 0);
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (h[i] > maax) {
        maax = h[i];
        continue;
      } else {
        diff[i] = maax - h[i];
      }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      sum += diff[i];
    if (sum < k) {
      cout << "-1\n";
      continue;
    }
    int last_pos = 0;
    while (k--) {
      bool incremented = false;
      for (int i = last_pos; i < n; i++) {
        if (i != n - 1 && h[i] < h[i + 1]) {
          h[i]++;
          last_pos = i;
          incremented = true;
          break;
        }
      }
      if (!incremented) {
        cout << "-1\n";
        break;
      }
    }
    if (k >= 0)
      cout << last_pos + 1 << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, vector replaces the VLA for better memory usage and handling. The additional last_pos variable is used to remember the last position where the increment happened. The unnecessary flag variable is removed and replaced with a simple break statement. The result is only printed if the k has reached zero, which eliminates the unnecessary flag checking after each h[i] increment. These modifications lead to a more efficient and faster program.
