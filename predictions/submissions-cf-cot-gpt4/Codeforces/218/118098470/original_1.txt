First, let's break down the program and understand what it's doing. 

1. The program reads two integer inputs (n, m) and then reads m integers into the array a.

2. It then sorts the array in ascending order.

3. The first loop calculates the sum of a[i] - j for each element of the array until k (which is initially equal to n) reaches 0.

4. The second loop calculates sum1 by adding the maximum element of the array to sum1 and then reducing the maximum element by 1, this continues until i is less than or equal to n.

The main issue with this code is the inefficient use of loops and the max_element function. The max_element function searches through the entire array to find the maximum element for each iteration, which results in a time complexity of O(n^2).

To optimize the code:

1. We can avoid using the max_element function in the second loop by reversing the sort order to descending. This way, the maximum element is always at the beginning of the array.

2. We can avoid the inner loop in the first loop by using a formula to calculate the sum. The sum of the first n numbers is (n*(n+1))/2. So the sum of the numbers from 1 to a[i] is (a[i]*(a[i]+1))/2 and the sum of the numbers from 1 to j is (j*(j+1))/2. Therefore, the sum of the numbers from j+1 to a[i] is (a[i]*(a[i]+1))/2 - (j*(j+1))/2.

3. We can use std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(NULL); to speed up the cin and cout operations.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, m, sum = 0, sum1 = 0, k;
  cin >> n >> m;
  vector<int> a(m+1);
  k = n;
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  sort(a.rbegin(), a.rend()-1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    int min_j = min(k, a[i]);
    sum += a[i]*min_j - min_j*(min_j-1)/2;
    k -= min_j;
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sum1 += a[1];
    a[1]--;
    if (a[1] < a[2]) {
      swap(a[1], a[2]);
    }
  }
  cout << sum1 << " " << sum << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Note that we have used std::vector for dynamic allocation of memory which will reduce the memory footprint when m is much less than 1020. The sort function is now sorting in descending order, the inner loop in the first loop is removed and replaced by a formula, and the max_element function in the second loop is replaced by accessing the first element of the array.
