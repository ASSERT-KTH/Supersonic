This C++ program is built to solve a problem, which seems to be related to some kind of scheduling or allocation problem. The main optimization opportunity here is to reduce the time complexity of the inner loop in your code. 

Currently, you have a nested loop where for each `i` (1 to `m`), you loop over `j` from `a[i][1]` to `a[i][0]`. This can lead to time complexity of O(n*m) in the worst case. To avoid this, you can use a priority queue to keep track of the current minimum `j` for each `i`. 

Instead of checking for each `j` whether `sch[j]` is 0 or not, you can maintain a priority queue of all `j` such that `sch[j]` is 0. This way, you can just pop out the minimum `j` until `cnt` becomes 0. 

You have also used the `vector<vector<ll>> a(m + 1, vector<ll>(4, 0));` where you use only three indices i.e., 0, 1, and 2. The 3rd index is not used in the program. So, the size of vector inside could be reduced to 3. 

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int
#define INF LLONG_MAX
#define IOS ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);cin.tie(NULL);cout.tie(NULL);

struct Compare {
    bool operator() (const ll& a, const ll& b) {
        return a > b;
    }
};

int main() {
  IOS 
  ll n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  vector<vector<ll>> a(m + 1, vector<ll>(3, 0));
  ll i = 0;
  ll sch[n + 1] = {0};
  priority_queue<ll, vector<ll>, Compare> pq;

  for (i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    cin >> a[i][1] >> a[i][0] >> a[i][2];
    sch[a[i][0]] = m + 1;
    a[i][2] = i;
  }
  
  for (i = 1; i <=n; i++) {
      if (!sch[i]) {
          pq.push(i);
      }
  }

  sort(a.begin() + 1, a.end());

  for (i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    ll cnt = a[i][2];
    while (!pq.empty() && pq.top() < a[i][0] && cnt > 0) {
      cnt--;
      sch[pq.top()] = a[i][2];
      pq.pop();
    }
    if (cnt) {
      cout << -1;
      return 0;
    }
  }
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    cout << sch[i] << " ";
}
```
