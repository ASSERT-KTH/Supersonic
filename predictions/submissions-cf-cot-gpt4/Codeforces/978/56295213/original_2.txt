This program reads a set of intervals and distributes them. The intervals are sorted by the end of each interval. After sorting, the program iterates the intervals and assigns them to the empty slots. If there is no enough slot for an interval, the program ends up with `-1`.

Here are the optimization steps:
1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is quite heavy, as it includes almost all standard library headers. It's better to include only the necessary headers.
2. The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);` part is used to make the program faster by disconnecting C++ standard streams from their C counterparts. However, in this program, only `cout` is used and not `cin`. So, we can remove `cin.tie(NULL);`.
3. The `vector<vector<ll>> a(m + 1, vector<ll>(4, 0));` is used to store the intervals, but the 0th index is never used. A better approach would be to use 1-based indexing and create the vector of size `m` instead of `m + 1`.
4. The `ll sch[n + 1] = {0};` is a VLA (Variable Length Array), which is not a standard C++. It would be better to use `vector<ll> sch(n + 1, 0);`.
5. The `sort(a.begin() + 1, a.end());` is sorting the entire vector, but the 0th index is never used. It's better to sort from `a.begin()` to `a.end()` after adjusting the vector size as per point 3.
6. The `if (!cnt)` can be moved out of the nested loop to avoid unnecessary loop iterations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#define ll long long int
#define pb push_back
#define INF LLONG_MAX
#define MOD 1e9 + 7
#define fir first
#define sec second
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  ll n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  vector<vector<ll>> a(m, vector<ll>(4, 0));
  vector<ll> sch(n + 1, 0);
  for (ll i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> a[i][1] >> a[i][0] >> a[i][2];
    sch[a[i][0]] = m + 1;
    a[i][3] = i + 1;
  }
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  for (ll i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    ll cnt = a[i][2];
    for (ll j = a[i][1]; j < a[i][0]; j++) {
      if (!sch[j]) {
        cnt--;
        sch[j] = a[i][3];
      }
      if (!cnt)
        break;
    }
    if (cnt) {
      cout << -1;
      return 0;
    }
  }
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    cout << sch[i] << " ";
}
```
Please note that this optimization mainly focuses on reducing memory usage and improving readability, while the time complexity of the main logic of the program remains unchanged.
