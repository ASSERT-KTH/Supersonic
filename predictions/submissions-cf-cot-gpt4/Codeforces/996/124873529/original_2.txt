The above code seems to be solving a specific problem and it is currently optimized in terms of time complexity. However, there are certain improvements that can be made which can improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

Here are the possible optimization steps:

1. Remove unused functions, typedefs, and macros: The given code has a lot of unused functions, typedefs, and macros. Including unused code increases the overall size of the compiled output and makes the code less readable. We can remove the unused `power`, `mod`, and `fun` functions. We can also remove unused typedefs like `ll`, `ld`, `pb`, `vint`, `vll`, `vld`, `vbool`, `vpii`, `vpll`, `unm`, `uns`, `T(T)`, `retf(flag, x)`, `forv(arr)`, `forin(arr)`, `ret(x)`, `F`, `S`.

2. Avoid using macros: Using macros can make the code harder to read and debug. It's better to use functions and constants where possible.

3. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This is a header file that includes almost all standard library header files. Including this file can significantly increase compile time because it includes a lot of unnecessary code. It's better to include only the necessary header files.

4. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This can cause name conflicts if the standard library has an identifier that's the same as one in your code.

Here is the optimized version of the given code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <climits>

void solve();

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);
  solve();
  return 0;
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<long long> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> arr[i];
    arr[i] -= i;
    if (arr[i] <= 0) {
      std::cout << i + 1 << "\n";
      return;
    }
    arr[i] = ceil(double(arr[i]) / n);
  }
  int mn = INT_MAX, mni;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (mn > arr[i]) {
      mn = arr[i];
      mni = i;
    }
  }
  std::cout << mni + 1;
}
```

This version of the code is simpler, more readable, and should have the same performance as the original version.
