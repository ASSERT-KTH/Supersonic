Before we start optimizing this program, let's understand what it does:

1. It reads an integer `t` from the standard input which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads two sequences of integers, counts the number of odd and even integers in each sequence, and multiplies these counts together in a certain way.

The main issues that can affect the performance of this program are:

1. I/O operations, which are expensive in terms of time.
2. Use of the modulo operator, which is more expensive than bitwise operators.

Here are the steps to optimize this program:

1. Instead of using `std::endl`, use `"\n"`. The `std::endl` not only inserts a newline but also flushes the output buffer, which is unnecessary and can degrade performance.

2. Instead of using the modulo operator to check if a number is even or odd, use a bitwise AND operation with `1`. This works because the binary representation of all odd numbers ends with `1` and all even numbers end with `0`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  long long t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    long long temp, n, m, a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> temp;
      (temp & 1) ? a++ : c++;
    }
    cin >> m;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      cin >> temp;
      (temp & 1) ? b++ : d++;
    }
    cout << a * b + c * d << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program should run faster and use less memory than the original one. The actual performance gain depends on the size of the input data and the specific hardware and software environment.
