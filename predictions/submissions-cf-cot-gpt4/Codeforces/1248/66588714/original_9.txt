The given program is already quite optimized. However, a small change can be made to slightly increase its efficiency. 

The modulus operator (`%`) is more computationally expensive than bitwise operators. In the program, we use `temp % 2` to check for evenness or oddness. As we know, if the last bit of a number is 1, it's an odd number; otherwise, it's even. So we can use bitwise AND operator (`&`) instead of modulus to check for evenness or oddness. 

We can replace `temp % 2` with `temp & 1`.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    long long temp, n, m, a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> temp;
      temp & 1 ? a++ : c++;
    }
    cin >> m;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      cin >> temp;
      temp & 1 ? b++ : d++;
    }
    cout << a * b + c * d << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimization will have a noticeable impact only if `n` and `m` are significantly large.
