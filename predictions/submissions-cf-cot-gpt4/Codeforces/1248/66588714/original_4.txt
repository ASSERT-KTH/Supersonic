The program as it is does not have many opportunities for direct optimization as the time complexity is already O(n) which is pretty optimal. However, there are a few points that can be improved:

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is quite large and includes much more than what is actually needed. It's better to include only the necessary header files to reduce memory usage and compile time. 

2. `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);`: These lines can be removed as the program is not alternating between standard input/output and C++ streams.

3. Variable declaration: It may help to declare `temp` only when it is needed inside the loops.

4. Using `'\n'` instead of `endl`. This is already in the code and it's a good practice as `endl` includes a flush operation which can slow down programs significantly when used in loops.

After applying these changes, the optimized program would look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    long long n, m, a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      long long temp;
      cin >> temp;
      temp % 2 ? a++ : c++;
    }
    cin >> m;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      long long temp;
      cin >> temp;
      temp % 2 ? b++ : d++;
    }
    cout << a * b + c * d << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Remember that these optimizations may not have a noticeable effect on the performance of the program because the original program already has a good time complexity. The most significant change here is removing the `bits/stdc++.h` header to reduce the compile time and memory usage.
