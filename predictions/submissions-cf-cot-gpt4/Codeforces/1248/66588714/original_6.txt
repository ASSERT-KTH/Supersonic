This C++ program is already quite optimized, but there are a few minor improvements that can be made.

1. Variables a, b, c, and d are initialized to zero and used only within the while loop. It would be slightly more efficient to declare these variables inside the loop. This way, the compiler doesn't need to store these variables in each iteration of the loop, reducing the memory usage slightly.

2. The usage of 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' variables can be optimized by declaring them as 'long long'. This way, the multiplication of these variables will not overflow for larger values.

3. The 'temp' variable is only used within the loops, so it would be more efficient to declare it inside each loop. This way, the compiler doesn't need to store this variable between iterations, reducing memory usage slightly.

4. The 'bits/stdc++.h' header file includes too many unnecessary header files which increases the compilation time. It's better to include only necessary header files like 'iostream'.

Here is the optimized version of the program with those improvements:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);
  
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    long long n, m, a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0;
    std::cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      long long temp;
      std::cin >> temp;
      temp % 2 ? a++ : c++;
    }
    std::cin >> m;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      long long temp;
      std::cin >> temp;
      temp % 2 ? b++ : d++;
    }
    std::cout << a * b + c * d << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The changes are quite minor and actual gain in efficiency may be negligible. It's always a good practice to use a profiler to actually measure the performance of your code.
