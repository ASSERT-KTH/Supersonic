This program is already quite optimized. The complexity is linear and it uses quite a small amount of memory. However, we can make few improvements:

1. We can remove the `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` and `cout.tie(NULL);` lines. These are typically included to speed up C++ I/O, but in this case, they may not make a significant difference and removing them may actually improve the readability of the code.
2. We can use bitwise operator instead of modulus for checking even and odd. Bitwise AND operation (&) with 1 will be faster than modulus (%) operation. If the number is odd, then the last bit of the binary representation is 1 and if the number is even, then the last bit is 0. So, we can use this property to check even or odd.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    long long temp, n, m, a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> temp;
      temp & 1 ? a++ : c++;
    }
    cin >> m;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      cin >> temp;
      temp & 1 ? b++ : d++;
    }
    cout << a * b + c * d << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
