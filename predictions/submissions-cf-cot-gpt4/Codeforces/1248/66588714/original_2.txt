This program seems to be well optimized, but there are a few minor modifications that can be done for better optimization:

1. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: This is quite a heavy include. It's much better to include only what you need. In this case, we can include `iostream` instead.

2. Variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`: Instead of declaring them as `long long`, we can declare them as `int` because these variables are for counting numbers and they will not exceed the range of int (2,147,483,647).

3. Use fast I/O: Instead of `cin` and `cout`, we can use `scanf` and `printf` for faster I/O operations.

4. Use bitwise operator: Instead of using the modulus operator (`%`), we can use bitwise AND (`&`) operator with 1 to check a number is even or odd. This will be faster than the modulus operator.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    int temp, n, m, a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &temp);
      (temp & 1) ? a++ : c++;
    }
    scanf("%d", &m);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &temp);
      (temp & 1) ? b++ : d++;
    }
    printf("%d\n", a * b + c * d);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
