The optimization of this program can be done in the following ways:

1. Remove unused macros and imports - The code contains a lot of unused macros and imports which are not used anywhere in the program. Removing these will reduce the memory usage and clean up the program.

2. Optimize the loop - Right now the loop is getting every number from n-1 to 1 and checking if its double is less than or equal to n. This is very inefficient. If you think about it, the greatest integer i such that 2*i is less than or equal to n is simply n/2. We don't need a loop for this. This will greatly speed up the program. 

3. Remove unnecessary else statement - The else statement with continue is not necessary as the loop will continue to the next iteration without it.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

typedef long long int ll;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        ll n;
        cin >> n;
        cout << n/2 << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```
In the optimized program, I only included the libraries and types that are actually being used in the program. The loop and the unnecessary else statement were removed and replaced with a simple division operation.
