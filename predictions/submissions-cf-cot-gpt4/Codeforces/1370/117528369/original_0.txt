This C++ program is already quite optimized in terms of its structure. However, there are a few changes that we can make to further optimize the program for running time and memory usage:

1. Remove unnecessary macros and typedefs:
    There are a number of macros and typedefs at the top of the program that are not used at all in the code. Removing these will make the code cleaner and easier to read, and it will also slightly reduce the memory usage.

2. Optimize the loop:
    In the main function, there is a loop that starts at 'n - 1' and decrements 'i' until it reaches 0. However, the loop immediately breaks when 'i * 2' is less than or equal to 'n'. This means that the loop is essentially trying to find the largest 'i' such that 'i * 2 <= n'. This can be computed directly without a loop as 'n / 2'.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    int ans = n / 2;
    cout << ans << "\n";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program should run faster and use less memory than the original version. The unnecessary macros and typedefs have been removed, and the loop has been replaced with a simple calculation.
