Step-by-step optimization:

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line includes many unnecessary headers that we don't use in our program. This can increase our program's compile time. We can replace it with only the necessary headers we are using.

2. There are some unnecessary macros defined that are not used in the program, such as `ll`, `ld`, `ff`, `ss`, `pb`, `mp`, `pll`, `vi`, `mii`, `pqb`, `pqs`, `setbits`, `mod`, `inf`, `ps`, `lcm`, `gcd`, `Y`, and `N`. We can remove them to clean up the code.

3. The `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` macro does nothing in this case, so we can remove it.

4. We can remove the `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`, `cin.tie(NULL);`, and `cout.tie(NULL);` lines. These lines are typically used to speed up I/O operations in competitive programming, but in this case, we are not doing any heavy I/O that would benefit from this speedup.

5. The `else { continue; }` statement is unnecessary because if the `if` condition is not met, the loop will naturally continue to the next iteration.

6. The `for` loop is doing unnecessary computations. The `num` variable is always `2*i` and we check if this `num` is less than or equal to `n`. But we start the loop with `i = n - 1` and decrement `i` in each iteration. So, the condition `num <= n` will always be true for the first iteration of the loop, and `ans` will be set to `n - 1` immediately. So, we can remove the loop and calculate `ans` directly.

After these optimizations, the optimized code is:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#define w(t) int t; cin >> t; while (t--)
using namespace std;

signed main() {
  w(t) {
    int n, ans;
    cin >> n;
    ans = n - 1;
    cout << ans << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Here, the `w(t)` macro is used to read the number of test cases `t` and run a `while` loop `t` times. Each iteration of the loop reads an integer `n` from the input, calculates `ans = n - 1`, and prints `ans`. The `signed main()` line declares the `main` function as returning an `int`. This is equivalent to just `int main()`.
