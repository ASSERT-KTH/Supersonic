Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unused macros and typedefs: There are many macros and typedefs which are not used in the program (like `ll`, `ld`, `ff`, `ss`, `pb`, `mp`, `pll`, `vi`, `mii`, `pqb`, `pqs`, `setbits`, `mod`, `inf`, `ps`, `lcm`, `gcd`, `Y`, and `N`). Removing them will reduce the memory footprint of the program.

2. Remove unnecessary 'else' block: The 'else' block containing 'continue' statement is unnecessary, as the flow of control would anyway go to the next iteration of the loop if the condition in the 'if' block is not satisfied. Removing this 'else' block will make the program cleaner and a bit faster.

3. Optimize the loop: The loop in the program is running from `n-1` to `1` just to find a number `i` such that `2*i <= n`. This can be directly calculated by doing `n/2`. This will greatly reduce the running time of the program for large values of `n`.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int ans = n / 2;
    cout << ans << "\n";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
