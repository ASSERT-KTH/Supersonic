The main optimization in this program will be in the loop section where we are iterating over from `n-1` to `1`. This loop is not required as we can directly calculate the value of `ans` by dividing `n` by `2`.

Let's break down the optimization:

1. Remove the for loop which is running from `n-1` to `1`.
2. Calculate `ans` by directly taking the floor value of `n/2` as `i*2 <= n` is equivalent to `i <= n/2`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define int long long
#define ld long double
#define ff first
#define ss second
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
#define pll pair<ll, ll>
#define vi vector<int>
#define mii map<int, int>
#define pqb priority_queue<int>
#define pqs priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>>
#define setbits(x) __buildin_popcountll(x)
#define mod 1000000007
#define inf 1e18
#define ps(x, y) fixed << setprecision(y) << x
#define w(t)                                                                   \
  int t;                                                                       \
  cin >> t;                                                                    \
  while (t--)
#define lcm(x, y) (x * y) / __gcd(x, y)
#define gcd(x, y) __gcd(x, y)
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
#endif
string Y = "YES\n";
string N = "NO\n";
signed main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  w(t) {
    int n, ans;
    cin >> n;
    ans = n / 2;
    cout << ans << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program is now more efficient in terms of running time as we have eliminated the need for a loop running `n` times. The memory usage remains the same.
