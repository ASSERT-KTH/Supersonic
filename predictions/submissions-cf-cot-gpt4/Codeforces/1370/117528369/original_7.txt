Step by step optimization:

1. Unnecessary Macros: The first thing I notice is that a lot of macros are defined but not used in the program which is unnecessary. The #define directive creates symbolic constants and functions. This can increase the size of the code, and hence removing the unused ones can save memory.

2. Unnecessary Variables: Avoid using unnecessary variables. In your case, variables `Y` and `N` are declared but never used.

3. Code Redundancy: The `else` condition in your loop is redundant, as it continues the loop which would happen by default.

4. Loop Optimization: The loop runs from `n-1` to 1 and checks if `i*2 <= n`. This check is unnecessary because `i` will always be less than or equal to `n/2`. So, we can simply initialize `ans` to `n/2`.

5. Include Necessary Libraries: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is actually a header file that includes most of the standard library headers in one go. This can be quite handy for competitive programming when you want to reduce the amount of typing, but it's generally considered bad practice because it includes a lot of unnecessary stuff and can significantly increase your compile time. So, only include the necessary libraries.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    cout << n / 2 << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
