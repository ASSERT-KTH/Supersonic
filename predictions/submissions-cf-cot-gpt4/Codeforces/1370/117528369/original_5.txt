1. Remove unused variables and macros: The given program contains many unused variables and macros. For example, macros like "ld", "ff", "ss", "pb", "mp", "pll", "vi", "mii", "pqb", "pqs", "setbits", "mod", "inf", "ps", "lcm", "gcd", and unused variables "Y" and "N" are not used anywhere in the program. Removing these will save memory.

2. Avoid using "bits/stdc++.h": This header file includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which can increase the compilation time and memory usage. Instead, include only the necessary header files.

3. Avoid using namespace std: Itâ€™s a bad practice to use "using namespace std" as it may lead to naming conflicts. It's better to use the std:: prefix when using the standard library functions.

4. Optimizing the loop: The loop from "n-1" to 1 checks if "i*2" is less than or equal to "n". This can be simplified and optimized by directly computing the value of "n/2" which will give the same result as the loop.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::cout << n / 2 << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program is more efficient in terms of both running time and memory usage. The loop has been replaced with a simple division operation, dramatically reducing the number of operations required. Moreover, the removal of unused variables and macros, the use of specific standard library headers instead of "bits/stdc++.h", and the avoidance of "using namespace std" also contribute to the optimization.
