The given code is already quite optimized. However, there is some room for minor improvements.

1. Redundant `#include`: The line `#include <ext/rope>` is redundant because the code does not use the rope data structure. Removing such redundant includes can save memory and decrease the compile time.

2. Using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(NULL);`: These lines can improve the input/output speed. They disable the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. By default, all standard streams are synchronized, which means that the C++ standard streams are coherent with the standard C streams. When we disable the synchronization, the C++ streams become faster.

3. The function `invGeneral` is written in a recursive way. It seems that it can be rewritten in an iterative way which can save some stack memory.

4. The function `query3` contains a for loop where it decreases and increases the `cnt[b][a[i]]`. It seems that it could be rewritten to avoid these operations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("O3")
#pragma GCC target("sse4")
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
using namespace std;
using namespace __gnu_pbds;
// ... rest of the code ...

void setIO(string s = "") {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  if (sz(s)) {
    setIn(s + ".in"), setOut(s + ".out");
  }
}

template <class T> T invGeneral(T a, T b) {
  T b0 = b, t, q;
  T x0 = 0, x1 = 1;
  if (b == 1) return 1;
  while (a > 1) {
    q = a / b;
    t = b, b = a % b, a = t;
    t = x0, x0 = x1 - q * x0, x1 = t;
  }
  if (x1 < 0) x1 += b0;
  return x1;
}

int query3(int y) {
  int mn = query2(y), ans = 0;
  int b = y / BLOCK;
  vi ok;
  trav(i, con[b]) {
    if (!CNT[b][i]) {
      in[b][i] = 0;
      continue;
    }
    ok.pb(i);
    if (i >= mn)
      ans += CNT[b][i];
  }
  swap(con[b], ok);
  int temp[MX] = {0};
  FOR(i, BLOCK * b + 1, y + 1) {
    temp[a[i]]++;
    ans += temp[a[i]] == mn;
  }
  return ans;
}

// ... rest of the code ...
```
Please note that you will need to test this code to make sure the changes don't break anything.
