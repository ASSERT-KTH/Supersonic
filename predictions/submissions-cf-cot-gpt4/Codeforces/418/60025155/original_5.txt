Optimization Steps:

1. Reduce the #includes: The program includes a large number of libraries even though they are not all used. This can be optimized by only including the necessary libraries. This will reduce the compile time and make the code cleaner and more readable.

2. Use const references in functions: When passing complex data structures to functions, it's better to pass them by const reference instead of passing them by value. This will avoid unnecessary copying of data, which can significantly improve the performance.

3. Avoid global variables: The program uses a large number of global variables. This can lead to problems such as naming conflicts and difficulties in understanding the program flow. So, it's generally a good idea to reduce the use of global variables. 

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations: There are some calculations that are performed multiple times. These calculations can be stored in a variable and reused to improve the performance.

5. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment for loop variables: Pre-increment (++i) is generally faster than post-increment (i++) because post-increment involves a copy of the variable.

Please note that given the complexity of the program and the lack of specific performance bottlenecks, these optimizations might not significantly improve the runtime or memory usage. However, they will make the code cleaner and more maintainable.

Optimized Program:

const int MOD = 1000000007;

}

int main() {
  setIO();

  const int MX = 100005;
  const int BLOCK = 1000;
  const int NUM = MX / BLOCK + 1;

  int cnt[NUM][2 * MX], CNT[NUM][MX], a[MX], A[MX];
  bitset<MX> in[NUM];
  vi con[NUM];

```

Note: For brevity, unchanged parts of the code are removed in the optimized version.
