The code you provided is already quite optimized. However, we can make a few small modifications that might improve performance slightly:

1. Reduce the number of global variables: In C++, global variables are stored in the heap, and accessing them can be slower than accessing local variables or class members. We can't completely eliminate global variables in this program, but we can try to limit their use wherever possible.

2. Remove unnecessary `using namespace` statements: This program imports three namespaces globally, which can lead to naming conflicts and confusion. Instead, we can import these namespaces only where they're needed.

3. Minimize the use of macros: This program uses several macros to shorten code, but that can make the code harder to understand and debug. Macros also have some drawbacks like they don't respect scope and they can't be debugged using a step debugger. Prefer inline functions, const variables, or enum classes instead.

4. Optimize `get()` function: The `get()` function could be optimized by using `try_emplace()` method instead of `count()` and `operator[]`. It performs the check and insertion in one go, saving us one lookup in the map.

Here is the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
...
map<int, int> m;
int N;
int get(int x) {
  auto result = m.try_emplace(x, m.size());
  return result.first->second;
}
...
int main() {
  setIO();
  re(N);
  FOR(i, 1, N + 1) {
    re(A[i]);
    a[i] = get(A[i]);
    upd(i, 1);
  }
  int M;
  re(M);
  F0R(i, M) {
    int t;
    re(t);
    if (t == 1) {
      int v, p;
      re(v, p);
      upd(p, -1);
      A[p] = v;
      a[p] = get(v);
      upd(p, 1);
    } else {
      int x, y;
      re(x, y);
      if (x == 1)
        ps(A[y]);
      else {
        if (x % 2 == 0)
          ps(query2(y));
        else
          ps(query3(y));
      }
    }
  }
}
...
```
Keep in mind that these optimizations might not lead to noticeable improvements, as the original program is already quite optimized. However, they can make the program easier to understand and maintain.
