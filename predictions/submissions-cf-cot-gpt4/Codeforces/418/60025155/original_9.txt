This program is quite complex and most of the optimization can be done by using better data structures and algorithms but looking at the problem statement to only make a small modification, there is not much that can be done other than removing unnecessary data types and macros that are not used in the code.

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unused datatypes and macros: 
   The program defined a number of datatypes and macros that were not used in the program. These include:
   - long double (ld)
   - complex<ld> (cd)
   - pair<ld, ld> (pd)
   - vector<ld> (vd)
   - vector<cd> (vcd)
   - FOR macro
   - FORd macro
   - lb macro
   - ub macro
   - sz macro
   - rsz macro
   - PI constant

2. Remove redundant includes:
   The program includes bits/stdc++.h which already includes all the standard libraries. So, we can remove other includes.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("O3")
#pragma GCC target("sse4")
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pi;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pl;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<ll> vl;
typedef vector<pi> vpi;
typedef vector<pl> vpl;
template <class T> using Tree = tree<T, null_type, less<T>, rb_tree_tag, tree_order_statistics_node_update>;
#define F0R(i, a) for (int i = 0; i < (a); i++)
#define F0Rd(i, a) for (int i = (a)-1; i >= 0; i--)
#define trav(a, x) for (auto &a : x)
#define mp make_pair
#define pb push_back
#define f first
#define s second
#define all(x) begin(x), end(x)
const int MOD = 1000000007;
const ll INF = 1e18;
template <class T> void ckmin(T &a, T b) { a = min(a, b); }
template <class T> void ckmax(T &a, T b) { a = max(a, b); }
// Rest of the code remains the same
```

This optimized code removes the unused datatypes and macros and redundant includes, which reduces the memory overhead of the program. However, please note that these optimizations will not significantly improve the running time of the program. To optimize the running time, we would need to optimize the algorithms and data structures used in the program.
