The C/C++ program you've provided reads 'n' integers from the user, stores them in an array, sorts the array, and then sums up the first 'm' negative integers (if any) in the sorted array, and prints the absolute value of that sum.

Here are some potential optimizations:

1. Avoid using Variable Length Array (VLA): The use of Variable Length Arrays (VLAs) is not a good practice as it's not part of the C++ standard, and it could cause a stack overflow for large 'n'. Instead, use std::vector<int> which is dynamically allocated.

2. Simplify the includes: The `<bits/stdc++.h>` is a GCC extension that includes too many headers unnecessarily, which can slow down the compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary libraries.

3. Avoid multiple passes over the data: Instead of sorting the whole array and then iterating over the sorted array to find the negative numbers, you can instead use a priority queue to keep track of the smallest 'm' numbers. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n log n) to O(n log m).

4. Use faster I/O methods: `std::cin` and `std::cout` are slower compared to `scanf` and `printf`. 

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;

  priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int num;
    cin >> num;
    if (minHeap.size() < m || num < minHeap.top()) {
      if (minHeap.size() == m) {
        minHeap.pop();
      }
      minHeap.push(num);
    }
  }

  int sum = 0;
  while (!minHeap.empty() && minHeap.top() < 0) {
    sum += minHeap.top();
    minHeap.pop();
  }

  cout << -sum << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation:
- The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` makes the input and output faster.
- A priority queue (minheap) is used to save the smallest 'm' numbers. If the size of the heap is 'm' and the current number is smaller than the top of the heap, the top of the heap is popped and the current number is pushed into the heap.
- After all the numbers have been processed, the negative numbers in the heap are summed. Since the heap could contain positive numbers, we check that `minHeap.top() < 0` before adding to the sum.
