The program can be optimized in several ways. Here are the steps of optimization:

1. Remove unnecessary libraries: The current program imports several libraries but it only uses a few of them. For instance, `<bits/stdc++.h>` is a heavy header file that includes almost all standard library. Including this may increase compilation time. So, we should only include the libraries that are actually needed.

2. Use `std::vector<int>` instead of `int arr[n];` : The size of the array is determined at run-time which is not recommended and it's not part of standard C++. We should use `std::vector<int>` instead because its size can be changed during runtime.

3. Use `std::accumulate` instead of the manual loop for summing the elements: It's safer and more efficient.

4. Use `std::min` instead of the loop to find the minimum between `n` and `m`: It's more readable and eliminates the possibility of off-by-one errors.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    vector<int> arr(n);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> arr[i];
    }
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    int sum = accumulate(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + min(n,m), 0, [](int a, int b) {
        return b < 0 ? a + b : a;
    });
    cout << abs(sum) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This version of the program does exactly the same thing as the original, but it is more efficient and less prone to errors.
