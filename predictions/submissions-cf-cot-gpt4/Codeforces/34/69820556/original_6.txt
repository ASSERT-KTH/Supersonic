The given C++ program reads an array of 'n' integers, sorts them, and then sums up the first 'm' negative numbers. The program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Instead of creating a dynamic array of size 'n' on the stack, we can use a std::vector<int> which will handle memory operations more efficiently.
2. We can use std::priority_queue in place of sorting the entire array which reduces the time complexity from O(n log n) to O(n log m). The priority_queue will keep track of the 'm' smallest elements as we iterate over the array.
3. We are including <bits/stdc++.h> which includes all standard library headers at once. This is not recommended because it can significantly increase compile time. It's better to include only the headers we need.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> pq;

    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int temp;
        cin >> temp;
        if(temp < 0) {
            if(pq.size() < m) {
                pq.push(temp);
            } else if(temp < pq.top()) {
                pq.pop();
                pq.push(temp);
            }
        }
    }

    int sum = 0;
    while(!pq.empty()) {
        sum += pq.top();
        pq.pop();
    }

    cout << abs(sum) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, the priority queue keeps track of the 'm' smallest numbers. It uses a min-heap data structure, where the top of the heap is always the smallest element. When a smaller number is encountered, the largest number in the heap is removed and the new smaller number is added. This ensures that we always keep the smallest 'm' numbers. At the end, the sum of these 'm' smallest numbers is calculated and its absolute value is printed.
