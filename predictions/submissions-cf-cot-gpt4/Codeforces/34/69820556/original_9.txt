Step-by-step optimization:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: `<array>`, `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<string>` and `<vector>` are not being used in the program. Including them will only increase the compilation time. Also, including `<bits/stdc++.h>` is a bad practice because it includes a lot of headers which might not be used, increasing compilation time and memory usage.

2. Use more efficient I/O methods: `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);` can be used to speed up the I/O operations in the program.

3. Avoid using Variable Length Arrays (VLA): `int arr[n];` is a VLA which is not standard in C++. Instead, use `std::vector<int>` which is dynamic and provides better performance.

4. Use `std::accumulate` function: Instead of writing a separate loop to calculate the sum, use the `std::accumulate` function from the `<numeric>` library. This function can directly calculate the sum of a range of elements.

5. Avoid unnecessary calls to `abs`: The `abs` function is being called only once at the end of the program, but it can be avoided by simply adding `-arr[i]` to the sum when `arr[i]` is negative.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0); 
    cin.tie(0); 
    cout.tie(0);

    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    vector<int> arr(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> arr[i];
    }

    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

    int sum = accumulate(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + min(n, m), 0, [](int sum, int i) {
        return i < 0 ? sum - i : sum;
    });

    cout << sum << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
This optimized program has a lower memory footprint and should run faster due to more efficient I/O operations and the use of `std::accumulate`.
