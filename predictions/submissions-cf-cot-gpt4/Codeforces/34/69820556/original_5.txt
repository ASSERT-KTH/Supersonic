The given program reads a list of integers from standard input, sorts it, and then adds up the first `m` negative numbers. If there are fewer than `m` negative numbers, it stops adding when it runs out of negative numbers.

However, there are several potential inefficiencies in this program:

1. The use of a variable-length array `arr[n]`. Variable-length arrays are not part of standard C++. While some compilers do support them as an extension, it would be better to use a `std::vector`, which is a standard, flexible, and efficient way to manage dynamic arrays in C++.

2. The program sorts the entire array, even though it only needs the smallest `m` elements. This is potentially a large waste of time if `n` is much larger than `m`. We can use `std::partial_sort` instead of `std::sort` to sort only the smallest `m` elements, which is faster if `m` is much less than `n`.

3. Using `<bits/stdc++.h>` is actually considered bad practice. This header file is quite large and slows down the compilation process significantly, as it includes literally all the Standard library headers.

4. There's no need to include both `<array>` and `<vector>`, especially when the program doesn't use `std::array`. 

5. There's also no need to include `<string>`, as the program doesn't use `std::string`.

6. The `using namespace std;` line can potentially lead to name conflicts. It's generally better to use the `std::` prefix explicitly.

Here's an optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  std::vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> arr[i];
  }
  std::partial_sort(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + m, arr.end());
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    if (arr[i] < 0)
      sum += arr[i];
    else
      break;
  }
  std::cout << abs(sum) << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program should run faster and use less memory for large inputs. Moreover, it's more compliant with the C++ standard, which makes it more portable and maintainable.
