The program reads integers from the input, sorts them, and then sums up the first m negative numbers, if there are any. To optimize it, here are the steps:

1. `#include<bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes most of the standard library header files in C++. Including it reduces the time taken to write all the different header files. However, it could increase the compilation time as it includes a lot of unnecessary header files that are not used in the program. In this case, we are already including specific libraries that we need, so `#include<bits/stdc++.h>` is not needed and can be removed.

2. Array to Vector: In C++, arrays are not as flexible as vectors. The size of arrays is fixed during compilation time which can waste a lot of memory space if not used properly. Vectors, on the other hand, are dynamic and can change their size during runtime. This can save a lot of memory space.

3. Avoid breaking the loop: We can avoid breaking the loop by checking the condition inside the loop itself, which is slightly more efficient.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }
  sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < m && arr[i] < 0; i++) {
    sum += arr[i];
  }
  cout << abs(sum) << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
