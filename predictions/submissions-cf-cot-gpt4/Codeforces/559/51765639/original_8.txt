This code is already quite optimized but there are few minor improvements we could do.

- You are using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes all the standard libraries. This is not good practice because it increases compile time. You should include only the libraries you need.
- All the functions and constants you have defined but not used in the program can be removed to save memory.
- The `degreetoradian` function can be simplified by combining the operations.
- You can reduce the number of operations in the `TriangleAreaWithSide` function by factoring out a common term.
- The `sqr` function can be inlined to reduce function call overhead.
- The use of `endl` can cause unnecessary flushing of the output stream and can be replaced with '\n'.
- The `optimize()` function is not needed unless you are doing a lot of input/output operations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

inline double sqr(double a) {
  return a * a;
}

inline double TriangleAreaWithSide(double a, double b, double c) {
  double s = (a + b + c) * 0.5;
  return sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c));
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  double a[6];
  for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  double ang = M_PI / 1.5;
  double A1 = ((a[0] * a[1]) / 2) * sin(ang);
  double A2 = ((a[2] * a[3]) / 2) * sin(ang);
  double A3 = ((a[4] * a[5]) / 2) * sin(ang);
  double x1 = sqrt(sqr(a[0]) + sqr(a[1]) - (2.0 * a[0] * a[1] * cos(ang)));
  double x2 = sqrt(sqr(a[3]) + sqr(a[2]) - (2.0 * a[3] * a[2] * cos(ang)));
  double x3 = sqrt(sqr(a[4]) + sqr(a[5]) - (2.0 * a[4] * a[5] * cos(ang)));
  double A4 = TriangleAreaWithSide(x1, x2, x3);
  double ar = TriangleAreaWithSide(1, 1, 1);
  int tottri = static_cast<int>((A1 + A2 + A3 + A4) / ar);
  cout << tottri << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

This code has the same functionality as the original, but is slightly more efficient in terms of memory usage and execution time.
