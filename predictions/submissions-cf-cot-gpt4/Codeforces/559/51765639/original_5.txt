The given C/C++ code is a collection of utility functions, type definitions, and macros that are used in competitive programming. The code calculates the area of three triangles and then calculates the total area of a larger triangle and divides it by the area of a unit triangle to get the total number of triangles that can fit in the larger one. 

Some optimization steps can be applied:

1. Remove unused typedefs, functions, and macros: There are many typedefs, functions, and macros that aren't used in the code. They're just adding unnecessary lines and confusion.

2. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: This header file includes too many standard libraries which can slow down the compilation process. Include only necessary header files.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std`: It's not a good practice to use this statement if the namespace `std` contains a lot of code that is not used in your program.

4. Use `constexpr` for constants: The `const` keyword only guarantees that you can't change the value, not that the value is a compile-time constant. But `constexpr` ensures that the variable is evaluated at compile time. It can help performance because it can cause computations to be done at compile time rather than runtime.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: For example, the `TriangleAreaWithSide` function calculates the same value for the semiperimeter `s` of a triangle three times. It would be more efficient to calculate it once and store it in a variable.

6. Avoid the use of `endl`: `endl` causes a flush operation, which can be costly in terms of performance. Use `'\n'` instead.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

#define PI acos(-1)

constexpr double eps = 1e-9;

inline double TriangleAreaWithSide(double a, double b, double c) {
  double s = (a + b + c) / 2;
  return sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c));
}

inline bool equalTo(double a, double b) {
  return fabs(a - b) <= eps;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  
  double a[10];
  for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  double ang = (PI * 120.0) / 180.0;
  double A1 = ((a[0] * a[1]) / 2) * sin(ang);
  double A2 = ((a[2] * a[3]) / 2) * sin(ang);
  double A3 = ((a[4] * a[5]) / 2) * sin(ang);
  double x1 = sqrt(a[0] * a[0] + a[1] * a[1] - (2.0 * a[0] * a[1] * cos(ang)));
  double x2 = sqrt(a[2] * a[2] + a[3] * a[3] - (2.0 * a[2] * a[3] * cos(ang)));
  double x3 = sqrt(a[4] * a[4] + a[5] * a[5] - (2.0 * a[4] * a[5] * cos(ang)));
  double A4 = TriangleAreaWithSide(x1, x2, x3);
  double ar = TriangleAreaWithSide(1, 1, 1);
  int tottri = (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4) / ar;
  std::cout << tottri << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

This program performs the same functionality as the original but is significantly simpler and more efficient.
