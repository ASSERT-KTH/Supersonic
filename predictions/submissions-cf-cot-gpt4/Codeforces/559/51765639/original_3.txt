The given C/C++ program appears to be a template for competitive programming, which is already optimized to some extent. However, there are few minor optimizations that can be done.

1. Avoid #include <bits/stdc++.h>: This header file includes too many standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation time. Instead, only include the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;` for large programs. This can cause name collisions, where the compiler may not be able to distinguish between user-defined functions and functions in std namespace.

3. Use pre-computed values: The value of `ang` can be pre-computed and stored instead of being calculated each time. The same holds true for `ar`.

4. Avoid repetitive calculations: In the program, `sqr(a[i])` is repeated multiple times for the same `i`. Instead, we can save it in a variable and use the variable.

5. Avoid unnecessary type conversions: The `TriangleAreaWithSide` function does not need to take `double` as arguments. It can take `int` since the arguments are always integers.

6. The `optimize()` macro can be inlined at the start of main since it is used only once. This can improve readability.

Here is the optimized code based on these suggestions:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <iomanip>

const double PI = acos(-1.0);
const double ang = PI * 120.0 / 180.0;
const double ar = sqrt(3) / 4;

inline double sqr(double a) {
  return a * a;
}

double TriangleAreaWithSide(double a, double b, double c) {
  double s = (a + b + c) / 2;
  return sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c));
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);

  double a[6];
  for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }

  double A = 0.0;
  double x[3];
  for (int i = 0; i < 6; i+=2) {
    double sqr_ai = sqr(a[i]);
    double sqr_ai1 = sqr(a[i+1]);
    A += ((a[i] * a[i+1]) / 2) * sin(ang);
    x[i/2] = sqrt(sqr_ai + sqr_ai1 - (2.0 * a[i] * a[i+1] * cos(ang)));
  }
  double A4 = TriangleAreaWithSide(x[0], x[1], x[2]);
  int tottri = (A + A4) / ar;
  std::cout << tottri << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The optimizations are minor and may not result in a noticeable runtime improvement for this specific code. However, they can be helpful in larger programs.
