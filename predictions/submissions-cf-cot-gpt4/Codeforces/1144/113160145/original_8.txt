This program is already highly optimized. However, there are a couple of small changes that can be made to potentially improve its performance:

1. Remove Unused Code: The `solve()` function is declared but never defined or used. We can remove this to clean up the code.
2. Avoid Global Variables: It's generally a good practice to avoid global variables where possible. In this program, `N`, `M`, `g` and `vis` are all globally declared. We can make these local to the `main()` function.
3. Use `std::array` Instead of `std::vector` for Fixed Size Arrays: `std::array` has performance benefits over `std::vector` when the size is known at compile-time, which is the case for `g` and `vis`. We can replace these `std::vector` instances with `std::array`.
4. Use `reserve` for `std::vector`: This can potentially improve performance by avoiding unnecessary reallocations and copies when the vector is growing. This is applicable to `v`.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
using namespace std;
using namespace __gnu_pbds;
#pragma GCC optimize("-O3")
typedef tree<int, null_type, less<int>, rb_tree_tag,
             tree_order_statistics_node_update>
    ordered_set;
template <typename T> void make_unique(vector<T> &vec) {
  vec.erase(unique(vec.begin(), vec.end()), vec.end());
}
// Remaining code...
#define cons 200005
typedef pair<ll, ll> pl;
typedef vector<ll> vl;
typedef vector<pl> vpl;
typedef vector<vl> vvl;
const ll mod = 1000000007;
const ld PI = 3.141592653589793;
const ll inf = 1e18;
map<pl, ll> u;
void dfs(ll node, ll pv, array<vl, cons>& g, vl& vis, ll& M) {
  vis[node] = 1;
  // Remaining code...
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  ll n = 0, m = 0, i = 0, j = 0, k = 0, cnt = 0, ans = 0, sum = 0, flag = 0,
     pos = -1, ind = -1, mn = inf, mx = -inf, res = 0;
  cin >> n >> m;
  vpl v;
  v.reserve(m);
  fo(i, m) {
    cin >> j >> k;
    g[j].pb(k);
    g[k].pb(j);
    v.pb({j, k});
  }
  ll M = 0;
  array<vl, cons> g;
  vl vis(cons);
  dfs(1, 0, g, vis, M);
  // Remaining code...
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations might have a minor impact, considering that the original code is already highly optimized.
