Let's break down the code and optimize it step by step. 

1. Vector v is doubled in size by appending its own elements at the end. This operation doubles the memory requirements and increases the time complexity. Instead of storing the elements twice in the same vector, we can use modular arithmetic to achieve the same effect without increasing memory usage or time complexity.

2. Vector u and z are prefixes of v and getSum(v) respectively. These vectors can be calculated on the fly, eliminating the need for extra memory and reducing time complexity.

3. The while loop inside the main while loop can be optimized. The inner while loop is doing unnecessary computations by subtracting the start value until the days become less than x. Instead, we can directly calculate the start value and subtract it from the days and sums, which will reduce the time complexity.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const long long MOD = 1e9 + 7;
long long getSum(long long n) { return n * (n + 1) / 2; }
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  long long n, x;
  cin >> n >> x;
  vector<long long> v(n);
  for (long long &x : v)
    cin >> x;
  long long ans = 0;
  int e = 0;
  long long days = 0, sums = 0;
  while (e < 2 * n) {
    long long val = v[e % n];
    days += val;
    sums += getSum(val);
    e++;
    if (days > x) {
        long long diff = days - x;
        int start_val = v[(e - 1) % n];
        if (start_val > diff) {
            sums -= getSum(start_val) - getSum(diff);
            days -= diff;
        } else {
            sums -= getSum(start_val);
            days -= start_val;
        }
    }
    ans = max(ans, sums);
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we implemented the above-mentioned optimizations. This version should run faster and consume less memory than the original version.
