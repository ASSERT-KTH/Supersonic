The provided code is a C++ program that performs some complex operations on a vector of long long integers. The main optimization opportunities come from reducing the number of operations performed, reducing memory consumption, and improving the time complexity of the algorithm.

Here are some steps to optimize the code:

1. Avoid duplicate vector: In the current code, the original vector 'v' is duplicated to another vector 'u'. This not only consumes extra memory but also increases the complexity of the program. We can avoid this by performing operations directly on 'v'.

2. Avoid unnecessary loop: There are two loops to calculate the sum and another computation on the elements of the vector. This can be merged into a single loop to reduce the time complexity.

3. Use reserve for vector: The 'push_back' operation on a vector may sometimes cause the vector to reallocate its memory, which is an expensive operation. To avoid this, we can use the 'reserve' function to allocate enough memory for the vector at once.

4. Avoid unnecessary function call: The function 'getSum' is called multiple times. We can avoid this by storing the result of the function call in a variable and reusing it.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const long long MOD = 1e9 + 7;
long long getSum(long long n) { return n * (n + 1) / 2; }
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  long long n, x;
  cin >> n >> x;
  vector<long long> v(n);
  for (long long &x : v)
    cin >> x;
  v.reserve(2*n);
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    v.push_back(v[i]);
  }
  n *= 2;
  vector<long long> z(n);
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    v[i] += i > 0 ? v[i - 1] : 0;
    z[i] = getSum(v[i]);
    z[i] += i > 0 ? z[i - 1] : 0;
  }
  long long ans = 0, days = 0, sums = 0;
  int s = 0, e = 0;
  while (e < n) {
    days += v[e];
    sums += getSum(v[e]);
    e++;
    while (days > x) {
      if (days - v[s] < x) {
        break;
      }
      long long currentSum = getSum(v[s]);
      days -= v[s];
      sums -= currentSum;
      s++;
    }
    long long diff = max(days - x, 0LL);
    ans = max(ans, sums - getSum(diff));
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

Note: These optimizations are based on the assumption that the code is correct and produces the desired output. The optimized code may have different behavior if the original code has bugs or unexpected behavior.
