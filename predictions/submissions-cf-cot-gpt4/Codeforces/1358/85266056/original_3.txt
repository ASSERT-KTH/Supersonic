First, let's go through the optimization steps:

1. Reduce unnecessary usage of library: The provided code includes many libraries that are not being used, which can lead to unnecessary memory usage. We remove those unnecessary libraries.

2. Avoid recalculating the same function: The function `getSum(v[s])` is calculated twice for the same value `v[s]`. We could store this value in a variable and use it to avoid recalculating the same thing.

3. Reduce repeated computation: The computation `days - x` is performed twice in a loop, which could be optimized by storing the result in a variable and reusing it.

4. Avoid unnecessary copying: The line `vector<long long> u = v;` makes a copy of `v` which is not necessary. We can directly use `v` to calculate `u`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const long long MOD = 1e9 + 7;

long long getSum(long long n) { 
    return n * (n + 1) / 2; 
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    long long n, x;
    cin >> n >> x;

    vector<long long> v(n);
    for (long long &x : v)
        cin >> x;
    v.insert(v.end(), v.begin(), v.end());
    n *= 2;

    for (long long i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        v[i] += v[i - 1];
    }

    vector<long long> z(n);
    for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        z[i] = getSum(v[i]);
    }
    for (long long i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        z[i] += z[i - 1];
    }

    long long ans = 0;
    int s = 0, e = 0;
    long long days = 0, sums = 0;
    while (e < v.size()) {
        days += v[e];
        sums += getSum(v[e]);
        e++;

        while (days > x) {
            if (days - v[s] < x) {
                break;
            }
            long long temp = getSum(v[s]);
            days -= v[s];
            sums -= temp;
            s++;
        }
        
        long long diff = max(days - x, 0LL);
        ans = max(ans, sums - getSum(diff));
    }

    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
```

The optimized code has better readability and efficiency by reducing unnecessary usage of libraries, avoiding unnecessary copying of vectors, and reducing repeated calculation of the same function.
