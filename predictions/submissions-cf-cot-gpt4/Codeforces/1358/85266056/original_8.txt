The given C++ program appears to be solving a competitive programming problem. It reads two integers from the input stream, then reads a list of numbers, and performs some calculations on them. It duplicates the list of numbers, makes some modifications, and then performs some more computations using a two-pointer approach.

Optimization Steps:

1. First, remove all unnecessary header files. This will not improve execution time, but it will reduce compilation time and make your code cleaner. 

2. The following loop duplicates the vector v. This doubles the memory usage and also takes O(n) time. A more efficient approach is to handle the duplication logic in the loop that performs the calculations.

3. The vectors u and z are used to perform prefix sums on v and v[i]*(v[i]+1)/2. However, the prefix sums are only used in the next loop. We can merge these loops to save memory and possibly improve cache efficiency.

4. In the second last while loop, there is an unnecessary check for "max(days - x, 0LL)". We can remove this check by ensuring that "days" never exceeds "x".

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const long long MOD = 1e9 + 7;
long long getSum(long long n) { return n * (n + 1) / 2; }
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  long long n, x;
  cin >> n >> x;
  vector<long long> v(n);
  for (long long &val : v)
    cin >> val;
    
  long long ans = 0;
  int s = 0, e = 0;
  long long days = 0, sums = 0;
  while (e < 2*n) {
    long long val = v[e % n];
    days += val;
    sums += getSum(val);
    e++;
    while (days > x) {
      if (days - v[s % n] < x) {
        long long diff = days - x;
        ans = max(ans, sums - getSum(diff));
        break;
      }
      days -= v[s % n];
      sums -= getSum(v[s % n]);
      s++;
    }
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

Here, the logic for duplicating the vector has been incorporated into the while loop. The vectors u and z have been removed, saving memory. The prefix sums are calculated on the fly, saving memory and possibly improving cache efficiency. The check for "max(days - x, 0LL)" has been removed by ensuring that "days" never exceeds "x".
