Optimization steps:
1. Remove unused libraries. This program does not use libraries like `<algorithm>`, `<chrono>`, `<cmath>`, `<list>`, `<map>`, `<numeric>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<sstream>`, `<stack>`, `<unordered_map>`, `<unordered_set>`. Removing these will clean up the code and slightly reduce the memory footprint.
2. Avoid unnecessary copying. The vector `u` is a copy of `v` which is unnecessary. Instead, we can directly operate on `v`.
3. The `while` loop where `days - v[s] < x` is checked does not need to be a separate loop. It can be combined with the `while (days > x)` loop.
4. The vectors `u` and `z` are unused in the program, removing them will reduce memory usage.

Here is the optimized code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const long long MOD = 1e9 + 7;

long long getSum(long long n) { 
    return n * (n + 1) / 2; 
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  long long n, x;
  cin >> n >> x;
  
  vector<long long> v(n);
  for (long long &x : v)
    cin >> x;
    
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    v.push_back(v[i]);
  }
  
  n *= 2;
  
  long long ans = 0;
  int s = 0, e = 0;
  long long days = 0, sums = 0;
  
  while (e < v.size()) {
    days += v[e];
    sums += getSum(v[e]);
    e++;
    while (days > x) {
      if (days - v[s] < x) {
        break;
      }
      days -= v[s];
      sums -= getSum(v[s]);
      s++;
    }
    long long diff = max(days - x, 0LL);
    ans = max(ans, sums - getSum(diff));
  }
  
  cout << ans;
  
  return 0;
}
```
This code maintains the same functionality as the original one but with less memory usage due to the removal of unnecessary variables and libraries.
