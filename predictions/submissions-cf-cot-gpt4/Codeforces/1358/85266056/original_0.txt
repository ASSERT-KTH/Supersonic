Here are the steps for optimization:

1. The initial vector `v` is doubled in size by appending itself to the end. This operation consumes additional memory equal to the size of `v` and takes time proportional to the size of `v`. An alternative approach is to perform relevant operations in a cyclic manner in the original `v` without physically doubling it. This can save memory usage and the time spent in doubling `v`.

2. Vector `u` is a prefix sum array of `v`. However, it is not used in the code, so it can be removed to save memory and the time spent in its generation.

3. Vector `z` is a prefix sum array of the sum of first `n` natural numbers for each element in `v`. However, it is not used in the code, so it can be removed to save memory and the time spent in its generation.

4. The function `getSum` is called multiple times with the same argument within the same iteration of the loop. The result of `getSum` can be cached to avoid redundant computations and save time.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const long long MOD = 1e9 + 7;
long long getSum(long long n) { return n * (n + 1) / 2; }
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  long long n, x;
  cin >> n >> x;
  vector<long long> v(n);
  for (long long &x : v)
    cin >> x;
  long long ans = 0;
  int s = 0, e = 0;
  long long days = 0, sums = 0;
  while (e < 2*n) {
    days += v[e%n];
    sums += getSum(v[e%n]);
    e++;
    while (days > x) {
      if (days - v[s] < x) {
        break;
      }
      days -= v[s];
      sums -= getSum(v[s]);
      s++;
    }
    long long diff = max(days - x, 0LL);
    ans = max(ans, sums - getSum(diff));
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimizations are made based on the provided code. If `u` and `z` are used in some parts of the code that are not shown, then they should not be removed.
