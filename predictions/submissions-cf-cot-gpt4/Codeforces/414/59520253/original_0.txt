The provided C++ program involves a dynamic programming approach. It seems to be calculating some form of mathematical operation on sets of numbers. The current implementation is already quite optimal in terms of algorithmic complexity. However, there are a few small improvements that can be made to the code to enhance its performance and improve the memory usage. 

Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid the use of `#define` directives: The current program uses `#define` to define constants, functions and even type aliases. This is not a recommended practice in C++ programming as it can lead to hard-to-debug errors. Using `const`, `typedef` or `using` statements can avoid this.

2. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is quite large and including it can increase compilation time significantly. Instead, only include the necessary libraries. 

3. Avoid using `using namespace std`: This can lead to naming collisions if the program is large or uses third-party libraries. 

4. Use `std::vector` instead of built-in arrays: The program uses built-in arrays for dynamic programming. However, built-in arrays do not automatically manage memory and can lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior if not handled properly. 

Now let's apply these optimizations to the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>
using std::vector;
using std::pair;
using std::unordered_map;
using std::unordered_set;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);
  
  int n, k;
  std::cin >> n >> k;

  vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, 0));

  for (int i = n; i > 0; i--) {
    dp[i][1] = 1;
    for (int j = 2; j <= k; j++) {
      for (int l = 2 * i; l <= n; l += i) {
        dp[i][j] += dp[l][j - 1];
        if (dp[i][j] >= MOD)
          dp[i][j] -= MOD;
      }
      dp[i][j] += dp[i][j - 1];
      if (dp[i][j] >= MOD)
        dp[i][j] -= MOD;
    }
  }

  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    ans += dp[i][k];
    ans %= MOD;
  }

  std::cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program uses `std::vector` for the dynamic programming table, which automatically manages memory. It also avoids the use of `#define` directives and `using namespace std`, which can lead to naming conflicts and hard-to-debug errors.
