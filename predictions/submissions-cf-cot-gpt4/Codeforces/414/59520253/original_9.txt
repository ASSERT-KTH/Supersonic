The given program is already written with efficiency in mind, but there are a few potential areas for optimization. 

1. Reduce unnecessary macro usage: Macros like #define all(a) a.begin(), a.end(), #define rall(a) a.rbegin(), a.rend(), #define sz(a) int(a.size()), #define sq(a) ((a) * (a)) are not used in this program and can be removed. They will not affect execution time or memory usage, but they can make the code cleaner and easier to read. 

2. Reduce use of std::endl: std::endl flushes the buffer each time it's used, which can slow down the program. By using "\n" instead, we can speed up output.

3. Avoid input/output synchronization: The line ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0); disables synchronization between C and C++ standard streams which can speed up input and output. But since we do not have any input or output in C standard streams in this program, this line is not necessary.

4. Use std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false): This disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. Once turned off, it cannot be turned back on.

5. Avoid namespace pollution: The line using namespace std; imports the entire std namespace into the global namespace and can lead to name clashes. 

6. Avoid using #define for constants: #define has no scope and no type, which can lead to bugs. Instead we can use const or constexpr for constants.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

#define MOD 1000000007

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    int n, k;
    std::cin >> n >> k;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n + 1, std::vector<int>(k + 1, 0));

    for (int i = n; i >= 0; --i) {
        dp[i][1] = 1;
        for (int j = 2; j <= k; ++j) {
            for (int l = 2 * i; l <= n; l += i) {
                dp[i][j] += dp[l][j - 1];
                if (dp[i][j] >= MOD)
                    dp[i][j] -= MOD;
            }
            dp[i][j] += dp[i][j - 1];
            if (dp[i][j] >= MOD)
                dp[i][j] -= MOD;
        }
    }
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i){ 
        ans += dp[i][k];
        ans %= MOD;
    }
    std::cout << ans << "\n";
}
```
