The program is performing some mathematical operations and the calculations are stored in the `dp` 2-dimensional array. The optimization might include:

1. The `memset` function is used to initialize the `dp` array to 0. This function is not necessary because in C++ local arrays are not initialized by default, so we can utilize this fact and initialize the array during declaration itself.

2. The condition checks in the loops `if (dp[i][j] >= MOD)` can be expensive in terms of runtime. This is because they are present inside nested loops, hence checked multiple times. Instead, we can use the modulus operator directly while doing the addition operation which will reduce the number of condition checks.

3. The output variable `ans` is being updated inside a loop, and the modulus operation is performed inside the loop. We can avoid doing this operation in every iteration by shifting it outside the loop.

4. The `#define` directives can be replaced by type alias (`using` keyword) or constants where appropriate for better code readability.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
using ld = long double;
using vi = vector<int>;
using vll = vector<ll>;
using umap = unordered_map;
using pii = pair<int, int>;
using pll = pair<ll, ll>;
using uset = unordered_set;
#define frw(i, a, b) for (auto i = (a); i < (b); i++)
#define bck(i, a, b) for (auto i = (a); i > (b); i--)
#define T() int testcases; cin >> testcases; frw(TC, 1, testcases + 1)
#define tez ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);
#define endl "\n"
#define fi first
#define se second
#define pow asdihagsiduh
#define pub push_back
#define in insert
#define all(a) a.begin(), a.end()
#define rall(a) a.rbegin(), a.rend()
#define sz(a) int(a.size())
#define sq(a) ((a) * (a))
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
int main() {
  tez int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  int dp[n + 1][k + 1] = {0};
  bck(i, n, 0) {
    dp[i][1] = 1;
    frw(j, 2, k + 1) {
      for (int l = 2 * i; l <= n; l += i) {
        dp[i][j] += dp[l][j - 1];
        dp[i][j] %= MOD;
      }
      dp[i][j] += dp[i][j - 1];
      dp[i][j] %= MOD;
    }
  }
  int ans = 0;
  frw(i, 1, n + 1) ans += dp[i][k];
  cout << ans % MOD;
}
```

This optimized version reduces the number of condition checks and modulus operations in the loops, and simplifies the initialization of the `dp` array, thus saving both runtime and memory.
