The given program has a few areas where it can be optimized.

1. The first optimization can be the removal of the unnecessary '#include ' directive. This library is generally considered bad practice since it includes all standard libraries, which can lead to longer compile times and potential naming conflicts.

2. The second optimization is to reduce the number of operations. The expression 'n = n * (n + 1) / 2' can be simplified to 'n = n * (n + 1) >> 1' which reduces the division operation to a shift operation, making it faster.

3. The third optimization is to reduce the number of times 'n' is read and written. This can be done by directly outputting the result instead of storing it again in 'n' and then outputting it.

4. The fourth optimization is to reduce the number of operations in the 'if' condition. This can be achieved by using the 'max' function instead of the 'if' condition.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int d = 0;
  cin >> d;
  long k = 0;
  cin >> k;
  long n = 0;
  cin >> n;
  long result = n * (n + 1) >> 1;
  result *= d;
  cout << max(result - k, 0L);
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program should run faster and use less memory than the original version.
