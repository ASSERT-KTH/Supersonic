Optimization steps:

1. Use `scanf` instead of `cin` and `printf` instead of `cout`. The `scanf` and `printf` functions are faster than `cin` and `cout`.

2. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file is actually quite large and includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which can slow down your program. Instead, only include the libraries you need, in this case `stdio.h`.

3. The calculation `n = n * (n + 1) / 2` can be optimized by assigning `n * (n + 1) / 2` to a separate variable and then use this variable in the next calculation. This way the multiplication and division operation is done only once.

4. `n = n * d;` and `if ((n - k) > 0)` can be combined into one statement. This will avoid unnecessary subtraction operation.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int d = 0;
  scanf("%d", &d);
  long k = 0;
  scanf("%ld", &k);
  long n = 0;
  scanf("%ld", &n);

  long sum_n = n * (n + 1) / 2;
  long result = sum_n * d - k;
  printf("%ld", result > 0 ? result : 0);
}
```
