The program can be optimized in a few ways:

1. Instead of performing `n = n * (n + 1) / 2;` and `n = n * d;` separately, they can be combined into a single operation `n = n * (n + 1) * d / 2;`. This reduces the number of multiplications and divisions by a factor of two.

2. To reduce memory usage, the data type of n can be changed to `long long`. This will allow n to handle larger numbers without overflow.

3. The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes all standard C++ libraries, which can slow down the compile time. It's better to include only those libraries that are actually used in the program.

4. Instead of using `cin` and `cout` for input and output, `scanf` and `printf` can be used. They are faster because they don't need to sync with the C++ standard streams.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int d = 0;
  scanf("%d", &d);
  long long k = 0;
  scanf("%lld", &k);
  long long n = 0;
  scanf("%lld", &n);
  n = n * (n + 1) * d / 2;
  
  long long result = n - k > 0 ? n - k : 0;
  printf("%lld", result);

  return 0;
}
```
