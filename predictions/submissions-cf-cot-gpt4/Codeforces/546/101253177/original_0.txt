Your program is quite well-written, but there are a few possible optimizations:

1. Remove `#include <stdio.h>`: Since you are using `<iostream>` for input and output, you don't need `<stdio.h>`.

2. Input Optimization: You can take the input of `d`, `k`, and `n` in a single line using comma-separated values. This will reduce the number of input operations.

3. Avoiding Multiplication: Instead of first calculating `n` using `n * (n + 1) / 2` and then multiplying by `d`, you can do it in one step to avoid one multiplication operation. 

4. Avoiding Repeated Calculation: You are calculating `n - k` twice. Instead, you can calculate it once and store the result in a variable, and then use that variable.

5. Return 0 at the end of main: As a good programming practice, always return 0 at the end of the main function. 

Here's the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  long d = 0, k = 0, n = 0;
  cin >> d >> k >> n;
  n = n * (n + 1) / 2 * d;
  long result = (n - k > 0) ? n - k : 0;
  cout << result;
  return 0;
}
```
I also changed the type of `d` to `long` because if `n` is large, `n*(n+1)/2` can overflow the `int` type.
