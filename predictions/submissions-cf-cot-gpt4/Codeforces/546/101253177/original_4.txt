The program can be optimized to reduce the number of computations and improve readability.

Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
The first line in the program, `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, is a GCC-specific header that includes many other standard headers. However, it's not good practice to use this in your code as it can significantly increase compile time. It's better to just include the specific headers that you need. In this case, `iostream` suffices.

Step 2: Remove unneeded `#include <stdio.h>`
The `stdio.h` library is not needed in this program. All the necessary functions (input/output) are covered by `iostream`.

Step 3: Combine operations into a single line
The operations to calculate `n` can be combined into a single line. This makes the code a little more compact and reduces the number of assignments.

Step 4: Use `max` function instead of `if` condition
Instead of using an `if` condition to compare `(n - k)` with `0`, you can use the `max` function. This simplifies the code and makes it more readable.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int d = 0;
  cin >> d;
  long k = 0;
  cin >> k;
  long n = 0;
  cin >> n;
  n = n * (n + 1) / 2 * d;
  cout << max(n - k, 0L);
  return 0;
}
```
