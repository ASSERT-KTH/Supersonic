Step 1:
We can reduce the number of operations by combining some of the operations. For instance, we can combine the calculation 'n = n * (n + 1) / 2;' and 'n = n * d;' into one operation 'n = n * (n + 1) * d / 2;'. This will reduce the number of multiplications and assignments.

Step 2:
We can reduce the memory footprint by reducing the number of variables. For instance, the variable 'k' is only used once, so we can directly subtract it in the output, instead of storing it in a variable.

Step 3:
The header file 'bits/stdc++.h' is a GCC specific library that includes a lot of unnecessary header files which makes compile time much longer. This can be replaced with only the necessary headers, which are 'iostream' in this case.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  long d, k, n;
  cin >> d >> k >> n;
  n = n * (n + 1) * d / 2;
  long result = (n - k) > 0 ? n - k : 0;
  cout << result;
  return 0;
}
```
This code is more efficient in terms of running time and memory usage. The number of operations is reduced and the number of variables is minimized. The compilation time is also reduced by using the necessary headers only.
