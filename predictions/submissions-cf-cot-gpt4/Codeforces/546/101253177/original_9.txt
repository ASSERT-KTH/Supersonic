The given C++ program reads three integers (d, k, n), calculates a mathematical expression and then prints the result or 0 if the result is negative. The program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Make use of the `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` function call, which disconnects C++ standard streams from their C counterparts. This can greatly increase performance when using cin and cout, because it disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. 

2. Combine `cin` and `cout` operations to reduce I/O operations.

3. Avoid unnecessary variables. The variable `n` is used to store the result of the mathematical calculation, but it is not necessary to store the intermediate results in `n`. Instead, the final result can be calculated in one line, reducing memory usage.

4. Simplify the conditional statement. Instead of checking whether `n - k` is greater than 0 and then printing `n - k` or "0", you can use the `max` function to directly print the maximum of `n - k` and 0.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int d = 0;
  long k = 0;
  long n = 0;
  cin >> d >> k >> n;
  long result = max(0L, n * (n + 1) / 2 * d - k);
  cout << result;
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program should run faster and use less memory than the original.
