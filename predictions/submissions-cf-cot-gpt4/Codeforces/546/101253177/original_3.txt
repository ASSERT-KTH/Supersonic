The optimization steps are as follows:

1) Remove the "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" because it includes more files than needed, which can slow down the compile time. Instead, only include the necessary header files.

2) Remove "#include <stdio.h>". It is not necessary in this program as we are using cin and cout for input and output which are part of the iostream library.

3) The calculation of n can be done in one line to reduce the number of operations.

4) Instead of calculating n-k twice (once for the if condition and once for the output), calculate it only once and store it in a variable.

5) Instead of using 'cout' to print "0" when n-k is less than or equal to 0, we can use the max function to directly print the maximum of 0 and n-k.

The optimized code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int d = 0;
  cin >> d;
  long k = 0;
  cin >> k;
  long n = 0;
  cin >> n;
  n = n * (n + 1) / 2 * d;
  long result = n - k;
  cout << max(result, 0L);
  return 0;
}
```
This code is more efficient in terms of running time and memory usage. It uses fewer operations and includes only the necessary header files.
