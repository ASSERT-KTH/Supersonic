This C++ program seems to be implementing a form of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, an algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It's then using that to calculate prefix sums over a range.

Here are some possible optimizations:

1. We can reduce the range of the main loop in the "precalc" function. Instead of going over all the elements of the "val" array, we can stop at "to". This is because any number "i" greater than "to" will not have any multiples less than "N", so there's no point checking them. This will save a lot of processing time.

2. We can combine the two loops at the end of the "precalc" function into one. This will reduce the number of iterations and therefore the running time.

3. The line "const ll to = sqrt(N) + 1;" is unnecessary because "to" is only used in the for loop inside the "precalc" function, so we can calculate it directly there.

4. We can also remove the unused constants "M", "tox", "inf", and "toy" to save memory.

5. The "ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);" and "cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);" lines are used to untie C++'s standard streams, which can speed up I/O operations. But since we're only doing simple I/O operations, we might not see a significant benefit and could therefore remove these lines to simplify the code.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define ll long long
#define pii pair<int, int>
#define piii pair<pii, pii>
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define f first
#define s second
#define m_p make_pair
#define pw(x) (1ll << x)
using namespace std;
const int N = 5e6 + 2;
int val[N];
bool is[N];
int cnt[N];
ll pref[N];

void precalc() {
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    val[i] = i;
  }
  for (int i = 2; i < sqrt(N) + 1; i++) {
    if (is[i])
      continue;
    int j = 2 * i;
    while (j < N) {
      is[j] = 1;
      while (val[j] % i == 0) {
        val[j] /= i;
        cnt[j]++;
      }
      j += i;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (val[i] != 1) {
      cnt[i]++;
    }
    if (i != 0) {
      pref[i] = pref[i - 1] + cnt[i];
    }
  }
}

int a, b;
signed main() {
  precalc();
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> a >> b;
    cout << pref[a] - pref[b] << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
