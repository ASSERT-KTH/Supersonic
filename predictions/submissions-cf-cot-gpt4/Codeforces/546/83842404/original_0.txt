This program seems to be an implementation of a segment sieve of Eratosthenes, where it counts the number of prime factors for numbers up to N and stores the prefix sums. The main optimizations that can be done here are:

1. Replace the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` directive: This header file is quite large and including it consumes more compilation time. It's better to include only those libraries which are being used in the program.

2. Remove the unnecessary macros: Macros like `all(x)`, `m_p` and `pw(x)` are not being used in the program, so we can remove them.

3. Pre-calculate the values of `val[i]` and `cnt[i]` for i=0 to N: This will prevent the program from recalculating these values for every test case and will save time.

4. Use fast I/O methods: `scanf/printf` are faster than `cin/cout` in C++. So, replacing `cin/cout` with `scanf/printf` will improve the program's running time.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#define ll long long
#define pii pair<int, int>
#define piii pair<pii, pii>
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define f first
#define s second
using namespace std;
const int N = 5e6 + 2;
const int M = 1e8;
const int tox[4] = {1, -1, 0, 0};
const ll inf = 1e18;
const int toy[4] = {0, 0, 1, -1};
int val[N];
bool is[N];
int cnt[N];
ll pref[N];
const ll to = sqrt(N) + 1;
void precalc() {
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    val[i] = i;
  }
  for (int i = 2; i < to; i++) {
    if (is[i])
      continue;
    int j = 2 * i;
    while (j < N) {
      is[j] = 1;
      while (val[j] % i == 0) {
        val[j] /= i;
        cnt[j]++;
      }
      j += i;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (val[i] != 1) {
      cnt[i]++;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    pref[i] = pref[i - 1] + cnt[i];
  }
}
int a, b;
int main() {
  precalc();
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    printf("%lld\n", pref[a] - pref[b]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program should run faster and consume less memory than the original one.
