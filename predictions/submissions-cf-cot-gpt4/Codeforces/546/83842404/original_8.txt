The code is a C++ program for finding the sum of the count of prime factors for all numbers in the range [b+1, a] for all test cases. The function precalc() is used to pre-calculate the number of prime factors for all numbers up to N.

In terms of optimization, there are a few areas where we can make improvements:

1. Avoiding the usage of <bits/stdc++.h> header file. This header file includes quite a lot of libraries which we might not use in this program. This will reduce the compilation time.

2. In function precalc(), we are calculating prime factors for all numbers up to N. We can optimize this by calculating prime factors only up to sqrt(N), because a larger factor of the number must be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been processed.

3. The input/output streams (cin/cout) are slower in comparison to scanf/printf. So, for faster Input/Output we can use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout. And we don't need to use ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0), and cout.tie(0) if we are using scanf/printf.

4. We donâ€™t need to calculate the 'pref' array for all numbers up to N. We can calculate it on the fly, which will save memory.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cmath>
#define ll long long
#define N 5000002
const int M = 1e8;
bool is[N];
int val[N], cnt[N];
ll pref = 0;
int a, b;

void precalc() {
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    val[i] = i;
  }
  int to = sqrt(N) + 1;
  for (int i = 2; i < to; i++) {
    if (is[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = 2 * i; j < N; j += i) {
      is[j] = 1;
      while (val[j] % i == 0) {
        val[j] /= i;
        cnt[j]++;
      }
    }
  }
  for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
    if (val[i] != 1) {
      cnt[i]++;
    }
    pref += cnt[i];
    if (i == a) break;
  }
}

int main() {
  precalc();
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
    ll result = pref - cnt[b];
    printf("%lld\n", result);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This code should run faster and use less memory than the original version.
