Optimization steps:

1. The precalc function can be optimized to reduce memory usage and running time. The 'is' array is used to store whether a number is prime or not. However, it is not necessary to store this information for all numbers up to N. The 'is' array can be replaced with a function that checks if a number is prime or not. This function can use the 'val' array to check if a number is prime. This will reduce memory usage.

2. The 'cnt' array is used to store the count of prime divisors of a number. This can be calculated in the precalc function without using an additional array. This will reduce memory usage.

3. The calculation of the 'pref' array can be optimized by using a variable to store the current sum instead of accessing the previous element of the array. This will reduce the running time.

4. The 'val' array is used to store the result of dividing a number by its prime divisors. This can be replaced with a variable in the precalc function. This will reduce memory usage.

5. The 'to' constant is calculated as the square root of N plus 1. This can be replaced with a constant value. This will reduce the running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define ll long long
#define pii pair<int, int>
#define piii pair<pii, pii>
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define f first
#define s second
#define m_p make_pair
#define pw(x) (1ll << x)
using namespace std;
const int N = 5e6 + 2;
const int M = 1e8;
const int tox[4] = {1, -1, 0, 0};
const ll inf = 1e18;
const int toy[4] = {0, 0, 1, -1};
ll pref[N];
const int to = 2237; // sqrt(5e6) + 1
void precalc() {
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    int val = i;
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int j = 2; j < to && j * j <= val; j++) {
      while (val % j == 0) {
        val /= j;
        cnt++;
      }
    }
    if (val != 1) {
      cnt++;
    }
    pref[i] = pref[i - 1] + cnt;
  }
}
int a, b;
signed main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  precalc();
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> a >> b;
    cout << pref[a] - pref[b] << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
