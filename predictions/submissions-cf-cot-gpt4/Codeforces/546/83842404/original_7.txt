The given C++ program calculates the prime factor counts for numbers from 0 to N (5e6 + 2) and stores it in an array. Then it reads a number of test cases and for each one, it takes two numbers a and b and outputs the difference in the accumulated prime factor counts up to a and b.

The optimization steps are as follows:

1. The precalc() function is called before inputting the test cases. This function calculates the prime factor counts for numbers up to N. This function can be optimized by considering only odd numbers after 2 in the sieve algorithm because even numbers greater than 2 are not prime.

2. The usage of 'is' array can be avoided by checking 'val[i] > 1' instead of 'is[i]'. This can save memory usage.

3. The usage of 'cnt' array is not necessary. We can add the counts directly to 'pref' array. This can save memory usage.

4. The usage of 'all(x)' macro is not needed in this program.

5. The usage of 'm_p' macro is not needed in this program.

6. The usage of 'f' and 's' macros is not needed in this program.

7. The usage of 'pw(x)' macro is not needed in this program.

8. The usage of 'tox', 'toy' arrays and 'M' constant is not needed in this program.

9. We don't need to include <bits/stdc++.h> as it includes more headers than we actually need. 

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

const int N = 5e6 + 2;
int val[N];
long long pref[N];
const int to = sqrt(N) + 1;

void precalc() {
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        val[i] = i;
        
    for (int i = 2; i < to; i += (i > 2 ? 2 : 1)) {
        if (val[i] > 1) {
            for (int j = i; j < N; j += i) {
                while (val[j] % i == 0) {
                    val[j] /= i;
                    pref[j]++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        if (val[i] > 1)
            pref[i]++;
            
    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++)
        pref[i] += pref[i - 1];
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    
    precalc();
    
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    
    while (t--) {
        int a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;
        cout << pref[a] - pref[b] << '\n';
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
