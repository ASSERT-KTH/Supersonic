This is a C++ program that performs prime factorization to calculate the number of prime factors for each integer up to 5e6 (5 million). It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all the prime factors. The program then calculates the prefix sum of the number of prime factors for each integer, which is used to answer queries about the difference in the number of prime factors between two integers.

Here's how we can optimize this program:

1. Use vector instead of arrays: The size of the arrays is fixed to N (5e6 + 2), which could waste a lot of memory if the maximum number in the input is much less than 5e6. We can use `std::vector` instead of arrays to save memory.

2. Avoid using `#define`: It's recommended to avoid using `#define` to define constants or macros in C++. The `#define` directive replaces the macro with its value before the program is compiled, which can lead to hard-to-debug errors. Instead, you can use `const` or `constexpr` to define constants. 

3. Use Fast I/O: The program already uses fast I/O methods `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);`, `cin.tie(0);`, and `cout.tie(0);`. This is a good practice to reduce the I/O time in C++.

4. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: This header file includes a lot of standard C++ libraries, many of which are not used in this program. Including unnecessary libraries can increase the compilation time. It's better to include only the libraries that are actually used in the program.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

const int N = 5e6 + 2;
const int M = 1e8;
const int tox[4] = {1, -1, 0, 0};
const long long inf = 1e18;
const int toy[4] = {0, 0, 1, -1};

vector<int> val(N);
vector<bool> is(N);
vector<int> cnt(N);
vector<long long> pref(N);
const int to = sqrt(N) + 1;

void precalc() {
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    val[i] = i;
  }
  for (int i = 2; i < to; i++) {
    if (is[i])
      continue;
    int j = 2 * i;
    while (j < N) {
      is[j] = 1;
      while (val[j] % i == 0) {
        val[j] /= i;
        cnt[j]++;
      }
      j += i;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (val[i] != 1) {
      cnt[i]++;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    pref[i] = pref[i - 1] + cnt[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  precalc();
  int t, a, b;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> a >> b;
    cout << pref[a] - pref[b] << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program should run faster and use less memory than the original program.
