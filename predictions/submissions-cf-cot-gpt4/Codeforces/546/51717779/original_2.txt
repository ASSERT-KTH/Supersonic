This program calculates the total cost of purchasing bananas, where each banana's price is incremented by 'k' for each subsequent banana. Then it compares the total cost with the amount of money 'n' that we have. If the total cost is more than the money we have, it prints the difference, otherwise, it prints 0.

The optimization that can be done here is to eliminate the loop that calculates the total cost. There is a mathematical formula to calculate the sum of first 'n' natural numbers which is `n*(n+1)/2`. We can use this formula instead of the loop. This will significantly reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(1).

Here is your optimized program:

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int_least64_t k, n, w;
  cin >> k >> n >> w;
  int_least64_t total_cost = k * w * (w + 1) / 2;
  if (total_cost <= n) {
    cout << 0;
  } else {
    cout << total_cost - n;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: It's generally not good practice to use `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers and increases the compilation time. I replaced it with `#include <iostream>` which is all this program needs. This will save on compilation time and memory.
