The given program calculates the total cost of w bananas where the cost of each banana is increasing by "k" and then it subtracts the available amount "n" from the total cost. If the total cost is less than or equal to the available amount, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the amount that the person has to borrow.

The loop in the program calculates the total cost of bananas. This can be optimized by using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is n*(n+1)/2. Here, "w" is the number of bananas and "k" is the common difference. The formula becomes k*w*(w+1)/2.

The optimized program will have a time complexity of O(1) instead of O(w).

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int_least64_t k, n, w, dem = 0;
  cin >> k >> n >> w;
  
  dem = k * w * (w+1) / 2;  // calculate total cost using summation formula
  
  if (dem <= n) {
    cout << 0;
  } else
    cout << dem - n;
    
  return 0;
}
```
This code reduces the time complexity from O(w) to O(1) by eliminating the need for the loop. The memory usage remains the same.
