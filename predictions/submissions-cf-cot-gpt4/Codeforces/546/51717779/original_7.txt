The given program calculates the total cost of buying 'w' bananas where the cost of each banana is 'k' times the number of bananas already bought. If the total cost is less than or equal to 'n', it prints '0'. Otherwise, it prints the amount by which the total cost exceeds 'n'. 

The current program has a time complexity of O(w) because it uses a for loop to calculate the total cost. This can be optimized to a constant time complexity, O(1), by using the formula for the sum of the first 'w' natural numbers instead of the for loop. 

The formula is: sum = w*(w+1)/2. The total cost is then k*sum.

The memory usage of the program is already optimal, so no changes are needed in that regard.

Optimized version of the program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int_least64_t k, n, w;
  cin >> k >> n >> w;
  int_least64_t sum = w*(w+1)/2; // sum of first 'w' natural numbers
  int_least64_t totalCost = k * sum; // total cost of 'w' bananas
  if (totalCost <= n) {
    cout << 0;
  } else
    cout << totalCost - n;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program accomplishes the same task as the original but does so more efficiently.
