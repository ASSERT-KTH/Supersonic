Step 1: Optimize the for loop:
The current implementation uses a for loop to compute the total cost, which is essentially the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum can be computed in constant time using the formula: sum = n/2 * (first_term + last_term). In this case, it becomes sum = w/2 * (1 + w) * k.

Step 2: Replace bits/stdc++.h with necessary headers:
Including bits/stdc++.h is not a good practice as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can significantly slow down the compilation time. We should only include the headers that are needed.

Step 3: Avoid using namespace std:
It's considered a bad practice to use "using namespace std;" in C++. This is because it includes the entire std namespace into the global namespace and can lead to name collision.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint>

int main() {
  int_least64_t k, n, w;
  std::cin >> k >> n >> w;

  // compute the sum using the formula: sum = n/2 * (first_term + last_term)
  int_least64_t dem = w * (w + 1) / 2 * k;

  if (dem <= n) {
    std::cout << 0;
  } else {
    std::cout << dem - n;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
