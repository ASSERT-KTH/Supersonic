The given code snippet calculates the total cost of buying w bananas, where the cost of the i-th banana is i*k. Then it outputs either 0 if the available money n is enough to buy all the bananas, or the difference between the total cost and the available money n.

This program can be optimized by avoiding the for loop. The total cost of bananas can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first w integers, which is (w*(w+1))/2. Then, this sum is multiplied by k to get the total cost.

Here are the optimization steps:
1. Remove the for loop.
2. Calculate the total cost using the formula (w*(w+1))/2 * k.
3. Compare the total cost with the available money n and output the result.

Below is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int_least64_t k, n, w, dem = 0;
  cin >> k >> n >> w;
  dem = w * (w+1) / 2 * k;
  if (dem <= n) {
    cout << 0;
  } else
    cout << dem - n;
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version, the time complexity is O(1), which is a significant improvement from the original version's O(w) time complexity. The memory usage remains the same because the number of variables used in the program has not increased.
