This program calculates the total cost of buying 'w' bananas where each 'i'-th banana costs 'i*k' and then subtracts the amount already available 'n'. If the cost is less than or equal to 'n', it prints 0, else it prints the remaining amount to be paid.

Here are some optimizations that we can make:

1. The loop to calculate 'dem' can be replaced with a formula. The cost of the bananas is the sum of the first 'w' natural numbers each multiplied by 'k'. The formula for the sum of the first 'w' natural numbers is 'w*(w+1)/2'. Applying this formula can reduce the time complexity from O(w) to O(1).

2. The comparison and subtraction can be combined into one operation using the max function.

3. You don't need to import the whole 'bits/stdc++.h'. Instead, you can just import the necessary libraries. This will reduce the compilation time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int_least64_t k, n, w;
  cin >> k >> n >> w;
  int_least64_t dem = k * w * (w + 1) / 2;
  cout << max((int_least64_t)0, dem - n);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program will run faster and compile quicker. The time complexity is constant O(1) and the memory complexity is also constant O(1).
