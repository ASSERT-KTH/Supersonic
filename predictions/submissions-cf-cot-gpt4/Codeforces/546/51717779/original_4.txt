The given program calculates the cost of buying 'w' bananas where the cost of the 'i'th banana is 'i * k'. If the total cost is less than or equal to 'n', it prints '0'. Otherwise, it prints the difference between the total cost and 'n'.

Here is the step-by-step optimization:

1. The loop in the code is used to calculate the sum of the first 'w' natural numbers each multiplied by 'k'. This is essentially calculating the sum of an arithmetic series. We can optimize this by using the formula for the sum of the first 'n' natural numbers which is 'n * (n + 1) / 2'. This eliminates the need for the loop and thus reduces the time complexity from O(w) to O(1).

2. In the code, 'dem' is used to store the total cost. But it is initialized to 0 and then checked if it is less than or equal to 'n'. Instead, we can calculate the total cost directly and compare it with 'n', eliminating the need for the 'dem' variable. This reduces the memory usage.

3. The 'bits/stdc++.h' header file is a GCC specific library that includes most of the standard C++ libraries. It is not a standard header, and its use is discouraged. It also increases the compile time. We can replace it with the specific standard libraries needed for this code, which are 'iostream'.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int_least64_t k, n, w;
  cin >> k >> n >> w;

  int_least64_t total_cost = k * w * (w + 1) / 2;
  
  if (total_cost <= n) {
    cout << 0;
  } else {
    cout << total_cost - n;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program will run faster and use less memory than the original version.
