The given C++ program is already quite optimized, but there are a few changes we can make to optimize it further.

1. In the "solve" function, the conditions to print "YES" are checked multiple times. We can consolidate these conditions and reduce the number of checks.

2. The condition 'n % b == 1' is checked twice in different if-else blocks. It can be checked only once.

3. The condition 'a == 1' is checked after 'b == 1' which is not necessary because if 'a == 1', then no matter what the value of 'b' is, the output will always be "YES".

4. The condition 'temp == n' is checked in each iteration of the while loop. This can be moved outside the loop.

5. The 'flag' variable is used to determine whether to print "YES" or "NO". Instead, we can use a boolean variable (bool) which is more memory-efficient than ll (long long).

6. The 'temp' variable can be defined as 'ull' (unsigned long long) instead of 'll' (long long) because its value is always positive. This way we can utilize the full range of 'ull' which is twice the positive range of 'll'.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the program.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define startt ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0);
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;
#define vint vector<int>
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define sz(a) (int)a.size()
#define MOD 1000000007
#define MOD2 998244353
#define MX 1000000000
#define nax 100005
#define MXL 1000000000000000000
#define PI 3.14159265
#define pb push_back
#define pf push_front
#define sc second
#define fr first
#define endl '\n'
#define ld long double
#define mp make_pair
void solve() {
  ll n, b;
  ull a;
  bool isYes = false;
  cin >> n >> a >> b;
  if ((n % b == 1 || n % b == a || b == 1) || a == 1) {
    isYes = true;
  } else {
    ull temp = 1;
    while (temp <= n) {
      if ((n - temp) % b == 0) {
        isYes = true;
        break;
      }
      temp *= a;
    }
  }
  cout << (isYes ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
}
int main() {
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  for (int tc = 1; tc <= t; tc++) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
By applying these optimizations, we have reduced the number of condition checks, eliminated redundant code, and made the program more efficient in terms of memory usage and running time.
