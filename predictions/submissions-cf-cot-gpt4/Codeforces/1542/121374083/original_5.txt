The given program is a solution to a problem where it checks if a number 'n' can be expressed as (x * a + y * b) where x and y are any non-negative integers. It includes a function `solve()` that takes inputs 'n', 'a', 'b' and then checks if the condition is satisfied. Based on the condition, it prints "YES" or "NO".

While the logic of the program seems to be correct, there are some areas where the program can be optimized. 

1. The usage of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is not recommended as it includes all the standard library headers which slows down the compilation time. So, it's better to include only the necessary headers for our program.

2. The macros definitions are not required in this case and might make the code less readable. It's advisable to use them when you have a constant that is being used in multiple places.

3. The 'flag' variable in the solve() function is being used as a boolean. It's better to use 'bool' type for such variables.

4. The 'temp' variable is not necessary. You can use the variable 'a' directly in the loop.

5. The 'll' type is used for variables that will not exceed the limit of 'int'. Using 'int' instead of 'll' can reduce memory usage.

6. The checks `n % b == 1` and `n % b == a` are duplicated in the if and else if statement. We can merge these two checks.

Now let's apply these optimizations to the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n, a, b;
  cin >> n >> a >> b;
  if (b == 1 || n % b == 1 || n % b == a || a == 1) {
    cout << "YES\n";
    return;
  }
  bool found = false;
  while (a <= n) {
    if ((n - a) % b == 0) {
      found = true;
      break;
    }
    a *= a;
  }
  if (found)
    cout << "YES\n";
  else
    cout << "NO\n";
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized code, we have used only necessary headers and data types, removed unnecessary variables, and simplified the condition checks to make it more efficient and faster.
