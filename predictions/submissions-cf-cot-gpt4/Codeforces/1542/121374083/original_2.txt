The original program is a solution for a competitive programming problem. It's already quite optimized, but there could be a few tweaks to make it slightly better. The main optimization you can make is to avoid unnecessary computations and to simplify conditions.

Here are the steps for optimization:

1. Remove the `#define startt` definition as it is not used in the code.
2. The `temp` variable in the `solve()` function can be avoided. Instead, calculate `n % a` once and store in `temp` to be used in the following conditions.
3. The condition `if (n % b == 1 || n % b == a || b == 1)` can be simplified to `if (temp == 1 || temp == b || b == 1)`.
4. The condition `if (a == 1)` can be moved up to avoid unnecessary computations in the case where `a` is 1.
5. The `flag` variable can be eliminated by breaking out of the loop and printing "YES" directly when the condition is met.

Here is the optimized code after the modifications:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  ll n, a, b;
  cin >> n >> a >> b;
  ll temp = n % a;
  
  if (a == 1 || temp == 1 || temp == b || b == 1) {
    cout << "YES\n";
    return;
  }
  
  while (n >= 1) {
    if (n == 1 || (n - 1) % b == 0) {
      cout << "YES\n";
      return;
    }
    n /= a;
  }
  
  cout << "NO\n";
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this is a minor optimization and might not have a significant impact on the execution time as the original code was already quite optimized. But it does make the code cleaner and easier to read.
