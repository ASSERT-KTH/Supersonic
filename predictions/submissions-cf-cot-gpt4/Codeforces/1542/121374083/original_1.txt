Optimization Steps:
1. Remove unused macros: This program contains a large number of macros that are not used in the program. They are taking up memory space and should be removed.
2. Reduce redundancy: The program checks `n % b == 1` twice in different conditions. This redundancy can be removed.
3. More efficient IO: The std::endl flushes the output buffer every time it is called, which is slower than using '\n'. It's better to use '\n' when there is no need to flush the buffer.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
typedef long long ll;

using namespace std;

void solve() {
  ll n, a, b;
  cin >> n >> a >> b;
  if (n % b == 1 || n % b == a || b == 1 || a == 1) {
    cout << "YES\n";
  } else {
    ll temp = 1, flag = 0;
    while (temp <= n) {
      if (temp == n) {
        flag = 1;
        break;
      }
      if ((n - temp) % b == 0) {
        flag = 1;
        break;
      }
      temp *= a;
    }
    if (flag)
      cout << "YES\n";
    else
      cout << "NO\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  for (int tc = 1; tc <= t; tc++) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
