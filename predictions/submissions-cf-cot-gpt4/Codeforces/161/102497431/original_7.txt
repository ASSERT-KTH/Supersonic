This program is already quite optimized as it uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the graph and dynamic programming (DP) to calculate the result. However, there are a few small optimizations that can be made.

1. **Avoid unnecessary calculations:** In the dfs function, in the second for loop, the expression "dp[node][j] - dp[u][j - 1]" is calculated multiple times for the same values of 'node', 'j', and 'u'. This value can be calculated once and stored in a variable.

2. **Reduce memory usage:** The 'g' graph is not being cleared before each run of the 'work' function. If the 'work' function is called multiple times, this could lead to excessive memory usage. The graph 'g' should be cleared before each run.

3. **Avoid using 'bits/stdc++.h':** This header file includes quite a lot of libraries, which increases the compilation time. Include only the libraries that are being used in the program.

4. **Avoid using 'using namespace std':** It's generally a bad practice to use the line "using namespace std" in the global scope in large programs as it can potentially lead to naming conflicts.

5. **Avoid using '#define' preprocessor:** In C++, using 'const' or 'constexpr' is recommended over '#define' because they respect the scope and are type safe.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <chrono>
#include <random>
#define pb push_back

typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;

const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const ll llinf = 1ll << 60;
const double PI = 3.14159265;
const int N = 50005;
const int K = 505;

std::mt19937_64 rng(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
std::vector<int> g[N];
ll ans;
int n, k;
ll dp[N][K];

ll mrand(ll B) { return (ull)rng() % B; }

void dfs(int node, int par) {
  for (auto &u : g[node]) {
    if (u == par)
      continue;
    dfs(u, node);
    for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
      dp[node][i] += dp[u][i - 1];
    }
  }
  ans += dp[node][k];
  ll tot = 0;
  for (int i = 1, j = k - 1; i < k; i++, j--) {
    for (auto &u : g[node]) {
      if (u == par)
        continue;
      ll diff = dp[node][j] - dp[u][j - 1];
      tot += (dp[u][i - 1]) * diff;
    }
  }
  ans += tot >> 1;
  dp[node][0] = 1LL;
}

void work() {
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &k);
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int u, v;
    scanf("%d%d", &u, &v);
    --u, --v;
    g[u].pb(v), g[v].pb(u);
  }
  dfs(0, -1);
  printf("%lld\n", ans);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    g[i].clear();
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0);
  work();
  return 0;
}
