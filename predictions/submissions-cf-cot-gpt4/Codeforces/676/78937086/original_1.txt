This is a complex C++ program that performs a series of calculations and checks related to prime numbers, polynomials, and modular arithmetic. The optimizations that can be made here are minimal, considering the nature of the operations performed. However, here are some possible optimizations:

1. The string to integer conversion for each value in the "values" vector can be done in-place, eliminating the need for the additional "fv" vector. This will reduce memory usage.
2. The "mm1", "mm2", "mm3", and "mm4" arrays are all calculated in exactly the same way, just with different modulo values. This computation could be consolidated into a single loop to make the code cleaner.
3. Use "else if" instead of multiple "if" statements in the last section of the main function to avoid unnecessary condition checks.
4. Remove the unnecessary else statement from the last section of the main function, since the function returns in each branch.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define mp make_pair
#define pb push_back
#define FIFO                                                                   \
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);                                                \
  cin.tie(0);                                                                  \
  cout.tie(0)

        fv[j] = (fv[j] + (1LL * val * mm[j][i]) % MOD) % MOD;
      }
    }

  } else if ((n + 1 - played) % 2 == 0)
      cout << "Yes";

```

Note: Please understand that these optimizations might not have a significant impact on the running time of the program as the main computational parts of the program (like the miller rabin primality test and fast exponentiation) cannot be easily optimized.
