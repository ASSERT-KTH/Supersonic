The given program seems to be a solution to a specific problem, possibly a competitive programming problem. The main optimization opportunities lie in the following areas:

1. **Avoiding unnecessary computations and memory usage:** Many computations are being done repeatedly. We can avoid this by storing the computed results for reuse. Moreover, the arrays `mm1`, `mm2`, `mm3`, `mm4`, and `fv` are only needed in a specific condition, so we can declare them only when required.

2. **Avoiding unnecessary data type conversions:** The strings in vector `values` are being converted to long long type. If we are sure that the input will always be integers, we can directly read the values as long long and avoid string conversion.

3. **Avoiding unnecessary function calls and operations:** There are several function calls and operations that can be avoided or simplified. For example, the mod operation is being used excessively. If the values being operated upon will not exceed the limit of the data type, the mod operation is not necessary.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
ll TestMillerRabin[12] = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37};
#define MOD 1000000007
#define mods 1000000009
#define mods1 37
#define mods2 715827883

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  int played = 0;
  ll p;
  vector<ll> values;
  for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
    ll s;
    cin >> s;
    if (i == 0)
      p = s;
    if (s != -1)
      played++;
    values.push_back(s);
  }
  if (k == 0) {
    if (values[0] == 0 || (values[0] == -1 && played % 2 == 1))
      cout << "Yes";
    else
      cout << "No";
    return 0;
  }
  if (played == n + 1) {
    vector<ll> mm1(n + 6), mm2(n + 6), mm3(n + 6), mm4(n + 6);
    mm1[0] = mm2[0] = mm3[0] = mm4[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < n + 6; i++) {
      mm1[i] = mm1[i - 1] * k % MOD;
      mm2[i] = mm2[i - 1] * k % mods;
      mm3[i] = mm3[i - 1] * k % mods1;
      mm4[i] = mm4[i - 1] * k % mods2;
    }
    ll fv1 = 0, fv2 = 0, fv3 = 0, fv4 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
      fv1 = (fv1 + values[i] * mm1[i]) % MOD;
      fv2 = (fv2 + values[i] * mm2[i]) % mods;
      fv3 = (fv3 + values[i] * mm3[i]) % mods1;
      fv4 = (fv4 + values[i] * mm4[i]) % mods2;
    }
    if (fv4 == 0 && fv1 == 0 && fv2 == 0 && fv3 == 0)
      cout << "Yes";
    else
      cout << "No";
    return 0;
  }
  if (played % 2 == 1) {
    if ((n + 1 - played) % 2 == 1)
      cout << "Yes";
    else
      cout << "No";
  } else {
    if ((n + 1 - played) % 2 == 0)
      cout << "Yes";
    else
      cout << "No";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note that many unused functions and unnecessary macros were removed from the code. This makes the code cleaner, shorter, and easier to understand. The logic remains the same, but optimizations were applied to improve the performance and memory usage.
