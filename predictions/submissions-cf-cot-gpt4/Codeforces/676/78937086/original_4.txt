This code is a bit complex and involves prime number checking, modular arithmetic, and string manipulation. Here are some steps to optimize the given code:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes more libraries than you actually need, which can increase the compiling time. Include only the necessary libraries for this program: `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`, `#include <string>`.

2. The macro `#define FIFO` can be removed. It's not used in the program, so it's just occupying memory space.

3. The `typedef` declarations for unused types like `vii`, `vll`, `vi`, `vl` can be removed. This will reduce the memory footprint of the program.

4. In the `main()` function, the `values` vector is used to store string inputs. After storing, the string inputs are converted to integer using `stoi()`. Instead of this, take integer inputs directly into a vector of integers. This avoids storing strings and then converting them to integers, thus reducing memory usage and improving runtime.

5. The `fastexp()` function is used in the `invmod()` function, but the `invmod()` function itself is not used in the code. So, `invmod()` and `fastexp()` functions can be removed to make the code cleaner.

6. The `fastexpp()` function is also not used in the code, so it can be removed.

7. The `mulmod()` function is used in `fastexpp()`, but since `fastexpp()` itself is not used, `mulmod()` can be removed.

8. The `check_composite()` function is only used inside the `isPrime()` function, but `isPrime()` itself is not used in the code. So, both `check_composite()` and `isPrime()` functions can be removed.

9. `TestMillerRabin` array is used in `isPrime()`, but since `isPrime()` is not used, `TestMillerRabin` array can be removed.

10. Finally, some parts of the code do the same thing but in different conditional branches. They can be merged to make the code more concise and readable.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define MOD 1000000007
#define mods 1000000009
#define mods1 37
#define mods2 715827883

int main() {
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  int played = 0;
  vector<ll> values(n + 1);
  for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
    ll s;
    cin >> s;
    if (s != -1)
      played++;
    values[i] = s;
  }
  if (k == 0) {
    if (values[0] == 0 or (values[0] == -1 and played % 2 == 1))
      cout << "Yes";
    else
      cout << "No";
    return 0;
  }
  if (played == n + 1) {
    vector<ll> mm1(n + 6), mm2(n + 6), mm3(n + 6), mm4(n + 6);
    mm1[0] = mm2[0] = mm3[0] = mm4[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < n + 6; i++) {
      mm1[i] = (1LL * mm1[i - 1] * k) % MOD;
      mm2[i] = (1LL * mm2[i - 1] * k) % mods;
      mm3[i] = (1LL * mm3[i - 1] * k) % mods1;
      mm4[i] = (1LL * mm4[i - 1] * k) % mods2;
    }
    ll fv1 = 0, fv2 = 0, fv3 = 0, fv4 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
      fv1 = (fv1 + (1LL * values[i] * mm1[i]) % MOD) % MOD;
      fv2 = (fv2 + (1LL * values[i] * mm2[i]) % mods) % mods;
      fv3 = (fv3 + (1LL * values[i] * mm3[i]) % mods1) % mods1;
      fv4 = (fv4 + (1LL * values[i] * mm4[i]) % mods2) % mods2;
    }
    if (fv4 == 0 and fv1 == 0 and fv2 == 0 and fv3 == 0)
      cout << "Yes";
    else
      cout << "No";
    return 0;
  }
  if ((n + 1 - played) % 2 == played % 2)
    cout << "Yes";
  else
    cout << "No";
  return 0;
}
