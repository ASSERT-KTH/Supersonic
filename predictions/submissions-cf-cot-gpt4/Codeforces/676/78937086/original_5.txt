This C++ program appears to be well-optimized on the whole, but it could be more efficient with a few small modifications. Here's how:

1. **Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`**: This header file is quite large and can slow compilation. It includes a lot of headers that aren't necessary for your program, so it's better to include only what's needed.

2. **Avoid using `using namespace std`**: This line can lead to name conflicts, as it includes all the names in the `std` namespace.

3. **Avoid macros where possible**: C++ has better alternatives to macros that should be utilized. For instance, instead of `#define mp make_pair`, use `std::pair<int, int> mp`.

4. **Use `std::array` instead of C-style arrays**: `TestMillerRabin` can be a `std::array` instead of a C-style array.

5. **Avoid unnecessary modulo operations**: Modulo operation is computationally expensive. In functions `mulmod`, `fastexp` and `fastexpp`, the last modulo operation is unnecessary. We've already performed a modulo operation in the previous line.

6. **Prefer `emplace_back` to `push_back`**: `emplace_back` constructs the object in place, while `push_back` constructs a temporary object and then moves it into the vector, which could be less efficient.

7. **Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(nullptr)`**: These lines speed up input/output by decoupling `std::cin` from `std::cout`.

After these optimizations, your code becomes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <array>
#include <string>
typedef long long ll;
typedef std::pair<int, int> pii;
typedef std::pair<ll, ll> pll;
typedef std::vector<int> vi;
typedef std::vector<ll> vl;
typedef std::vector<pii> vii;
typedef std::vector<pll> vll;
constexpr int mod1 = 1000000007;
constexpr int mod2 = 1000000009;
constexpr int mod3 = 37;
constexpr int mod4 = 715827883;
std::array<int,12> TestMillerRabin = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37};

//... code here is same as before

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);
  //...
  for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
    std::string s;
    std::cin >> s;
    if (i == 0)
      p = s;
    if (s != "?")
      played++;
    values.emplace_back(s);
  }
  //... code here is same as before
}
```

The above code is more idiomatic and should compile and run faster than the original code.
