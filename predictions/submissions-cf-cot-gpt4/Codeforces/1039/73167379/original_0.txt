Optimizing this code involves several steps:

1. **Use actual types instead of `typedef`**: This does not make the code more efficient, but it does make it more understandable. The use of `typedef` in this code is unnecessary and may cause confusion. This is especially true for types like `vec`, `ms`, `pb`, etc.

2. **Avoid using `#define` for constants**: This code uses `#define` to create constants. It's better to use `const` for this purpose since it provides type checking which can prevent bugs.

3. **Avoid using `#define` for functions**: This code uses `#define` for functions like `fast`. This is considered bad practice in C++ because it can cause problems with debugging and code maintenance. It's better to use inline functions instead.

4. **Avoid using global variables**: This code uses global variables like `a`, `OPA`, etc. This is considered bad practice in C++ because it can lead to bugs that are hard to find. It's better to pass these variables as arguments to functions.

5. **Minimize the use of `#pragma` directives**: These directives are used for compiler-specific optimizations. However, they can make the code less portable and less understandable. It's better to rely on standard C++ features for optimization.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
typedef long double ld;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pll;
typedef pair<ld, ld> pdd;
typedef pair<Node *, Node *> pnn;

mt19937 rnd(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());

// Replace fast macro with inline function
inline void fast() {
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  cin.sync_with_stdio(0);
  cout.sync_with_stdio(0);
}

// Other functions remain the same

int main() {
  fast();
  // Avoid using global variables
  int a;
  cin >> a;

  // Other code remains the same
}
```

This optimized code is more readable and maintainable, but it might not necessarily run faster or use less memory. The original code is already highly optimized for speed and memory usage, so there's not much room for improvement in these areas.
