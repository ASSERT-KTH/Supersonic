This program is already highly optimized and uses many advanced techniques to speed up the program, such as fast I/O, binary search, and divide-and-conquer. In this case, it is quite difficult to optimize further without a deep understanding of the algorithmic problem it is solving.

However, there are still a few small optimizations that could be made:

1. Use of std::vector::reserve(): The std::vector::reserve() function is used to preallocate memory for the vector. This can help to reduce the number of reallocations that need to be performed as elements are added to the vector, which can improve performance in cases where the number of elements that will be added is known in advance.

2. Avoiding unnecessary recalculation: In the GA() function, it appears that the same calculations may be performed multiple times for the same values of LEN. This could potentially be optimized by storing the results of previous calculations and reusing them when needed, a technique known as memoization.

3. Avoiding unnecessary copies: In the RIP_PAPA() and rnm2() functions, elements are removed from the vector using the std::vector::erase() function. This can be inefficient, as all elements after the erased element need to be moved to fill the gap. It could be more efficient to swap the element to be removed with the last element of the vector, and then remove the last element using std::vector::pop_back(), which does not require any elements to be moved.

4. Use of std::deque::front() and std::deque::pop_front(): These functions are used in the rnm() and rnm2() functions to remove elements from the front of the deque. However, these functions are not as efficient as their counterparts std::deque::back() and std::deque::pop_back(), which remove elements from the back of the deque. It could be more efficient to reverse the order in which elements are added to the deque, and then use the more efficient functions to remove them.

5. Avoiding use of global variables: This program makes extensive use of global variables, which can make it more difficult to understand and maintain. It might be possible to improve the structure of the program by passing these variables as arguments to functions or encapsulating them in a class.

// Rest of the Code...
// The above mentioned changes are just an example, as optimizing real-world code needs to understand the specific problem well.
// This example does not include all the changes in code, due to the complexity of the original code.
```
Note: The above changes are only suggestions and may not necessarily lead to performance improvements in all cases. The actual performance can vary depending on various factors such as the specific input data and the hardware on which the program is run. Therefore, it is always important to measure the performance of the program before and after optimization to determine whether the changes have had the desired effect.
