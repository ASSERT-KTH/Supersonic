Step 1: Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which increases compilation time. Instead, only include the libraries you need, which in this case are `iostream`.

Step 2: Instead of performing two divisions when `n` is odd, you can simply calculate `sum` as `-n/2`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  long long n, sum;
  cin >> n;
  if (n % 2 == 0) {
    sum = n / 2;
  } else {
    sum = -n / 2;
  }
  cout << sum << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This code maintains the same functionality as the original, but it is more efficient in terms of both running time and memory usage.
