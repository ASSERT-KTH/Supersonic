This C++ program calculates the sum of the first 'n' integers, where 'n' is provided by the user. If 'n' is an even number, the sum is positive, otherwise it is negative.

Optimization Steps:
1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and replace it with the specific libraries that are needed. Including `bits/stdc++.h` is not a good practice because it includes all the standard libraries, which can slow down the compilation process.
2. Use bitwise operators instead of arithmetic operators. Bitwise operators are faster than arithmetic operators. In this case, we can use the bitwise AND operator (&) to check if the number is even or odd. And we can use right shift operator (>>) to divide the number by 2. 

Now, let's implement these changes in the program.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  long long n, sum;
  cin >> n;
  if (n & 1) {
    sum = -((n + 1) >> 1);
  } else {
    sum = n >> 1;
  }
  cout << sum << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
By applying these optimizations, the program will be faster and more memory efficient.
