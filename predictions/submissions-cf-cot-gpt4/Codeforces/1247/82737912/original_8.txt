This is a pretty dense program, but let's see what optimizations we can make.

1. Reduce scope of variables: In the provided code, all variables are defined globally. It is a good practice to reduce the scope of variables as much as possible. In this case, we can move the variables 'tes', 'n', 'm', 'arr', 'cum', and 'dp' inside the 'main' function or where they are required.

2. Avoid unnecessary computations: The function 'power' is defined but not used anywhere in the code. So, it can be removed to save memory.

3. Reduce unnecessary memory allocation: The 4D vector 'dp' seems to be taking up a lot of memory. It's initiated with size 2e3 + 1 for each of its dimensions. This is a lot of memory. It might be possible to reduce this if the problem's constraints allow it.

4. Avoid using 'endl': 'endl' not only breaks the line, but also flushes the output buffer, which is slower than simply printing '\n'.

5. Use '\n' instead of 'endl': As mentioned in the previous point, it's faster to print '\n' instead of 'endl' to break the line.

6. Avoid using 'bits/stdc++.h': This header file includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which can slow down the compilation time. Include only necessary libraries explicitly.

7. Avoid using macro definitions: Macro definitions like '#define' are processed before the compilation and it may make the debugging difficult. Use constant variables or inline functions instead, wherever possible.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
using ld = long double;
using ve = vector<string>;
using vellll = vector<vector<vector<vector<ll>>>>;
using velll = vector<vector<vector<ll>>>;
using pii = pair<int, int>;
using pll = pair<ll, ll>;

const ll mod = 1000000007;
const ll inf = 9e18;
const ld pi = 2 * acos(0.0);

void solve() {
  ll n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;

  ve arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> arr[i];

  velll cum(n, vector<vector<ll>>(m, vector<ll>(2, 0)));
  vellll dp(n, vector<vector<vector<ll>>>(m, vector<vector<ll>>(2, vector<ll>(2, 0))));

  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      cum[i][j][0] = (i == n - 1) ? 0 : cum[i + 1][j][0];
      if (arr[i][j] == 'R')
        cum[i][j][0]++;
    }
  }
  for (int j = m - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cum[i][j][1] = (j == m - 1) ? 0 : cum[i][j + 1][1];
      if (arr[i][j] == 'R')
        cum[i][j][1]++;
    }
  }

  // rest of the code remains the same...
  cout << dp[0][0][0][1] << '\n';
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int tes = 1;
  while (tes--) {
    solve();
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that it's hard to optimize the code further without knowing the exact problem constraints. The loop optimization and data structure optimization should be done based on specific problem requirements.
