This program adds up all the elements of an array and stores the result in a map. During the process, it subtracts some values from the sum based on some conditions. It looks like the program is trying to find a specific pattern in the array.

Here are the steps for optimization:

1. First, always include only necessary libraries. The #include <bits/stdc++.h> is a GCC specific library that includes most of the standard libraries. This is not recommended since it increases compilation time and is not portable. In this case, we only need <iostream>, <vector> and <map>.
  
2. Use fast I/O operations. In competitive programming, cin and cout are slower than scanf and printf. But we can speed up cin and cout by adding ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL) at the beginning of the main function.

3. The map 'vis' is only used to check whether an element exists or not. We can replace it with a set, which is faster for existence checks.
  
4. We are using long long data type for many variables which might not need such a large range. Analyzing the context in which these variables are used can help us to choose a more appropriate data type.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  long long ans = static_cast<long long>(n) * (n + 1) / 2;
  
  vector<long long> v(n + 1), cnt(n + 1, 0);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    cin >> v[i];
    
  map<long long, int> mp;
  set<long long> vis;
  mp[0] = 0;
  vis.insert(0);
  
  int mx = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1] + v[i];
    if (vis.count(cnt[i])) {
      int l = max(0, mp[cnt[i]] - mx);
      int r = n - i;
      if (mp[cnt[i]] - mx >= 0) {
        ans -= static_cast<long long>(l) * r + l + r;
        if (i - mp[cnt[i]] != n || !mx)
          ans--;
      }
      mx = max(mp[cnt[i]] + 1, mx);
    }
    mp[cnt[i]] = i;
    vis.insert(cnt[i]);
  }
  
  cout << ans << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program will run faster due to fast I/O operations and the usage of set instead of map for existence checks. The memory usage will also be reduced due to the replacement of long long data types with int where possible.
