This is a relatively optimized code in terms of its logic and usage of C++ STL containers. However, there are a few areas where the code can be slightly optimized:

1. **Avoid excessive macro usage**: Macros in C++ are replaced by the preprocessor before compilation, which can lead to code bloat and debugging difficulties. Where possible, use functions or constants.

2. **Use of `#include "bits/stdc++.h"`**: This header file includes almost all standard library header files, which can increase compilation time because they are all included, regardless of whether they are used or not. Include only those libraries that you actually need.

3. **Use of `using namespace std;`**: This can lead to naming conflicts if the standard library has an identifier that matches one in your code. It's better to use `std::` where necessary.

4. **Avoiding global variables**: `countOfFactors` is a global variable. We can avoid this by passing it as a parameter to the function. This can make the function more predictable and easier to debug.

5. **Avoiding unnecessary functions**: `fio()` and `setUpLocal()` functions can be replaced with a few lines of code in the `main()` function itself.

6. **Avoiding unnecessary initializations**: `gcdIs` is initialized with 0. There's no need to initialize it 

Here's the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <set>
#include <bitset>
#include <algorithm>

#define int long long int
const int mod = 1000 * 1000 * 1000 + 7;
const int maxN = 15000007;
std::bitset<maxN> primes;
int spf[maxN];

int gcd(int x, int y) { return y ? gcd(y, x % y) : x; }

void sieve() {
  primes.set();
  primes[0] = primes[1] = 0;
  for (int i = 2; i < maxN; i++)
    spf[i] = i;
  for (int i = 4; i < maxN; i += 2) {
    if (i != 2)
      primes[i] = 0;
    spf[i] = 2;
  }
  for (int i = 3; i < maxN; i++) {
    if (primes[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j < maxN; j += i) {
        primes[j] = 0;
        spf[j] = i;
      }
    }
  }
}

void factorize(int n, std::unordered_map<int, int> &countOfFactors) {
  std::set<int> primeFactors;
  while (n != 1) {
    primeFactors.insert(spf[n]);
    n /= spf[n];
  }
  for (int i : primeFactors)
    countOfFactors[i]++;
}

int32_t main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  
  sieve();
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> v(n);
  int gcdIs;
  std::cin >> gcdIs; v[0] = gcdIs;
  
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> v[i];
    gcdIs = gcd(gcdIs, v[i]);
  }
  
  std::unordered_map<int, int> countOfFactors;
  
  for (int &i : v) {
    i /= gcdIs;
    factorize(i, countOfFactors);
  }
  
  int keep = 0;
  for (auto &i : countOfFactors) {
    keep = std::max(keep, i.second);
  }
  keep ? (std::cout << n - keep) : (std::cout << "-1");
  
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The program assumes that the input and output files are properly set up. If you are not working in an environment where the input and output files are pre-set (like a competitive programming platform), you may need to modify the program to handle input and output in a way that suits your environment.
