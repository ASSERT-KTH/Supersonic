This C++ program is already fairly optimized. However, there are a few potential improvements that can be made:

1. Replace the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` directive: `bits/stdc++.h` is not a standard C++ library. It's a GCC extension that includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can slow down the compilation time. I will replace it with the necessary standard libraries.

2. Remove `const double eps = 1e-8;`: This constant is not used anywhere in the code, so we can remove it for better readability and to reduce the size of the executable.

3. Remove `typedef unsigned long long ull;` and `typedef long long ll;`: These typedefs are not used in the code, so we can remove them for the same reasons as above.

4. Remove `#define pii pair<int, int>`: Again, this macro is not used anywhere in the code, so it can be removed.

5. Remove `#define X first` and `#define Y second`: These macros are not used anywhere in the code, so they can be removed.

6. Remove `#define lowbit a &(-a)`: This macro is not used anywhere in the code, so it can be removed.

7. Remove `const double PI = acos(-1);`: This constant is not used anywhere in the code, so it can be removed.

8. Remove `const int mod = 1e9 + 7;`: This constant is not used anywhere in the code, so it can be removed.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <cmath>

const int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const int maxn = 1e6 + 10;

int prime[maxn];
bool vis[maxn];

template <typename t> void read(t &x) {
  char ch = getchar();
  x = 0;
  int f = 1;
  while (!isdigit(ch)) {
    if (ch == '-')
      f = -1;
    ch = getchar();
  }
  while (isdigit(ch)) {
    x = (x << 3) + (x << 1) + (ch ^ 48);
    ch = getchar();
  }
  x = x * f;
}

void euler(int n) {
  memset(vis, 0, sizeof(vis));
  for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!vis[i])
      prime[++prime[0]] = i;
    for (int j = 1; j <= prime[0] && i * prime[j] < n; ++j) {
      vis[i * prime[j]] = true;
      if (i % prime[j] == 0)
        break;
    }
  }
}

int ans[maxn];

int main() {
  euler(maxn - 9);
  vis[1] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= maxn; ++i)
    ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + (int)(!vis[i]);
  int t;
  read(t);
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    read(n);
    if (n <= 3) {
      printf("%d\n", n);
      continue;
    }
    int l = 1, r = prime[0];
    while (l + 1 < r) {
      int mid = (r + l) / 2;
      if ((long long)prime[mid] * prime[mid] <= (long long)n)
        l = mid;
      else
        r = mid;
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans[n] - ans[prime[l]] + 1);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
