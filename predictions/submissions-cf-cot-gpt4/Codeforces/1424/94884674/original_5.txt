This program needs a few optimizations.

1. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the specific standard libraries used in the program. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is not a standard library and it includes all the standard libraries which increases the compilation time.

2. The function `euler(int n)` calculates all the prime numbers till `n` using the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm and stores them in `prime[]` array. As the size of `prime[]` is not known before execution, the size of `prime[]` is taken as the maximum possible size i.e., `maxn`. But, the number of primes till `n` is less than `n`. So, the memory is wasted. By using a std::vector instead of a C array, we can dynamically allocate memory as per the requirement which reduces memory usage.

3. Replace `#define pii pair<int, int>` with `typedef pair<int, int> pii;` because `typedef` is preferred over `#define` in C++ as it follows scope rules.

4. Using C++ `iostream` functions like `cin`, `cout` instead of C-style I/O functions like `getchar()`, `printf()`. I/O functions from `iostream` are type safe and easier to use.

5. In the main function, the `vis[1] = 1;` is not required as `vis[]` array is already initialized with false in the `euler()` function.

6. Remove unused constants, macros, and typedefs.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
const int maxn = 1e6 + 10;
vector<int> prime;
vector<bool> vis(maxn);
vector<int> ans(maxn);

void euler(int n) {
  for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!vis[i])
      prime.push_back(i);
    for (unsigned int j = 0; j < prime.size() && i * prime[j] < n; ++j) {
      vis[i * prime[j]] = true;
      if (i % prime[j] == 0)
        break;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  euler(maxn - 9);
  for (int i = 1; i <= maxn; ++i)
    ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + (!vis[i]);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    if (n <= 3) {
      cout << n << "\n";
      continue;
    }
    int l = 1, r = prime.size();
    while (l + 1 < r) {
      int mid = (r + l) / 2;
      if ((ll)prime[mid] * prime[mid] <= (ll)n)
        l = mid;
      else
        r = mid;
    }
    cout << ans[n] - ans[prime[l]] + 1 << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In conclusion, the optimizations made in this code are focused on reducing memory usage and improving code readability. The use of vectors over C arrays allows dynamic memory allocation, reducing unnecessary memory usage. The use of `iostream` functions over C-style I/O functions improves code readability and safety. Furthermore, removing unused definitions and cleaning up the code also improves readability.
