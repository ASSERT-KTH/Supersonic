The code you posted is a program to calculate the number of prime numbers less than or equal to `n` for each test case. The optimization for this program can be done in the following ways:

1. The key point of optimization is the sieve of Eratosthenes, which is done in the function `euler(int n)`. In the original code, the sieve of Eratosthenes is performed on all numbers up to `maxn - 9`, but it actually only needs to be done up to `sqrt(maxn)` because any composite number `n` must have a factor less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`. So we can decrease the range of the sieve to `sqrt(maxn)`.

2. By using `std::vector` instead of C-style arrays, we can avoid the need to manually manage memory and make the code safer and simpler. But since we are asked to make small modifications, we will keep the arrays.

3. `memset` is used to initialize the `vis` array, but it is not necessary because the `vis` array is global and it is automatically initialized to zero.

4. The `read()` function is used to read integers, but it is a bit overcomplicated. We can replace it with standard `std::cin >> x`.

5. The `printf` function is used to print the result. To keep the code more C++ style, we can replace it with `std::cout << x`.

6. The code has a `using namespace std;` statement. This is considered a bad practice in C++. It is better to use the `std::` prefix when needed.

Here is the optimized code considering the above points:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

const int maxn = 1e6 + 10;
int prime[maxn];
bool vis[maxn];
int ans[maxn];

void euler(int n) {
  for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!vis[i])
      prime[++prime[0]] = i;
    for (int j = 1; j <= prime[0] && i * prime[j] < n; ++j) {
      vis[i * prime[j]] = true;
      if (i % prime[j] == 0)
        break;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  euler(sqrt(maxn - 9));
  vis[1] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= maxn; ++i)
    ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + (int)(!vis[i]);
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    if (n <= 3) {
      std::cout << n << "\n";
      continue;
    }
    int l = 1, r = prime[0];
    while (l + 1 < r) {
      int mid = (r + l) / 2;
      if ((long long)prime[mid] * prime[mid] <= (long long)n)
        l = mid;
      else
        r = mid;
    }
    std::cout << ans[n] - ans[prime[l]] + 1 << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the optimization may vary depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.
