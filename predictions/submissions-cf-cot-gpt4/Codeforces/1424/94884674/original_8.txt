The optimizations that can be made in the program are:

1. Use a vector instead of an array for 'prime' and 'vis'. This would help in saving memory as the size of the vector can be adjusted dynamically. This would also lead to faster execution time as there will be fewer cache misses due to fewer elements in memory.

2. Instead of memset, use std::fill_n for filling an array. It is faster because it uses a template function and there is no typecasting involved.

3. The macro lowbit defined is not used in the program. It can be removed.

4. The function read() uses getchar() which is slower than using cin. Change getchar() to cin.

5. The main optimization is in the euler() function. The check of 'if (!vis[i])' is not needed. It is better to just iterate over all the numbers and mark them as visited.

6. In the main function, use cin instead of read() function to take inputs. It is faster.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
const int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const double PI = acos(-1);
const double eps = 1e-8;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef long long ll;
#define pii pair<int, int>
#define X first
#define Y second
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 1e6 + 10;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
vector<int> prime(maxn, 0);
vector<bool> vis(maxn, false);
void euler(int n) {
  prime[0] = 0;
  fill_n(vis.begin(), vis.size(), false);
  for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
    prime[++prime[0]] = i;
    for (int j = 1; j <= prime[0] && i * prime[j] < n; ++j) {
      vis[i * prime[j]] = true;
      if (i % prime[j] == 0)
        break;
    }
  }
}
vector<int> ans(maxn, 0);
int main() {
  euler(maxn - 9);
  vis[1] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i < maxn; ++i)
    ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + (int)(!vis[i]);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    if (n <= 3) {
      cout << n << "\n";
      continue;
    }
    int l = 1, r = prime[0];
    while (l + 1 < r) {
      int mid = (r + l) / 2;
      if ((ll)prime[mid] * prime[mid] <= (ll)n)
        l = mid;
      else
        r = mid;
    }
    cout << ans[n] - ans[prime[l]] + 1 << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
