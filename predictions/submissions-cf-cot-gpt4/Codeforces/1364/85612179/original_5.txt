The code is a C++ program that takes an input array of integers and transforms it into an array where each element is not present in the original array before its position. The code is already optimized for speed with the use of unordered_set and unordered_map for constant time lookups, use of the Fast I/O, and other optimizations for modern compilers.

However, there are a few small improvements that can be made for both readability and performance:

1. Unnecessary typedefs: The code defines a lot of typedefs which are never used in the code. Removing these will not only reduce the memory footprint of the executable file, but also improve the readability of the code.

2. Unnecessary Macros: The code has a lot of macros which are never used. These can be removed to improve readability.

3. The code uses the set to check if a number is present or not. However, we can use an array of booleans (or bitset for optimizing memory usage) to mark the presence of a number. This will reduce the time complexity from O(logN) to O(1) for each lookup.

4. The custom_hash struct and associated code are not used anywhere in the program and can be safely removed.

5. The debug function and associated macros are not used anywhere in the program and can be safely removed.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define fr(i, a, b) for (int i = (a), _b = (b); i <= _b; i++)
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0, _n = (n); i < _n; i++)

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> v(n);
  bitset<100001> s1; // Assuming n <= 10^5
  rep(i, n) {
    cin >> v[i];
    s1.set(v[i]);
    if (v[i] > i + 1) {
      cout << -1 << '\n';
      return 0;
    }
  }
  vector<int> ans(n, -1);
  fr(i, 1, n - 1) {
    if (v[i - 1] != v[i]) {
      ans[i] = v[i - 1];
    }
  }
  int start = !v[0];
  rep(i, n) {
    if (ans[i] == -1) {
      while (s1.test(start)) {
        start++;
      }
      ans[i] = start++;
    }
  }
  rep(i, n) { cout << ans[i] << ' '; }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the size of the bitset is assumed to be 100001. This number should be adjusted according to the maximum possible value of n.
