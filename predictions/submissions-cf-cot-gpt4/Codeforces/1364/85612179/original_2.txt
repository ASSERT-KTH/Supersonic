This program appears to be a competitive programming problem solution. The code has a lot of macros and typedefs which are used in competitive programming to write code fast. However, they can make the code harder to understand and maintain for other developers. 

Also, using "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" is not a good practice since it includes a lot of unnecessary headers which can increase the compile time.

Here are the steps for optimization:

1. Remove unnecessary #include and typedef statements. Include only those header files which are necessary.

2. Remove #pragma GCC optimize("Ofast") statement. This is used to optimize the code at compile time, but sometimes it can lead to precision errors.

3. Remove the debug functions and macros. They are not needed for the final version of the program, so they can be removed to make the code cleaner.

4. Instead of using std::set to store the elements of the vector, use std::unordered_set which has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertions and lookups.

5. The vector 'ranges' is declared but never used, so it can be removed.

6. The 'custom_hash' struct is declared but never used, so it can be removed.

7. #define macros like 'fr', 'rep', etc. make the code shorter but harder to understand. Replace them with regular for-loops.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  vector<int> v(n);
  unordered_set<int> s1;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
    s1.insert(v[i]);
    if (v[i] > i + 1) {
      cout << -1 << '\n';
      return 0;
    }
  }
  
  vector<int> ans(n, -1);
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (v[i - 1] != v[i]) {
      ans[i] = v[i - 1];
    }
  }
  
  int start = !v[0];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (ans[i] == -1) {
      while (s1.find(start) != s1.end()) {
        start++;
      }
      ans[i] = start++;
    }
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << ans[i] << ' ';
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code is shorter, clearer and more maintainable. It should also be a bit faster due to the usage of std::unordered_set instead of std::set.
