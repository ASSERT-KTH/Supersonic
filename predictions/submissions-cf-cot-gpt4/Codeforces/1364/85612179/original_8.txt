The given code is quite complex and already optimized in many ways. However, a few improvements can still be made:

1. The code uses `find()` method on an `unordered_set` (s1) inside a loop. This operation could be quite costly in terms of performance, especially if the size of the `unordered_set` is large. An `unordered_set` can be replaced with a `vector` of `boolean` values where the index represents the value itself and the element at that index represents the existence of that value. This would reduce the time complexity of the operation from O(1) to O(N).

2. The `#define` macros are used to create aliases for different operations. While this practice makes the code shorter, it reduces readability. The macro names can be improved to make the code more readable.

3. The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` are used to speed up the `cin` and `cout` operations. However, they can lead to problems when we are mixing `cin/cout` and `scanf/printf` in the same program. The code does not seem to use `scanf/printf` so it should be fine in this case.

4. The `#ifdef mehul` blocks are used to conditionally compile the code. If the 'mehul' flag is not set, certain parts of the code are not compiled. This can be useful for debugging or for providing different versions of the code for different environments. However, if these blocks are not needed, they can be removed to simplify the code.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define for_range(i, a, b) for (int i = (a), _b = (b); i <= _b; i++)
#define for_loop(i, n) for (int i = 0, _n = (n); i < _n; i++)

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> v(n), ans(n, -1);
  vector<bool> exists(n+1, false);
  for_loop(i, n) {
    cin >> v[i];
    exists[v[i]] = true;
    if (v[i] > i + 1) {
      cout << -1 << '\n';
      return 0;
    }
  }
  for_range(i, 1, n - 1) {
    if (v[i - 1] != v[i]) {
      ans[i] = v[i - 1];
    }
  }
  int start = !v[0];
  for_loop(i, n) {
    if (ans[i] == -1) {
      while (exists[start]) {
        start++;
      }
      ans[i] = start++;
    }
  }
  for_loop(i, n) { cout << ans[i] << ' '; }
  return 0;
}
```
