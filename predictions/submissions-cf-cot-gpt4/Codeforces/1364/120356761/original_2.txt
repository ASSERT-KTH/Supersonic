Here are the optimization steps:

1. Move `int pos = 0;` to the scope of the `while` loop to avoid unnecessary memory allocation.
2. The `if (!pos) pos--;` statement is not needed as the value of pos is always greater than or equal to 1, due to the for loops and the min() function call. If all elements in the array are zero, the minimum value of `pos` is 1, and if not, the minimum value is the index of the non-zero element plus 1.
3. Avoid using `#define` for loops like `#define fon for (i = 0; i < n; i++)`. It's not a good practice in terms of readability and debugging.
4. Avoid using `using namespace std;`. It's a bad practice because it can lead to name clashes.
5. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` directly instead of `#define JSM ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`.
6. Use pre-increment (`++i`) instead of post-increment (`i++`) in for loops. This can provide a little performance gain in some cases. This is because post increment involves copying the value before incrementing, while pre-increment doesn't.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int t, n, x, i;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    std::cin >> n >> x;
    std::vector<int> a(n);
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      std::cin >> a[i];
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      a[i] %= x;
    int sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      sum += a[i];
    if (sum % x) {
      std::cout << n << std::endl;
      continue;
    }
    int pos = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      if (a[i])
        break;
    pos = i + 1;
    for (i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i)
      if (a[i])
        break;
    pos = std::min(pos, n - i);
    std::cout << n - pos << std::endl;
  }
}
```

Please note that the use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is considered bad practice. It's better to include only the necessary libraries, like `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`, `#include <algorithm>`. But as the task is to make small modifications, I did not change it.
