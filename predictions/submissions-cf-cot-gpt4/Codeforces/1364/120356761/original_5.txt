Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary macros. The usage of macros can be avoided for better readability. The macro `#define fon for (i = 0; i < n; i++)` is not clear for readers who are not familiar with it. It's better to use the actual `for` loop with its conditions.

2. `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` should be moved outside the main function. This is used to speed up I/O operations but don't need to be inside the main function.

3. Instead of calculating the sum of all elements and then checking if it's divisible by x, we can check each element while reading the input. If there is any element not divisible by x, then we can print n and continue; we don't need to calculate the sum and check the divisibility.

4. We don't need to iterate through the vector twice to find the first and last element not divisible by x. Instead, we can find them while reading the input.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int
#define pb push_back

ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

int main() {
    int t, n, x, i, answer = 0;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        cin >> n >> x;
        vector<int> a(n);
        bool dividable = true;
        int first = -1;
        int last = -1;
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
            a[i] %= x;
            if (a[i] && dividable) {
                dividable = false;
                first = i;
            }
            if (a[i]) {
                last = i;
            }
        }
        if (!dividable) {
            cout << n << endl;
            continue;
        }
        int pos = min(first + 1, n - last);
        cout << n - pos << endl;
    }
}
```
