This program can be optimized by removing redundant iterations, removing redundant code and by optimizing input-output operations. Here are the steps to optimize this program:

1. Redundant Iterations: The program iterates over the array 'a' three times. First to input elements, second to calculate modulo operation and sum, and third to find the first and last non-zero elements. We can do all these tasks in one iteration only. This will significantly decrease the running time of the program.

2. Redundant Modulo Operation: The program takes modulo of each array element with 'x' and then takes modulo of sum with 'x'. Taking modulo in each step is not necessary. We can just take modulo of the sum with 'x' after adding all elements. This will give the same result and reduce the number of modulo operations by 'n'.

3. Redundant Code: The variable 'pos' is unnecessarily set to 'i + 1' and 'n - i'. We can directly calculate 'n - pos' in the same step and store it in 'answer'.

4. Input-Output Operations: The program uses C++ 'cin' and 'cout' for input-output operations. We can use 'scanf' and 'printf' instead of 'cin' and 'cout'. 'scanf' and 'printf' are faster than 'cin' and 'cout'.

5. Unnecessary Macros: The program defines some unnecessary macros like 'pb' and 'JSM'. These macros are not used anywhere in the code. We can remove these macros to clean up the code.

Here is the optimized program after applying all these steps:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
#define ll long long int
int main() {
  int t, n, x, i, answer = 0, sum = 0, a;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &x);
    int pos = n, neg = -1;
    sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &a);
      sum += a;
      if (a % x != 0) {
        pos = std::min(pos, i);
        neg = i;
      }
    }
    answer = (sum % x == 0 ? n - std::min(pos + 1, n - neg) : n);
    printf("%d\n", answer);
  }
}
```
