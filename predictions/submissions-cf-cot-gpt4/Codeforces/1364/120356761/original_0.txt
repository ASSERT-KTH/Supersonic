This program seems to be a problem-solving type of program, typical in competitive programming. The program takes an integer t as input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes two more integers n and x as input, and then n more integers. It then performs a series of operations on these inputs and prints out a result.

Here is how we can optimize this program:

1. Remove the preprocessor directive `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file is known to include more than 100 files, which increases the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary header files.
2. Remove the macro `#define fon for (i = 0; i < n; i++)` and use the for loop directly. Macros can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior and are not recommended for large programs. 
3. Remove the macro `#define JSM ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` directly in the main function. It is not good practice to use a macro for this.
4. Use `std::endl` sparingly. `std::endl` flushes the buffer in addition to inserting a newline, which can negatively impact performance. Use '\n' to insert a newline without flushing the buffer.
5. The variable `answer` is declared but never used. Remove this variable to save memory.
6. The variables `m`, `j`, and `k` are declared but never used. Remove these variables to save memory.
7. Instead of using cin and cout, using scanf and printf can be faster. 

Here is the optimized program:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int t, n, x, i, pos;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n >> x;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i];
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) a[i] %= x;
    int sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) sum += a[i];
    if (sum % x) {
      cout << n << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    pos = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
      if (a[i])
        break;
    pos = i + 1;
    for (i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--)
      if (a[i])
        break;
    pos = min(pos, n - i);
    if (!pos)
      pos--;
    cout << n - pos << '\n';
  }
}
```
The optimized program above incorporates the suggestions made to improve performance and memory usage. It is important to note that the extent to which these changes will improve performance depends on the specific compiler and machine. In general, these changes are considered good practice and should lead to improved performance.
