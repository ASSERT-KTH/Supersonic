Before optimizing the code, let's understand the problem it solves. This program reads a number of test cases. Each test case consists of a vector of integers and a modulus. It computes the modulus of each element in the vector, sums them, and if the sum is not divisible by the modulus, it prints the size of the vector. Otherwise, it finds the first and last non-zero elements in the vector and prints the largest sequence without these elements.

Here are some optimization steps:

1. Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header, it includes more than we need which increases the compilation time. Instead, explicitly include only needed headers, which are `iostream`, `vector`, and `algorithm` in this case.

2. Remove the `#define` directives. The `pb` macro is not used anywhere and the `fon` macro only obfuscates the code. Also, the `JSM` macro can be replaced with its content.

3. The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` line is used to speed up I/O by disabling synchronization with the standard C I/O library. However, it's not needed here because we're not using any C I/O functions.

4. Move the declarations of `i`, `j`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `answer` to the smallest possible scope, which reduces memory usage.

5. The variable `answer` is not used anywhere, so it can be removed.

6. `pos` is unnecessarily incremented and then immediately decremented when it's zero. This can be simplified.

7. The `continue` statement is unnecessary and can be removed if we change the structure of the code slightly.

8. The `min` function is not needed because we can use the ternary operator to select the smaller value.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, x;
    cin >> n >> x;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
      a[i] %= x;
    }
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      sum += a[i];
    if (sum % x) {
      cout << n << '\n';
    } else {
      int pos1 = 0, pos2 = n - 1;
      while (pos1 < n && a[pos1] == 0) pos1++;
      while (pos2 >= 0 && a[pos2] == 0) pos2--;
      int pos = pos1 < n - pos2 ? pos1 + 1 : n - pos2;
      cout << n - pos << '\n';
    }
  }
}
```
