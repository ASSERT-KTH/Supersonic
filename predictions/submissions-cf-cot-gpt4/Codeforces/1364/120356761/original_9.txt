The given program can be optimized in multiple ways:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because this header file includes quite a lot of files, which increases compilation time. Instead, include only necessary header files.

2. Use prefix increment (++i) instead of postfix increment (i++) in loops, as the former is generally more efficient in C++.

3. Avoid repeated computation of `n - i` by storing it in a variable.

4. Avoid using `std::endl` for newline, as it also forces a flush operation, which can slow down your program. Use '\n' character instead.

5. Remove unused variables `m`, `j`, `k` and `answer`.

6. You can also remove `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` if you aren't using multi-threading.

Applying these optimizations, the code becomes:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int

int main() {
  int t, n, x, i;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n >> x;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      cin >> a[i];

    int sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      a[i] %= x;
      sum += a[i];
    }
    if (sum % x) {
      cout << n << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    int pos = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      if (a[i])
        break;
    pos = i + 1;
    for (i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i)
      if (a[i])
        break;
    int n_minus_i = n - i;
    pos = min(pos, n_minus_i);
    if (!pos)
      pos--;
    cout << n - pos << '\n';
  }
}
```
Please test the code thoroughly to make sure that the optimizations didn't affect the logic of your program.
