First, let's identify the parts that could be optimized in the existing code:

1. The macro definition `#define fon for (i = 0; i < n; i++)` is not recommended. It decreases code readability and can lead to unexpected behavior. We will replace this macro with the actual for loop.

2. The line `JSM int t, n, m, x, i, j, k, answer = 0;` is not optimized. The variable `answer` is not used at all in the program and `m, j, k` are declared but not used. We can remove those from the declaration to save memory.

3. The calculations of modulo and sum can be done in a single loop to save time.

4. We can calculate the minimum position in the same loop by keeping track of the first and last non-zero modulo positions.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int t, n, x, i;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n >> x;
    vector<int> a(n);
    int sum = 0, firstPos = -1, lastPos = -1;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
      a[i] %= x;
      sum += a[i];
      if (a[i] && firstPos == -1)
        firstPos = i;
      if (a[i])
        lastPos = i;
    }
    if (sum % x) {
      cout << n << endl;
      continue;
    }
    int pos = min(firstPos + 1, n - lastPos);
    if (!pos)
      pos--;
    cout << n - pos << endl;
  }
}
```

This optimized program should run faster and use less memory than the original one.
