The given C/C++ program has several places where we can optimize it to improve running time and memory usage. Here are the steps we can take:

1. Remove Unused Code: The given program contains several lines of code that are not being used. This includes unused macros, variables, arrays, and functions. By removing these, we can reduce the program's memory usage.

2. Use auto in Range-Based for Loop: In the range-based for loop, we can use 'auto' instead of specifying the type 'll'. This not only makes the code cleaner but also reduces the chance of type-related errors.

3. Reduce Variable Scope: In the main function, several variables are declared at the beginning of the function but are only used within the while loop. We can declare these variables within the while loop to reduce their scope and improve memory usage.

4. Optimize I/O Operations: We can replace 'endl' with '\n' to improve the speed of output on some compilers. 

5. Avoid Unnecessary Memory Allocation: The vectors 'v' and 'v2' are initialized in each iteration of the while loop. However, 'v2' is never used, and 'v' can be cleared at the end of each iteration. This avoids unnecessary memory allocation.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<ll> a(n+1), v;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      cin >> a[i];
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      if (i == 1 || i == n || (a[i - 1] < a[i]) != (a[i] < a[i + 1]))
        v.push_back(a[i]);
    }
    cout << v.size() << "\n";
    for (auto it : v)
      cout << it << " ";
    cout << "\n";
    v.clear();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program should run faster and use less memory than the original program.
