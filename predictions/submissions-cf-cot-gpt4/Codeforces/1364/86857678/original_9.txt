This program seems to be a competitive programming solution for a specific problem, and it's already quite optimized. However, there is still some room for minor improvements:

1. Avoid "using namespace std;" - It's a bad practice because it can lead to name collisions, which can cause bugs that are hard to track down.

2. Move the declarations of variables to the place where they are first used. This can make the code cleaner and slightly more efficient, as the variables aren't allocated until they're actually needed.

3. Remove unused variables - It looks like some variables such as "b", "aa", "t", "k", "ev", "od", "tt", "n", "vec", "v", "vis", "edge", "cost", "l", "c2", "ok", "chid", "dp", "f" are declared but not used anywhere, this is unnecessary and can be removed to save memory.

4. The dfs function seems to be unused, you can remove it.

5. "v" is declared twice, once globally and once locally in the main function. The local declaration shadows the global one, and it's generally considered a bad practice to have shadowing like this. Since the global "v" is never used, you can remove the global declaration.

6. Move the definition of "m" and "pos" near their usage and initialize them directly.

7. The vector v2 is declared but not used, so it can be removed.

Here is the optimized version of your code:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#define ll long long
#define In freopen("ahsan.txt", "r", stdin);
#define NO cout << "NO" << endl
#define m1 cout << "-1" << endl
#define No cout << "No" << endl
#define YES cout << "YES" << endl
#define Yes cout << "Yes" << endl
#define pb push_back
#define bug(a) cerr << #a << " : " << a << endl
#define all(v) (v.begin(), v.end())
#define sz(x) x.size()

const int mx = 1e6 + 5;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll a[200010];
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      cin >> a[i];
    vector<ll> v;
    ll mx = 1, mn = 1, x = -1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      if (i == 1 || i == n || (a[i - 1] < a[i]) != (a[i] < a[i + 1]))
        v.push_back(a[i]);
    }
    cout << v.size() << endl;
    for (auto it : v)
      cout << it << " ";
    cout << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
