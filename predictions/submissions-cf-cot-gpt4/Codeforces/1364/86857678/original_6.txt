The given C++ code can be optimized in various ways. Here are the steps for optimization:

1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes all standard library. It increases the compilation time as the compiler needs to compile all the included libraries, even though not all of them might be used in the program. Include only the necessary libraries.

2. Remove unused variables: In the code, several variables like `b[200051], aa[200010], t, k, ev, od, tt, edge, cost[mx], l, c2[mx], chid[mx], dp[mx], f[mx]` are declared but never used. This will unnecessarily occupy memory.

3. Avoid using global variables: Global variables use more memory and can be accessed and modified anywhere in the code, which may lead to bugs. So, declare variables when you need them.

4. Replace `#define` with `const` or `constexpr` for constants: `#define` is a preprocessor macro and does not respect scope and type rules of C++. `const` or `constexpr` are preferred because they are type safe.

5. Avoid using `endl`: `endl` not only moves the cursor to the next line but also flushes the output buffer, increasing the time complexity. Use `'\n'` instead.

6. Remove unnecessary `freopen`: The `freopen` function is used to redirect an existing file pointer to another stream. But it's not used in this code. 

Now, the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;

const int mx = 1e6 + 5;
using pii = pair<long long, long long>;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        vector<long long> a(n + 1);
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
            cin >> a[i];
        vector<long long> v;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i == 1 || i == n || (a[i - 1] < a[i]) != (a[i] < a[i + 1]))
                v.push_back(a[i]);
        }
        cout << v.size() << '\n';
        for (const auto &it : v)
            cout << it << " ";
        cout << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
```
