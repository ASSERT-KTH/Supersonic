The given program is a bit hard to analyze and optimize without knowing its specific functionality or requirements. However, there are a few general improvements that could be made:

1. Remove unused variables and macros: There are several variables and macros defined that are not used anywhere in the code. This includes `pii`, `In`, `ff`, `ss`, `NO`, `m1`, `No`, `YES`, `Yes`, `pb`, `bug`, `all`, `sz`, `mx`, `b`, `aa`, `k`, `ev`, `od`, `tt`, `n`, `v`, `vis`, `edge`, `cost`, `l`, `c2`, `ok`, `chid`, `dp`, and `f`. Removing these will reduce memory usage and make the code more readable.

2. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: This header file includes quite a lot of libraries which can slow down the compilation process significantly and increase the executable size. You should replace it with only the libraries you need. In this case, it looks like `iostream`, `vector`, and `string` are enough.

3. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(NULL);` before any input/output operations: This will make the program run faster by decoupling `cin`/`cout` from `scanf`/`printf`.

4. The `dfs` function seems to be unnecessary as it is not being called or used anywhere in the program. We can remove this function.

5. The `while(t--)` loop seems to be taking a lot of inputs but not all are used. We can optimize this.

After all these optimizations, the improved version of your code would look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
long long a[200010], t;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      cin >> a[i];
    vector<long long> v;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      if (i == 1 || i == n || (a[i - 1] < a[i]) != (a[i] < a[i + 1]))
        v.push_back(a[i]);
    }
    cout << v.size() << endl;
    for (auto it : v)
      cout << it << " ";
    cout << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program should work exactly like the original, but with improved performance and readability.
