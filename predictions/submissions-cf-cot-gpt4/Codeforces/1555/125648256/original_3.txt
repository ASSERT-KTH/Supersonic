The given C/C++ program is already quite optimized, but we can make a few small modifications to gain marginal improvements.

1. Avoid using "bits/stdc++.h". This header file includes quite a lot of files, and it can slow down the compilation process significantly. It is better to include only the libraries that we are going to use.

2. We can avoid using the `std::endl` to end lines. `std::endl` not only inserts a newline, but it also flushes the stream. This is not necessary if we are writing a lot of data at once. We can use "\n" instead of `std::endl` for better performance.

3. We can declare `m` inside the `main()` function and pass it as a parameter to the `solve()` function, instead of declaring it inside the `solve()` function. This way, we are not declaring and destroying `m` with each test case.

Here is the optimized program.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int
void solve(int m);
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int test = 1, m;
  cin >> test;
  while (test--) {
    cin >> m;
    solve(m);
  }
  return 0;
}
void solve(int m) {
  vector<vector<int>> matrix(2, vector<int>(m));
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      cin >> matrix[i][j];
    }
  }
  ll suffix = 0;
  ll prefix = 0;
  for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
    suffix += matrix[0][j];
  }
  ll ans = suffix;
  for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
    suffix -= matrix[0][j];
    prefix += matrix[1][j - 1];
    ans = min(ans, max(prefix, suffix));
  }
  cout << ans << "\n";
  return;
}
```

In this program, we have also added the lines `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up the input/output operations.
