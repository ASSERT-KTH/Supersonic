The original program is already quite optimized, there aren't many changes we could make to improve the performance significantly. However, there are a few small changes we can make to improve the code performance.

1. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);` to speed up cin and cout.

2. The vector initialization could be moved inside the solve function since it is not used elsewhere. This would reduce the scope of the vector and may improve memory usage slightly.

3. The 'suffix' could be calculated while taking the input. This would save one pass over the array.

Here is the optimized code according to these points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int
void solve();
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int test = 1;
  cin >> test;
  while (test--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
void solve() {
  int m;
  cin >> m;
  vector<vector<int>> matrix(2, vector<int>(m));
  ll suffix = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      cin >> matrix[i][j];
      if (i==0 && j!=0)
        suffix += matrix[i][j];
    }
  }
  
  ll ans = suffix, prefix = 0;
  for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
    suffix -= matrix[0][j];
    prefix += matrix[1][j - 1];
    ans = min(ans, max(prefix, suffix));
  }
  cout << ans << "\n";
  return;
}
```

Please note that using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;` is considered bad practice as it may lead to name clashes and increased compile time. To make your code more optimized and better, include only the libraries that you need and avoid using the std namespace globally.
