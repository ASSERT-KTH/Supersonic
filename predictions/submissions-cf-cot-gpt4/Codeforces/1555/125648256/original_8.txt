Here are the steps to optimize the given program:

1) Use the `ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up the cin/cout operations.

2) Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers which increases the compile time. Include only the necessary headers.

3) Use `std::vector::reserve` to preallocate memory for vector if you know the size in advance.

4) Avoid using `std::endl` since it causes unnecessary flushing of the buffer which slows down the program. Use "\n" instead.

5) Since the function `solve()` does not modify any global variables and does not depend on any global state, it can be marked as `inline` which might improve performance as the function could be inserted at the point of the function call, and hence, save the overhead of a function call. However, the decision to inline a function is made by the compiler, so marking a function as `inline` is just a request to the compiler, not a command.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int
inline void solve();
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int test = 1;
  cin >> test;
  while (test--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
inline void solve() {
  int m;
  cin >> m;
  vector<vector<int>> matrix(2);
  matrix[0].reserve(m);
  matrix[1].reserve(m);
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      int temp; cin >> temp;
      matrix[i].push_back(temp);
    }
  }
  ll suffix = 0;
  ll prefix = 0;
  for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
    suffix += matrix[0][j];
  }
  ll ans = suffix;
  for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
    suffix -= matrix[0][j];
    prefix += matrix[1][j - 1];
    ans = min(ans, max(prefix, suffix));
  }
  cout << ans << "\n";
  return;
}
```

Please note, these optimizations are based on best practices and general observations. Different compilers and systems might behave differently.
