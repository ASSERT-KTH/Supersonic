Optimization Steps:

1. We can see that in the solve() function, the first nested loops are used to store the input values in the 2D vector. Here instead of using nested loops, we can use single loop as the input is only for two lines.

2. In the following loops where prefix and suffix are calculated, we have to access the 2D vector elements. Accessing 2D vector elements is costlier in terms of time. To optimize this, we can store the 2D vector elements in two separate 1D vectors. This will reduce the time taken to access the elements.

3. The 'bits/stdc++.h' header file includes almost all standard C++ libraries. Including this file will increase the compilation time as the compiler needs to compile all the included libraries. Instead, we can include only those libraries that are needed in our code.

4. 'using namespace std;' is used so we don't have to use 'std::' before every standard function. But it includes entire standard library which might lead to name collision. So, better to use 'std::' before every standard function.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

#define ll long long int

void solve();

int main() {
  int test = 1;
  std::cin >> test;
  while (test--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}

void solve() {
  int m;
  std::cin >> m;
  std::vector<int> row1(m), row2(m);
  for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    std::cin >> row1[j];
  }
  for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    std::cin >> row2[j];
  }

  ll suffix = 0;
  ll prefix = 0;
  for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
    suffix += row1[j];
  }

  ll ans = suffix;
  for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
    suffix -= row1[j];
    prefix += row2[j - 1];
    ans = std::min(ans, std::max(prefix, suffix));
  }

  std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  return;
}
```
In the optimized program, we are using single loop to take input and storing the 2D vector elements in two separate 1D vectors. This will optimize the program in terms of running time. We are also including only those libraries which are needed in the code which reduces the compilation time. Using 'std::' before each standard function will prevent any name collision.
