Optimization Steps:

1. Remove the inclusion of "bits/stdc++.h" as it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increase the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries. In this case, we need "iostream" and "vector".

2. Use "ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);" and "cin.tie(NULL);" at the beginning of the main function. These two lines turn off some features of the C++ standard library that can slow down I/O operations and cause your program to run faster.

3. Declare the "matrix" vector as a global variable. This way, it will be allocated in the global memory space, not the stack. This can help prevent stack overflow for large inputs.

4. We can remove the 'return' at the end of the "solve" function as the control will return back to the calling function as soon as the end of the "solve" function is reached. 

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;
#define ll long long int

void solve();
vector<vector<int>> matrix(2);

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int test = 1;
  cin >> test;
  
  while (test--) {
    solve();
  }
  
  return 0;
}

void solve() {
  int m;
  cin >> m;
  matrix[0].resize(m);
  matrix[1].resize(m);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      cin >> matrix[i][j];
    }
  }
  
  ll suffix = 0;
  ll prefix = 0;
  
  for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
    suffix += matrix[0][j];
  }
  
  ll ans = suffix;
  
  for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
    suffix -= matrix[0][j];
    prefix += matrix[1][j - 1];
    ans = min(ans, max(prefix, suffix));
  }
  
  cout << ans << endl;
}
```
Note: Use global variables judiciously as they can make the program harder to understand and debug. Also, be aware of the risk of stack overflow when dealing with large inputs.
