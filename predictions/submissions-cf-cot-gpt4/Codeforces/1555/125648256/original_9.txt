The given program is already quite optimized, but there are few points where we can further improve it:

1. Avoid #include <bits/stdc++.h>: This header file includes a lot of unnecessary code which can slow down the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary header files.

2. Reduce namespace scope: The 'using namespace std;' line can be replaced with 'using std::cout;' , 'using std::cin;' , and 'using std::vector;', etc. This can potentially reduce the risk of name collision and make the code more efficient.

3. Use 'ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);' to speed up cin and cout: This can significantly improve I/O speed in some cases.

4. Avoid use of 'endl': 'endl' not only moves to the next line but also causes a flush operation, which can be slower than '\n'.

5. Avoid needless assignments: Do not assign 'test' to 1 just to overwrite it with 'cin' on the next line.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::vector;
using std::min;
using std::max;

typedef long long int ll;

void solve();

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int test;
  cin >> test;
  while (test--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}

void solve() {
  int m;
  cin >> m;
  vector<vector<int>> matrix(2, vector<int>(m));
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      cin >> matrix[i][j];
    }
  }
  ll suffix = 0;
  ll prefix = 0;
  for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
    suffix += matrix[0][j];
  }
  ll ans = suffix;
  for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
    suffix -= matrix[0][j];
    prefix += matrix[1][j - 1];
    ans = min(ans, max(prefix, suffix));
  }
  cout << ans << '\n';
  return;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations may make the code run faster in some cases, but can also make it slower in others. It is always a good idea to test your code with different inputs and conditions to ensure that it is performing as expected.
