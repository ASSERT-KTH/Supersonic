The given code is already optimized enough in terms of time complexity. However, there are a few changes that can be made to make it more efficient and to follow better programming practices.

1. Instead of using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, we should include only the necessary libraries. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increases the compilation time.

2. The variable `ll` is defined but is not being used anywhere in the program. We can remove this to clean up the code.

3. The `#pragma GCC optimize(2)` compiler directive is forcing the optimized level to 2. GCC's optimization level 2 increases the compilation time and may not even result in a faster execution time. So it's better to remove this directive and let the compiler decide the optimization level.

4. The value `6` is used multiple times in the program, we can define a constant variable `PATTERN_SIZE` to hold this value. This way, if we need to change this value, we only need to change it in one place.

5. The matrix `pp` is initialized with zeroes, we can use the `std::fill` function from `<algorithm>` library to fill the matrix with zeroes, this will make the initialization faster.

6. The `while` loop that deals with the variable `m` can be replaced with a `for` loop. This is because we know the exact number of iterations (which is `m`) and `for` loops are generally faster than `while` loops.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

#define PATTERN_SIZE 6

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    string k[PATTERN_SIZE] = {"abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"};
    int pp[PATTERN_SIZE][n + 1];
    fill(&pp[0][0], &pp[0][0] + sizeof(pp), 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < PATTERN_SIZE; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            pp[i][j + 1] = pp[i][j];
            if (k[i][j % 3] != s[j])
                pp[i][j + 1]++;
        }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int l, r;
        cin >> l >> r;
        l--;
        int ans = r - l;
        for (int j = 0; j < PATTERN_SIZE; j++) {
            ans = min(ans, pp[j][r] - pp[j][l]);
        }
        cout << ans << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
