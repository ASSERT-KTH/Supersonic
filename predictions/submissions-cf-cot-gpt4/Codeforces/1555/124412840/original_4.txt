Step 1: Avoid using #include <bits/stdc++.h> because this header file includes quite a lot of headers, which can slow down the compile time significantly. Instead, include only those header files that are necessary.

Step 2: Avoid using namespace std; It's a bad practice in C++ to use this line, because it can lead to name clashes, which can cause bugs that are very difficult to diagnose.

Step 3: Instead of using string k[6] = {"abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"};, use a 2D character array. This is because string objects consume more memory than character arrays.

Step 4: Instead of using cin >> l >> r; to take input, use scanf(), because scanf() is faster than cin.

Step 5: Instead of using cout << ans << endl; to print output, use printf(), because printf() is faster than cout.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

#define ll long long
#define MAXN 100005

int pp[6][MAXN];
char s[MAXN];
char k[6][4] = {"abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"};

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  scanf("%s", s);
  for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      pp[i][j + 1] = pp[i][j];
      if (k[i][j % 3] != s[j])
        pp[i][j + 1]++;
    }
  }
  while (m--) {
    int l, r;
    scanf("%d %d", &l, &r);
    l--;
    int ans = r - l;
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
      ans = std::min(ans, pp[i][r] - pp[i][l]);
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
