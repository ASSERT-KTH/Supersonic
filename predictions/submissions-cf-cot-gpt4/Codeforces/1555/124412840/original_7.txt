Optimization Steps:

1. The #include <bits/stdc++.h> statement includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increases compilation time. It's better to include only the libraries that are being used.

2. Declare the variables at the point of first use. This can make the program more readable and maintainable. 

3. The array 'k' contains 6 strings that are permutations of "abc". Instead of hardcoding these, we can generate them on the fly using next_permutation. This will reduce the memory usage.

4. The 'pp' array is used to store cumulative sums. It seems to have an extra element which is never used. So, we can reduce its size by 1.

5. The 'pp' array is filled in a loop, but its calculation depends only on the previous element. Hence, we can calculate it on the fly without storing the whole array.

6. The 'ans' variable is calculated in a loop, but its calculation depends only on the previous value. Hence, we can calculate it on the fly without using an extra variable.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  string s;
  cin >> s;

  string seq = "abc";
  do {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (seq[i % 3] != s[i])
        seq[i + 1]++;
    }
  } while (next_permutation(seq.begin(), seq.end()));
  
  while (m--) {
    int l, r;
    cin >> l >> r;
    --l;
    
    int ans = r - l;
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
      ans = min(ans, seq[r] - seq[l]);
    }

    cout << ans << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
