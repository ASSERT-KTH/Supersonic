The program you have posted is already quite optimized with respect to both time and memory usage, but there are a couple of small modifications that we can make to potentially improve the performance slightly.

1. Instead of using an array of strings to store the permutations, we can use an array of characters. This is because strings in C++ are dynamically allocated and thus can consume more memory than necessary. By using an array of characters, we will have a fixed size of memory allocated.

2. Avoid using "using namespace std;". In large programs, this can lead to naming conflicts as it includes all the names from the standard library into the global namespace. It's not an optimization per se, but it's a good practice to follow.

3. The "#pragma GCC optimize(2)" is not really needed and not portable across compilers, so it can be removed.

Now, let's apply these modifications to the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#define ll long long
int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  std::string s;
  std::cin >> s;
  char k[6][4] = {"abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"};
  int pp[6][n + 1] = {0};
  for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      pp[i][j + 1] = pp[i][j];
      if (k[i][j % 3] != s[j])
        pp[i][j + 1]++;
    }
  }
  while (m--) {
    int l, r;
    std::cin >> l >> r;
    l--;
    int ans = r - l;
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
      ans = std::min(ans, pp[i][r] - pp[i][l]);
    }
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the performance improvement from these changes will be very minor, since the original code is already quite efficient.
