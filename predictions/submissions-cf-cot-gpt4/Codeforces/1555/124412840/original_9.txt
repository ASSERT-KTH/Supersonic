The given program is already optimized in terms of time complexity. It uses dynamic programming to store the results of previous computations and then uses these results to solve future problems. This greatly reduces the time taken to compute the result. 

However, there are a few places where small modifications can further optimize the program:

1) The array `pp` is initialized with zeros using the `{0}` syntax. This initialization can be removed, as by default, C++ initializes array elements to zero. This can save a bit of memory.

2) Instead of using `cin` and `cout` for input and output, using `scanf` and `printf` can be a bit faster due to less overhead. 

3) The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes many unnecessary libraries which can increase the compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary libraries.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  string k[6] = {"abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"};
  int pp[6][n + 1];
  for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      pp[i][j + 1] = pp[i][j];
      if (k[i][j % 3] != s[j])
        pp[i][j + 1]++;
    }
  }
  while (m--) {
    int l, r;
    scanf("%d %d", &l, &r);
    l--;
    int ans = r - l;
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
      ans = min(ans, pp[i][r] - pp[i][l]);
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
