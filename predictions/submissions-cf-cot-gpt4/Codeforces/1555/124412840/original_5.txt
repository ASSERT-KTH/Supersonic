The given C++ program receives two integers n and m from user input, then a string s. It then calculates values based on the string s and the predefined strings in the array k, and stores these values in the 2D array pp. For each of the m queries, the program receives two integers l and r, calculates an answer based on these values and the array pp, and outputs the answer.

The program is already optimized for reading standard input and output by disabling synchronization with stdio using `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and untying cin from cout with `cin.tie(NULL)`. 

One small optimization you can make is to avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, as it includes many other header files that may not be used, which can slow down compile time. Instead, you can just include the necessary header files for this program, which are `iostream`, `string`, `algorithm`, and `cstring` in this case. 

Another potential optimization is to change the way you're initializing the 2D array `pp`. Currently, you're initializing all the cells to 0, but you actually only need to initialize the first column to 0. In addition, you can allocate memory for `pp` dynamically according to the value of `n`. This can save both time and space because you're not initializing unnecessary values, and you're not allocating more memory than needed.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  string k[6] = {"abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"};
  int** pp = new int*[6];
  for(int i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {
    pp[i] = new int[n+1];
    memset(pp[i], 0, sizeof(int)*(n+1));
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      pp[i][j + 1] = pp[i][j];
      if (k[i][j % 3] != s[j])
        pp[i][j + 1]++;
    }
  }
  while (m--) {
    int l, r;
    cin >> l >> r;
    l--;
    int ans = r - l;
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
      ans = min(ans, pp[i][r] - pp[i][l]);
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  for(int i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {
    delete [] pp[i];
  }
  delete [] pp;
  return 0;
}
``` 

This version of the program avoids the potential slowdown from using `bits/stdc++.h` by including only necessary header files, and optimizes memory usage by dynamically allocating memory for `pp`.
