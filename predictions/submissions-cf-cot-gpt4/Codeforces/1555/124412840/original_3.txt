Let's look at the potential areas of optimization in this code:

1. Instead of allocating a 2D array `pp[6][n+1]`, we can allocate a 2D array of size `pp[6][n]` and adjust the indexes accordingly. This saves memory.

2. `string k[6]` can be replaced with `char k[6][3]`. This is because we know the size of the strings at compile time, and we can allocate just enough memory for the strings. Using `char` arrays instead of `string` objects can also slightly improve the running time as there is less overhead.

3. `l` and `r` can be declared outside the while loop to avoid repeated declarations.

4. We can replace `int ans = r - l;` with `int ans = INT_MAX;`. This way, we don't need to calculate `r - l` every time, and `INT_MAX` guarantees that any legal value will be smaller than the initial value of `ans`.

5. `cin.tie(NULL);` is not needed as we are not mixing `cin` and `cout` in this code, so we can remove it.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#pragma GCC optimize(2)
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  char k[6][3] = {"abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"};
  int pp[6][n] = {0};
  for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      pp[i][j] = (j > 0 ? pp[i][j - 1] : 0);
      if (k[i][j % 3] != s[j])
        pp[i][j]++;
    }
  }
  int l, r;
  while (m--) {
    cin >> l >> r;
    l--;
    r--;
    int ans = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
      ans = min(ans, pp[i][r] - (l > 0 ? pp[i][l - 1] : 0));
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
