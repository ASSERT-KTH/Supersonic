First, let's go through the code and identify potential optimizations:

1. The gcd function is recursively called which may be expensive in the case of large numbers. We can replace it with an iterative version for better performance.

2. There are two separate loops to input `x[i]` and `p[i]`, we can merge these two loops to slightly reduce the overhead.

3. The mid variable is calculated in every iteration from 3 to n, but it is used only after the loop. We can move the calculation inside the next loop to avoid unnecessary calculations when a solution is found.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long LL;
const int maxn = 3 * 1e5 + 10;
LL x[maxn], p[maxn], num[maxn];

LL gcd(LL x, LL y) {
  while(y != 0) {
    LL t = y;
    y = x % y;
    x = t;
  }
  return x;
}

int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    scanf("%lld", &x[i]);
    num[i] = x[i] - x[i - 1];
  }
  scanf("%lld", &p[1]);
  LL mid = num[2];
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    if(i != 1) scanf("%lld", &p[i]);
    if(i >= 3) mid = gcd(mid, num[i]);
    if (mid % p[i] == 0) {
      printf("YES\n");
      printf("%lld %d\n", x[1], i);
      return 0;
    }
  }
  printf("NO\n");
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations might not significantly improve the performance, as the main computational complexity comes from the gcd calculation and the loops which are necessary for the logic of the program. But they do reduce the number of operations and could save some time in cases where the input is large.
