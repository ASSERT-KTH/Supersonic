The given program calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a series of differences between consecutive elements in an array and then checks if this gcd is divisible by any number in another array. If a divisor is found, it prints "YES" and the first number of the array along with the index of the divisor in the second array.

Here are some optimization steps:

1. Calculating the gcd can be optimized by using the binary gcd algorithm (also known as Stein's algorithm), which reduces the number of recursive calls and replaces expensive modulo operations with relatively cheap shifts and subtractions.

2. The input reading method can be optimized. Instead of using scanf() which is slower, we can use faster input methods. But as this involves changing the structure of the code significantly, we will skip this optimization in this case.

3. Instead of scanning the entire second array for a factor of the gcd, we could break out of the loop as soon as we find one. This is already implemented in the given code.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long LL;
const int maxn = 3 * 1e5 + 10;
LL x[maxn], p[maxn], num[maxn];

LL binary_gcd(LL u, LL v) {
  if (u == v)
    return u;
  if (u == 0)
    return v;
  if (v == 0)
    return u;
  if (~u & 1)
    if (v & 1)
      return binary_gcd(u >> 1, v);
    else
      return binary_gcd(u >> 1, v >> 1) << 1;
  if (~v & 1)
    return binary_gcd(u, v >> 1);
  if (u > v)
    return binary_gcd((u - v) >> 1, v);
  return binary_gcd((v - u) >> 1, u);
}

int main() {
  int n, m, flag = 0;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    scanf("%lld", &x[i]);
    num[i] = x[i] - x[i - 1];
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    scanf("%lld", &p[i]);
  }
  LL mid = num[2];
  for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    mid = binary_gcd(mid, num[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    if (mid % p[i] == 0) {
      printf("YES\n");
      printf("%lld %d\n", x[1], i);
      return 0;
    }
  }
  printf("NO\n");
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version improves the gcd calculation time, which is the most computationally expensive part of the original program. The reading of inputs and the search for a divisor are still done in linear time.
