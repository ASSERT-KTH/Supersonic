The above program is a C++ program that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a sequence of numbers and compares it to another sequence. It seems to be fairly optimized in terms of algorithmic complexity, but there are a few tweaks that can be made to improve performance and memory usage:

1. One main thing that can be optimized here is the usage of long long int (LL) for all variables. If you know that your numbers will not exceed the limit of int, it will be more efficient to use int instead of long long int.

2. The gcd function is recursive, which means it may cause a stack overflow for large inputs. It can be replaced with an iterative version to prevent this.

3. The arrays x, p and num are declared with a size of 3e5 + 10. If you know that you will never need that many elements, you can reduce the size of these arrays. However, if you don't know the maximum number of elements, you could consider using dynamic containers like std::vector instead of arrays. 

4. You could directly calculate num[i] when reading x[i] to avoid looping through the array again.

5. You could break the final loop as soon as you find a divisor, to avoid unnecessary operations.

6. We can get rid of the 'flag' variable as it is not being used in the code.

Here is the optimized version of the given code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long LL;
const int maxn = 3 * 1e5 + 10;
LL x[maxn], p[maxn], num[maxn];

LL gcd(LL x, LL y) {
    while (y != 0) {
        LL temp = y;
        y = x % y;
        x = temp;
    }
    return x;
}

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  cin >> x[1];
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> x[i];
    num[i] = x[i] - x[i - 1];
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    cin >> p[i];
  }
  LL mid = num[2];
  for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    mid = gcd(mid, num[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    if (mid % p[i] == 0) {
      cout << "YES\n" << x[1] << " " << i << "\n";
      return 0;
    }
  }
  cout << "NO\n";
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the algorithmic complexity remains the same. The improvements are mostly related to memory usage and potential stack overflow issues.
