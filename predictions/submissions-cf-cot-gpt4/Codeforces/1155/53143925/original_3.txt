This program is already quite optimized, but there are few changes we can make:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes certain libraries that are not used, namely `<algorithm>`, `<iostream>`, `<set>`, `<string>`, and `<vector>`. Removing these will reduce the compilation time and the size of the executable.

2. Avoid multiple `printf`s: In the loop where "YES" is printed, two different `printf` calls are made. This can be combined into a single `printf`.

3. Utilize constant for array size: The `3 * 1e5 + 10` constant is used as the size of the arrays, but it could be turned into a constant for better readability and maintainability.

4. Inline the gcd function: The gcd function is a small function that is used frequently. By inlining it, we avoid the overhead of a function call.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
typedef long long LL;
const int MAXN = 3 * 1e5 + 10;
LL x[MAXN], p[MAXN], num[MAXN];
inline LL gcd(LL x, LL y) { return y == 0 ? x : gcd(y, x % y); }
int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    scanf("%lld", &x[i]);
    num[i] = x[i] - x[i - 1];
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    scanf("%lld", &p[i]);
  }
  LL mid = num[2];
  for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    mid = gcd(mid, num[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    if (mid % p[i] == 0) {
      printf("YES\n%lld %d\n", x[1], i);
      return 0;
    }
  }
  printf("NO\n");
  return 0;
}
```

Note: These optimizations will not significantly improve the runtime or memory usage of the program, but they do improve the code quality and maintainability. The main computational part of the program (the gcd calculation and the loops) is already as efficient as it can be.
