The program involves calculating divisors of a number and then performing operations on them. Here are some steps that can be taken to optimize the program:

1. Avoid the use of `vector<long long int> divs` inside the loop, because it is created and destroyed in each iteration, which is unnecessary and inefficient. We can declare it once outside the loop and use `divs.clear()` to empty it in each iteration. This will prevent the overhead of memory allocation and deallocation in each iteration.

2. Instead of using `sort(divs.rbegin(), divs.rend());` to sort the divisors in descending order, we can insert the divisors in reverse order directly. This will prevent the need for sorting and thus save time. We can achieve this by iterating from sqrt(x) down to 1.

3. The `#define` macros for `pb`, `pob`, `S`, `F` and `FAST` are not used in the program. Removing them will not impact the program but will make the code cleaner.

4. The `debug(ll tt) {}` function is also not used anywhere and can be removed.

5. The `while(t--)` loop is not necessary as `t` is always 1. We can just call the `solve()` function.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define vll vector<long long int>
#define mod 1000000007
#define ll long long int
const int N = 1e6 + 15;
void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vll dp(N);
  dp[0] = 1;
  vll divs;
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    ll x;
    cin >> x;
    divs.clear();
    for (ll j = sqrt(x); j >= 1; j--) {
      if (x % j == 0) {
        divs.push_back(j);
        if (j != x / j)
          divs.push_back(x / j);
      }
    }
    for (auto x : divs) {
      dp[x] += dp[x - 1];
      dp[x] %= mod;
    }
  }
  ll ans = 0;
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    ans += dp[i], ans %= mod;
  cout << ans;
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  solve();
}
```
This program will have better time efficiency due to the elimination of unnecessary operations and memory allocation/deallocation. It will also have a slight improvement in memory efficiency due to the removal of unused macros and function.
