Here are the steps to optimize this program:

1. The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes almost all standard library files which increases the compilation time. It's better to include only the libraries that are needed.

2. The use of `#define` can be replaced with `constexpr` for constant values and `using` for type definitions. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.

3. The `FAST` macro is used only once. We can directly put this code in the `main` function.

4. The `debug` function is empty and not used anywhere. We can remove this.

5. The `while(t--)` loop in `main` function is not needed as `t` is always 1. We can just call the `solve` function.

6. Instead of using `vector<long long int>` (vll) for divisors, we can use `std::set<long long int>` which will keep the divisors sorted and remove duplicates, taking care of the `j * j != x` case.

7. The `sort` function is not needed as we are using `std::set` which is already sorted.

8. We can directly use the range based for loop for the divisors set, without creating a copy of each element in `divs`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;

constexpr long long mod = 1000000007;
constexpr int N = 1e6 + 15;
using vll = vector<long long int>;
using pll = pair<long long int, long long int>;

void solve() {
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  vll dp(N);
  dp[0] = 1;
  for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    long long x;
    cin >> x;
    set<long long> divs;
    for (long long j = 1; j * j <= x; j++) {
      if (x % j == 0) {
        divs.insert(j);
        divs.insert(x / j);
      }
    }
    for (auto it = divs.rbegin(); it != divs.rend(); ++it) {
      dp[*it] += dp[*it - 1];
      dp[*it] %= mod;
    }
  }
  long long ans = 0;
  for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    ans += dp[i], ans %= mod;
  cout << ans;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  solve();
}
```
