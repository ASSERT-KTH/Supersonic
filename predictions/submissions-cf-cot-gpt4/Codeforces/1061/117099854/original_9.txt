Here are the steps to optimize the given program:

1. Instead of using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes many unnecessary libraries, we should include only the necessary headers. This will reduce the compilation time.

2. The use of `#define pb push_back` and `#define pob pop_back` is less readable. It's better to use `push_back` and `pop_back` directly in the code.

3. Instead of using `ll` and `vll` as data types, we can use `long long` and `vector<long long>` for better readability.

4. The `solve` function is not returning anything. We should make it return an integer.

5. The `debug` function is empty and is not used anywhere. We should remove it.

6. In the `solve` function, the variable `N` is not required to be a vector of size `N`. It can just be a vector and we can use `push_back` to insert elements.

7. In the `main` function, we are running a while loop only once. We can remove the while loop and directly call the `solve` function.

8. The `FAST` block is not needed in modern compilers. We can remove it.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const long long mod = 1000000007;
const long long inf = 1e18;

long long solve() {
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<long long> dp;
  dp.push_back(1);
  for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    long long x;
    cin >> x;
    vector<long long> divs;
    for (long long j = 1; j * j <= x; j++) {
      if (x % j == 0) {
        divs.push_back(j);
        if (j * j != x)
          divs.push_back(x / j);
      }
    }
    sort(divs.rbegin(), divs.rend());
    for (auto x : divs) {
      dp.push_back(dp[x - 1]);
      dp[x] %= mod;
    }
  }
  long long ans = 0;
  for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    ans += dp[i], ans %= mod;
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

Remember that optimizations may vary depending on the compiler and the hardware. The optimizations provided here are general and may not apply to all situations.
