Here are some optimization steps that could be applied to this program:

1. Avoid Global Variables: Global variables are stored in heap memory which is slower to access compared to stack memory. Hence, it is better to avoid using global variables. But, in this program, the global variables are constants, hence it is fine to use them as global variables.

2. Avoid using `#define`: `#define` is a preprocessor directive that is used to define constants or macros. Using `#define` can make debugging difficult because it is processed before the compilation. Instead, using `const` can be a better option. 

3. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This line can cause conflicts in the names of the functions, classes, or variables that you use in your code. It's better to use `std::` prefix before each standard library object.

4. Limit the scope of variables: The variable `ll x` is defined inside the for loop but it is better to define it just before it is used. This makes the code easier to understand and less prone to errors.

5. Remove unused function: The `debug(ll tt)` function is not used anywhere in the code and can be removed.

6. Fast I/O: `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(0);` are used to speed up cin/cout, but they should not be used if you have to use scanf/printf, getchar/putchar, gets/puts in the same program. In this program, only cin and cout are being used, so it's fine.

7. `std::endl` vs `"\n"`: `std::endl` not only inserts a new line, but it also flushes the stream. This can make your program slower if you are printing a lot of data. If you don't need to flush the stream, you can just use `"\n"` to print a new line.

8. Using `auto` in range-based for loop: Instead of `ll i = 1; i <= n; i++`, we can use `for (auto i : dp)`, which is more efficient and easier to read.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
const long long int mod = 1000000007;
const int N = 1e6 + 15;

void solve() {
  long long int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<long long int> dp(N);
  dp[0] = 1;
  for (long long int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    long long int x;
    std::cin >> x;
    std::vector<long long int> divs;
    for (long long int j = 1; j * j <= x; j++) {
      if (x % j == 0) {
        divs.push_back(j);
        if (j * j != x)
          divs.push_back(x / j);
      }
    }
    sort(divs.rbegin(), divs.rend());
    for (auto x : divs) {
      dp[x] += dp[x - 1];
      dp[x] %= mod;
    }
  }
  long long int ans = 0;
  for (auto i : dp) {
    ans += i; 
    ans %= mod;
  }
  std::cout << ans << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int t = 1;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code is more readable and efficient.
