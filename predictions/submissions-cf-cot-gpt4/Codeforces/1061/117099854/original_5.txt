This is quite a complex piece of code, but there are a few key areas where we can make some optimizations to improve both running time and memory usage:

1. Avoid unnecessary vector creation: In the solve() function, a new vector 'divs' is created for every iteration of the loop. This is unnecessary and inefficient, as we can simply clear the vector at the end of each loop iteration and reuse it, thereby reducing memory usage.

2. Use reserve() for vector: If we know the maximum size that a vector is going to be, we can use the reserve() function to pre-allocate memory for it. This can help to reduce the time and memory required for dynamic resizing of the vector.

3. Avoid unnecessary modulo operation: In the loop where 'dp' is updated, a modulo operation is performed in every iteration. This is unnecessary and can be quite expensive in terms of computational resources. Instead, we can perform the modulo operation only when 'dp[x]' exceeds 'mod'.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define pb push_back
#define S second
#define F first
#define FAST ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0)
#define vll vector<long long int>
#define pll pair<long long int, long long int>
#define mod 1000000007
#define ll long long int
#define ld long double
#define pi 3.141592653589793238
#define Endl endl
#define endl "\n"
const int N = 1e6 + 15;
const ll inf = 1e18;
vll divs; // defined globally
void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vll dp(N);
  dp[0] = 1;
  divs.reserve(200); // reserve memory for vector
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    ll x;
    cin >> x;
    for (ll j = 1; j * j <= x; j++) {
      if (x % j == 0) {
        divs.pb(j);
        if (j * j != x)
          divs.pb(x / j);
      }
    }
    sort(divs.rbegin(), divs.rend());
    for (auto x : divs) {
      dp[x] += dp[x - 1];
      if (dp[x] >= mod) // perform modulo operation only when necessary
        dp[x] %= mod;
    }
    divs.clear(); // clear vector for next iteration
  }
  ll ans = 0;
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    ans += dp[i], ans %= mod;
  cout << ans;
}
void debug(ll tt) {}
signed main() {
  FAST;
  int t = 1;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
}
```

Note: The maximum size of the vector 'divs' is estimated to be 200 based on the constraints of the problem. This value may need to be adjusted depending on the actual input data.
