The following steps can be followed to optimize this program:

1. Avoid usage of `#define`: It's better to use `const` or `constexpr` for constants. `#define` is a preprocessor macro and has a few downsides. It does not respect the scope and it does not have any type, which may lead to some unexpected results. 

2. Replace `#include<bits/stdc++.h>`: It is a GCC compiler extension which includes most of the standard libraries. While it can save time during a contest, it's not a good habit to use it due to the following reasons:

   - It's non-standard. Your code will not be portable.
   - It increases compile time because it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std`: It's a bad practice because it can lead to name clashes. If the std namespace contains names that are also used in other parts of the program, it can lead to unexpected results.

4. Avoid global variables where possible: Global variables can make the program hard to understand and debug, and they can lead to unexpected results because any part of the program can change their value.

5. Use prefix increment (`++i`) instead of postfix (`i++`) where possible: In some cases, prefix increment can be faster because it avoids unnecessary copy.

6. Use `std::endl` carefully: `std::endl` not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output buffer, which can slow down the program. If you don't need to flush the output buffer, you can use `'\n'` instead.

7. Avoid unnecessary creation of the divs vector in each iteration: You can create it once outside the loop and clear it in each iteration.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <utility>

const long long MOD = 1000000007;
const int N = 1e6 + 15;
const long long inf = 1e18;

void solve() {
  long long n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<long long> dp(N);
  dp[0] = 1;
  std::vector<long long> divs;
  for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    long long x;
    std::cin >> x;
    divs.clear();
    for (long long j = 1; j * j <= x; j++) {
      if (x % j == 0) {
        divs.push_back(j);
        if (j * j != x)
          divs.push_back(x / j);
      }
    }
    std::sort(divs.rbegin(), divs.rend());
    for (auto x : divs) {
      dp[x] += dp[x - 1];
      dp[x] %= MOD;
    }
  }
  long long ans = 0;
  for (long long i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
    ans += dp[i], ans %= MOD;
  std::cout << ans << '\n';
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);                                               
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);                                                                 
  std::cout.tie(nullptr);
  solve();
}
```

Please note that the running time of the program is highly dependent on the input size and the algorithm used. The optimizations proposed here are more about code style and efficiency, but they won't significantly change the time complexity of the program.
