Step 1: Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes more libraries than necessary, which can slow down the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries. In this case, `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`, `#include <algorithm>`, `#include <utility>` are needed.

Step 2: The usage of `#define pb push_back` and `#define pob pop_back` is unnecessary and it can make the code less readable for some people. Directly using `push_back` and `pop_back` is preferred.

Step 3: `FAST` macro is used to speed up I/O operations. However, this code doesn't need that kind of speed, so it's unnecessary.

Step 4: Avoid using 'll' and 'vll' instead use 'long long int' and 'std::vector<long long int>' directly for better code readability. 

Step 5: `mod2` is defined but never used, so it can be removed.

Step 6: `Endl` is defined as `endl`, but `endl` is already a valid keyword in C++. So, we can remove `Endl`.

Step 7: `debug` function is defined but never used, so it can be removed.

Step 8: In the main function, the loop is unnecessary because the number of test cases `t` is always 1.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;
const int N = 1e6 + 15;
const long long int inf = 1e18;
const long long int mod = 1000000007;

void solve() {
  long long int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<long long int> dp(N);
  dp[0] = 1;
  for (long long int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    long long int x;
    cin >> x;
    vector<long long int> divs;
    for (long long int j = 1; j * j <= x; j++) {
      if (x % j == 0) {
        divs.push_back(j);
        if (j * j != x)
          divs.push_back(x / j);
      }
    }
    sort(divs.rbegin(), divs.rend());
    for (auto x : divs) {
      dp[x] += dp[x - 1];
      dp[x] %= mod;
    }
  }
  long long int ans = 0;
  for (long long int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    ans += dp[i], ans %= mod;
  cout << ans;
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code is more readable and efficient. It includes only the necessary libraries, removing unnecessary macros and unused variables and functions. The main loop is also eliminated.
