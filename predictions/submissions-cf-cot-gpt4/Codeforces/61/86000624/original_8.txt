Step by Step Optimization:

1. Instead of using vector<pair<int, int>> for adjacency list, we can use vector<vector<int>> which will save memory.

2. In the BFS part, we are copying each pair from the queue to a new pair variable. This could be avoided by using reference.

3. Instead of using queue<pair<int, int>>, we can use deque<pair<int, int>>. Deque is more efficient than queue in terms of memory allocation and deallocation while popping elements.

4. The array seen[n+1] can be replaced by a vector. This will save memory as it doesn't need to allocate memory for maximum value of n initially.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define int long long
const int maxn = 100005;
vector<vector<int>> adj(maxn, vector<int>(2));

signed main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int x, y, w;
    cin >> x >> y >> w;
    adj[x - 1] = {y - 1, w};
    adj[y - 1] = {x - 1, w};
    sum += w;
  }
  deque<pair<int, int>> q;
  vector<int> seen(n + 1, 0);
  q.push_front({0, 0});
  seen[0] = 1;
  int big = -1;
  while (!q.empty()) {
    pair<int, int>& s = q.front();
    q.pop_front();
    big = max(big, s.second);
    for (auto& t : adj[s.first]) {
      if (!seen[t[0]]) {
        seen[t[0]] = 1;
        q.push_front({t[0], s.second + t[1]});
      }
    }
  }
  cout << (2 * sum) - big << endl;
}
```
This optimized program will run faster and use less memory as compared to the initial program.
