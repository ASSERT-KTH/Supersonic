This program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Avoiding Global Variables: Global variables can be avoided for better memory management. Global variables are stored in heap memory and take up space for the entire duration of the program. Local variables are preferred as they are stored in stack memory and get destroyed once out of scope.

2. Use of Macros: Macros can be replaced with const variables as macros are not type safe and can cause compile time errors.

3. Avoiding 'using namespace std': By avoiding this, the code will not bring everything in the std namespace into the global scope, thus preventing name collision issues.

4. Avoiding '#include <bits/stdc++.h>': It includes a lot of files, which can lead to a slower compilation process. It's better to include only those libraries which are required.

5. Avoiding 'endl': Instead of 'endl', '\n' can be used. 'endl' inserts a newline character into the output stream and flushes it. This flushing operation increases the running time of the code.

6. Initializing Variables: Variables should be initialized at the time of declaration to avoid garbage value.

7. Avoiding Multiple Returns: The function solve() has multiple return statements. By reducing these to a single return statement, the code becomes cleaner and easier to read and debug.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <algorithm>

const long long nmmx = 31, kmx = 51;
int dp[nmmx][nmmx][kmx];

int solve(int n, int m, int k) {
  int ans = dp[n][m][k];
  if (ans != -1)
    return ans;
  if (n * m == k || !k)
    ans = 0;
  else {
    ans = 1e18;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; ++i) {
      for (int j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
        ans = std::min(ans, m * m + solve(i, m, j) + solve(n - i, m, k - j));
      }
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= m - 1; ++i) {
      for (int j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
        ans = std::min(ans, n * n + solve(n, i, j) + solve(n, m - i, k - j));
      }
    }
  }
  dp[n][m][k] = ans;
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);
  memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
  solve(30, 30, 50);
  int t = 0;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n = 0, m = 0, k = 0;
    std::cin >> n >> m >> k;
    std::cout << solve(n, m, k) << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
