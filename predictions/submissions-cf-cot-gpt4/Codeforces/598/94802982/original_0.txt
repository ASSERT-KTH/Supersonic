The given C++ program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. The usage of `<bits/stdc++.h>` is discouraged as it includes all of the standard library and increases compilation time. Instead, we will only include the necessary headers.
2. The macro `int long long` is replaced with a typedef. This improves readability and is more in line with C++ style.
3. The usage of namespace `std` is considered a bad practice, we can specify `std::` as prefix where required.
4. We can calculate the "solve" function for all possible values of n, m, and k in the main function before taking any inputs. This will ensure that the function is only calculated once, which will increase the efficiency of the program.
5. Instead of using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);`, we can use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0); std::cin.tie(0);` which is more readable and does the same.

Here is the optimized version of the program, reflecting these changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>

typedef long long ll;
constexpr ll nmmx = 31, kmx = 51;

ll dp[nmmx][nmmx][kmx];

ll solve(ll n, ll m, ll k) {
  ll &ans = dp[n][m][k];
  if (ans != -1)
    return ans;
  if (n * m == k || !k)
    return ans = 0;
  ans = 1e18;
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n - 1; ++i) {
    for (ll j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
      ans = std::min(ans, m * m + solve(i, m, j) + solve(n - i, m, k - j));
    }
  }
  for (ll i = 1; i <= m - 1; ++i) {
    for (ll j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
      ans = std::min(ans, n * n + solve(n, i, j) + solve(n, m - i, k - j));
    }
  }
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  
  std::memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
  for (ll i = 1; i < nmmx; i++)
    for (ll j = 1; j < nmmx; j++)
      for (ll k = 0; k < kmx; k++)
        solve(i, j, k);

  ll t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll n, m, k;
    std::cin >> n >> m >> k;
    std::cout << dp[n][m][k] << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The pre-calculation of `solve` function for all possible values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will significantly reduce the running time as it avoids the re-computation of the same subproblems again and again. The rest of the changes are mostly for improving the readability and maintainability of the code.
