The given C++ code doesn't have much scope for optimization in terms of the overall logic, but there are a few minor improvements that can be made to make the code cleaner and slightly more efficient:

1. Avoid Including Unnecessary Headers: `<bits/stdc++.h>` is a GCC specific header file that includes almost all standard C++ libraries. Including this can cause slower compilation time. It's better to include only those libraries that you actually need.

2. Using `std::endl`: `std::endl` not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output stream, which can lead to slower I/O operations. It's better to use '\n' when you just want to insert a newline.

3. Optimizing I/O operations: The statements `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);` are used to optimize I/O operations in C++, but in this code, they are placed after `memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp)); solve(30, 30, 50);` which involve I/O operations. These statements should be placed at the very beginning of the main function to make sure that all the I/O operations are optimized.

Here's the optimized code with the above improvements:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#define int long long
const int nmmx = 31, kmx = 51;
int dp[nmmx][nmmx][kmx];

int solve(int n, int m, int k) {
  int &ans = dp[n][m][k];
  if (ans != -1)
    return ans;
  if (n * m == k || !k)
    return ans = 0;
  ans = 1e18;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
      ans = min(ans, m * m + solve(i, m, j) + solve(n - i, m, k - j));
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m - 1; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
      ans = min(ans, n * n + solve(n, i, j) + solve(n, m - i, k - j));
    }
  }
  return ans;
}

signed main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);
  memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
  solve(30, 30, 50);
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, m, k;
    std::cin >> n >> m >> k;
    std::cout << solve(n, m, k) << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations are minor and they are unlikely to result in noticeable performance improvements. The main performance bottleneck in this program is the algorithmic complexity of the `solve` function, which is not addressed here.
