The given C++ program is a dynamic programming solution for a problem. It is already quite optimized. However, we can do a few tweaks to improve the performance a bit further.

1. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`: Replacing `endl` with `'\n'` can be faster because `endl` always causes a flush operation which can be expensive in terms of time.

2. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: This is a header file that includes almost every standard library. Including it can increase the compilation time. We can include only the necessary libraries which will decrease the compilation time.

3. Use Fast I/O: `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);` is used to speed up the input-output operations. It is already included in the original program.

Now, let's implement these optimizations in the code.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#define int long long
#define endl '\n'
const int nmmx = 31, kmx = 51;
int dp[nmmx][nmmx][kmx];

int solve(int n, int m, int k) {
  int &ans = dp[n][m][k];
  if (ans != -1)
    return ans;
  if (n * m == k || !k)
    return ans = 0;
  ans = 1e18;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
      ans = std::min(ans, m * m + solve(i, m, j) + solve(n - i, m, k - j));
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m - 1; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
      ans = std::min(ans, n * n + solve(n, i, j) + solve(n, m - i, k - j));
    }
  }
  return ans;
}

signed main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);
  std::memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
  solve(30, 30, 50);
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, m, k;
    std::cin >> n >> m >> k;
    std::cout << solve(n, m, k) << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
