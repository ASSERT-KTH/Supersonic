The program given is already optimized in terms of dynamic programming strategy. However, there are some minor improvements that could be made:

1. Use `constexpr` for constant expressions: Modern C++ allows the `constexpr` keyword which tells the compiler to evaluate the expression at compile time, which can lead to performance benefits. In your case, `nmmx` and `kmx` can be made `constexpr`.

2. Avoid using `#define` for constants: In C++, it's better to use `const` or `constexpr` for defining constants as they are type-safe.

3. Use fast I/O: The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` line can speed up I/O operations for large inputs.

4. Avoid `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is quite large and includes more than what you need, which increases compilation time. It's better to include only what you need.

Here's the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

constexpr int nmmx = 31;
constexpr int kmx = 51;
vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(nmmx, vector<vector<int>>(nmmx, vector<int>(kmx, -1)));

int solve(int n, int m, int k) {
    int &ans = dp[n][m][k];
    if (ans != -1)
        return ans;
    if (n*m == k || !k)
        return ans = 0;
    ans = INT64_MAX;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
            ans = min(ans, m*m + solve(i, m, j) + solve(n - i, m, k - j));
        }
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= m - 1; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
            ans = min(ans, n*n + solve(n, i, j) + solve(n, m - i, k - j));
        }
    }
    return ans;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n, m, k;
        cin >> n >> m >> k;
        cout << solve(n, m, k) << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The primary change is in the initialization of the `dp` array to avoid multiple initializations. This version should be more efficient as it avoids unnecessary memory reallocations.
