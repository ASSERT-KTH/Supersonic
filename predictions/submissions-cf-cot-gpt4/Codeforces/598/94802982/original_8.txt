This program is already pretty optimized, but there are a few small tweaks that can be made to potentially improve the performance. However, exact performance improvement will highly depend on the hardware and compiler.

1. Avoid using "#define" for constants: It's better to use "const" instead of "#define" to declare constants because "const" follows the scope rule and it is type safe.

2. Avoid unnecessary usage of std::endl: std::endl not only inserts a newline character, but also flushes the output buffer, which can cause a drop in performance. Since the output doesn't need to be flushed after every output operation, it's better to use '\n' instead.

3. Use prefix increment (++i) instead of postfix increment (i++): In C++, the prefix increment operator can be more efficient than the postfix increment operator, because the postfix operator involves a copy operation. 

4. Use 'auto': Use 'auto' keyword for automatic type deduction where the type of the variable is obvious from the context. This can make the code cleaner and less prone to type-related errors.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long int NMMX = 31, KMX = 51;
long long int dp[NMMX][NMMX][KMX];

long long int solve(int n, int m, int k) {
  auto &ans = dp[n][m][k];
  if (ans != -1)
    return ans;
  if (n * m == k || !k)
    return ans = 0;
  ans = 1e18;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
      ans = min(ans, m * m + solve(i, m, j) + solve(n - i, m, k - j));
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m - 1; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
      ans = min(ans, n * n + solve(n, i, j) + solve(n, m - i, k - j));
    }
  }
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
  solve(30, 30, 50);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, m, k;
    cin >> n >> m >> k;
    cout << solve(n, m, k) << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note that these optimizations are relatively minor and may not result in significant performance gains. The most time-consuming part of your program is the 'solve' function, which has a time complexity of O(n^2 * m^2 * k). To significantly improve the performance of your program, you would need to find a more efficient algorithm.
