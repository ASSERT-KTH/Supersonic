This program is already fairly optimized, but there are a few ways we could potentially make small improvements:

1. **Avoid unnecessary computations:** In the solve function, two loops are running for splitting the matrix either row-wise or column-wise. However, the inner loop is running from 0 to k even when the 'j' exceeds the possible number of cells in the split matrix. By limiting 'j' to the number of cells in the split matrix, we avoid unnecessary computations. 

2. **Avoid unnecessary memory usage:** The variable 'ans' is being stored as a reference to the value in the dp array. While this does not inherently cause slower execution times, it is generally better to avoid using references unless necessary to avoid potential issues with memory usage.

3. **Use faster I/O methods:** The use of cin and cout are slower compared to scanf and printf. We can replace cin and cout with scanf and printf to make the program run faster.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define endl '\n'
const int nmmx = 31, kmx = 51;
int dp[nmmx][nmmx][kmx];
int solve(int n, int m, int k) {
  if (dp[n][m][k] != -1)
    return dp[n][m][k];
  if (n * m == k || !k)
    return dp[n][m][k] = 0;
  dp[n][m][k] = 1e18;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= min(k, i*m); ++j) {
      dp[n][m][k] = min(dp[n][m][k], m * m + solve(i, m, j) + solve(n - i, m, k - j));
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m - 1; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= min(k, n*i); ++j) {
      dp[n][m][k] = min(dp[n][m][k], n * n + solve(n, i, j) + solve(n, m - i, k - j));
    }
  }
  return dp[n][m][k];
}
signed main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
  solve(30, 30, 50);
  int t;
  scanf("%lld", &t);
  while (t--) {
    int n, m, k;
    scanf("%lld %lld %lld", &n, &m, &k);
    printf("%lld\n", solve(n, m, k));
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that optimization techniques might not always improve the performance of the program. Sometimes, the performance may degrade or remain unaffected due to compiler optimizations or system architecture. Hence, it's always a good practice to benchmark the performance of the program before and after the optimization.
