The given code is a dynamic programming problem. It's already optimized in terms of time complexity. But we can optimize it a bit by reducing the number of iterations in the two inner loops. The two inner loops are used to iterate over all possible values from 0 to k. But in many cases, the value of k can be larger than the value of n*m. As the dp array has been initialized to -1, any value of k greater than n*m will return -1, which will not affect the final answer. So we can reduce the upper limit of the loops from k to min(n*m, k). This will reduce the number of unnecessary iterations and hence optimize the program.

Here is the optimized code:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define endl '\n';
const int nmmx = 31, kmx = 51;
int dp[nmmx][nmmx][kmx];
int solve(int n, int m, int k) {
  int &ans = dp[n][m][k];
  if (ans != -1)
    return ans;
  if (n * m == k || !k)
    return ans = 0;
  ans = 1e18;
  int limit = min(n*m, k);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= limit; ++j) {
      ans = min(ans, m * m + solve(i, m, j) + solve(n - i, m, k - j));
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m - 1; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= limit; ++j) {
      ans = min(ans, n * n + solve(n, i, j) + solve(n, m - i, k - j));
    }
  }
  return ans;
}
signed main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
  solve(30, 30, 50);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, m, k;
    cin >> n >> m >> k;
    cout << solve(n, m, k) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimization will improve the performance of the code by reducing the number of iterations in the two inner loops.
