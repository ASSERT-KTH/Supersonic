The provided code represents an implementation of the Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. Here are some potential optimizations:

1. Initialize the Matrix: Instead of initializing every cell of the matrix with a large value, only initialize the cells that are going to be used. This will reduce the unnecessary looping over the whole matrix and also save memory.

2. Avoiding unnecessary re-computation: In the dijkstra function, you calculate (cur + j) % N and (j + cost[cur]) % N multiple times. Instead, store these values in variables and use them. This will reduce the computation time.

3. Use of Priority Queue: The current implementation has a time complexity of O(N^2). This is because it tries to find the smallest unmarked node by scanning all nodes. This can be significantly optimized by using a priority queue, which can find the smallest unmarked node in O(logN) time.

4. Reduce #define usage: It's generally not a good practice to use #define for declaring constants in C++. Instead, use "const" keyword. Also, using #define for aliasing types like 'long long int' can make the code harder to understand.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long MOD = 1e9 + 7;
void setIO(string name, int submit) {
  if (submit) {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);
    freopen((name + ".in").c_str(), "r", stdin);
    freopen((name + ".out").c_str(), "w", stdout);
  } else {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);
  }
}
int N, M;
long long matrix[600][600];
void dijisktra(int start) {
  vector<long long> cost(N, 1e18);
  vector<bool> marked(N, false);
  priority_queue<pair<long long, int>, vector<pair<long long, int>>, greater<pair<long long, int>>> pq;
  cost[start] = 0;
  pq.push({0, start});
  while (!pq.empty()) {
    int cur = pq.top().second; pq.pop();
    if (marked[cur]) continue;
    marked[cur] = true;
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
      int next_node = (cur + j) % N;
      long long new_cost = cost[cur] + j;
      if (cost[next_node] > new_cost) {
        cost[next_node] = new_cost;
        pq.push({new_cost, next_node});
      }
      new_cost = cost[cur] + matrix[cur][j];
      next_node = (j + cost[cur]) % N;
      if (cost[next_node] > new_cost) {
        cost[next_node] = new_cost;
        pq.push({new_cost, next_node});
      }
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (i == start)
      cout << 0 << " ";
    else
      cout << cost[i] << " ";
  }
  cout << "\n";
}
int main() {
  setIO("", 0);
  cin >> N >> M;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
      matrix[i][j] = 1 << 30;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    int a, b, c;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;
    matrix[a][b] = c;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    dijisktra(i);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the priority queue optimization may not always lead to faster code in practice, due to overheads associated with maintaining the heap structure. However, it does have a better worst-case time complexity.
