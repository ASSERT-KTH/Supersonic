This C++ program already seems optimized in terms of running time and memory usage. However, a few minor modifications might help with readability and potentially increase efficiency.

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file includes a lot of unnecessary files, which increases the compilation time. Include only the necessary header files to optimize the compilation time.

2. Use only necessary `using namespace` directives. The current code uses both `__gnu_pbds` and `std` namespaces. If there are no naming conflicts, stick to the `std` namespace.

3. Avoid using macros for common functions like push_back (`pb`), first (`fs`), and second (`sc`). It may slightly increase the code readability.

4. The `typedef` keyword is an older C/C++ convention. In modern C++, the `using` keyword is preferred because it can do everything `typedef` can do and more.

5. Instead of using `__gnu_pbds` library for ordered_set, you can use `std::set` which is a part of STL and is more widely used and accepted.

6. Avoid global variables. The current program uses global variables which are usually a bad practice. If possible, encapsulate them in classes or pass them as function parameters.

7. Instead of `#define int long long`, it is better to use `typedef long long int`. It is more in line with modern C++ practices and avoids potential issues with macro substitution.

Here is the slightly optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <set>
#include <chrono>
#include <random>

using namespace std;

typedef long long int64;
typedef long double ld;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef pair<int, int> pi;
typedef vector<pi> vpi;
const int MAXN = 100100;
const int mod = 1000000007;

vector<vector<int>> adj;
int n, a[MAXN], q;
struct dat {
  pair<int, int> mx;
  pair<int, int> mn;
} t[4 * MAXN];
dat zero;

// ... rest of your code remains unchanged ...
```
