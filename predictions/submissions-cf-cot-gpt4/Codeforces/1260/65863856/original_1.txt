The given C++ program is already quite efficient, and most of the parts are written in an optimized way. However, there is still room for a tiny bit of optimization.

In the function `is_possible`, the `LazySegmentTree` `stree` is created for each call. But the size `n + 1` is the same for every call, so the segment tree could be created once outside the function and passed by reference to it. This way, the memory allocation will happen only once instead of multiple times, which could improve the performance if the function is called a lot of times. However, note that this will only have a noticeable effect if `n` is very large and the function is called a lot of times.

Here is the optimized version of the given C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
template <typename T> class LazySegmentTree {
  // ... (same as before)

public:
  LazySegmentTree(int n) {
    this->n = n;
    arr = vector<T>(4 * n);
    lazy = vector<T>(4 * n);
  }
  void refresh() {
    fill(arr.begin(), arr.end(), T());
    fill(lazy.begin(), lazy.end(), T());
  }
  // ... (same as before)
};

// ... (same as before)

bool is_possible(int mid, LazySegmentTree<Sum>& stree) {
  stree.refresh();
  // ... (same as before)
}

int main() {
  // ... (same as before)
  LazySegmentTree<Sum> stree(n + 1);
  while (left < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    if (is_possible(mid, stree)) {
      right = mid;
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  // ... (same as before)
}
```

In the optimized version, I added a `refresh` method to `LazySegmentTree` that resets `arr` and `lazy` to their initial values. This method is then called at the beginning of `is_possible`. Also, `stree` is now created once in `main` and passed by reference to `is_possible`.
