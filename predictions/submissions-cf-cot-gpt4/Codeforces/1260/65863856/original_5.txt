The program already has an optimized approach for finding a trap using a segment tree and binary search. However, a small optimization can be made on the memory allocation side.

The arrays `int a[200000]`, `int l[200000]`, `int r[200000]`, `int d[200000]`, and `bool trapped[200000]` are statically allocated with a size of 200000. They will take up space even if the actual input size is much smaller than 200000. This can be optimized by using std::vector, which will dynamically allocate only the required amount of memory.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// ... other part of the code...

// change arrays to vectors
vector<int> a, l, r, d;
vector<bool> trapped;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cin >> m >> n >> k >> t;
  
  a.resize(m);
  l.resize(k);
  r.resize(k);
  d.resize(k);
  trapped.resize(n + 1);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    cin >> l[i] >> r[i] >> d[i];
  }
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  int left = 0;
  int right = m - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    if (is_possible(mid)) {
      right = mid;
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  if (!is_possible(left)) {
    left += 1;
  }
  int sent = m - left;
  printf("%d\n", sent);
}
```

This optimization reduces the memory usage of the program by allocating only the necessary amount of memory. It will not reduce the run-time complexity of the program as the algorithm remains the same.
