This is a complex C++ program which is already efficient in its current state. The program utilizes a lazy segment tree for efficient range updates and queries. A lazy segment tree is a data structure that allows updating an interval or segment of values at once and can answer range queries efficiently. 

However, there are still a few places where we can optimize the program to make it faster and use less memory:

1. Memory allocation: For large array `a`, `l`, `r`, `d` and `trapped` we can use dynamic allocation to save memory when the program is not running. This helps to manage memory more efficiently and reduce wastage of memory.

2. Avoiding unnecessary operations: In the struct Sum, the `update_val_with_lazy` function currently calculates the difference between `right_node` and `left_node` even when the value of `lazy` is zero, which is unnecessary. We can add a condition to check if the `lazy` value is not zero before calculating the difference.

3. Reducing function calls: In the `range_query` and `range_update` public methods, we can avoid calling the `query` and `update` methods if `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, respectively. This will save time in function calls and stack space.

4. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header file includes practically every standard library in C++, which can significantly slow down the compilation process. Itâ€™s better to include only those headers which are used in the program.

5. Using a faster I/O method: `cin` and `cout` are considerably slower than `scanf` and `printf`. As this code involves a lot of I/O, using `scanf` and `printf` would be faster.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
template <typename T> class LazySegmentTree {
  int n;
  vector<T> arr;
  vector<T> lazy;

  // Rest of the code is same
  
public:
  LazySegmentTree(int n) {
    this->n = n;
    arr = vector<T>(4 * n);
    lazy = vector<T>(4 * n);
  }
  T range_query(int l, int r) {
    if(l >= r) return T();
    return query(0, 0, n, l, r);
  }
  T point_query(int idx) { return range_query(idx, idx + 1); }
  void range_update(int l, int r, T val) {
    if(l < r){
      update(0, 0, n, l, r, val);
    }
  }
  void point_update(int idx, T val) { range_update(idx, idx + 1, val); }
};

// Rest of the code is same

void update_val_with_lazy(Sum lazy, int left_node, int right_node) {
  if(lazy.val != 0)
    this->val = (right_node - left_node);
}

// Rest of the code is same

int main() {
  int m, n, k, t;
  scanf("%d %d %d %d", &m, &n, &k, &t);
  int *a = new int[m];
  int *l = new int[k];
  int *r = new int[k];
  int *d = new int[k];
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d %d", &l[i], &r[i], &d[i]);
  }
  sort(a, a + m);
  int left = 0;
  int right = m - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    if (is_possible(mid)) {
      right = mid;
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  if (!is_possible(left)) {
    left += 1;
  }
  int sent = m - left;
  printf("%d\n", sent);
  delete[] a;
  delete[] l;
  delete[] r;
  delete[] d;
}
```
Note: Remember that dynamic memory allocation can be slower than static memory allocation, and it can also lead to memory leaks if not managed properly. So use it judiciously.
