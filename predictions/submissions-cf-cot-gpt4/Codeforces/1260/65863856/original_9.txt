This program is quite optimized and there is not much scope for improving its running time or memory usage. However, there are a few small changes that can be made to slightly improve it.

1. The function `is_possible()` is called multiple times with the same arguments, but the function's result for a given argument will always be the same. Therefore, we can use a technique called memoization to store the results of the function for each argument, which will avoid the need to recompute them. This will improve the running time but will also increase the memory usage.

2. We can avoid initializing `vector<T> arr` and `vector<T> lazy` twice. In the constructor of `LazySegmentTree`, they are first default-constructed and then immediately assigned a new value. We can instead initialize them directly with the desired value. This will reduce the memory usage and the running time.

3. In the `main()` function, the array `a` is sorted. The time complexity of sorting is O(n log n), which is quite expensive. However, since the input size `m` is not that large (up to 200000), this is not a big concern. If the input size were larger, we might consider using a different data structure that maintains the elements in sorted order, such as a tree-based data structure (e.g., a set or a map in C++).

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
template <typename T> class LazySegmentTree {
  int n;
  vector<T> arr;
  vector<T> lazy;
  // ... the rest is same ...
public:
  LazySegmentTree(int n) : arr(4 * n), lazy(4 * n) {
    this->n = n;
  }
  // ... the rest is same ...
};

// ... the rest is same ...

map<int, bool> memo;
bool is_possible(int mid) {
  if (memo.count(mid)) {
    return memo[mid];
  }
  // ... the rest is same ...
  bool result = req_time <= t;
  memo[mid] = result;
  return result;
}

int main() {
  // ... the rest is same ...
  sort(a, a + m);
  // ... the rest is same ...
}
```
Please note that these optimizations might not make a noticeable difference in the program's performance, because the original program is already quite optimized.
