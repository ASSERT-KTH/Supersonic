The given program is already quite optimized and any further optimizations would be minor. However, there are a few small tweaks we can make to potentially improve the performance:

1. We can eliminate the usage of `std::vector` for `arr` and `lazy` and replace them with dynamic arrays to reduce overhead introduced by STL vector. This might increase the performance slightly.
2. We can move the `min_agility` calculation out of the loop in the `is_possible` function. This way, we reduce the number of calculations.
3. We can replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` which are faster for large input and output.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
template <typename T> class LazySegmentTree {
  int n;
  T* arr;
  T* lazy;
  // ... rest of the code is the same ...
public:
  LazySegmentTree(int n) {
    this->n = n;
    arr = new T[4 * n];
    lazy = new T[4 * n];
  }
  // destructor to free dynamic arrays
  ~LazySegmentTree(){
    delete[] arr;
    delete[] lazy;
  }
  // ... rest of the code is the same ...
};

// ... rest of the code is the same ...

bool is_possible(int mid) {
  LazySegmentTree<Sum> stree(n + 1);
  int min_agility = a[mid];  // Moved outside the loop
  for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    if (d[i] > min_agility) {
      stree.range_update(l[i] - 1, r[i], Sum(1));
    }
  }
  int req_time = n + 1 + 2 * stree.range_query(0, n + 1).val;
  return req_time <= t;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  scanf("%d%d%d%d", &m, &n, &k, &t);  // Replaced cin with scanf
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);  // Replaced cin with scanf
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    scanf("%d%d%d", &l[i], &r[i], &d[i]);  // Replaced cin with scanf
  }
  // ... rest of the code is the same ...
  printf("%d\n", sent);  // Replaced cout with printf
}
```

Please note that the optimizations done here might not have a significant impact on the performance. Also, the readability and safety of the code are compromised with the usage of raw pointers and C-style I/O. Therefore, use these optimizations wisely and only when necessary.
