The code performs the following tasks:

1. Takes two inputs: an integer `n` and a long long integer `s`.
2. The program then takes `n` inputs and stores them in an array `a`.
3. The array `a` is then sorted.
4. The program then finds the median of the array and calculates the differences of the elements from `s` on the left and right of the median separately.
5. It then prints the maximum of these two values.

Optimization Steps:

1. The declaration and initialization of `i` and `j` can be done in a single line instead of two. This makes the code more compact.
2. In the while loops, it's unnecessary to check `i >= 0` and `j <= n - 1`, because the loop condition `a[i] > s` and `a[j] < s` will automatically break the loop when `i` or `j` is out of range. Removing these conditions can reduce the time complexity, improving the running time of the program.
3. An array of size `n` is declared, which is not efficient if `n` is very large. It's better to use a vector because it can dynamically adjust its size depending on the number of elements.
4. The code uses `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input/output, which is slower than using `scanf` and `printf`.

Optimized Program:

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  long long s;
  scanf("%d %lld", &n, &s);
  vector<long long> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%lld", &a[i]);
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  int mid = n / 2;
  long long l = 0, r = 0;
  for (int i = mid; a[i] > s && i >= 0; i--)
    l += a[i] - s;
  for (int j = mid; a[j] < s && j < n; j++)
    r += s - a[j];
  printf("%lld", max(l, r));
  return 0;
}
```
