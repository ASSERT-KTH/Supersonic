This program reads an array of integers from the standard input, sorts it, and then calculates the absolute difference between each element and a given number 's'. The total sum of these differences is then printed out. 

Here are some possible steps to optimize the program:

1. Use vector instead of dynamic size array: Dynamic size arrays are not standard in C++. It's better to use vector for dynamic size data. Vector manages memory better and safer than manually handling memory. 

2. Use std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false): This can speed up the I/O operations in C++. I/O operations are often a bottleneck in programs, so this could speed up the program significantly.

3. Use cin.tie(NULL): This unties cin from cout. Tied streams ensure that one stream is flushed automatically before each I/O operation on the other stream. By untying them, we can improve performance.

4. Use '\n' instead of endl: endl causes a flush operation, which can be expensive. Using '\n' can improve performance.

Now let's apply these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n;
  long long s;
  cin >> n >> s;
  vector<long long> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  int mid = n / 2;
  int i = mid, j = mid;
  long long l = 0, r = 0;
  while (i >= 0 && a[i] > s) {
    l += a[i] - s;
    i--;
  }
  while (j < n && a[j] < s) {
    r += s - a[j];
    j++;
  }
  cout << max(l, r) << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations may not always speed up your program. The actual impact depends on the specific input and how the compiler optimizes your code.
