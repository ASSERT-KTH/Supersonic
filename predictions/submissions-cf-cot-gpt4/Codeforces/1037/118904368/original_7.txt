This program reads two integers, n and s, from the standard input, then reads n integers to array a. The array is sorted, then the program calculates two sums: the sum of differences between s and each element of the array to the left of the middle, and the sum of differences between s and each element of the array to the right of the middle. The maximum of these two sums is then printed.

Optimization:
1. Instead of using an array to store the input numbers, we can use a vector. The size of an array is static and cannot be changed once declared. However, the size of a vector can be changed dynamically. This means that if we use an array, we have to declare the maximum size at the beginning, which could be a waste of space if the actual number of elements is much less. A vector will use only as much memory as needed.

2. The sort operation is expensive, with a typical time complexity of O(n log n). However, the algorithm requires the median of the array rather than the fully sorted array. Thus, we can use the nth_element function which has a time complexity of O(n) to partially sort the array so that the median element is in its correct position.

3. To calculate the sums, we use two while loops that iterate over the array in opposite directions. We can combine these two loops into one. This will reduce the number of iterations and thus the running time of the program.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    long long s;
    cin >> n >> s;
    vector<long long> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> a[i];

    nth_element(a.begin(), a.begin() + n/2, a.end());
    long long diff = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if ((i < n/2 && a[i] > s) || (i >= n/2 && a[i] < s)) {
            diff += abs(s - a[i]);
        }
    }

    cout << diff << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This version of the program uses less memory and runs faster because it uses a vector instead of an array, avoids a full sort of the array, and combines two loops into one.
