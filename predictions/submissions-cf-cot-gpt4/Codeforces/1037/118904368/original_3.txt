The given program takes an integer array and a target value. It sorts the array, and then it tries to make the middle element of the array equal to the target by either increasing smaller elements or decreasing larger elements. The program calculates the total amount of change and prints it.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Instead of using a dynamic array with size n (`long long a[n];`), use a vector. Dynamic arrays are not standard in C++, and their size must be known at compile time. However, vectors can change their size dynamically at runtime, which makes them an ideal choice.

2. Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`. `scanf` and `printf` are faster than `cin` and `cout`.

3. Instead of using two separate loops for checking elements greater than or less than the target, we can merge them into one loop to reduce the number of iterations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  long long s;
  scanf("%d %lld", &n, &s);
  vector<long long> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%lld", &a[i]);
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  int mid = n / 2;
  long long change = 0;
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
    if ((i < mid && a[i] < s) || (i > mid && a[i] > s)) {
      change += abs(s - a[i]);
    }
  }
  printf("%lld", change);
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we use a vector for dynamic size array. We read the input with `scanf` and write the output with `printf` for faster IO. We merge the two while loops into one for loop which traverses the array only once, reducing the number of iterations.
