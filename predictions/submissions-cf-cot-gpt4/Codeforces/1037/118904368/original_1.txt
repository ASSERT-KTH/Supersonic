The given program takes two inputs: an integer n, and a long long integer s. It then takes n more inputs to populate an array a. The array is sorted and two operations are performed to calculate two sums (l and r). Finally, the program prints the maximum of these two sums.

Here are some optimization steps:

1. Use Vector Instead of Array: In C++, it's better to use vector over array especially when the size is not known at compile time. Vectors are dynamic and provide many inbuilt functions to handle data efficiently, it also manages memory better than arrays.

2. Use std::ios::sync_with_stdio: This can significantly increase the speed of cin and cout.

3. Use '\n' instead of endl: endl not only moves to the next line but also flushes the output, which can be a costly operation in terms of time.

4. Pass array to sort function with iterators: Instead of passing raw pointers, we can pass iterators to the sort function for better readability.

5. Avoid unnecessary checks in while loop: In the given code, the condition "j <= n - 1" is unnecessary because we're already checking "a[j] < s". Similarly for "i >= 0".

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  int n;
  long long s;
  cin >> n >> s;
  vector<long long> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  int mid = n / 2;
  int i = mid, j = mid;
  long long l = 0, r = 0;
  while (i >= 0 && a[i] > s) {
    l += a[i] - s;
    i--;
  }
  while (a[j] < s) {
    r += s - a[j];
    j++;
  }
  cout << max(l, r) << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

Remember, these optimizations might not necessarily result in noticeable improvements for smaller inputs. However, for larger inputs, these optimizations would generally lead to improved execution time and memory usage.
