The program you have written is already quite optimized in terms of its algorithmic complexity. However, there are a few small modifications we can make to improve it slightly.

1. Avoid Dynamic Array: In C++, it's not recommended to create an array whose length is not constant (i.e., `long long a[n];`). This is because the size of an array in C++ needs to be a compile-time constant. In your code, `n` is not a compile-time constant. It's more efficient and safer to use `std::vector` in this case.

2. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio`: This will synchronize the input/output of C++ streams with that of C streams. This can speed up the IO operations.

3. Use `std::cin.tie()`: This function is used to tie the cin object to the cout object so that the cout buffer is flushed before each I/O operation via cin.

4. Use `auto` keyword: The `auto` keyword automatically deduces the type of the variable from its initializer. It can be used to simplify code and make it easier to maintain.

Here is the optimized code:

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    int n;
    long long s;
    cin >> n >> s;
    vector<long long> a(n);
    for(auto &i : a)
        cin >> i;
    sort(a.begin(), a.end());
    int mid = n / 2;
    int i = mid, j = mid;
    long long l = 0, r = 0;
    while (i >= 0 && a[i] > s) {
        l += a[i] - s;
        i--;
    }
    while (j < n && a[j] < s) {
        r += s - a[j];
        j++;
    }
    cout << max(l, r);
    return 0;
}
```

These optimizations will slightly improve the speed of the program, but the main time complexity is still determined by the sorting operation, which is O(n log n).
