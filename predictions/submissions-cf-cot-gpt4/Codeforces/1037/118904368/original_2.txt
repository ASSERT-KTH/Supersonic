This program reads an array of integers from standard input, sorts the array and then calculates the difference from a given value 's' for the right and left halves of the array. It then prints the maximum of these two values.

Although the program is relatively efficient, there are two main things we can optimize:

1. Array Allocation: In C++, it is not recommended to use variable-length arrays like `long long a[n];` because their size is not known at compile time and they can cause undefined behavior. The size of array `a` should be known at compile time. We can use `std::vector` to create a dynamic array instead. This will not necessarily make the program faster, but it will make it safer and more robust.

2. I/O Operations: The cin and cout operations are quite slow. By using ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL), we can speed up I/O operations. These lines essentially tell the program not to synchronize C++'s stdio with C's stdio and untie cin from cout, speeding up I/O operations.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n;
  long long s;
  cin >> n >> s;
  vector<long long> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  int mid = n / 2;
  int i = mid, j = mid;
  long long l = 0, r = 0;
  while (i >= 0 && a[i] > s) {
    l += a[i] - s;
    i--;
  }
  while (j < n && a[j] < s) {
    r += s - a[j];
    j++;
  }
  cout << max(l, r);
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version should be safer and a bit faster than the original one.
