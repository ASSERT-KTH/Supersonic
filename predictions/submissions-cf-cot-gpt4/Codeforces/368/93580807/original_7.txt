The given program reads `n` integers and stores it in a vector `v`. Then it processes the vector in reverse, counting the number of distinct elements seen so far at each position and storing this count in `v`. Then it reads `m` queries, each specifying an index `q`, and prints the count stored at `v[q - 1]`.

The program is already quite optimized, but there are a few small modifications that can be made:

1. The `read` function is only used once, so it can be inlined into the `solve` function. This saves a function call, which requires pushing parameters onto the stack and popping them off.

2. The `set` `s` is used to check whether an element has been seen before. Checking whether an element is in a `set` requires O(log n) time. By changing `s` to an `unordered_set`, which uses hashing, the time complexity is reduced to O(1) on average.

3. Inside the loop, `v[i]` is accessed twice. It's better to use a reference to avoid this double access.

Here is the optimized code with the above modifications:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
void solve(int n, int m) {
  vector<int> v(n);

  // Inlined read function
  for (auto &x : v)
    cin >> x;

  unordered_set<int> s; // Changed to unordered_set for O(1) lookup
  int cont = 0;
  for (int i = v.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int &x = v[i]; // Use a reference to avoid double access
    if (s.find(x) == s.end()) {
      s.insert(x);
      cont++;
    }
    x = cont;
  }

  int q;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> q;
    cout << v[q - 1] << endl;
  }
}
int main() {
  int n, m;
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  cin >> n >> m;
  solve(n, m);
}
```

Please note that the `unordered_set` requires more memory than `set`, but it improves the running time. If memory is a concern, you might want to stick with `set`.
