The optimization can be done in the following ways:

1. Avoid Memory Utilization: `SparseTable` is a two-dimensional vector with a size of approximately 10^6 * log2(10^6), which is too large and unnecessary. In this problem, we are only querying for a range `min(j + i - 1, R)`, which means we only care about the maximum value in the range of `i` length. We can use a single dimensional vector to keep track of the maximum value in a range of length `i` for any `i`, thus reducing the space complexity from O(N log N) to O(N).

2. Avoid Unnecessary Operations: In the solve function, we are doing unnecessary operations by iterating from `i` to `R+1` with a step of `i` for each `i`. We should note that for a number `x`, the maximum value that can be subtracted from it would be a number which is the multiple of a divisor of `x`. So, it is enough to iterate up to sqrt(x) because a larger factor of `x` must be a multiple of smaller factor. This optimization will reduce the time complexity from O(N^2) to O(N sqrt N).

Below is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define lli int
#define ve vector<lli>
#define fr(i, a, n) for (lli i = a; i < (n); i++)
#define op(x) cout << x << endl
#define fast ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);

void solve() {
  lli R = 1e6;
  ve a(R + 1, 0);
  lli n;
  cin >> n;
  fr(i, 0, n) {
    lli x;
    cin >> x;
    a[x] = x;
  }
  ve b(R + 1, 0);
  for (lli i = 1; i <= R; i++) {
    b[i] = max(b[i - 1], a[i]);
  }
  lli maxi = 0;
  for (lli i = 1; i <= R; i++) {
    if (!a[i])
      continue;
    for (lli j = i; j <= R; j += i) {
      lli temp = b[min(j + i - 1, R)] - j;
      maxi = max(maxi, temp);
      if (j > sqrt(i)) {
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  op(maxi);
}

int main() {
  fast;
  lli test = 1;
  while (test--) {
    solve();
  }
}
```

Please note that this is not a complete solution, but an optimized one with respect to the original code. The final solution may vary depending on the problem requirements.
