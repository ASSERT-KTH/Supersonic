The given C++ program seems optimized in terms of coding practices. However, there are a few things that might be improved for better performance.

1. Avoid using #define: It's better to use 'using' keyword for this purpose. For example, instead of '#define lli int', you can write 'using lli = int;'. The reason for this is that '#define' is processed by the preprocessor and can lead to harder-to-debug errors since it's essentially a text replacement, whereas 'using' is processed by the compiler and is type-safe.

2. Avoid unnecessary computations inside loops: In the solve() function, there is a loop where the same operation 'min(j + i - 1, R)' is performed multiple times. It's better to calculate this once and store it in a variable.

3. Use 'constexpr' for constants: Instead of '#define', use 'constexpr' for defining constants. The advantage of this is that the value is evaluated at compile time, which can sometimes lead to faster code.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
#pragma GCC target("avx,avx2,fma")
#pragma GCC target("sse,sse2,sse3,ssse3,sse4,popcnt,abm,mmx,avx,tune=native")
#pragma comment(linker, "/stack:200000000")
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using lli = int;
using ld = long double;
using pll = pair<lli, lli>;
using ve = vector<lli>;
using vep = vector<pll>;
constexpr char endl = '\n';
constexpr lli R = 1e6;
// Remaining code...

struct SparseTable {
  // Remaining code...
  lli query(lli l, lli r) {
    lli temp = logtwo[r - l + 1];
    lli ans = max(table[l][temp], table[r - (1LL << temp) + 1][temp]);
    return ans;
  }
};

void solve() {
  ve a(R + 5, 0);
  lli n;
  cin >> n;
  for (lli i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    lli x;
    cin >> x;
    a[x] = x;
  }
  SparseTable tab(a);
  lli maxi = 0;
  for (lli i = 2; i < R + 1; i++) {
    if (!a[i])
      continue;
    for (lli j = i; j < R + 1; j += i) {
      lli temp = min(j + i - 1, R);
      maxi = max(maxi, tab.query(j, temp) - j);
    }
  }
  cout << maxi << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations might not lead to a huge performance improvement. The real bottleneck of this program seems to be the algorithmic complexity of the solve function. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) which is quite high. If the input size n is large, the program will take a long time to execute. The algorithmic optimization of this function is beyond the scope of this question and would require a deeper understanding of the problem that this function is solving.
