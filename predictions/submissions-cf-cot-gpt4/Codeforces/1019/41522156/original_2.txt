The given program seems to be a geometric algorithm that checks for certain conditions among the points. The main optimizations can be done in the loops by avoiding redundant computations (such as Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi) and reducing the complexity of 'if' conditions. 

Here are the steps to optimize the code:

1. The first optimization is to merge the two separate loops into one. This will reduce the traversal time.

2. The second optimization is to avoid the redundant computation of 't' by storing its value in a variable. This reduces the number of multiplications and subtractions.

3. The third optimization is to break the loop once the required condition is met. This will reduce the number of unnecessary iterations.

4. The fourth optimization is to remove the unused arrays and variables that are taking up memory.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
#pragma GCC target("sse,sse2,sse3,ssse3,sse4,popcnt,abm,mmx,avx,tune=native")
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
int64 x[2180], y[2180];
int64 Nx[2180], Ny[2180];

int main() {
  int n;
  int64 S;
  cin >> n >> S;
  S *= 2L;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> x[i] >> y[i];
  }
  for (int s = 0; s < n; ++s) {
    for (int i = s + 1; i < n; ++i) {
      Nx[i] = x[i] - x[s];
      Ny[i] = y[i] - y[s];
      int Xi = Nx[i], Yi = Ny[i];
      for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
        int64 t = Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi;
        if (t == S || t == -S) {
          cout << "Yes\n";
          cout << x[s] << " " << y[s] << "\n";
          cout << x[i] << " " << y[i] << "\n";
          cout << x[j] << " " << y[j] << "\n";
          return 0;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  cout << "No\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that I have preserved the original logic of the program, and only made small modifications as per your request. The overall performance improvement will depend on the actual data and runtime environment.
