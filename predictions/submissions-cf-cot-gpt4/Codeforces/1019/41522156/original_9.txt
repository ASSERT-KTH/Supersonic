The given C/C++ program is a bit complex and there are multiple loops running within each other which increase the time complexity of the program. We can note that there are a few redundancies and unnecessary computations which we can optimize. 

1. Some of the #include statements at the beginning of the program are not necessary. It seems that libraries such as <bitset>, <cassert>, <cmath>, <ctime>, <map>, <queue>, <set>, <sstream>, <string>, <vector> are not used in the program. These includes can be removed to decrease the size of the compiled program.

2. The 'mod', 'nx', 'ny', 'a' arrays are declared but never used throughout the program. They can be removed.

3. In the nested loop where the variable 'ind' is calculated, the same calculation "Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi" is repeated twice for each 'j' when 't == S || t == -S'. We can store this calculation in a variable to avoid doing the same calculation twice.

4. Also, the code inside the if (ind > 0) block is the same as the code used to calculate the 'ind'. We can combine these two parts of code into one.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
#pragma GCC target("sse,sse2,sse3,ssse3,sse4,popcnt,abm,mmx,avx,tune=native")
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
int64 x[2180], y[2180];
int64 Nx[2180], Ny[2180];
int main() {
  int n;
  int64 S;
  cin >> n >> S;
  S *= 2L;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> x[i] >> y[i];
  }
  for (int s = 0; s < n; ++s) {
    for (int i = s + 1; i < n; ++i) {
      Nx[i] = x[i] - x[s];
      Ny[i] = y[i] - y[s];
    }
    for (int i = s + 1; i < n; ++i) {
      int Xi = Nx[i], Yi = Ny[i];
      for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
        int64 t = Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi;
        if (t == S || t == -S) {
          cout << "Yes\n";
          cout << x[s] << " " << y[s] << "\n";
          cout << x[i] << " " << y[i] << "\n";
          cout << x[j] << " " << y[j] << "\n";
          return 0;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  cout << "No\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program should run faster and use less memory than the original program.
