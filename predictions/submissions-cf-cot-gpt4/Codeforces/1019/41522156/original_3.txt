The program could be optimized by reducing the amount of computations inside the loops and removing unnecessary computations. 

1. The calculation of 't' is done twice in the program. This is not necessary and can be avoided by storing the result in a variable. 

2. The second loop inside the 'ind' if statement seems to be doing redundant work. Once 'ind' is greater than 0, we can break out of the loop, instead of continuing to iterate over it. 

3. The calculation of Nx[i] and Ny[i] is done for every 's'. However, these values do not depend on 's', they only depend on 'i'. It would be more efficient to calculate these values before the loop over 's', and store them in an array. 

4. The variables Nx, Ny, and A are not used anywhere else in the code and can be removed.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
#pragma GCC target("sse,sse2,sse3,ssse3,sse4,popcnt,abm,mmx,avx,tune=native")
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
int main() {
  int n;
  int64 S;
  cin >> n >> S;
  S *= 2L;
  vector<int64> x(n), y(n), Nx(n), Ny(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> x[i] >> y[i];
  }
  for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    Nx[i] = x[i] - x[0];
    Ny[i] = y[i] - y[0];
  }
  for (int s = 0; s < n; ++s) {
    for (int i = s + 1; i < n; ++i) {
      int Xi = Nx[i], Yi = Ny[i];
      int ind = 0;
      for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
        int64 t = Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi;
        if (t == S || t == -S) {
          ind += j;
        }
      }
      if (ind > 0) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
          int64 t = Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi;
          if (t == S || t == -S) {
            cout << "Yes\n";
            cout << x[s] << " " << y[s] << "\n";
            cout << x[i] << " " << y[i] << "\n";
            cout << x[j] << " " << y[j] << "\n";
            return 0;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  cout << "No\n";
  return 0;
}
```
