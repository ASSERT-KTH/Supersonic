The program's performance can be improved by avoiding unnecessary operations and using more efficient data structures. Here's how:

1. Redundant calculations: The calculation of `t` is performed twice for each pair of `i` and `j` if `ind > 0`. This is unnecessary and can be avoided by storing the result of the calculation and reusing it.

2. Inefficient data structures: The program makes use of arrays to store data. However, arrays in C++ are not dynamic, meaning their size needs to be known at compile time, and they cannot be resized. This can lead to inefficient memory usage. However, in this case, as the size of the arrays is determined by the variable `n` which is input at runtime, the arrays cannot be replaced with vectors for better memory management.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
#pragma GCC target("sse,sse2,sse3,ssse3,sse4,popcnt,abm,mmx,avx,tune=native")
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <cassert>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
#define sz(v) ((int)(v).size())
#define all(v) (v).begin(), (v).end()
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
typedef pair<int, int> ii;
typedef vector<int> vi;
constexpr int B = 5;
int64 x[2180], y[2180];
int64 Nx[2180], Ny[2180];
int main() {
  int n;
  int64 S;
  cin >> n >> S;
  S *= 2L;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> x[i] >> y[i];
  }
  for (int s = 0; s < n; ++s) {
    for (int i = s + 1; i < n; ++i) {
      Nx[i] = x[i] - x[s];
      Ny[i] = y[i] - y[s];
    }
    for (int i = s + 1; i < n; ++i) {
      int Xi = Nx[i], Yi = Ny[i];
      int ind = 0;
      for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
        int64 t = Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi;
        if (t == S || t == -S) {
          ind += j;
          cout << "Yes\n";
          cout << x[s] << " " << y[s] << "\n";
          cout << x[i] << " " << y[i] << "\n";
          cout << x[j] << " " << y[j] << "\n";
          return 0;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  cout << "No\n";
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the redundant calculation of `t` is avoided by moving the output printing inside the inner loop. Because once we found the condition `t == S || t == -S` is satisfied, we can directly print the output and exit the program. This saves unnecessary computations in the case when `ind > 0`.
