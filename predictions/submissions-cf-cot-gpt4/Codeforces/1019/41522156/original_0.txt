The primary optimization for this code involves reducing the number of repetitive calculations and avoiding unnecessary operations. Below are the steps for optimization:

1. The calculations of `Nx[i] = x[i] - x[s];` and `Ny[i] = y[i] - y[s];` are performed twice for the same indices in two different loops. We can merge these loops into one single loop to avoid repetition of calculations.

2. The calculation of `int64 t = Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi;` is also done twice in two different loops. We can store this calculation in a variable and use it in both conditions.

3. We are increasing the `ind` variable by `j` whenever `t == S || t == -S` but we are not using this variable anywhere except checking if it is greater than 0. So, instead of increasing by `j`, we can simply set it to 1 to indicate that the condition is satisfied.

4. The variable `j` is not declared in the scope of the outer for loop where it is used in `cout << x[j] << " " << y[j] << "\n";`. This could potentially cause issues, so we need to declare it in the proper scope.

Here is the optimized code:
