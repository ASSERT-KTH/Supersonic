Here are the steps to optimize the given code:

1. The main computation in this code is the calculation of `t` which is calculated twice. We can save this value in a variable when computed for the first time, and use it again when needed. This will save us from unnecessary computations, thus improving the running time.

2. Unnecessary use of the variable `ind`. Instead of keeping track of the sum of the indices `j` where `t == S` or `t == -S`, we can simply break the loop when we find the first such `j`. This will save us from unnecessary looping and computations.

3. The `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")` and `#pragma GCC target("sse,sse2,sse3,ssse3,sse4,popcnt,abm,mmx,avx,tune=native")` directives are used for specific compiler optimizations. They might not always produce the desired results and can sometimes even slow down the code. It's better to leave the optimization to the compiler unless you're sure about what you're doing. Therefore, we will remove these lines.

4. Lastly, many variables and arrays in the code are unused. Removing these will reduce memory usage.

After these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
int64 x[2180], y[2180];
int64 Nx[2180], Ny[2180];
int main() {
  int n;
  int64 S;
  cin >> n >> S;
  S *= 2L;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> x[i] >> y[i];
  }
  for (int s = 0; s < n; ++s) {
    for (int i = s + 1; i < n; ++i) {
      Nx[i] = x[i] - x[s];
      Ny[i] = y[i] - y[s];
    }
    for (int i = s + 1; i < n; ++i) {
      int64 Xi = Nx[i], Yi = Ny[i];
      for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
        int64 t = Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi;
        if (t == S || t == -S) {
          cout << "Yes\n";
          cout << x[s] << " " << y[s] << "\n";
          cout << x[i] << " " << y[i] << "\n";
          cout << x[j] << " " << y[j] << "\n";
          return 0;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  cout << "No\n";
  return 0;
}
```
This code should run faster and use less memory than the original code.
