There are not many optimizations for memory usage that can be done to this code as it already has a good usage of memory, but there are a few things we can do to potentially help with runtime:

1. Remove the `#pragma GCC optimize("O2")` directive. This directive is typically used for competitive programming and may not always provide the best optimization for a given piece of code. It's generally recommended to let the compiler decide on optimizations unless a specific optimization is required.

2. The `fastio()` function is used to speed up I/O operations by disabling synchronization with `stdio` and untie `cin` and `cout`. However, it also makes the program less safe as it can cause issues when mixing `cin/cout` with `scanf/printf` or directly using `stdin/stdout`. Since you don't use `scanf/printf` in your program, this optimization is not necessary and could potentially cause more harm than good.

3. You're using `cin` and `cout` for input and output. While these are simple to use, they're also slower than alternatives like `scanf` and `printf`. If speed is of the essence, consider switching to these faster I/O methods.

4. The `isPowerOfTwo()` function is not being used in the code, so it can be removed.

Here's your optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (n); i++)
#define for1(i, n) for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
#define FOR(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i <= (b); i++)
#define FORD(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i >= (b); i--)
#define nx cout << "\n";
const int INF = 1 << 29;
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
#define pp pair<ll, ll>
#define ppi pair<int, int>
typedef long long int ll;
#define pri(x) printf("%d ", x);
long long binpow(long long a, long long b) {
  long long res = 1;
  while (b > 0) {
    if (b & 1)
      res = res * a;
    a = a * a;
    b >>= 1;
  }
  return res;
}
const int dx[] = {1, 0, -1, 0, 1, 1, -1, -1};
const int dy[] = {0, -1, 0, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1};
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int tc = 1;
  cin >> tc;
  while (tc--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    ll a[n], b[n];
    rep(i, n) cin >> a[i];
    rep(i, n) cin >> b[i];
    ll ma = *min_element(a, a + n), mo = *min_element(b, b + n);
    ll ans = 0;
    rep(i, n) {
      if (a[i] > ma && b[i] > mo) {
        int x = min(a[i] - ma, b[i] - mo);
        a[i] -= x;
        b[i] -= x;
        ans += x;
        if (a[i] > ma)
          ans += a[i] - ma;
        else
          ans += b[i] - mo;
      } else if (a[i] > ma) {
        ans += a[i] - ma;
      } else if (b[i] > mo) {
        ans += b[i] - mo;
      }
    }
    cout << ans;
    nx;
  }
  return 0;
}
