The given program seems to be already optimized in terms of time complexity, but we can do a few small modifications to improve memory usage and reduce the number of operations.

Here are the steps for optimization:

1. Remove the `#pragma GCC optimize("O2")` directive. This directive is a compiler-specific optimization and it might not always improve the performance of the program. It's better to rely on the algorithmic optimization.

2. Remove unnecessary `typedef` or `#define`. In the given code, there are some defined macros and typedefs which are not used in the program like `ppi`, `pp`, `FORD`, `FOR`, `for1`, `pri`, `MOD`, `INF`, `dx[]`, and `dy[]`. Removing these will reduce memory usage.

3. Simplify the conditional checks in the loop. There are multiple checks and similar operations for `a[i] > ma` and `b[i] > mo`. We can simplify this using a single check for each condition.

4. Remove `nx` macro and replace it with `cout << "\n"`. This will make the code easier to read and understand.

5. Remove unused functions `isPowerOfTwo` and `binpow`. These functions are defined but not used anywhere in the program, removing these will reduce memory usage.

The optimized version of the program is:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (n); i++)
typedef long long int ll;

void fastio() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
}

int main() {
  fastio();
  int tc = 1;
  cin >> tc;
  while (tc--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    ll a[n], b[n];
    rep(i, n) cin >> a[i];
    rep(i, n) cin >> b[i];
    ll ma = *min_element(a, a + n), mo = *min_element(b, b + n);
    ll ans = 0;
    rep(i, n) {
      ll x = min(a[i] - ma, b[i] - mo);
      a[i] -= x;
      b[i] -= x;
      ans += x;

      if (a[i] > ma) {
        ans += a[i] - ma;
      } else if (b[i] > mo) {
        ans += b[i] - mo;
      }
    }
    cout << ans << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
