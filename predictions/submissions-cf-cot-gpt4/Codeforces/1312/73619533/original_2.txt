The provided code is quite complex and already highly optimized, but there are still a few modifications that can potentially improve its efficiency.

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file includes almost all standard libraries which can significantly increase the compile time. Instead, only include the necessary header files. However, this won't affect the run-time performance.

2. Avoid using `#define`. Instead, use `const` or `inline` functions. Macros are processed by the preprocessor and can lead to hard-to-find errors. They also don't respect the scoping rules, potentially causing naming conflicts.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std;`. This can lead to name clashes, which can be hard to debug, if you're using libraries that have a function with the same name.

4. Avoid using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`, `cin.tie(0);`, and `cout.tie(0);` unless dealing with interactive problems or large inputs/outputs. These lines disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams which may cause unexpected behavior.

5. The `dfs` function can be optimized to reduce its complexity. The `assign` function is called twice in the `dfs` function. The first call can be removed, and the second call can be placed inside the if conditional to prevent unnecessary calls.

6. Use prefix increment (++i) in loops instead of postfix (i++) for performance gain. But in C++, the difference is negligible.

Below is the optimized program with the changes mentioned above.

}

    assign(node << 1 | 1, mid + 1, r, idx, val);
  segtree[node] = combine(segtree[node << 1], segtree[node << 1 | 1]);
}

    dp[node] = min(dp[node], dp[par] + 1);
  if (good[node]) {
    updateRange(1, 1, N, 1, tmp.size(), 1);
    dp[node] = min(dp[node], query(1, 1, N, 1, tmp.size()));
  }
  tmp.push_back(dp[node]);
  if (good[node]) {
    assign(1, 1, N, tmp.size(), dp[node] + good[node]);
  }
  for (ll i = 0; i < NAX; ++i) {
    if (adj[i][node] != -1) {
      dfs(adj[i][node], node);
    }
  }
  if (good[node]) {
    assign(1, 1, N, tmp.size(), INF);
  }
  tmp.pop_back();
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

Please note, these optimizations may not significantly improve the running time and memory usage as the code was already highly optimized. The real bottleneck of this code is the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm, which is already quite optimal.
