The given code is already quite optimized and is using many of the best practices of C++ programming. However, there are still some areas where we can make some small optimizations.

1. Use prefix increment (++i) instead of postfix increment (i++) in loops: In C++, the postfix increment operation involves an extra step of creating a copy of the variable, incrementing it, and then returning the original value. On the other hand, the prefix increment operation simply increments the variable and returns the incremented value. This can make a difference in performance, especially in loops that iterate a large number of times.

2. Avoid using std::endl to end lines: std::endl not only inserts a newline character, but also flushes the output buffer, which can slow down the performance especially when outputting a large amount of data. Instead, we can simply use "\n" to insert a newline character.

3. Avoid using using namespace std: This is more of a best practice than an optimization. The "using namespace std" directive can lead to naming conflicts if the same name is used in the std namespace and in your program. Also, it violates the principle of encapsulation by bringing all names in the std namespace into the global namespace.

4. Use std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and std::cin.tie(NULL) at the beginning of the main function: These two lines can speed up the input/output operations in C++. The first line disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams, and the second line unties the cin and cout streams. By default, cin and cout are tied together to ensure a proper order of input and output. But if we are sure that we won't mix input and output operations, we can untie them to get better performance.

5. Use memset to initialize the arrays to zero: The memset function can be faster than loop initialization, especially for large arrays.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
using namespace __gnu_pbds;
#define ll long long
#define pp pair<ll, ll>
typedef tree<pp, null_type, less<pp>, rb_tree_tag,
             tree_order_statistics_node_update>
    ordered_set;
#define ld long double
#define fi first
#define se second
#define pb push_back
#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for (ll i = a; i < b; ++i)
#define sz(v) (ll)(v.size())
#define hell (ll)1000000007
#define slld(x) scanf("%lld", &x)
ll t = 1, nn;
const ll maxn = 1e6 + 5, N = 1e6, nax = 26, inf = hell;
ll segtree[4 * maxn], lazy[4 * maxn], value[maxn], adj[nax][maxn];
vector<ll> good(maxn, 0), seta, tmp, dp(maxn, inf);
ll combine(ll x, ll y) { return min(x, y); }
void build(ll node, ll l, ll r) {
  if (l == r) {
    segtree[node] = value[l];
    return;
  }
  ll mid = (l + r) / 2;
  build(node << 1, l, mid);
  build(node << 1 | 1, mid + 1, r);
  segtree[node] = combine(segtree[node << 1], segtree[node << 1 | 1]);
}
// ... rest of the code remains the same ...
signed main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
