This program is already quite optimized, but there are few small modifications we can make to optimize the program a little bit more.

1. Avoid Using #define: In C++, using #define to create macros and constants is not the best practice. It is better to use const or enum for constant values and inline function for macros.

2. Removing Redundant Code: In the build function, there is an unnecessary line of code `segtree[node] = combine(segtree[node << 1], segtree[node << 1 | 1]);` that is executed every time the function is called. This line of code is not necessary and can be removed.

3. Use Fast I/O: To speed up the input-output operations, you can use fast I/O. You can achieve this by using `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(NULL);`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
using namespace std;
using namespace __gnu_pbds;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pp;
typedef tree<pp, null_type, less<pp>, rb_tree_tag,
             tree_order_statistics_node_update>
    ordered_set;
typedef long double ld;
const ll hell = 1000000007;
const ll maxn = 1e6 + 5, N = 1e6, nax = 26, inf = hell;
ll segtree[4 * maxn], lazy[4 * maxn], value[maxn], adj[nax][maxn];
vector<ll> good(maxn, 0), seta, tmp, dp(maxn, inf);

ll combine(ll x, ll y) { return min(x, y); }

void build(ll node, ll l, ll r) {
  if (l == r) {
    segtree[node] = value[l];
    return;
  }
  ll mid = (l + r) / 2;
  build(node << 1, l, mid);
  build(node << 1 | 1, mid + 1, r);
}

// rest of the code remains the same

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The `ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` statement disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. By default, all standard streams are synchronized, which in practice allows you to mix C- and C++-style I/O and get sensible and expected results. If you disable the synchronization, then C++ streams are allowed to have their own independent buffers, which makes mixing C- and C++-style I/O an adventure.
