The code provided is a C++ program that reads a number of test cases (t), and for each test case it reads two numbers (n and k). Then for each test case, it reads n numbers (a[i]) and performs some operations. The operations involve dividing each number by k repeatedly and checking some conditions. Finally, it prints "YES" or "NO" depending on the value of a flag (fl).

Here are the optimizations I would suggest:

1. Remove unnecessary macros: The code has many unused macros. Macros like `#define sf1(n) scanf("%lld", &n);` or `#define sf2(n, m) scanf("%lld %lld", &n, &m);` are not used anywhere in the code.

2. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: This header file includes practically everything from the standard library and is not efficient. It increases compilation time as the compiler needs to compile all of these. Instead, include only the necessary header files.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std`: This can lead to name clashes, which can be hard to troubleshoot.

4. Avoid clearing map in each iteration: Clearing the map `mp` in each test case is not efficient. Instead, you can define the map inside the while loop, so it gets destroyed and recreated in each iteration, which is generally faster than clearing it.

5. Avoid using long long int when not necessary: If the constraints of the problem allow it, use int instead of long long int. It is faster and uses less memory.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::map;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k, fl = 1;
    cin >> n >> k;
    int a[35];
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
    }
    map<int, int> mp;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      int p = a[i];
      int j = 0;
      while (p) {
        if (p % k > 1) {
          fl = 0;
          break;
        }
        if (p % k == 1) {
          if (mp[j] == 1) {
            fl = 0;
            break;
          }
          mp[j] = 1;
        }
        j++;
        p = p / k;
      }
      if (fl == 0) break;
    }
    if (fl == 1)
      cout << "YES" << endl;
    else
      cout << "NO" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
