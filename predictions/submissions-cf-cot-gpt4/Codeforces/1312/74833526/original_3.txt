The given code reads test cases, then for each test case it reads a length `n` and a number `k`. It then reads `n` numbers, and processes each number in base `k` to check if any two numbers have a `1` in the same position, if so it breaks and returns "NO", otherwise if the loop finishes successfully, it returns "YES".

Optimization 1: 

The first optimization you can do is to avoid the `std::map` and use a `std::bitset` instead. This is because you only need to store whether a certain position is occupied or not, and a bitset is perfect for this. It uses one bit per element, instead of the three words (on a 64-bit machine) used by a `std::map` node.

Optimization 2: 

The second optimization is to convert the loop on `p` from a while loop to a for loop, which is more compact and readable. The `p` variable is divided by `k` in each iteration, so you can directly put this in the loop condition.

Optimization 3: 

The third optimization is to use `std::cin` and `std::cout` directly instead of using `#define` to define `ci` and `co`. This makes the code clearer and easier to understand.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    long long t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        long long n, k;
        cin >> n >> k;
        vector<long long> a(n + 1);
        for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }
        bitset<64> used;
        bool fl = true;
        for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (long long j = 0, p = a[i]; p; p /= k, j++) {
                if (p % k > 1 || (p % k == 1 && used[j])) {
                    fl = false;
                    break;
                }
                if (p % k == 1) {
                    used[j] = 1;
                }
            }
            if (!fl) {
                break;
            }
        }
        if (fl)
            cout << "YES" << endl;
        else
            cout << "NO" << endl;
    }
}
```
This optimized code should have the same functionality as the original code but with faster execution and less memory consumption.
