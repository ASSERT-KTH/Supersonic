The provided C++ program reads a number of test cases (`t`) and for each test case, it reads the number of elements (`n`) and a number (`k`). Then it reads `n` numbers. It checks if any number when divided by `k` gives a remainder greater than 1 or if the same position (`j`) is marked more than once. If either of these conditions is met, it will print "NO", otherwise, it prints "YES".

Here are some optimization steps that can be taken:

1. **Avoid using `#include<bits/stdc++.h>`**: This header file includes a lot of unnecessary headers which can increase the compilation time. Replace it with only the necessary headers.

2. **Avoid using macros**: Macros are replaced by the preprocessor before the program is compiled. This can lead to issues if not used carefully. It's better to use functions or simple statements.

3. **Avoid using `std::endl`**: `std::endl` not only inserts a new line, but it also flushes the output buffer, which can decrease the performance of I/O operations.

4. **Avoid using `std::cin` and `std::cout` for competitive programming**: These are slower compared to `printf` and `scanf`. Alternatively, you can also use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` to speed up `cin` and `cout`.

5. **Avoid clearing the entire map at the end of each iteration**: Instead, only remove the elements that were inserted.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    long long t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        long long n, k, fl = 1;
        cin >> n >> k;

        map<long long, long long> mp;
        long long a[35];

        for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }

        for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            long long p = a[i];
            long long j = 0;
            while (p) {
                if (p % k > 1) {
                    fl = 0;
                    break;
                }
                if (p % k == 1) {
                    if (mp[j] == 1) {
                        fl = 0;
                        break;
                    }
                    mp[j] = 1;
                }
                j++;
                p = p / k;
            }
            if (fl == 0) {
                break;
            }
        }

        if (fl == 1) {
            cout << "YES\n";
        } else {
            cout << "NO\n";
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code does the same job as before but runs faster and uses less memory.
