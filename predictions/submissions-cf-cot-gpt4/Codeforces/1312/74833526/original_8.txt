Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary macro definitions: The macros `co`, `ci`, `sf1`, `sf2`, `sf3`, `en`, `coy`, `con` and `For` are not used in the code. Removing these will clean up the code and reduce memory usage.

2. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increases compilation time. Replace it with specific libraries that are needed.

3. Reduce the size of the array: The array `a` is defined with a size of 35, but the problem may not require that much. We can define it with the size of `n` inside the main function after we have the value of `n`.

4. Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`: `unordered_map` provides constant time average complexity for insertions and access while `map` provides logarithmic time complexity. This can significantly improve the runtime of the program.

5. Avoid clearing the map unnecessarily: If `fl` is 0, then break the loop, and clear the map at the beginning of the test case. This avoids unnecessary map clearing.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int

int main() {
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    unordered_map<ll, ll> mp;
    ll n, k, p, j, fl = 1;
    cin >> n >> k;
    ll* a = new ll[n];
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
    }
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (fl == 0) {
        break;
      }
      p = a[i];
      j = 0;
      while (p) {
        if (p % k > 1) {
          fl = 0;
          break;
        }
        if (p % k == 1) {
          if (mp[j] == 1) {
            fl = 0;
            break;
          }
          mp[j] = 1;
        }
        j++;
        p = p / k;
      }
    }
    delete[] a;
    if (fl == 1)
      cout << "YES" << endl;
    else
      cout << "NO" << endl;
  }
}
```

Note: This optimized program assumes that n will not be greater than the maximum value that can be held by a `long long int`. If n can be a very large number, it's better to use a `vector` instead of an array.
