Step 1: Variable Types
The variable "n" is a short. Generally, shorts are used when you are certain that the value won't exceed the limit of short. But if there's a possibility that it might exceed, it's better to use int. In this case, n is used for array size and array index which usually is an int. So we will replace short with int. 

Step 2: Dynamic Memory Allocation
In C++, the size of an array is fixed at compile time. Using variable-length arrays (like int v[n];) can lead to stack overflow and is not good practice. Instead, we allocate the memory dynamically based on the value of n.

Step 3: Unnecessary Break 
In the second loop, we are breaking the loop when we find the first pair of elements with difference equal to 1. Instead of breaking the loop, we can simply print 2 and continue to the next iteration of the outer loop. This will remove the need for the variable "f".

Step 4: Use <iostream> and <algorithm> instead of <bits/stdc++.h>
The <bits/stdc++.h> is a GCC specific library and it includes a lot of unnecessary stuff. Instead, we will use more specific libraries.

Here is the optimized program based on the aforementioned steps:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int q;
    cin >> q;
    for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        int* v = new int[n];
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
            cin >> v[j];
        sort(v, v + n);
        for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
            if (abs(v[j + 1] - v[j]) == 1) {
                cout << 2 << endl;
                delete[] v;
                goto next_iteration;
            }
        }
        cout << 1 << endl;
        next_iteration:
        delete[] v;
    }
}
```
