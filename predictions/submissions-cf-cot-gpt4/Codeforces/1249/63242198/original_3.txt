Here are some steps to optimize the given C++ program:

1. Avoid using #include <bits/stdc++.h> because it includes too many unused libraries, increasing the program's compilation time. Instead, include only the libraries that you will use.

2. Use cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0), and ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) to increase input/output efficiency.

3. Use vector<int> v(n) instead of int v[n] to avoid the Variable-Length Array (VLA), which is not a part of the C++ standard and can lead to performance issues.

4. The sort function can take up to O(n log n) time complexity. In this case, you don't need the array to be sorted. You can simply keep track of the minimum and maximum element in the array while reading the inputs. If the difference between the maximum and minimum element is greater than 1, then set f = 2.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    short q;
    cin >> q;
    for (short i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        short n, f = 1;
        cin >> n;
        vector<int> v(n);
        int min_val = INT_MAX, max_val = INT_MIN;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            cin >> v[j];
            min_val = min(min_val, v[j]);
            max_val = max(max_val, v[j]);
        }
        if (max_val - min_val > 1) {
            f = 2;
        }
        cout << f << endl;
    }
}
```
This program has a time complexity of O(n), which is more efficient than the original program with O(n log n).
