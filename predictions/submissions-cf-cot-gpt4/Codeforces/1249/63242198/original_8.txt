Here are the steps to optimize the given C/C++ program:

Step 1: Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with `#include <iostream>`, `#include <algorithm>`, and `#include <vector>`. The `bits/stdc++.h` header file is quite large and using it can increase compilation time. Including only necessary headers can improve the compilation speed.

Step 2: Replace the array `int v[n]` with a `std::vector<int> v(n)`. Dynamic arrays don't comply with the C++ standards and may lead to undefined behavior. It's better to use `std::vector`, which is safer and more flexible.

Step 3: Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`. The `cin` and `cout` functions in C++ are slower than `scanf` and `printf` in C.

Step 4: Remove the `sort(v.begin(), v.end())` line. There's no need to sort the vector to find if any two elements differ by one. We can check this while inputting the numbers and break the loop when we find such pair to save time.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int q;
    scanf("%d", &q);
    for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        int n, f = 1;
        scanf("%d", &n);
        vector<int> v(n);
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            scanf("%d", &v[j]);
            if(j > 0 && abs(v[j] - v[j-1]) == 1) {
                f = 2;
                break;
            }
        }
        printf("%d\n", f);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that the above-mentioned changes are strictly in context of the given problem. In general, using `scanf` and `printf` is not recommended in C++ as they are less type-safe compared to `cin` & `cout`. But for competitive programming where time is the key, they can be beneficial.
