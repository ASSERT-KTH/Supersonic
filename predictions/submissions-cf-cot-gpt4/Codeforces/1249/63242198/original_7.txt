The given C++ program is a simple one, but there are some optimizations that can be made to improve its performance. 

1. Avoid using #include<bits/stdc++.h>: This header file includes quite a lot of headers, a lot of which we do not need in this program. This increases compilation time. Instead, we should only include the headers that we need.

2. Use std::vector instead of C-style array: It's not safe to declare an array of a size that is not constant. In C++, it's better to use std::vector when you need an array-like structure with a size that can change.

3. Avoid using std::sort if not necessary: The problem is to find if there are two elements with a difference of 1. You don't need to sort the array. You can simply find the min and max elements. If max - min is greater than the number of elements, then there must be two elements with a difference of 1.

4. Avoid using std namespace: Using the std namespace is a bad practice because it can lead to name collisions.

5. Use std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false): To speed up the cin and cout operations.

6. Use cin.tie(NULL): This unties cin from cout. Tied streams ensure that one stream is flushed automatically before each I/O operation on the other stream.

Now let's see the modified code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  short q;
  std::cin >> q;
  for (short i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    short n, f = 1;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<int> v(n);
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
      std::cin >> v[j];
    auto minmax = std::minmax_element(v.begin(), v.end());
    if (*minmax.second - *minmax.first > 1)
      f = 2;
    std::cout << f << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
