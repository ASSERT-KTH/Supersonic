Optimization Steps:

1. The first thing to note is the use of `#include<bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file should be avoided as it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, increasing compilation time. Instead, we should only include the libraries that we are using which are `iostream` and `algorithm`.

2. The use of `using namespace std;` is also generally avoided in large projects as it can lead to name collisions. However, in this small program, it is fine to use it for brevity.

3. The variable `q` is being stored as a `short`. This is fine if you are certain that the value of `q` is always going to be small. However, if the value of `q` can be large, it is better to store it as an `int` to avoid overflow.

4. The use of Variable Length Arrays (VLA) is discouraged as it is not part of the C++ standard. It is better to use a dynamic array or a `vector` instead.

5. The sort function is not needed here. We can keep track of the minimum and maximum value in the list, and if the difference between them is 1 or less, we can set `f` to 2 without sorting.

6. The `f` variable could be a boolean instead of a short, because it only has two states. This reduces memory usage.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    int n;
    bool f = false;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> v(n);
    int max_val = INT_MIN, min_val = INT_MAX;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      cin >> v[j];
      max_val = max(max_val, v[j]);
      min_val = min(min_val, v[j]);
    }
    if (max_val - min_val <= 1) {
      f = true;
    }
    cout << (f ? 2 : 1) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
