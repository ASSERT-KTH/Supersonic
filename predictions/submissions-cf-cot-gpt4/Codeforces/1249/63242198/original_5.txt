The given C++ program reads a number of test cases, then for each test case, reads an array of integers, sorts it, and checks if there are at least two consecutive numbers. If there are, it outputs 2, else it outputs 1.

Here are some optimizations:

1. **Avoid Dynamic Array Size**: In C++, the size of an array should be a constant expression. The code `int v[n];` is not standard C++. Although some compilers allow this as an extension, it's better to avoid. We can use `std::vector<int>` instead.

2. **Avoid Unnecessary Sorting**: The program sorts the array to find if there are two consecutive elements. But we don't need to sort the array for this. We can use a `std::set` which stores unique elements in sorted order. Then we iterate over the set elements to check if there are two consecutive numbers.

The optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  short q;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    short n;
    cin >> n;
    set<int> numbers;
    for (short i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int num;
      cin >> num;
      numbers.insert(num);
    }
    short f = 1;
    auto it = numbers.begin();
    auto next_it = it;
    ++next_it;
    while (next_it != numbers.end()) {
      if (*next_it - *it == 1) {
        f = 2;
        break;
      }
      it = next_it;
      ++next_it;
    }
    cout << f << endl;
  }
}
```

This optimized program reduces the time complexity from O(q*n*log(n)) to O(q*n) and uses space more safely, avoiding potential issues with dynamic-sized arrays.
