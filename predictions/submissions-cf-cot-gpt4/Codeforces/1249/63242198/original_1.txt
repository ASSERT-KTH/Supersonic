Step 1 - Remove #include <bits/stdc++.h>: This is not a standard library and can slow down the compilation process. Instead, include only those libraries that are being used in the program.

Step 2 - Use vector instead of array: The program uses a variable-length array, which is not a standard C++ feature. Using a vector instead will make the code easier to read and more efficient. It also provides dynamic size capability which is better than static arrays.

Step 3 - Use std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false): This line disables the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams if it is called before the program performs its first input or output operation. Adding cin.tie(NULL) can also stop the unnecessary flushing of the stream. It can be a useful trick to speed up the cin and cout operations.

Step 4 - Use std::endl sparingly: std::endl not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output buffer. This can significantly slow down the program. Use "\n" instead of std::endl.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  short q;
  cin >> q;

  for (short i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    short n, f = 1;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> v(n);

    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
      cin >> v[j];

    sort(v.begin(), v.end());

    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
      if (abs(v[j + 1] - v[j]) == 1) {
        f = 2;
        break;
      }
    }
    cout << f << "\n";
  }
}
```
