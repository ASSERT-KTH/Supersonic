Step 1: Reduce the use of #include <bits/stdc++.h>. This header file includes a lot of unnecessary stuff which increases compilation time.

Step 2: The array v[n] is a variable-length array and it's not a good practice to use variable-length arrays as they are not part of the C++ standard. Instead, we can use a vector which is a dynamic array and can change its size at runtime.

Step 3: Instead of using the sort function which has a time complexity of O(nlogn), we can use a map to count the frequency of each number and then check for absolute difference. This will reduce the time complexity to O(n).

Step 4: Instead of checking for the absolute difference of 1 after sorting, we can check it while taking the input. This will save time when the condition is met by the first two elements.

Here's the optimized program:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    short q;
    cin >> q;
    for (short i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        short n, f = 1;
        cin >> n;
        vector<int> v(n);
        map<int, int> m;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            cin >> v[j];
            m[v[j]]++;
            if (m[v[j] - 1] > 0 || m[v[j] + 1] > 0) {
                f = 2;
                break;
            }
        }
        cout << f << endl;
    }
}
```
