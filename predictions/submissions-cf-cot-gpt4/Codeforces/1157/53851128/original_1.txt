The given code is a C++ code that uses a number of macros and templates for simplifying various operations. The code reads an integer number 'n' from the input and then reads two sequences of 'n' integers. Afterward, it performs some operations on these sequences and finally outputs a sequence.

Here are the steps to optimize it:

1. Remove unused macros and templates: The code has a number of macros and templates that are not used anywhere in the code. For example, the macros `eb`, `ub`, `smn`, `repn`, `sgi`, and the templates for `upper_bound`, `sort` with a custom function, and `in` for checking multiple arguments. These can be removed to reduce the memory footprint.

2. Avoid using a multiset: The code uses a multiset to store one of the sequences and performs operations like finding the lower bound and erasing elements. This is inefficient both in terms of time and memory. A better approach is to use a sorted vector. The lower bound can be found using binary search and elements can be removed by swapping them with the last element and decrementing the size of the vector.

3. Use `printf` and `scanf` instead of `cin` and `cout`: The I/O operations with `cin` and `cout` are slower compared to `printf` and `scanf`. So, we can replace the `cin` and `cout` with `printf` and `scanf` to speed up the I/O operations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdio>
typedef long long int ll;

int main() {
  ll n;
  scanf("%lld", &n);
  std::vector<ll> va(n), vb(n), stb(n), vc(n);
  
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%lld", &va[i]);
  }
  
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%lld", &vb[i]);
    stb[i] = vb[i] % n;
  }
  
  std::sort(stb.begin(), stb.end());
  
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    auto it = std::lower_bound(stb.begin(), stb.end(), (n - va[i]) % n);
    if (it != stb.end() && (*it + va[i]) % n < (*stb.begin() + va[i]) % n) {
      vc[i] = (*it + va[i]) % n;
      stb.erase(it);
    } else {
      vc[i] = (*stb.begin() + va[i]) % n;
      stb.erase(stb.begin());
    }
  }
  
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    printf("%lld ", vc[i]);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the code performs the same operations but in a more efficient way. It avoids unnecessary macros and templates, uses a sorted vector instead of a multiset, and uses faster I/O operations.
