This program is already written in a quite optimized way. However, there are a few changes that can be done to make it slightly more efficient.

Optimization Steps:
1. Instead of using a multiset, we can use a priority_queue. The reason for this change is that priority_queue in C++ STL is implemented using a max heap and the time complexity for insertion and extraction operations is O(log n) which is better than multiset's time complexity O(log n) for insertion and O(n) for deletion.
2. We don't need to calculate modulo n for every element in vb while inserting into priority_queue. We can calculate it when we are extracting the elements from the queue.
3. We don't need to insert all elements from vb into the priority_queue at once. We can insert one element at a time when we need it.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#define __IceQuarze__
#ifdef __IceQuarze__
// ... (same as above)
#define priq priority_queue<ll>
// ... (same as above)
#endif

int main() {
  lgi(n);
  vl va, vb;
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    lgi(t);
    va.pb(t);
  }
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    lgi(t);
    vb.pb(t);
  }
  priq pqb;
  int index = 0;
  vl vc;
  for (auto i : va) {
    pqb.push(vb[index++] % n);
    auto top = pqb.top();
    if ((top + i) % n < ((pqb.top() + i) % n)) {
      vc.pb((top + i) % n);
      pqb.pop();
    } else {
      vc.pb((pqb.top() + i) % n);
      pqb.pop();
    }
  }
  po(vc);
  return 0;
}
```
This program does the same thing as the original one but in a slightly more efficient way.
