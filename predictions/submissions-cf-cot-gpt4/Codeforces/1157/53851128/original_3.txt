The given code is a competitive programming code, which is already optimized for running time. However, there are a few things that can be done to make it more readable, maintainable, and slightly optimized.

1. Remove the unused macros, typedefs, and functions. They create unnecessary clutter and somewhat increase the compilation time.

2. Use 'emplace' instead of 'push_back'. 'emplace' constructs a new element in place, which can be more efficient.

3. Remove the `#ifdef __IceQuarze__` directive. It's not necessary here.

4. Remove the 'using namespace std;' statement. It's generally a bad practice because it can lead to name conflicts.

5. Remove the 'mod' function as it is not used.

6. Remove 'gi' functions as they are not used.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>

#define rep(i, a, b) for (long long int i = a; i < b; ++i)

typedef long long int ll;

template <typename T> void _po(const std::vector<T> &v) {
  for (auto &t : v) {
    std::cout << t << " ";
  }
  std::cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ll n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<ll> va, vb;
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    ll t;
    std::cin >> t;
    va.emplace_back(t);
  }
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    ll t;
    std::cin >> t;
    vb.emplace_back(t);
  }
  std::multiset<ll> stb;
  rep(i, 0, n) { stb.insert(vb[i] % n); }
  std::vector<ll> vc;
  for (auto i : va) {
    auto it = stb.lower_bound((n - i) % n);
    if (it != stb.end() && (*it + i) % n < (*stb.begin() + i) % n) {
      vc.emplace_back((*it + i) % n);
      stb.erase(it);
    } else {
      vc.emplace_back((*stb.begin() + i) % n);
      stb.erase(stb.begin());
    }
  }
  _po(vc);
  return 0;
}
```

Remember, in competitive programming, readability is usually sacrificed for speed, so the original code would be acceptable in a contest setting. However, in a production setting, the revised code is much cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to understand, which is more important in the long term.
