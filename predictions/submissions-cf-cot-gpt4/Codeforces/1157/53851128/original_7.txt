This program is already pretty optimized, but there are a few potential improvements that could be made:

1. Redundant macros: There are many macros defined that are either not used in the program or are just redundant. For example, the macros "pb", "eb", "ins", "es", "fi", "se", "bg", "ed", "ep", "vl", "sl", "pll", "msl", "mpll", "smx", "smn", "repn", "lgi", "sgi", "gcd", "lb", "ub", "fs", "MOD", "mod", "in" are not used in the program. Removing these will reduce the overall size of the source code, making it easier to read and understand.

2. Using auto keyword: The use of the "auto" keyword can simplify the code and make it more readable. It can also potentially improve performance by allowing the compiler to choose the most efficient type.

3. Use std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false): This can significantly improve I/O performance in some cases. However, it should be used with caution, as it can cause issues with synchronization with the C standard library streams.

4. Inline functions: The functions "gi", "_po", and "po" could potentially be made inline. This would cause the function code to be inserted directly at the call site, potentially improving performance by eliminating the overhead of a function call.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
typedef long long int ll;
using namespace std;

template <typename T> void gi(T &value) { cin >> value; }
template <typename T, typename... Args> void gi(T &value, Args &... args) {
  cin >> value;
  gi(args...);
}

template <typename T> void _po(const vector<T> &v) {
  for (auto &t : v) {
    cout << t << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
}

template <typename... Args> void po(const Args &... args) {
  _po(args...);
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  ll n;
  gi(n);
  vector<ll> va, vb;
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    ll t;
    gi(t);
    va.push_back(t);
  }
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    ll t;
    gi(t);
    vb.push_back(t);
  }
  multiset<ll> stb;
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) { stb.insert(vb[i] % n); }
  vector<ll> vc;
  for (auto i : va) {
    auto it = stb.lower_bound((n - i) % n);
    if (it != stb.end() && (*it + i) % n < (*stb.begin() + i) % n) {
      vc.push_back((*it + i) % n);
      stb.erase(it);
    } else {
      vc.push_back((*stb.begin() + i) % n);
      stb.erase(stb.begin());
    }
  }
  po(vc);
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the improvements of the given code are minor, as the initial version of the code was already well-optimized. It's also important to remember that the most effective optimizations often depend on the specifics of the use case, the hardware, and the compiler.
