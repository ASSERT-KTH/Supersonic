The given C++ program seems to be already optimized in terms of its algorithm and data structures used. However, there are still a few possibilities that can be considered for micro-optimizations. Please note that these optimizations might not have a significant impact on the overall execution time, but can make the code cleaner and slightly efficient.

1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header file includes quite a lot of standard C++ libraries, which can increase the compilation time. Include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid `#define`: It can lead to problems because it doesn't respect scope. Instead, use `const` variables or `constexpr` if you're using C++11 or later.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std`: This can lead to name conflicts if the program is large and complex.

4. Avoid redundant code: The `power` function is overloaded and seems to perform the same operation with minor differences. Consider combining them into one function or removing the redundant one.

5. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment: For primitive types like int, there's no difference, but for complex types, pre-increment can be faster.

Here's the optimized version of your code considering these points:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <ctime>
#include <chrono>

using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::vector;
using std::pair;
using std::make_pair;
using std::min;

using ll = long long int;
constexpr ll MOD = 1000000007;

int power(ll x, ll n, ll P = MOD) {
    if (x == 0)
        return 0;
    if (n == 0 || x == 1)
        return 1;
    x %= P;
    ll res = 1;
    while (n > 0) {
        if (n & 1)
            res = res * x % P;
        x = x * x % P;
        n /= 2;
    }
    return res;
}

ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
    if (b == 0)
        return a;
    return gcd(b, a % b);
}

ll lcm(ll a, ll b) {
    return (a * b) / gcd(a, b);
}

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<pair<ll, ll>> v(n);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> v[i].first >> v[i].second;
    // rest of your code
}

int main() {
    clock_t time_req = clock();
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    int tc = 1;
    cin >> tc;
    while (tc--)
        solve();
    time_req = clock() - time_req;
    return 0;
}
```

Remember, the greatest performance improvements usually come from algorithmic optimizations rather than these small changes.
