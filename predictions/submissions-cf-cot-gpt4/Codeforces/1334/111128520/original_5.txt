The provided code is already designed with performance and efficiency in mind. However, there are a few areas where minor tweaks can be made for small improvements.

1. **Avoid unnecessary memory allocation:** The power function is defined twice, once with modulus operation and once without it. This is leading to unnecessary memory allocation. We can merge these two functions into one by providing a default argument for the modulus.

2. **Avoiding Division:** Division operation is costly in terms of CPU cycles. In the power function, we are doing a division operation to divide 'n' by 2. We can replace this division operation with a right shift operation which is faster.

3. **Avoid unnecessary modulus operations**: In the two power functions, there are some modulus operations that can be avoided. Specifically, x % P is calculated twice, even though the result is the same. We can store the result in a variable and use this variable instead.

Here is the optimized code based on these improvements:

```c++
long long int power(long long int x, long long int n, long long int P = oo) {
  if (x == 0)
    return 0;
  else if (n == 0 || x == 1)
    return 1;
  x %= P;
  long long res = 1;
  while (n > 0) {
    if (n & 1)
      res = (res * x) % P;
    x = (x * x) % P;
    n >>= 1;  // replace division by 2 with right shift
  }
  return res;
}

// ... rest of the code ...

void __sol() {
  // ... rest of the code ...

  ll modX, modX1;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    modX = max(0LL, v[i].FF - v[(i - 1 + n) % n].SS);
    modX1 = max(0LL, v[(i - 1 + n) % n].FF - v[(i - 2 + n) % n].SS);
    cnt += v[i].FF - modX;
    cnt += modX1;
    cnt -= v[(i - 1 + n) % n].FF;
    ans = min(ans, cnt);
  }

  // ... rest of the code ...
}
```
