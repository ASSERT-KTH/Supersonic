The given code is a competitive programming code where generally the optimization level is already high. However, there are still a few areas where minor tweaks can be done.

1. Reducing the number of function calls: The code calls the mod function multiple times, we can store it in a variable and reuse it instead of recalculating.

2. Use bitwise operators wherever possible: In the code, division by 2 is used repeatedly, we can use a right shift operator instead. The right shift operator is faster than the division operation.

3. Reusing calculated values: The code calculates the same values multiple times, such as `v[(i - 1 + n) % n].FF`, we can store these values in a variable and reuse them.

4. Avoiding redundant calculations: The value of `(i - 1 + n) % n` and `(i - 2 + n) % n` is calculated multiple times, which is not efficient. Instead, we can calculate these values once and use them throughout.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
#define ll long long int
#define MOD 1000000007
#define oo 1000000000000000000
#define forr(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define fastio ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0)
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define unique(v) sort(all(v)); v.resize(distance(v.begin(), unique(all(v))))
#define eb emplace_back
#define FF first
#define SS second
#define mem(a, v) memset(a, v, sizeof(a))
#define pb push_back
#define popcount(x) __builtin_popcount(x)
using namespace std;

// other functions and define statements remain same

void __sol() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<pair<ll, ll>> v(n);
  forr(i, n) cin >> v[i].FF >> v[i].SS;
  if (n == 2) {
    cout << min(v[0].FF + max(0LL, v[1].FF - v[0].SS),
                v[1].FF + max(0LL, v[0].FF - v[1].SS))
         << "\n";
    return;
  }
  ll cnt = 0, curr = v[0].FF;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cnt += curr;
    curr = max(0LL, v[(i + 1) % n].FF - v[i].SS);
  }
  ll ans = cnt;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    ll idx1 = (i - 1 + n) % n;
    ll idx2 = (i - 2 + n) % n;
    ll value1 = v[idx1].FF;
    ll value2 = max(0LL, v[i].FF - value1);
    ll value3 = max(0LL, value1 - v[idx2].SS);
    cnt += value2;
    cnt += value3;
    cnt -= value1;
    ans = min(ans, cnt);
  }
  cout << ans << "\n";
  return;
}
int main() {
  clock_t time_req = clock();
  fastio;
  int tc = 1;
  cin >> tc;
  while (tc--)
    __sol();
  time_req = clock() - time_req;
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimization level of the given code was already quite high, hence, the impact of the changes may not be significant in all cases. The effect of these optimizations can vary depending on the compiler and the hardware where the program runs.
