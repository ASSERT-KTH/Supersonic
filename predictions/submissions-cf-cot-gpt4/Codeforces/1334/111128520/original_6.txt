This program is already well-optimized in terms of time complexity. There are no nested loops, and all operations are linear in terms of the input size. However, there are some minor improvements that can be made in terms of code readability and best practices:

1. Avoid `#include "bits/stdc++.h"`: This header file is quite large and including it can significantly slow down the compilation time. It's better to include only the specific standard libraries that you need.

2. Avoid using `#define` for constants: In C++, it's better to use `const` or `constexpr` for constants, as they provide type safety.

3. Use `std::array` instead of C-style array for `dx`: `std::array` provides better performance than C-style array and they can be used in the same way as containers like `std::vector`.

4. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This can cause name clashes if the standard library has a function or class with the same name as one in your program.

5. Use `auto` for type inference: This can make the code cleaner and easier to read, and also helps when the type of the variable is complex or hard to write.

6. Use more descriptive variable names: This will make the code easier to understand for other developers.

The following is the optimized version of your program after applying the above suggestions:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <array>
#include <chrono>
#include <utility>

using ll = long long int;
constexpr ll MOD = 1000000007;
constexpr ll oo = 1000000000000000000;
#define forr(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define fastio                                                                 \
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);                                       \
  cin.tie(0);                                                                  \
  cout.tie(0)

// Rest of the code remains the same...

std::array<std::pair<int, int>, 4> dx = { std::make_pair(-1, 0), std::make_pair(1, 0), std::make_pair(0, -1), std::make_pair(0, 1) };

void solve() {
  // Same as __sol()...
}

int main() {
  clock_t time_req = clock();
  fastio;
  int test_cases = 1;
  std::cin >> test_cases;
  while (test_cases--)
    solve();
  time_req = clock() - time_req;
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the above code is a simplified version aimed at readability and best practices rather than further optimizations. For specific optimization techniques such as loop unrolling, inline functions, etc., you'd need a more detailed analysis of the code and the problem it's trying to solve.
