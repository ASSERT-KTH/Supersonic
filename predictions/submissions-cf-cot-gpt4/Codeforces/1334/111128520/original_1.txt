This program has been written using competitive programming best practices, which includes the use of macros and templates for easier debugging and more concise code. However, these practices are not generally considered good for readability and maintainability in a production codebase.

The main potential optimization in this program lies in the function `__sol()`, which is called in the main function. The `__sol()` function calculates a minimum value using a brute-force approach, which means that it checks all possibilities to find the minimum value. Although this approach can be acceptable for smaller inputs, for larger inputs, it can lead to poor performance.

One potential optimization is to use dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to calculate the minimum value if it is applicable to the problem. However, without a description of the problem, it's hard to suggest a specific alternative algorithm.

Since the original requirement is to make a 'small modification' and not rewrite the program, we can optimize the program by removing unnecessary code:

1. Remove the `#include "bits/stdc++.h"` header and include only the necessary headers. The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compile time significantly.

2. Remove the unused functions and macros. Unused code increases the size of the binary and makes the code harder to read.

3. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(nullptr); std::cout.tie(nullptr);` instead of using `#define` macro.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef long long int ll;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<pair<ll, ll>> v(n);
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
    cin >> v[i].first >> v[i].second;
  
  if (n == 2) {
    cout << min(v[0].first + max(0LL, v[1].first - v[0].second),
                v[1].first + max(0LL, v[0].first - v[1].second)) << "\n";
    return;
  }
  
  ll cnt = 0, curr = v[0].first;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cnt += curr;
    curr = max(0LL, v[(i + 1) % n].first - v[i].second);
  }
  
  ll ans = cnt;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    cnt += v[i].first - max(0LL, v[i].first - v[(i - 1 + n) % n].second);
    cnt += max(0LL, v[(i - 1 + n) % n].first - v[(i - 2 + n) % n].second);
    cnt -= v[(i - 1 + n) % n].first;
    ans = min(ans, cnt);
  }
  cout << ans << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);

  int tc = 1;
  cin >> tc;
  while (tc--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

This code now includes only what it needs, making it clearer and potentially faster to compile.
