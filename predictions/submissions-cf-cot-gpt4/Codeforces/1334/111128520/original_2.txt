Optimizing this program completely might not be possible without knowing the exact requirements of your program. However, some general optimizations can be made:

1. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up I/O operations.
2. Avoid using `std::endl` and use `"\n"` instead because `std::endl` flushes the output buffer every time it's used, which can slow down I/O operations.
3. Avoid using `long long` when `int` will suffice. `int` is usually the fastest integer type.
4. Avoid using `std::vector` when the size is known at compile time. Instead, use a plain array or `std::array`.
5. When looping through a container, if you don't modify the container itself, use a range-based for loop. It's easier to read and can avoid potential off-by-one errors.

However, the code you provided is quite large and the logic is complex. It's hard to provide more specific optimizations without knowing the exact details of your program. If you could provide the specific requirements of your program, more specific optimizations could be suggested.

Here is a simplified version of your program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

#define ll long long int

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int tc;
  cin >> tc;
  
  while(tc--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    vector<pair<ll, ll>> v(n);

    for(auto &i : v)
      cin >> i.first >> i.second;

    if(n == 2) {
      cout << min(v[0].first + max(0LL, v[1].first - v[0].second),
                  v[1].first + max(0LL, v[0].first - v[1].second)) << "\n";
      continue;
    }

    ll cnt = 0, curr = v[0].first;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cnt += curr;
      curr = max(0LL, v[(i + 1) % n].first - v[i].second);
    }

    ll ans = cnt;
    for(int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
      cnt += v[i].first - max(0LL, v[i].first - v[(i - 1 + n) % n].second);
      cnt += max(0LL, v[(i - 1 + n) % n].first - v[(i - 2 + n) % n].second);
      cnt -= v[(i - 1 + n) % n].first;
      ans = min(ans, cnt);
    }

    cout << ans << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this version, I've:
- Removed unused code
- Simplified I/O operations
- Replaced `forr` macro with range-based for loops where possible
- Removed unnecessary function calls

This should result in a program that is faster and uses less memory. However, without knowing the exact requirements of your program, these are only general optimizations.
