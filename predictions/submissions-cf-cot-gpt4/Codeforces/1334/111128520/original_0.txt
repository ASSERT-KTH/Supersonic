This C++ program employs a number of macros and templates to abstract away certain operations. However, some of these may add unnecessary overhead and complicate the code, making it harder to understand and optimize. Here are a few steps that we can take to optimize this program:

1. The first thing to consider is the usage of the `bits/stdc++.h` header. It is not a standard header file and includes a lot of unnecessary header files which can increase the compile time. It's better to include only the necessary header files.
2. The `fastio` macro is used to speed up I/O operations, but it can also cause synchronization issues with `printf` and `scanf`. If there is no need to mix C and C++ I/O operations, this macro can be kept.
3. The debug functions with `__print` are not used in the code and it can be removed.
4. The `power` function is overloaded and has a lot of common code. We can remove code duplication by creating a general function.
5. The `custom_hash` struct is not used in the code and can be removed.
6. The overloaded `operator>>` and `operator<<` for `vector<T>` are not used and can be removed.
7. The `dx` variable in the global scope is not used and can be removed.
8. The `__sol` function is a bit complicated and difficult to read, but without changing the algorithm used, there is little scope for optimization.

Let's implement these changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
#include <chrono>
#include <algorithm>

#define ll long long int
#define MOD 1000000007
#define oo 1000000000000000000
#define forr(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define fastio ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0)
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define unique(v) sort(all(v)); v.resize(distance(v.begin(), unique(all(v))))
#define eb emplace_back
#define FF first
#define SS second
#define mem(a, v) memset(a, v, sizeof(a))
#define pb push_back
#define popcount(x) __builtin_popcount(x)
using namespace std;

ll power(ll x, ll n, const ll P = -1) {
  if (x == 0)
    return 0;
  if (n == 0 || x == 1)
    return 1;
  if (P != -1)
    x %= P;
  ll res = 1;
  while (n > 0) {
    if (n & 1)
      res = (P != -1) ? (res * x % P) : (res * x);
    x = (P != -1) ? (x * x % P) : (x * x);
    n /= 2;
  }
  return res;
}

ll gcd(const ll a, const ll b) {
  if (b == 0)
    return a;
  return gcd(b, a % b);
}

ll lcm(const ll a, const ll b) {
  return (a * b) / gcd(a, b);
}

int inv(ll x) { return power(x, MOD - 2, MOD); }

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<pair<ll, ll>> v(n);
  forr(i, n) cin >> v[i].FF >> v[i].SS;
  if (n == 2) {
    cout << min(v[0].FF + max(0LL, v[1].FF - v[0].SS), v[1].FF + max(0LL, v[0].FF - v[1].SS)) << "\n";
    return;
  }
  ll cnt = 0, curr = v[0].FF;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cnt += curr;
    curr = max(0LL, v[(i + 1) % n].FF - v[i].SS);
  }
  ll ans = cnt;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    cnt += v[i].FF - max(0LL, v[i].FF - v[(i - 1 + n) % n].SS);
    cnt += max(0LL, v[(i - 1 + n) % n].FF - v[(i - 2 + n) % n].SS);
    cnt -= v[(i - 1 + n) % n].FF;
    ans = min(ans, cnt);
  }
  cout << ans << "\n";
  return;
}

int main() {
  fastio;
  int tc;
  cin >> tc;
  while (tc--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program is cleaner and more readable, and it should also compile and run slightly faster.
