Alright, below are the steps for optimizing the given C/C++ program:

1. Use `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`. These two statements turn off some features of iostream which slow down the program. After adding these lines, the program will run faster. 

2. Remove the usage of `vector<ll> v;` and `v.push_back(n);` and replace it with a simple array. Using vector and push_back function costs more in terms of time and memory.

3. Remove `sort(v.rbegin(), v.rend());` and `arr[i] = sm / (i + 1);`. These operations are expensive and not needed for the program. You can keep track of the sum and the count while inputting the values.

4. Remove the macros that are not in use like `#define ll long long`, `#define ld long double`, `#define E endl`, `#define ull unsigned long long`, `#define TeFa`, and `#define Mod 1000000007`.

Now, let's modify the program based on these steps:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define IOS ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);
using namespace std;
int main() {
  IOS;
  long long t, nn, m, n;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    long long sm = 0;
    long long cnt = 0;
    cin >> nn >> m;
    long double arr[nn];
    for (int i = 0; i < nn; i++) {
      cin >> n;
      sm += n;
      if (sm / (i + 1) >= m)
        cnt++;
    }
    cout << cnt << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program should run faster and consume less memory than the original one.
