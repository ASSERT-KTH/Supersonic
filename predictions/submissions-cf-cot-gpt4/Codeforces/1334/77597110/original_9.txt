This code can be optimized in several ways, mainly for running time:

1. **Avoid `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`**: This header file includes all the standard libraries, which increases the compiling time. Include only the libraries that are needed. In this case, `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`, `#include <algorithm>`.
2. **Avoid `using namespace std;`**: This is not a performance optimization, but a good practice to avoid naming conflicts or collisions that could occur.
3. **Avoid macros for standard operations**: Macros like `in` for `cin` and `E` for `endl` do not make the code faster or slower, but they make the code harder to understand for other people. It's better to use `std::cin` and `std::endl` directly.
4. **Avoid dynamically resizing vector**: Currently, the vector `v` is being resized dynamically with `push_back`, which can be slower than resizing it all at once, especially for large inputs. We know the size of the vector in advance (`nn`), so we can allocate all memory at once.
5. **Avoid dividing in every iteration**: Division is more expensive than multiplication, so instead of dividing `sm` by `(i + 1)` in each iteration, we can multiply `arr[i - 1]` by `i` and then add `v[i]` divided by `(i + 1)`.
6. **Avoid calculating `v.size()` in each iteration of the loop**: `v.size()` is a constant, so we can calculate it once and store it in a variable, then use that variable in the loop condition.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  
  long long t, nn, m, n;
  std::cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    std::cin >> nn >> m;
    std::vector<long long> v(nn), arr(nn);
    long long sm = 0, cnt = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < nn; i++) {
      std::cin >> n;
      v[i] = n;
    }
    
    std::sort(v.rbegin(), v.rend());

    for (int i = 0; i < nn; i++) {
      sm += v[i];
      if (i == 0)
        arr[i] = v[i];
      else {
        arr[i] = arr[i - 1] * i / (i + 1) + v[i] / (i + 1);
      }
      if (arr[i] >= m)
        cnt++;
    }
    std::cout << cnt << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program should run faster and use less memory than the original code.
