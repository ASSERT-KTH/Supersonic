The given program is a C++ program that sorts a vector in descending order and then performs some calculations on the elements of the vector and counts how many of the results are greater than or equal to a given number 'm'. The program also takes multiple test cases 't'. 

Here are some steps we can take to optimize this program:

1. The use of `#define IOT ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);` is unnecessary as it is only used once in the program. We can directly place it in the main function which also improves readability.

2. The use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is discouraged as it includes many unnecessary headers which increases compile time. We can include only the necessary headers.

3. The vector `v` is initialized and then filled with the elements one by one using the `push_back()` function. This can be optimized by declaring the size of the vector at initialization and then directly assigning the values to the elements of the vector using indexing. This will reduce memory usage as the vector does not need to resize dynamically when we use `push_back()`.

4. The size of the vector `v` is calculated in each iteration of the loop using the `size()` function. This can be optimized by calculating the size once before the loop and storing it in a variable.

5. The `arr` array is of type `long double` but the values assigned to it are of type `ll (long long)`. This can be optimized by making the `arr` array of type `long long` to save memory.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define E '\n'
#define Mod 1000000007

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);
  ll t, nn, m, n;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll sm = 0;
    ll cnt = 0;
    cin >> nn >> m;
    vector<ll> v(nn);
    ll arr[nn];
    for (int i = 0; i < nn; i++) {
      cin >> v[i];
    }
    sort(v.rbegin(), v.rend());
    int vSize = v.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < vSize; i++) {
      sm += v[i];
      if (i == 0)
        arr[0] = v[0];
      else {
        arr[i] = sm / (i + 1);
      }
      if (arr[i] >= m)
        cnt++;
    }
    cout << cnt << E;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
