Sure, let's optimize the program. The program reads an input, sorts it in descending order and then calculates the prefix averages. After that, it checks how many averages are greater than or equal to a certain value 'm' and prints the count. 

Firstly, it's unnecessary to use `long double` for array `arr` since all the values stored in it are integers. Changing `long double` to `ll` will save memory.

Secondly, the use of `vector` to store input values is redundant because it's not utilized after sorting. We can sort the input as we read it, saving memory and improving efficiency.

Thirdly, the variable `cnt` can be incremented immediately when the condition `arr[i] >= m` is met, eliminating the need for the if statement inside the loop.

Finally, instead of using `cin` and `cout`, using `scanf` and `printf` can make the I/O faster.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
#define ll long long
#define E "\n"
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ll t, nn, m, n;
  scanf("%lld", &t);
  while (t--) {
    ll sm = 0;
    ll cnt = 0;
    scanf("%lld%lld", &nn, &m);
    ll v[nn], arr[nn];
    for (ll i = 0; i < nn; i++) {
      scanf("%lld", &v[i]);
    }
    sort(v, v + nn, greater<ll>());
    for (ll i = 0; i < nn; i++) {
      sm += v[i];
      arr[i] = i == 0 ? v[0] : sm / (i + 1);
      cnt += arr[i] >= m;
    }
    printf("%lld%s", cnt, E);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code efficiently uses memory and it should run faster than the original one.
