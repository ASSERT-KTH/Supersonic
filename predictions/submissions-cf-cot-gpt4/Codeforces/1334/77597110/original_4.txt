Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary #define statements:
   We can remove #define TeFa, #define E endl, and #define IOT ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); as they are not needed.

2. Use vector::reserve for memory pre-allocation:
   By knowing the number of elements beforehand, we can reserve memory in the vector to avoid reallocation.

3. Use vector::size() only once:
   Instead of calling v.size() in the loop, which is a O(1) operation but still has overhead, we can store the size in a variable and use it.

4. Avoid floating point division if not required:
   We are storing the result of floating point division in an array but only using it to check if it's greater than or equal to a number. We can compare the sum with the product of the number and the index instead.

5. Use fast input/output (IO):
   Use fast IO to decrease the running time of the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  ll t, nn, m, n;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll sm = 0;
    ll cnt = 0;
    cin >> nn >> m;
    vector<ll> v;
    v.reserve(nn);
    for (int i = 0; i < nn; i++) {
      cin >> n;
      v.push_back(n);
    }
    sort(v.rbegin(), v.rend());
    int size = v.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      sm += v[i];
      if (sm >= (i + 1) * m)
        cnt++;
    }
    cout << cnt << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that generally using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;` are not considered good practice as they include unnecessary libraries and can cause name conflicts, but since the goal was to make small modifications, I kept them.
