The optimizations that can be done are:

1. Remove unused variables: The `it`, `z`, and `Mx` variables are not used anywhere in the code, so we can remove them. This will save memory.

2. Avoid using `vector::push_back`: `vector::push_back` may cause reallocations if the vector's capacity is exceeded. We know the size of the vector in advance (it's `nn`), so we can allocate the required memory all at once using the constructor `vector::vector(size_type n)`. This will save both memory (by avoiding over-allocations) and time (by avoiding reallocations).

3. Avoid using `vector::size()`: `vector::size()` is a function call that takes time. Since we know the size of the vector (it's `nn`), we can use `nn` instead of `v.size()`. This will save time.

4. Reserve memory for `arr`: `arr` is an array that is accessed by index, so it needs to have its memory reserved before it is used. Not doing so could potentially lead to a segmentation fault. Reserving the memory in advance will save time (by avoiding reallocations) and prevent potential crashes.

5. Use prefix increment in loops: Prefix increment (`++i`) is generally more efficient than postfix increment (`i++`) for non-primitive types. Although for built-in types like `int`, modern compilers usually optimize both to the same code, it's a good practice to always use prefix increment in loops because it's guaranteed to be at least as efficient as postfix increment.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <limits>
#define ll long long
#define ld long double
#define E endl
#define ull unsigned long long
#define TeFa
#define in cin
#define Mod 1000000007
#define IOT                                                                    \
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);                                                \
  cin.tie(0);
using namespace std;
int main() {
  IOT;
  ll t, nn, m, n;
  in >> t;
  while (t--) {
    in >> nn >> m;
    vector<ll> v(nn);
    ld arr[nn];
    ll sm = 0;
    ll cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nn; ++i) {
      in >> v[i];
    }
    sort(v.rbegin(), v.rend());
    for (int i = 0; i < nn; ++i) {
      sm += v[i];
      if (i == 0)
        arr[0] = v[0];
      else {
        arr[i] = sm / (i + 1);
      }
      if (arr[i] >= m)
        cnt++;
    }
    cout << cnt << E;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note: Using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;` is generally discouraged in production code because it can lead to name clashes and longer compile times.
