This program seems to be solving some sort of bin packing problem using a greedy algorithm, where it tries to pack the most items possible into a bin, given a certain maximum weight. It does this by sorting the weights in descending order and then trying to fit them in the current bin. If they don't fit, it moves on to the next bin. The map "x" keeps track of the remaining weight in each bin.

Here are the steps to optimize this code:

1. Usage of "std::map" is not the best choice for this problem. Because "std::map" is implemented as a balanced binary search tree, the time complexity for lookup, insert and delete operations is O(log n) which can slow down the program when dealing with large inputs. In this case, the keys in the map are the remaining weights of the bins. Since the weights are integers and do not exceed a certain limit, we can use a "std::vector" as a frequency table instead. The index of the vector can represent the weights and the value at that index can represent the frequency. This will reduce the time complexity for lookup, insert and delete operations to O(1).

2. In the original code, the for-loop to find the best bin to put the next item is inefficient. It iterates through the entire map which can be avoided by using a pointer or iterator to the current bin. When we put an item in the bin, we can just decrement the iterator until we find a bin that can fit the next item.

Here is the optimized code based on the above suggestions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n_sets;
    scanf("%d", &n_sets);
    for (int set_number = 1; set_number <= n_sets; set_number++) {
        int n, W;
        scanf("%d %d", &n, &W);
        vector<int> a(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            scanf("%d", &a[i]);
        sort(a.begin(), a.end(), greater<int>());
        vector<int> x(W + 1, 0);
        x[W] = 200000;
        auto best_w = x.rbegin();
        for (int i : a) {
            while (best_w->first < i)
                ++best_w;
            --best_w->second;
            if (!best_w->second)
                ++best_w;
            ++x[best_w->first - i];
        }
        printf("%d\n", 200000 - x[W]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that in some C++ environments, using "auto &[k, v]" in a range-based for loop may not work. In such cases, use "auto it = x.rbegin(); it != x.rend(); ++it" instead and replace "best_w->first" with "it->first" and "best_w->second" with "it->second".
