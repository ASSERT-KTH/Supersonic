The given program is solving a problem of packing items in the bins in an efficient way with a bin packing algorithm. It reads a number of test cases, then for each test case it reads the number of items and the maximum weight each bin can hold. After that, it reads the weights of the items, sorts them in descending order, and tries to pack as many items into the bins without exceeding the maximum weight. The goal is to minimize the number of bins used.

Let's go through the steps to optimize this program:

1. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to disable the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding C streams. This can give a significant performance boost.

2. Replace `scanf()` and `printf()` functions with `cin` and `cout`. Using C++ I/O can be faster with `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);`.

3. Use a `multiset` instead of a `map` to store the remaining weights of the bins. A multiset keeps its elements sorted and allows duplicate values. We can use its functionality to find a bin that can hold the current item in O(log n) time instead of O(n) with map.

4. Replace the loop that finds the best bin for the current item with a binary search on the multiset. This can be done with `multiset::upper_bound()` function.

5. The loop that reads the weights of the items can be moved inside the loop that packs the items into the bins. This can save some memory by not storing all the weights at once.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n_sets;
  cin >> n_sets;
  for (int set_number = 1; set_number <= n_sets; set_number++) {
    int n, W;
    cin >> n >> W;
    multiset<int> x;
    x.insert(W);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int a;
      cin >> a;
      auto it = x.lower_bound(W - a + 1);
      if (it != x.end()) {
        x.erase(it);
      }
      x.insert(W - a);
    }
    cout << x.size() << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program should run significantly faster and use less memory than the original program.
