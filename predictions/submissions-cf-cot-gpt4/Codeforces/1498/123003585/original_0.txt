The given C++ program reads an integer `n_sets` from the input which represents the number of sets to process. For each set, it reads an integer `n` (the size of the set) and `W` (the weight). Then, it reads `n` integers into an array `a`. Afterwards, it sorts the array in descending order. The program then uses a map `x` to track the remaining weights. For each element in `a`, it finds the best weight in `x` that can accommodate the element and decreases its count. If the count reaches 0, it is erased from `x`. Finally, it prints the number of weights that have been used.

Here are some optimizations that can be applied to this program:

1. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(NULL);`. This will disable the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams which can cause unnecessary overhead. Moreover, it unties `cin` from `cout`, which means `cout` will not be flushed before each `cin`. This can improve I/O performance.

2. The `std::map` container is used to keep track of weights. However, `std::map` operations such as insert and find have a logarithmic complexity. We can use `std::unordered_map` instead, which provides constant time average complexity for these operations.

3. The array `a` is defined with a size of `n`, which is not known at compile-time. This is not allowed in C++. We can replace the array `a` with a `std::vector` which can be resized at runtime.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n_sets;
  cin >> n_sets;
  for (int set_number = 1; set_number <= n_sets; set_number++) {
    int n, W;
    cin >> n >> W;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> a[i];
    sort(a.begin(), a.end(), greater<int>());
    unordered_map<int, int> x;
    x[W] = 200000;
    for (int i : a) {
      int remain = W - i;
      int best_w = W;
      for (auto &[k, v] : x) {
        if (k - i >= 0 && v != 0 && k - i < remain) {
          best_w = k;
          remain = k - i;
        }
      }
      x[best_w]--;
      if (!x[best_w])
        x.erase(best_w);
      x[remain]++;
    }
    cout << 200000 - x[W] << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the logic of the program hasn't been modified, only performance improvements have been made. Depending on the specific use case, there could be other ways to optimize the program further.
