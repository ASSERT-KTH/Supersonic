Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid using expensive operations: Map operations are quite costly in terms of time complexity. In this case, it's better to use a multiset instead of a map, because the operations we perform on this container (insert, erase, and find the largest/smallest element) can be done more efficiently with a multiset.

2. Do not use dynamic arrays on the stack: The line `int a[n];` is not standard C++. It's better to use a vector instead.

3. Use fast input/output methods: `scanf` and `printf` are faster than `cin` and `cout` in C++.

4. Use `auto` keyword to simplify code: `auto` keyword automatically determines the type of the variable at compile-time. We can use it to simplify the type declarations.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n_sets;
    cin >> n_sets;

    for (int set_number = 1; set_number <= n_sets; set_number++) {
        int n, W;
        cin >> n >> W;

        vector<int> a(n);
        for (int& i : a)
            cin >> i;

        sort(a.begin(), a.end(), greater<int>());

        multiset<int> x;
        x.insert(W);
        for (int i : a) {
            auto best_w = x.lower_bound(i);
            if (best_w != x.end()) {
                x.erase(best_w);
                x.insert(W - i);
            }
        }

        cout << x.size() << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program should be significantly faster and use less memory than the original program.
