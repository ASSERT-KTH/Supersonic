The given program seems to be solving a variant of the knapsack problem, where it tries to pack items with given weights into the smallest possible number of bins with a maximum capacity `W`.

1. The first optimization that can be made is to replace the map with an unordered_map. An unordered_map in C++ has an average time complexity of O(1) for search, insertion and deletion operations, while a map has a time complexity of O(logN). This change will drastically reduce the running time of the program.

2. We can remove the line `x[W] = 200000;` because we are initializing the map with a value that is not needed. This will save a small amount of memory.

3. We can use `auto it = x.lower_bound(i);` to find the first element in the map that can accommodate the weight `i`. This will reduce the time complexity from O(N) to O(logN) where N is the size of the map.

4. We can reduce the memory usage by replacing `int a[n];` with a vector `vector<int> a(n);`. This will dynamically allocate the memory for the array.

5. Instead of checking `if (!x[best_w]) x.erase(best_w);`, we can directly erase the element because `map::erase` operation does not throw an exception or present any issue if the key does not exist.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n_sets;
  scanf("%d", &n_sets);
  
  for (int set_number = 1; set_number <= n_sets; set_number++) {
    int n, W;
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &W);
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    sort(a.begin(), a.end(), greater<int>());
    unordered_map<int, int> x;
    
    for (int i : a) {
      auto it = x.lower_bound(i);
      if(it == x.end()) {
        x[W-i]++;
      } else {
        (it->second)--;
        if(it->second == 0)
          x.erase(it);
        if(i != it->first)
          x[it->first-i]++;
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", n - x.size());
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should run faster and use less memory compared to the original code. The optimizations mainly focused on improving the time complexity of the inner loop and reducing the memory usage by replacing the static array with a dynamic vector.
