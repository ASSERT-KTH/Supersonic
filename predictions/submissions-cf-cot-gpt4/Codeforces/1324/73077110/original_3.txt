Optimization Steps:

1. Firstly, we can see that there is a dynamic allocation of two arrays, a[n] and b[n]. This dynamic allocation is not necessary and can be replaced with vectors or arrays with a fixed size if the maximum size of n is known.

2. The same set of operations is applied to both vectors v and v1, and the subtraction results are stored separately in two vectors. We can perform the subtraction operation once, store the results in one vector, and sort this vector.

3. The use of the upper_bound function is not efficient since it will take O(log n) time for each search, resulting in a total time complexity of O(n log n). We can use two pointers to traverse the sorted vector, which will reduce the time complexity to linear.

4. The division by 2 to find the final answer can be moved outside the for loop to avoid unnecessary operations.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define IOS ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);
#define deb(x) cout << #x << "=" << x << endl;
#define endl '\n'
#define M 1000000007
#define int long long
using namespace std;
void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> a(n), b(n);
  vector<ll> v;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> b[i];
    v.push_back(a[i] - b[i]);
  }
  sort(v.begin(), v.end());
  ll ans = 0, j = n - 1;
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
    while (j >= 0 && v[i] + v[j] > 0) {
      --j;
    }
    ans += n - max(i, j) - 1;
    if (v[i] < 0)
      --ans;
  }
  cout << ans / 2 << endl;
}
int32_t main() {
  IOS ll T = 1;
  while (T--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that you need to be careful with the range of the values and the size of the vectors. If the maximum size of n is too large, you might need to use other data structures or algorithms to avoid overflow or out-of-memory issues. The optimization above is based on the assumption that the maximum size of n is within a reasonable range.
