Optimization steps:

1. In the current program, every time an element is pushed to the vector, memory reallocation might be needed which is a costly process. Instead of using push_back for the vectors 'v' and 'v1', we can use 'resize' function right after we define 'n'. This will preallocate enough space for all the elements, which will reduce the time taken by the vector reallocation process.

2. We can also remove the 'b' array as it is only being used to temporarily hold input values and then calculate the values for 'v' and 'v1'. Instead, we can use a single temporary variable to hold the current input, and calculate and store the values for 'v' and 'v1' in the same loop.

3. The division operation is more costly than multiplication, so instead of dividing the final answer by 2, we can multiply each increment of ans by 0.5.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define IOS ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);
#define deb(x) cout << #x << "=" << x << endl;
#define endl '\n'
#define M 1000000007
#define int long long
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  ll a[n];
  std::vector<ll> v(n), v1(n);
  ll temp;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> temp;
    v[i] = a[i] - temp;
    v1[i] = temp - a[i];
  }
  sort(v.begin(), v.end());
  sort(v1.begin(), v1.end());
  ll ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    auto it = upper_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), v1[i]);
    if (it == v.end()) {
      continue;
    }
    ll temp = v.end() - it;
    if (v1[i] < 0)
      temp--;
    ans += temp * 0.5;
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int32_t main() {
  IOS ll T = 1;
  while (T--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
