The given program is a C++ program that reads two arrays (a and b), calculates their pairwise differences, and counts how many such pairs have positive difference. It then divides the count by 2 and prints the result. The program uses dynamic memory allocation and contains lots of redundant operations which can be optimized. Here's what can be optimized:

1. Redundant Storage in Vector: The program is storing the same data twice in two vectors (v and v1). This is unnecessary and redundant as v1 is just the negative of v. We can simply use v and negate the values when necessary. This would save a lot of memory.

2. Unnecessary Sort: The program sorts both the vectors v and v1. However, as v1 is simply the negative of v, its sorted order is just the reverse of v. Hence, sorting v1 is unnecessary.

3. Unnecessary Division: In the end, the program divides the answer by 2. It's not needed if we adjust our counting mechanism.

4. Dynamic Memory Allocation: The program uses dynamic arrays to store the input data. This is inefficient in terms of memory usage and can be avoided by using static arrays.

5. Redundant Code: The #define directives and the IOS macro are not needed in this context and can be removed.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<long long> v(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    long long a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    v[i] = a - b;
  }
  sort(v.begin(), v.end());
  
  long long ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (v[i] <= 0) {
      auto it = lower_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), -v[i] + 1);
      ans += v.end() - it;
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program performs the same task but in a more efficient and memory-friendly way.
