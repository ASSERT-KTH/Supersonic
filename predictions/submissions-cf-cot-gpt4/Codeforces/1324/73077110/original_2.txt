This C++ code reads an array size `n` and two arrays `a` and `b` of size `n`. It then calculates two vectors `v` and `v1` whose elements are the difference between the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. It then sorts these vectors and calculates a value `ans`.

Optimization steps:

1. One of the most memory-consuming parts of this code is the use of two vectors `v` and `v1` to store the difference between the elements of `a` and `b`. Since these vectors depend only on `a` and `b`, they can be calculated on-the-fly, eliminating the need for the extra storage. We can keep a single sorted vector `v` for the differences.

2. Dynamic arrays `a` and `b` can be replaced with vectors which manage their own memory and avoids potential memory leaks if not handled properly.

3. The macro `#define int long long` seems to be not in use and can be removed to avoid confusion.

4. The variable `T` is always 1, so the while loop in the `main` function can be replaced by calling `solve()` directly.

Optimized Program:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define IOS ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  std::vector<ll> a(n), b(n), v;

  for (ll &i : a) {
    cin >> i;
  }
  for (ll &i : b) {
    cin >> i;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    v.push_back(a[i] - b[i]);
  }

  sort(v.begin(), v.end());

  ll ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    ll diff = b[i] - a[i];
    auto it = upper_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), diff);
    if (it == v.end()) {
      continue;
    }
    ll temp = v.end() - it;
    if (diff < 0)
      temp--;
    ans += temp;
  }
  cout << ans / 2 << endl;
}

int main() {
  IOS
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
Please make sure that your compiler supports C++11 or later for range-based for loop.

Please note that using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;` are considered bad practice. They are used here because the original code used them and the task was to optimize the given code without completely rewriting it. In a real-world application, you should only include the headers you need and avoid `using namespace std;` to prevent name clashes.
