The given C++ program seems to be already well written, but there are still some areas where it can be optimized for running time and memory usage. Here is the step-by-step explanation:

1. Avoid the use of `std::vector` for `v` and `v1` since the size `n` is already known. We can use array instead of vector to avoid the overhead of dynamic resizing. This will improve the memory usage.

2. There is no need to sort `v1`. We only need to find the upper bound of its elements in `v`, and `v` is already sorted. So, we can save some time by not sorting `v1`.

3. The `v1` array is used to store differences in the reverse order. However, we don't really need to do this because we can directly calculate `b[i] - a[i]` and use it in our upper_bound function.

4. The line `ll temp = v.end() - it;` is calculating the distance between the iterator `it` and the end of the vector `v` on each iteration. This is not necessary and can be calculated once at the start of the for loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define IOS ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);
#define deb(x) cout << #x << "=" << x << endl;
#define endl '\n'
#define M 1000000007
#define int long long
using namespace std;
void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  ll a[n], b[n], v[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> b[i];
    v[i] = a[i] - b[i];
  }
  sort(v, v+n);
  ll ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    ll temp = b[i] - a[i];
    auto it = upper_bound(v, v+n, temp);
    if (it != v+n) {
      ll distance = v+n - it;
      if (temp < 0)
        distance--;
      ans += distance;
    }
  }
  cout << ans / 2 << endl;
}
int32_t main() {
  IOS ll T = 1;
  while (T--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
