The given C++ program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Avoiding dynamic size arrays: Dynamic size arrays like `ll a[n], b[n];` are not supported by some compilers. Instead, use vectors which are dynamic and safer.

2. Reducing unnecessary vector operations: The vectors `v` and `v1` are being filled up with the difference of elements of `a` and `b`. This can be done directly in a single loop instead of two different loops to reduce time complexity.

3. Reducing redundant sort operations: The vectors `v` and `v1` are both sorted. However, since they contain the same elements (in opposite order), sorting one of them should suffice.

Here's the optimized program:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define IOS ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);
#define deb(x) cout << #x << "=" << x << endl;
#define endl '\n'
#define M 1000000007
#define int long long
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> a(n), b(n), v(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i] >> b[i];
    v[i] = a[i] - b[i];
  }
  sort(v.begin(), v.end());
  ll ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    auto it = upper_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), -v[i]);
    if (it != v.end()) {
      ll temp = v.end() - it;
      if (v[i] < 0)
        temp--;
      ans += temp;
    }
  }
  cout << ans / 2 << endl;
}

int32_t main() {
  IOS ll T = 1;
  while (T--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program reduces the number of loops, sorts less often, and avoids potential issues with dynamic arrays. These changes should make the program run faster and use less memory.
