The given code has the following areas that can be optimized:

1. Memory Usage: The code uses two dynamic arrays (a and b) and two vectors (v and v1) to hold the input and perform operations. This is redundant and a waste of memory. We can reduce this by using only the vectors v and v1.

2. Running Time: The code sorts the vectors v and v1. Sorting is an O(n log n) operation and can be time-consuming for large n. However, the code requires the vectors to be sorted for the binary search operation (upper_bound). This can't be avoided.

3. The main function has unnecessary while loop which can be removed, and the call to solve() function can be made directly.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define IOS                                                                    \
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);                                            \
  cin.tie(NULL);                                                               \
  cout.tie(NULL);

#define endl '\n'
#define M 1000000007
#define int long long
using namespace std;
void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  std::vector<ll> v(n), v1(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> v[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> v1[i];
    v[i] -= v1[i];
    v1[i] = -v[i];
  }
  sort(v.begin(), v.end());
  sort(v1.begin(), v1.end());
  ll ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    auto it = upper_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), v1[i]);
    if (it == v.end()) {
      continue;
    }
    ll temp = v.end() - it;
    if (v1[i] < 0)
      temp--;
    ans += temp;
  }
  cout << ans / 2 << endl;
}
int32_t main() {
  IOS
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces memory usage by eliminating redundant arrays and improves running time by removing unnecessary loops.
