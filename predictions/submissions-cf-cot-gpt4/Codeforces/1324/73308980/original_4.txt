The given code is reading from the file and standard input, then counting the number of odd and even numbers and printing "NO" if there is at least one odd and one even number, and "YES" otherwise.

There are several potential places for optimization:

1. Reduce IO operations: Each `cin` and `cout` operation is expensive in terms of time. We can reduce the number of operations by reading all the numbers at once and storing them in an array, and by using `"\n"` instead of `endl` to avoid unnecessary flushes of the output stream.

2. Use bitwise operations: Bitwise operations are often faster than arithmetic operations. In this case, we can use the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to check if a number is odd or even. The value `tmp & 1` will be `1` if `tmp` is odd, and `0` if it is even.

3. Avoid multiplication: The multiplication operation `odd * even` can be replaced with a logical AND operation `odd && even`. This is because we are only interested in whether both `odd` and `even` are non-zero, not their actual product.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int t, n, odd, even;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> nums(n);
    odd = even = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> nums[i];
      if (nums[i] & 1)
        odd++;
      else
        even++;
    }
    if (odd && even)
      cout << "NO\n";
    else
      cout << "YES\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These changes should make the program faster and more memory-efficient, especially for large inputs.
