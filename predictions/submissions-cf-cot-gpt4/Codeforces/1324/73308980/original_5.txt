This program can be optimized in two ways:

1. Avoid unnecessary variable initialization inside the loop: The variables `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0 inside the loop for every `t`. Instead, they should be initialized only once, and reset to 0 at the end of each loop iteration to avoid unnecessary memory operations.

2. Reduce the number of console output operations: Console output is a slow operation, and the current program writes to the console once for every `t`. Instead, a string can be built and written to the console once after all calculations are done.

Here is the optimized version of the program according to the above improvements:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int t, n, tmp, odd = 0, even = 0;
  string result;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> tmp;
      if (tmp & 1)
        odd++;
      else
        even++;
    }
    result += (odd * even) ? "NO\n" : "YES\n";
    odd = even = 0;
  }
  cout << result;
  return 0;
}
```

By doing these optimizations, the program will run faster and use less memory as it performs fewer memory operations (variable initialization and console output).
