This code seems quite well optimized already, but there are few changes that can be made to make this code a bit more efficient:

1. Use of #define: It's generally considered bad practice to use #define in C++. It's usually better to use const or inline functions, which are type-safe.

2. Use of using namespace std: It's generally not recommended to use the std namespace globally. It might cause name collisions, which could lead to bugs. It's better to use it in a local scope.

3. Use of getchar(): getchar() is a slow function. Using cin instead can make the code faster.

4. Use of putchar(): putchar() is a slow function. Using cout instead makes the code faster.

5. Use of vector::push_back in loop: push_back causes the vector to reallocate memory when its capacity is exceeded. This can be avoided by calling vector::reserve before the loop.

6. Use of magic numbers: There are few magic numbers in the code. Using named constants improves readability.

7. The variable "t" is declared as a global, but its scope is only within the check function. It can be moved to local scope.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

const int N = 2e5 + 7;
int n, m;
int k[N], sum;
std::vector<int> p, s[N];

inline long long read() {
  long long s = 0, w = 1;
  char ch = std::cin.get();
  for (; !std::isdigit(ch); ch = std::cin.get())
    if (ch == '-')
      w = -1;
  for (; std::isdigit(ch); ch = std::cin.get())
    s = (s << 1) + (s << 3) + (ch ^ 48);
  return s * w;
}

inline void print(long long x, int op = 10) {
  if (!x) {
    std::cout << '0';
    if (op)
      std::cout.put(op);
    return;
  }
  char F[40];
  long long tmp = x > 0 ? x : -x;
  if (x < 0)
    std::cout.put('-');
  int cnt = 0;
  while (tmp > 0) {
    F[cnt++] = tmp % 10 + '0';
    tmp /= 10;
  }
  while (cnt > 0)
    std::cout.put(F[--cnt]);
  if (op)
    std::cout.put(op);
}

bool check(int x) {
  int t[N] = {0};
  int now = x, ned = sum, cnt = 0;
  int i = lower_bound(p.begin(), p.end(), x) - p.begin();
  for(int i = std::min(N - 1, x); i >= 1; --i) {
    now = std::min(now, i);
    if (now == 0 or ned == 0)
      break;
    for (auto &it : s[i]) {
      int buy = std::min(now, k[it] - t[it]);
      t[it] += buy;
      ned -= buy;
      now -= buy;
      cnt += buy;
    }
  }
  return x - cnt >= ned * 2;
}

void solve() {
  n = read(), m = read();
  for(int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    k[i] = read();
    sum += k[i];
  }
  p.reserve(m);
  for(int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
    int d = read(), t = read();
    p.push_back(d);
    s[d].push_back(t);
  }
  std::sort(p.begin(), p.end());
  int l = 1, r = sum * 2, ans = 1;
  while (l <= r) {
    int mid = l + r >> 1;
    if (check(mid))
      ans = mid, r = mid - 1;
    else
      l = mid + 1;
  }
  print(ans);
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
