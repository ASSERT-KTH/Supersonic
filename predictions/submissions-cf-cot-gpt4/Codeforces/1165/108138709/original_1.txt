First, let's go through the program and identify the areas where we can optimize the program.

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line includes a lot of unnecessary libraries that can slow down the compile time. We should only include the necessary libraries for our program.

2. Macros such as `#define js`, `#define all(__vv__)`, `#define pai pair<int, int>` are not used in the program. Removing these will improve readability and memory usage.

3. In the `read()` function, the logic to read a negative number is implemented but it's not used anywhere in the current program. If we don't need to handle negative numbers, we can simplify this function.

4. The `print()` function has a complex logic to print the number, which can be replaced with a single line of `cout << x;`.

5. In the `solve()` function, the `check()` function is called with the argument which is the midpoint of `l` and `r`. If the `check()` function returns `true`, `r` is updated to `mid - 1`. However, if `check(mid)` returns `true`, `check(mid - 1)` will also return `true` (since the `check()` function is monotonic). Thus, we don't need to perform `check(mid - 1)`.

Let's optimize the program based on these observations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#define rep(i, sta, en) for (int i = sta; i <= en; ++i)
#define repp(i, sta, en) for (int i = sta; i >= en; --i)
typedef long long ll;
const int N = 2e5 + 7;
int n, m;
int k[N], t[N], sum;
std::vector<int> p, s[N];
bool check(int x) {
  memset(t, 0, sizeof(t));
  int now = x, ned = sum;
  int i = std::lower_bound(p.begin(), p.end(), x) - p.begin();
  repp(i, std::min(N - 1, x), 1) {
    now = std::min(now, i);
    if (now == 0 or ned == 0)
      break;
    for (auto &it : s[i]) {
      int buy = std::min(now, k[it] - t[it]);
      t[it] += buy;
      ned -= buy;
      now -= buy;
    }
  }
  return x - now >= ned * 2;
}
void solve() {
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  rep(i, 1, n) {
    std::cin >> k[i];
    sum += k[i];
  }
  rep(i, 1, m) {
    int d, t;
    std::cin >> d >> t;
    p.push_back(d);
    s[d].push_back(t);
  }
  std::sort(p.begin(), p.end());
  int l = 1, r = sum * 2, ans = 1;
  while (l < r) {
    int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
    if (check(mid))
      r = mid;
    else
      l = mid + 1;
  }
  std::cout << l;
}
int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program is more efficient and uses less memory than the original one. The unnecessary libraries and unused functions have been removed, and the binary search logic has been optimized.
