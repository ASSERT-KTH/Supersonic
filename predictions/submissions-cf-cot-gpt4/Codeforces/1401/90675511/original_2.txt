The given program receives an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it gets an array of `n` integers, then finds the smallest number `m` in the array. It creates a new array with the indices and values of the numbers in the original array that are divisible by `m`, sorts this new array, and then updates the original array with the sorted numbers. Finally, it checks if the updated array is sorted in increasing order; if not, it prints "NO", otherwise, it prints "YES".

Here are steps to optimize the program:

1. Instead of using three separate arrays `a`, `b`, and `c`, use a vector of pairs. Each pair will store the value and its index. This way, we save space by not storing zeros in `b` and `c` when the condition `a[i] % m == 0` is not met. Also, this reduces the need for managing the index `k`.
   
2. Instead of finding the smallest element `m` in the array separately, do it while reading the input. This will save one traversal of the array.

3. After sorting the vector of pairs, there is no need to update the original array and check if it's sorted. Instead, compare the sorted array with the original one. If they are not equal, print "NO"; otherwise, print "YES". This way, we avoid unnecessary updates and one pass through the array.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    vector<pair<int, int>> arr(n);
    int m = INT_MAX;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> arr[i].first;
      arr[i].second = i;
      m = min(m, arr[i].first);
    }
    
    vector<pair<int, int>> divisible;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (arr[i].first % m == 0) {
        divisible.push_back(arr[i]);
      }
    }
    
    sort(divisible.begin(), divisible.end());
    
    for (int i = 0; i < divisible.size(); i++) {
      arr[divisible[i].second] = divisible[i];
    }
    
    if (is_sorted(arr.begin(), arr.end())) {
      cout << "YES\n";
    } else {
      cout << "NO\n";
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;` are not recommended in large projects or production code due to possible naming conflicts and increased compilation times. However, they are frequently used in competitive programming for brevity.
