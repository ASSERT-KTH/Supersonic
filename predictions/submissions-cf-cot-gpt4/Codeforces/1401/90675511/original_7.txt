The given code reads a number 't' which signifies the number of test cases. For each test case, an array of size 'n' is read and the minimum value 'm' is calculated. A new array of elements that are divisible by 'm' is created and sorted. This sorted array is placed back into the original positions of the original array. Finally, the code checks if the resulting array is sorted.

Optimizations:
1. Array allocation: In C++, dynamic allocation of array on stack using variable size is not standard. For large values of 'n', it can even lead to stack overflow. Therefore, we should switch to using `vector<int>` instead of `int[]`.
2. Unnecessary arrays: The arrays 'b' and 'c' can be combined into one `vector<pair<int, int>>`, where the first element of the pair is the index and the second element is the value. This will decrease memory usage.
3. Sorting: We don't need to sort the entire array. We only need to ensure that the elements that are divisible by 'm' are sorted among themselves. For the remaining elements, as they are not affected, they will maintain their relative order which is already sorted as per the problem statement.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  for (; t--;) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    int m = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
      m = min(m, a[i]);
    }
    vector<pair<int, int>> b;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (a[i] % m == 0) {
        b.push_back({i, a[i]});
      }
    }
    sort(b.begin(), b.end(), [](auto &x, auto &y) {
      return x.second < y.second;
    });
    for (auto &p : b)
      a[p.first] = p.second;
    if (is_sorted(a.begin(), a.end()))
      cout << "YES\n";
    else
      cout << "NO\n";
  }
}
```
