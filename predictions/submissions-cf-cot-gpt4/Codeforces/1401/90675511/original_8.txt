The given C++ program does the following:

1. Reads an integer t which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads an integer n and then a sequence of n integers into an array a.
3. It finds the minimum element m in a.
4. It creates two arrays b and c, where the i-th element of b is the index at which the i-th element of c appeared in a, but only for elements of a that are divisible by m.
5. It sorts the elements in c, and then puts them back into a at the corresponding positions indicated by b.
6. It checks if the array a is sorted, and outputs "YES" if it is and "NO" if it isn't.

Optimization Steps:

1. The primary optimization would focus on reducing the number of iterations through the array a.
2. Instead of finding the minimum element in the entire array a in one pass, and then in a second pass filling the arrays b and c, these two steps can be combined into a single pass. This would halve the number of iterations through a.
3. The second optimization would be to eliminate the need to sort c and then put its elements back into a. Instead, we can just check if the elements in a that are not divisible by m are already in sorted order. This is because the elements in c will always be sorted after they are put back into a, so they will not affect the sorted order of the other elements.
4. The third optimization would be to avoid using the flag variable. We can directly output "NO" and return from the function when we find that a is not sorted, instead of setting the flag and checking it later.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        vector<int> a(n);
        int m = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
            m = min(m, a[i]);
        }
        vector<int> indices;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (a[i] % m == 0) {
                indices.push_back(i);
            } else if (i > 0 && a[i] < a[i - 1]) {
                cout << "NO\n";
                return 0;
            }
        }
        cout << "YES\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, the vector `indices` is not used because it isn't required, but it's kept so that the optimized code closely follows the original code. If it's okay to deviate from the original code a bit, the vector `indices` can be removed.
