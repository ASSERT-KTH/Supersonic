This C++ program seems to be sorting an array partially. The part of the array that is sorted is determined by whether the elements are divisible by the minimum value in the array.

The main optimizations for this program would be to:

1. Use `std::vector<int>` instead of C-style arrays: This offers more security and functionality, and it's easier to work with. In addition, it's recommended in C++ to avoid C-style arrays in favor of `std::vector`.

2. Use a custom comparator for sorting: Instead of sorting the `c` array and then assigning the values back into the `a` array, you could use a custom comparator that does the modulo operation on the fly.

3. Combine the loops: Instead of having separate loops for finding the minimum value, filling the `b` and `c` arrays, and checking if the `a` array is sorted, you could combine these into fewer loops.

However, these optimizations might be more significant than you requested. If you want smaller changes, you could:

1. Combine the loops for finding the minimum value and filling the `b` and `c` arrays.

2. Combine the loop for sorting the `c` array and checking if the `a` array is sorted.

Here is the optimized program with the above smaller changes:

```C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int a[n], b[n], c[n];
    int m = INT_MAX;
    int k = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
      m = min(m, a[i]);
      if (a[i] % m == 0) {
        b[k] = i;
        c[k] = a[i];
        k++;
      }
    }
    sort(c, c + k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
      a[b[i]] = c[i];
    if (is_sorted(a, a+n))
      cout << "YES\n";
    else
      cout << "NO\n";
  }
}
```
In this optimized version, I combined the first two loops into one. The `min` function is used to find the minimum value, and the `b` and `c` arrays are filled in the same loop. The `is_sorted` function is used to check if the `a` array is sorted, which simplifies this part of the code.
