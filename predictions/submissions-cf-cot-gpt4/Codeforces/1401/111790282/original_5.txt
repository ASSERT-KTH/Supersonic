The given program is already quite optimized. However, there are a few small modifications we can make:

1. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to make I/O operations faster. It will disable the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams if it is called before the program performs its first input or output operation.

2. Use `std::min` and `std::max` functions instead of if-else conditions to find minimum and maximum. This makes the code cleaner and might be slightly faster.

3. Use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the buffer.

4. Reduce the number of variables to save memory. `mn` and `mn2` variables are not needed and can be replaced with direct calculations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int t, xa, xb, ya, yb, za, zb, ans;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ans = 0;
    cin >> xa >> ya >> za >> xb >> yb >> zb;

    int temp = min(za, yb);
    za -= temp;
    yb -= temp;
    ans += (2 * temp);
    zb -= za;
    ans -= (2 * max(0, zb - xa));

    cout << ans << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Note: In the original code, `xb` was not used. If it's not a mistake and `xb` is not used in operations, you can remove it.
