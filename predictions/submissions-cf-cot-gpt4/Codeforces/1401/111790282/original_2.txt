Here are the steps to optimize the given C/C++ program:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increases the compile time. Instead, only include the libraries that are being used in the program. In this case, `iostream` is the only required library.

2. Using `namespace std` is a bad practice as it could lead to name conflicts. So, it's better to use `std::` before every standard library object.

3. For the variables `mn` and `mn2`, the `std::min` and `std::max` functions can be used to find the minimum and maximum values respectively, instead of using if-else blocks. This makes the code cleaner and more readable.

4. Also, the `std::max` function can be used to ensure that `zb` doesn't go below zero when subtracting `za`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    int t, xa, xb, ya, yb, za, zb, ans;
    std::cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        ans = 0;
        std::cin >> xa >> ya >> za >> xb >> yb >> zb;
        int mn = std::min(za, yb);
        za -= mn;
        yb -= mn;
        ans += (2 * mn);
        zb = std::max(0, zb - za);
        int mn2 = std::max(0, zb - xa);
        ans -= (2 * mn2);
        std::cout << ans << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Note that the above code is not only optimized for running time but also for readability, which is also an important aspect of code optimization.
