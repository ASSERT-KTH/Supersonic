The given code is already quite optimized in terms of time as it's running in O(1) time complexity for each test case. However, a few small modifications can make it more efficient and clean.

Optimization Steps:

1. The first step of optimization is to use the `std::min` function from the standard library, instead of using the `if-else` construct to find the minimum between two numbers. This will make the code cleaner and slightly more efficient.

2. The second optimization can be to use the `std::max` function to ensure `mn2` is not less than zero, instead of using the `if` condition. This will again reduce the number of lines in the code and make it cleaner.

3. Another small optimization can be to use `'\n'` directly in the `cout` method instead of using it in a separate line. This will reduce the number of lines in the code and will not make any significant difference in terms of efficiency.

4. Also, using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` can speed up the I/O operations. This can make a significant difference when the number of I/O operations are large.

Here's the optimized code taking into account the optimizations mentioned above:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t, xa, xb, ya, yb, za, zb, mn, mn2, ans;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ans = 0;
    cin >> xa >> ya >> za >> xb >> yb >> zb;
    mn = min(za, yb);
    za -= mn;
    yb -= mn;
    ans += (2 * mn);
    zb -= za;
    mn2 = max(zb - xa, 0);
    ans -= (2 * mn2);
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is not recommended for production code as it includes too many headers, increasing the compile time, and it's not standard C++. It's usually used in competitive programming for convenience.
