The code provided seems to be quite optimized in terms of running time and memory usage. However, there are some small improvements that can be done. Here are the steps:

1. Streamlining the reading of input: Currently, the input variables are being read one at a time. This could be streamlined with the use of a single line.

2. Minimizing variable assignments: There are some unnecessary variable assignments in the code, which can be minimized. For example, instead of assigning `mn` twice, a single ternary operation can be used.

3. Avoiding unnecessary calculations: The code currently calculates `2*mn` and `2*mn2` separately. Instead, these can be calculated once and stored in the variable itself to avoid the extra calculation.

4. Using `std::endl` instead of '\n': Although '\n' is faster, `std::endl` ensures the buffer is flushed, which could prevent potential issues in some cases.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int t, xa, xb, ya, yb, za, zb;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> xa >> ya >> za >> xb >> yb >> zb;
    int mn = min(za, yb);
    za -= mn;
    yb -= mn;
    int ans = 2 * mn;
    zb -= za;
    int mn2 = max(0, zb - xa);
    ans -= 2 * mn2;
    cout << ans << std::endl;
  }
}
```
In this version of the code, the calculations are more streamlined, variable assignments are minimized, and the input reading is more efficient.
