Here are the steps to optimize the given code:

1. The first optimization is related to the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increases the compilation time. Therefore, it's better to include only the libraries that are being used. In this case, `iostream` is sufficient.

2. If you have multiple `cout` statements, it's better to combine them into one to improve the I/O performance.

3. Also, `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` can be used to unsync the C++ standard streams with their C counterparts to achieve faster I/O. 

4. `cin.tie(NULL)` can be used so `cin` operation does not always cause a flush of `cout` before execution.

5. The `if` statements to calculate `mn` and `mn2` can be replaced with the `min` function to make the code cleaner and faster.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int xa, xb, ya, yb, za, zb, ans = 0;
        cin >> xa >> ya >> za >> xb >> yb >> zb;
        int mn = min(za, yb);
        za -= mn;
        yb -= mn;
        ans = 2 * mn;
        zb -= za;
        int mn2 = max(0, zb - xa);
        ans -= 2 * mn2;
        cout << ans << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimizations performed here are mostly high-level and language specific. For lower-level optimizations such as memory and CPU usage, it would require a deeper understanding of the specific algorithm and its usage context.
