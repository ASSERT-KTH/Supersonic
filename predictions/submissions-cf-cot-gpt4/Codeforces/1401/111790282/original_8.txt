This C++ program appears to be already quite optimized. However, there are few small changes that could potentially improve its performance.

1. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`: These two lines of code can speed up the input/output operations in C++. They are especially useful when a large amount of data is read or written.

2. Use `std::min()` and `std::max()`: Instead of using if-else statements to determine the minimum or maximum between two numbers, we can use the `std::min()` and `std::max()` functions. This can make the code more concise and easier to read.

3. Print the result in a single `cout` statement: Multiple `cout` statements can slow down the program due to the overhead of function calls. We can print the result and the newline character in a single `cout` statement.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t, xa, xb, ya, yb, za, zb, mn, mn2, ans;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ans = 0;
    cin >> xa >> ya >> za >> xb >> yb >> zb;
    mn = min(za, yb);
    za -= mn;
    yb -= mn;
    ans += (2 * mn);
    zb -= za;
    mn2 = max(0, zb - xa);
    ans -= (2 * mn2);
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
}
```
This program does the same thing as the original one but with potential improvements in performance.
