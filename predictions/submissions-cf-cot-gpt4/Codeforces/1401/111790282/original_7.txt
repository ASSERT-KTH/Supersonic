This program is already quite efficient, but there are a few areas where tiny improvements could be achieved. 

1. Instead of performing two different operations to decrement `za` and `yb` by `mn`, you could use the `-= mn` operation directly in the if-else statement where `mn` is being calculated. This would save some time by reducing the number of operations.

2. The line `zb -= za;` can be moved inside the second if condition where `mn2` is calculated. If `mn2` is less than 0, there's no need to subtract `za` from `zb`, so this could potentially save some time.

3. You can combine two cout statements into one, which will slightly optimize the code as well.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int t, xa, xb, ya, yb, za, zb, mn, mn2, ans;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ans = 0;
    cin >> xa >> ya >> za >> xb >> yb >> zb;
    if (za > yb) {
      mn = yb;
      za -= mn;
      yb -= mn;
    } else {
      mn = za;
      za -= mn;
      yb -= mn;
    }
    ans += (2 * mn);
    if (zb >= za) {
      zb -= za;
      mn2 = zb - xa;
      if (mn2 < 0)
        mn2 = 0;
      ans -= (2 * mn2);
    }
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
}
```

Please note that these are minor optimizations and may not cause a noticeable difference in running time or memory usage.
