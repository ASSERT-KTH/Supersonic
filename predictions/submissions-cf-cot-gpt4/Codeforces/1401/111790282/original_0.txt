This code is already quite optimized, but there are a few small improvements we can make:

1. Move the declaration of the variables `mn` and `mn2` inside the while loop. This way, the memory for these variables is only allocated when needed, which can save memory if `t` is small. This is a small optimization, but it can add up if the loop is run many times.

2. Remove the separate `cout << '\n';` statement and include the newline character directly in the previous statement. This reduces the number of output operations, which can potentially improve performance.

3. Use `std::min` and `std::max` functions for finding minimum and maximum. This makes the code cleaner and more compact, and these functions are usually implemented in a very efficient way.

4. Since `zb` is decreased by `za`, we should ensure `zb` is not negative before subtracting `xa` from it. This will help avoid unnecessary calculations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t, xa, xb, ya, yb, za, zb, ans;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        cin >> xa >> ya >> za >> xb >> yb >> zb;
        int mn = min(za, yb);
        za -= mn;
        yb -= mn;
        ans = 2 * mn;
        zb = max(zb - za, 0);
        int mn2 = max(zb - xa, 0);
        ans -= 2 * mn2;
        cout << ans << '\n';
    }
}
```
This optimized code is more efficient in terms of memory usage and has fewer output operations than the original code.
