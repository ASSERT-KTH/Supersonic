This program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. **Include only necessary headers:** The first line of your code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a header file that includes almost all standard library headers. This is generally considered bad practice, as it unnecessarily increases compilation time and memory usage. Instead, you should include only the headers you actually use. In this case, it seems like you only need `<iostream>` for input and output.

2. **Use less variables:** There are several variables declared at the beginning of `main()`, but some of them are used only in a very limited scope. You can reduce the number of variables by declaring them in the smallest scope where they are used.

3. **Avoid unnecessary operations:** There are a couple of places in your code where you perform operations that could be avoided. For example, `zb -= za;` is followed by `mn2 = zb - xa;`. You can combine these two operations into one: `mn2 = zb - xa - za;`.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int xa, xb, ya, yb, za, zb;
    cin >> xa >> ya >> za >> xb >> yb >> zb;

    int mn = min(za, yb);
    za -= mn;
    yb -= mn;
    int ans = 2 * mn;

    int mn2 = max(0, zb - xa - za);
    ans -= 2 * mn2;
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, I've moved the declaration of `mn` and `mn2` to where they're used, removed the `ans = 0` line since `ans` is immediately assigned a new value anyway, replaced the `if` statements with `min` and `max` functions to make the code cleaner and easier to follow, and consolidated the `zb -= za;` and `mn2 = zb - xa;` lines into a single line.
