The given C/C++ program seems to be already optimized in terms of algorithmic complexity but there are some small changes that can be done to optimize it further:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#define IOS` macro and its usage. This is not required and just adds extra lines to the code.
2. Reduce the scope of the `temp` variable. Currently, it is defined for the whole while loop. We can define it just where we need it.
3. The `iostream` library is lighter than `bits/stdc++.h` which can reduce the compilation time.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2;
    cin >> a1 >> b1 >> c1 >> a2 >> b2 >> c2;
    ll ans = 0;
    {
      ll temp = min(c1, b2);
      ans += temp * 2;
      c1 -= temp;
      b2 -= temp;
    }
    c1 -= min(c1, c2);
    c2 -= min(a1, c2);
    {
      ll temp = min(b1, c2);
      ans -= 2 * temp;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note that these optimizations are very minor and may not result in noticeable improvements in execution time or memory usage. The performance of this code primarily depends on the algorithmic complexity, which seems to be linear (O(n)) with respect to the input size, and this is already optimal for this kind of problem.
