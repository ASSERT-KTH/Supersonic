The given program reads an integer `t` and for `t` times reads six more integers `a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2` and calculates a value `ans` based on these.

Optimization Steps:
1. The first optimization that can be done is to avoid the usage of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file includes quite a lot of files, and it is unnecessary to include all these files. We can instead include only those header files that are required. In this code, we only need `iostream`. This will reduce the compilation time.
2. We do not need to use `using namespace std;` as it can cause name clashes. We can use the `std::` prefix when needed.
3. We can eliminate the use of the `IOS` macro. This macro is used to speed up `cin` and `cout`, but since we are only using `cin` and `cout` a few times, the overhead of setting up these optimizations may outweigh their benefits.
4. Instead of using multiple variables for temp, we can use just one temporary variable for all the calculations.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#define ll long long

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2;
    std::cin >> a1 >> b1 >> c1 >> a2 >> b2 >> c2;
    ll ans = 0;
    ll temp = std::min(c1, b2);
    ans += temp * 2;
    c1 -= temp;
    b2 -= temp;
    temp = std::min(c1, c2);
    c2 -= temp;
    temp = std::min(a1, c2);
    c2 -= temp;
    temp = std::min(b1, c2);
    ans -= 2 * temp;
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we have included only the necessary header files and removed the `IOS` macro. We have also reduced the number of temporary variables used for calculations.
