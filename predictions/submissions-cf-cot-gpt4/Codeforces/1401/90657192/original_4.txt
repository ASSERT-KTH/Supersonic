This C++ code is already quite optimized, but there are few small adjustments we can make:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which increases compilation time. We can replace it with the specific libraries that we need.

2. The `IOS` macro is used to speed up I/O operations, but it isn't necessary here because we aren't doing a large number of I/O operations in a loop. So, we can remove it.

3. `using namespace std;` brings the entire std namespace into scope which could potentially lead to name collision and unusual behavior. It's better to use specific items from std namespace.

4. Avoid unnecessary variables. In this case, `temp` variable is unnecessary as it is used only to store temporary values for the operations. We can perform those operations directly.

Let's apply these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#define ll long long

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2;
    std::cin >> a1 >> b1 >> c1 >> a2 >> b2 >> c2;
    ll ans = 0;

    ll min_val = std::min(c1, b2);
    ans += min_val * 2;
    c1 -= min_val;
    b2 -= min_val;

    c2 -= std::min(c1, c2);
    c2 -= std::min(a1, c2);
    ans -= 2 * std::min(b1, c2);

    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that in case of competitive programming, where execution time is critical, using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `IOS` macro is a common practice. The optimizations here are more suitable for production code.
