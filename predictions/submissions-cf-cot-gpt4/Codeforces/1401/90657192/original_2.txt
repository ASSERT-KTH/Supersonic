Optimization Steps:

1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes many unnecessary libraries, which can slow down the compilation time. It's not a standard library, so it's better to include only the libraries needed. In this case, we need `iostream` and `algorithm`.

2. Remove `#define IOS` and `IOS;`: These lines are used to speed up reading from `stdin` and writing to `stdout`. However, the speedup is usually negligible and can even be harmful in some cases. It's better to use the standard `cin` and `cout` without these optimizations.

3. Consider using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(NULL)`: These two lines can significantly speed up `cin` and `cout`. They're especially useful when you're doing a lot of input/output. However, you can't mix `cin/cout` with `scanf/printf` after using these lines.

4. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`: `endl` not only inserts a newline character but also flushes the output buffer, which can be slower. If you don't need to flush the buffer immediately, use `'\n'`.

5. Declare variables outside the loop: Memory allocation takes some time, so if you're using the same variables in a loop, it's better to declare them outside the loop. This way, you'll only allocate memory once instead of multiple times.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;

  long long a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2, ans = 0, temp;

  while (t--) {
    cin >> a1 >> b1 >> c1 >> a2 >> b2 >> c2;
    ans = 0;
    temp = min(c1, b2);
    ans += temp * 2;
    c1 -= temp;
    b2 -= temp;
    temp = min(c1, c2);
    c2 -= temp;
    temp = min(a1, c2);
    c2 -= temp;
    temp = min(b1, c2);
    ans -= 2 * temp;
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
