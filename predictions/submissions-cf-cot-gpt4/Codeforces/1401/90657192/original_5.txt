The code given seems already quite efficient. There are no unnecessary calculations or data structures, and all variables are used correctly. However, there are a few minor improvements and optimizations that can be done:

1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file includes almost all standard library headers, which is unnecessary and can increase compile time. Instead, include only what you need.

2. Remove the `#define IOS` macro. This macro speeds up the cin and cout operations. However, if the input/output operations are not a bottleneck in the program, this macro is not necessary and can be removed. The `ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);` are used to untie cin from cout and to turn off synchronization with the c standard library streams. This makes the program faster, but it also makes it more error-prone.

3. Minimize the scope of variables. This means declaring variables as late as possible. This makes the program easier to read and understand. Also, each variable will only take up memory when it is actually used.

Here is the optimized version of the code based on the above suggestions:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<algorithm>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2;
    cin >> a1 >> b1 >> c1 >> a2 >> b2 >> c2;
    ll ans = 0;
    {
      ll temp = min(c1, b2);
      ans += temp * 2;
      c1 -= temp;
      b2 -= temp;
    }
    {
      ll temp = min(c1, c2);
      c2 -= temp;
      temp = min(a1, c2);
      c2 -= temp;
    }
    {
      ll temp = min(b1, c2);
      ans -= 2 * temp;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
In this optimized version, I have removed the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `#define IOS` and replaced them with necessary headers and statements. Also, I have minimized the scope of the `temp` variable by putting it inside a block `{}`. So, the memory for `temp` is released after it is no longer needed. This can save memory when the number of test cases `t` is large.
