Here are some steps to optimize this program:

1. Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` directive. This header file includes almost all standard library headers, which increases compilation time. Include only the headers you need.

2. The `IOS` macro is not necessary. It aims to speed up I/O by disabling synchronization with C library I/O functions and untie cin and cout. However, this is not a bottleneck in your code and it is not recommended to use macros for this purpose.

3. The `ll` type is a `long long`, which is usually a 64-bit integer. If you only deal with 32-bit integers in your program, use `int` instead to reduce memory usage.

4. The `temp` variable is used for different purposes. It is not a good practice to use the same variable for different purposes. Instead, use different variables with meaningful names to make the code more readable.

5. The `cin` and `cout` objects are slower than the C-style input/output functions `scanf` and `printf`. For competitive programming, it is common to use `scanf` and `printf`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    int a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2;
    scanf("%d%d%d%d%d%d", &a1, &b1, &c1, &a2, &b2, &c2);
    int ans = 0;
    int temp1 = min(c1, b2);
    ans += temp1 * 2;
    c1 -= temp1;
    b2 -= temp1;
    int temp2 = min(c1, c2);
    c2 -= temp2;
    int temp3 = min(a1, c2);
    c2 -= temp3;
    int temp4 = min(b1, c2);
    ans -= 2 * temp4;
    printf("%d\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program should be faster and use less memory than the original one. Remember that the optimization is limited to the code you provided and there could be other ways of optimizing the logic of the program, depending on the specific task it is supposed to solve.
