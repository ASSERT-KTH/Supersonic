The given C/C++ program is already fairly optimized, but there are still minor changes we can implement to further optimize it.

1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a large number of standard library headers which can slow down the compilation process. Including only the necessary headers will speed up compilation.

2. Limit the scope of variables: Declaring variables in the smallest possible scope can aid in memory usage. Here, we can declare `temp` inside each loop. Doing so also provides better code readability because it limits the variable's scope to where it's used.

3. Using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This can provide a significant speedup in I/O operations. However, it should be noted that while this can speed up I/O operations, it may cause issues if you're mixing `std::cin/cout` with `scanf/printf`.

4. Unnecessary Macro `IOS`: This macro is not necessary as it is only used once in the program. Writing it directly in the main function will not affect the performance, but improves readability.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL); 
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    long long a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2;
    cin >> a1 >> b1 >> c1 >> a2 >> b2 >> c2;
    
    long long ans = 0;
    
    long long temp = min(c1, b2);
    ans += temp * 2;
    c1 -= temp;
    b2 -= temp;
    
    temp = min(c1, c2);
    c2 -= temp;
    
    temp = min(a1, c2);
    c2 -= temp;
    
    temp = min(b1, c2);
    ans -= 2 * temp;
    
    cout << ans << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
Please note that optimization is not always about increasing speed or reducing memory usage. Sometimes, it's about making the code cleaner and easier to read and understand. And in some cases, making the code more readable can also make it more efficient.
