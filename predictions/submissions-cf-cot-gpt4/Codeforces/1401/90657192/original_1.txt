Step 1: Remove #include <bits/stdc++.h>
This header file is quite large and includes many standard libraries which may not be used in this program. Including this file can slow down the compile time. Instead, I will include only the required header files.

Step 2: Remove Macro "IOS"
Although this macro is used to speed up I/O operations in competitive programming, it's generally not recommended for production code due to its global effect. Instead, we can place the actual code in the main function itself.

Step 3: Use int instead of int32_t for main function
The int32_t is a fixed width integer type with width exactly 32 bits. However, it's not necessary to use this in the main function. The return type of main can simply be int.

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary variable assignments
In the current code, the actual minimum value is calculated and stored in a temporary variable temp, and then it's subtracted from other variables. Instead, we can directly subtract the minimum value from the required variables, which reduces the need for the temp variable and saves memory.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
  
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        long long a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2;
        cin >> a1 >> b1 >> c1 >> a2 >> b2 >> c2;
        long long ans = 0;
        c1 -= min(c1, b2) * 2;
        ans += min(c1, b2) * 2;
        c2 -= min(c1, c2);
        c2 -= min(a1, c2);
        ans -= min(b1, c2) * 2;
        cout << ans << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have only included the necessary header files, made the code more readable by removing the macro, and optimized memory usage by removing the unnecessary temp variable.
