The given C/C++ program is already quite optimized in terms of running time and memory usage. It uses `cin` and `cout` which are faster than `printf` and `scanf` in C++. It also takes into account using `typedef long long ll` to shorten the code and enhance understanding. However, using the `#define` and `using namespace std` is generally not recommended as it could lead to naming conflicts.

The variable `temp` is being recalculated multiple times, we can reduce this by direct subtraction and addition to `ans`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

typedef long long ll;

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(nullptr);
    std::cout.tie(nullptr);
    int t;
    std::cin >> t;
    while(t--) {
        ll a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2;
        std::cin >> a1 >> b1 >> c1 >> a2 >> b2 >> c2;
        ll ans = 0;

        ll transfer = std::min(c1, b2);
        ans += transfer * 2;
        c1 -= transfer;
        c2 -= std::min(c1, c2);
        c2 -= std::min(a1, c2);
        ans -= 2 * std::min(b1, c2);

        std::cout << ans << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In terms of optimization, I have done the following:

1. Removed `#define IOS` and `#define ll long long` and replaced them with `typedef long long ll;` and set `cin` and `cout` to fast mode individually. This is because `#define` can lead to naming conflicts and it is more C++ style to use `typedef` or `using` for type renaming.

2. Removed `using namespace std;` to avoid potential naming conflicts.

3. Placed `std::` before `cin`, `cout`, `endl`, `min` and `ios::sync_with_stdio`. This is to specify that these names are from the `std` namespace as `using namespace std;` has been removed.

4. Reduced the number of times `temp` is calculated by directly subtracting and adding to `ans`. This reduces the number of operations and therefore potentially speeds up the program a bit.

5. Replaced `endl` with `"\n"` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the buffer. This could potentially speed up the output a bit. 

Remember, these optimizations are minor and the actual performance gain may not be noticeable for small inputs. But these are good practices to follow.
