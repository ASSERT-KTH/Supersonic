This program reads a string from the user and then prints out selected characters from that string. The characters are selected based on the current loop index `i`. For each iteration, it checks if `b` (which starts from 0) is less than `n` and then it prints the character at index `b` of the string `t` and increments `b` by `i`.

Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid string concatenation on each input. Concatenating strings is an expensive operation in terms of time complexity. In this case, it is unnecessary because we can print the character directly.

2. Removing unnecessary string variable `t`. We can directly get characters from user input.

3. Instead of checking `b < n` inside the loop, we can use `b < n` as the loop condition. This saves us from unnecessary iterations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  char t;
  for (int i = 1, b = 0; b < n; i++, b += i) {
    cin >> t;
    cout << t;
  }
}
```
In this version of the program, we read and print one character at a time, so we don't need to store the whole string in memory. The time complexity is also improved because we avoid the expensive string concatenation operation and unnecessary iterations.
