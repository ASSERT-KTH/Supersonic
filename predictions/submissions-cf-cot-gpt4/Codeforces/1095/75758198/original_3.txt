This program reads a string from the user and prints every i-th character of the string where i is an increasing integer. The program can be optimized in several ways:

1. Declare the variables `n` and `b` inside the loop to reduce the scope of these variables.
2. Instead of checking `if (b < n)` inside the loop, we can use a while loop to ensure that the loop will stop when `b` is equal to or greater than `n`.
3. The string `t` can be read directly into the `cin` statement, no need to initialize it to an empty string.
4. Reserve memory for the string before input to avoid reallocation.
5. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to speed up I/O operations.
6. Use '\n' instead of `std::endl` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the buffer.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::string t;
    t.reserve(n);
    std::cin >> t;

    for (int i = 1, b = 0; b < n; i++, b += i) {
        std::cout << t[b];
    }
    std::cout << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should run faster and use less memory than the original program. The optimization is achieved by reducing the scope of variables, removing unnecessary checks, and speeding up I/O operations.
