The given code takes an input `n` (number of characters to be printed) and a string `t`. It then prints the characters of string `t` at intervals of increasing numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, ...). The loop executes `n` times, but the string may be printed less than `n` times due to the `if` condition (if `b` is less than `n`).

Optimization Steps:

1. The `b` variable is incremented by `i` (which ranges from `1` to `n`). After a few iterations, `b` will be greater than `n`, so the `if` condition will fail, and the rest of the iterations will be useless. We can break the loop when `b` reaches `n`.

2. The string `t` is initialized as an empty string before reading the input. This is not necessary. We can directly read the string input.

3. We should prefer '\n' over `std::endl` to avoid unnecessary overhead.

Optimized Program:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  string t;
  cin >> n >> t;
  int b = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    if (b < n) {
      cout << t[b];
      b += i;
    } else {
      break;
    }
  }
  cout << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized program, we've eliminated unnecessary loop iterations and cleaned up the code for readability and performance.
