The given program reads an integer 'n' and a string 't' from the input, then it prints every 'i'th character of 't', where 'i' ranges from 1 to 'n', using a variable 'b' as the index.

Here are a few optimization steps:

1. We can skip assigning an empty string to 't' at the beginning as 't' will be overwritten by the input string. This reduces memory usage.

2. We can optimize the loop by eliminating the need to check 'if (b < n)' in each iteration. As 'b' increases by 'i' in each iteration, we can stop the loop when 'b' reaches or exceeds 'n'.

3. Instead of outputting each character immediately with 'cout', we can append them to a string and output the string at the end. This reduces the number of I/O operations, which are generally slow.

Now, let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  string t;
  cin >> t;
  string output = "";
  for (int i = 1, b = 0; b < n; b += i, ++i) {
    output += t[b];
  }
  cout << output;
}
```

In this optimized program, we have reduced the number of I/O operations and eliminated unnecessary operations.
