The existing program does not have any severe performance issues, but there is room for minor improvements. The optimization can be done in a few steps:

1. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` after `using namespace std;` to unsynchronize C++ standard streams with their corresponding C streams. This can speed up I/O operations.

2. Use `std::cin.tie(NULL);` to untie cin from cout. Tied streams ensure that one stream is flushed automatically before each I/O operation on the other stream. In this case, we don't need to flush cout before each cin, so we can untie them.

3. Instead of checking `if (b < n)` in every iteration, we can stop the loop when `b >= n`. 

4. `b += i;` can lead to `b` being greater than `n` which would not be useful as it is only used as an index to string `t`, so we should break the loop when `b` exceeds `n`.

5. `cin >> t;` can be moved before `cin >> n;` to remove the need for initializing `string t = "";`.

Here is the updated code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  string t;
  int n;
  cin >> t >> n;

  int b = 0;
  for (int i = 1; b < n; i++) {
    cout << t[b];
    b += i;
    if (b >= n) break;
  }
}
```

Remember that these optimizations might not make a significant difference in running time or memory usage for smaller inputs, but can be beneficial for larger inputs or more complex programs.
