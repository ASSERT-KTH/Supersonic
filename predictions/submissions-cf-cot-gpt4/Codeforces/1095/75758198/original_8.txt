This program is a C++ program which takes an integer `n` and a string `t` as input, then prints every `i`th character of the string, where `i` increases from 1 to `n`.

The optimization in this program can be done in the following ways:

1. `std::endl` is a costly operation as it flushes the buffer every time it is called. Instead, we can replace it with "\n".

2. The condition `if (b < n)` can be eliminated if we control the loop in a way that `b` never exceeds `n`.

3. Instead of printing every character inside the loop, we can append them to a string and print it once after the loop. It will reduce the time spent on printing to the console.

4. We should use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(NULL)` to speed up cin and cout operations.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n;
  string t, result = "";
  cin >> n >> t;
  for (int i = 1, b = 0; b < n; b += i, i++) {
    result += t[b];
  }
  cout << result << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program should run faster and use less memory than the original program.
