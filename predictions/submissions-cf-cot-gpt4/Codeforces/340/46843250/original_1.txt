This is a fairly complex and large C++ program that utilizes many features of the language. Here are some steps we can take to optimize it:

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` statement is known to increase the compilation time significantly. It includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can replace it with specific headers that we need for this program.

2. The `sync` macro is used to sync the C++ and C streams. This operation is not needed in the `main()` function, so we can remove it, reducing unnecessary synchronization overhead.

3. The `q = 1; while (q--) Main();` loop in the `main()` function is not needed because it only runs once. We can directly call `Main()` without the loop.

4. In the `Main()` function, the `cin >> a[i];` operation is inside a loop which can slow down the program. We can use the `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` before the loop to speed up the input operation.

5. The `mod(ll n)` function is not used in the program, we can remove it.

6. The `pow(ll a, ll b)` function is not used in the program, we can remove it.

7. The `debug(x)` macro is not used in the program, we can remove it.

8. The `Sort(x)` macro is not used in the program, we can remove it.

9. The `Mn(x)` macro is not used in the program, we can remove it.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#define pb push_back
#define Mp make_pair
#define F first
#define S second
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define sz(x) x.size()
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef long double ld;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pll;
typedef vector<ll> vll;
typedef string str;
const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const ll MAXN = 1e5 + 300;
const ll MINN = 1e3 + 20;
const ll MOD2 = 998244353ll;
const ll INF = 74592896151251;
const ld EPS = 1e-9;
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) { return (b ? gcd(b, a % b) : a); }
ll a[MAXN];
multiset<ll> s;
int Main() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    auto it = s.lower_bound(a[i]);
    if (it != s.end())
      s.erase(it);
    s.insert(a[i]);
  }
  cout << sz(s);
}
int main() {
  Main();
  return 0;
}
```

By making these changes, we've improved the efficiency and readability of the program without altering its functionality.
