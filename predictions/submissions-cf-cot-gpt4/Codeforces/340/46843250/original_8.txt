The program you provided is already quite optimized. However, there are a few potential improvements that could be made.

Optimization Steps:

1. The function `pow(ll a, ll b)` calculates the power of `a` to the power `b`. But this function is not being used anywhere in the code, so it could be removed to reduce the memory footprint.

2. Similarly, the `gcd(ll a, ll b)` and `mod(ll n)` functions are not used anywhere in the code, they can be removed as well.

3. The constant `MINN` is not being used in the code, so it can be removed to reduce the memory footprint.

4. The constant `EPS` is not being used, so it can be removed as well.

5. The constant `MOD2` is not being used, so it can be removed.

6. Typedefs like `ld`, `pii`, `vi`, `pll`, `vll`, `str` are not being used in the code, so they can be removed.

7. The `debug(x)` macro is not being used, so it can be removed.

8. The `sync;` line in the main function is used to sync the C and C++ standard streams, which is not required in this program, so it can be removed.

9. The `q` variable in the main function is always set to 1 and the while loop only runs once, so it can be replaced by a simple function call to `Main()`.

10. The `Main()` function does not return a value which is not a good practice in C++. We can change `int Main()` to `void Main()` to reflect this.

Optimized Program:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define pb push_back
#define Mp make_pair
#define F first
#define S second
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define Sort(x) sort(all(x))
#define sz(x) x.size()
#define endl '\n'
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const ll MAXN = 1e5 + 300;
const ll INF = 74592896151251;
ll a[MAXN];
multiset<ll> s;
void Main() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    auto it = s.lower_bound(a[i]);
    if (it != s.end())
      s.erase(it);
    s.insert(a[i]);
  }
  cout << sz(s);
}
int main() {
  Main();
  return 0;
}
