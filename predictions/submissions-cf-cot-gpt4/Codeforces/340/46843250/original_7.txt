The code you have provided is a C++ program which is already quite optimized. However, there is some room for small improvements. 

1. `using namespace std;` is generally discouraged. It might lead to name collisions which are hard to debug. So, we will remove this line and use `std::` where necessary.

2. The function `pow(ll a, ll b)` is unused in the code. We remove it to save memory.

3. The `sync` macro, which is used to sync the C++ and C I/O and untie `cin` and `cout`, is used but not necessary in this specific program, and it might slow down the execution. We remove it.

4. The variables `MOD`, `MINN`, `MOD2`, `INF`, `EPS` are declared but never used. We remove them to save memory.

5. The `Main()` function is not returning any value which is not a good practice as this function is declared as int. We add `return 0;` at the end of the `Main()` function.

6. The `while` loop in `main()` function is unnecessary as it runs only once. We remove it.

Here is the optimized code:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define pb push_back
#define Mp make_pair
#define F first
#define S second
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define Sort(x) sort(all(x))
#define sz(x) x.size()
#define debug(x) cerr << #x << " = " << x << endl
#define endl '\n'
typedef long long ll;
typedef long double ld;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef std::vector<int> vi;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pll;
typedef std::vector<ll> vll;
typedef std::string str;
const ll MAXN = 1e5 + 300;
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) { return (b ? gcd(b, a % b) : a); }
ll mod(ll n) {
  while (n < 0)
    n += MOD;
  return n % MOD;
}
ll a[MAXN];
std::multiset<ll> s;
int Main() {
  ll n;
  std::cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> a[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    auto it = s.lower_bound(a[i]);
    if (it != s.end())
      s.erase(it);
    s.insert(a[i]);
  }
  std::cout << sz(s);
  return 0;
}
int main() {
  int q;
  q = 1;
  Main();
  return 0;
}
```
