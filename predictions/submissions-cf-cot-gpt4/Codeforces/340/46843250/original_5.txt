Optimization steps:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of files, and it increases the compilation time. It's better to include only what you need.

2. Avoid using `#define`: Although it makes the code shorter, it reduces readability and can lead to errors. It's better to use typed constants and functions.

3. Avoid using namespace std: This can lead to naming conflicts.

4. Avoid using global variables: It's better to pass them as function parameters.

5. Avoid using `sync;`: This line disables synchronization between C and C++ standard streams but it's not needed in your program.

6. Avoid using `while (q--)`: This line is unnecessary since `q` is always 1.

7. Modify the function `pow()`: The current implementation doesn't handle negative exponents and is not efficient for large exponents. It's better to use the built-in `pow()` function provided by C++.

8. Avoid using `multiset`: Multiset is used to store multiple elements. If the elements are unique, it's better to use `set`.

9. Use `auto` keyword for iterators: It makes code cleaner and easier to read.

10. Use `std::endl` carefully: `std::endl` inserts a newline character into the output buffer and flushes it. If performance is crucial and you don't need to flush the buffer, it's better to use `\n`.

Optimized Program:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <set>
#include <string>

using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::vector;
using std::set;
using std::string;
using std::pair;
using std::make_pair;

typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<ll> vll;
typedef string str;

const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const ll MAXN = 1e5 + 300;

ll mod(ll n) {
  while (n < 0)
    n += MOD;
  return n % MOD;
}

ll gcd(ll a, ll b) { return (b ? gcd(b, a % b) : a); }

int main() {
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  
  while (q--) {
    ll n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<ll> a(n);
    set<ll> s;
  
    for (ll& i : a)
      cin >> i;
  
    for (ll& i : a) {
      auto it = s.lower_bound(i);
      if (it != s.end())
        s.erase(it);
      s.insert(i);
    }
  
    cout << s.size() << '\n';
  }
  
  return 0;
}
