First, let's go through the code and analyze what can be optimized:

1. Unnecessary Macros: The macros defined at the top are not being used in the program, removing them will make the program more readable and might improve compilation time.

2. Includes: <bits/stdc++.h> is a header file that includes almost all standard library headers. It is not a good practice to include it as it might lead to longer compilation times. Instead, include only those headers that are actually needed.

3. Unnecessary Variables: There are several constants, typedefs, and variables declared that are not used in the program. Removing them makes the code cleaner and easier to read and might improve compilation time.

4. pow() function: The power function can be optimized. The current implementation uses recursive calls which can be expensive. Instead, we can use the standard library function pow() which is optimized.

5. sync in main(): ios::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0) is used to sync the C++ standard streams with their C counterparts. In this case, it is not necessary and can be removed.

6. The array 'a' is used to read the input, but we don't need to store all the input numbers. We can process each number as we read it, reducing the memory usage.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll n, num;
  cin >> n;
  multiset<ll> s;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> num;
    auto it = s.lower_bound(num);
    if (it != s.end())
      s.erase(it);
    s.insert(num);
  }
  cout << s.size();
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that I've removed the unused typedefs, constants, macros, headers, variables, and functions, and the array 'a'. I've also removed the unnecessary synchronization of standard IO streams.
