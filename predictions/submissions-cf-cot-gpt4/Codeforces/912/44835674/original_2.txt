This given code is a complex combination of multiple functionalities which include number theory algorithms, file I/O management, and usage of advanced data structures. It is already fairly optimized for its purpose so making large improvements on it is hard. However, there are a few minor adjustments that can be made to potentially improve the program's efficiency and readability:

1. Use Direct Library Inclusion: The current code uses `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` which includes all the standard libraries which is not recommended as it increases compilation time and makes the code less portable. We should only include the libraries that are being used in the code.

2. Avoid Global Variables: The code uses global variables (`maxN`, `p[]`, `n`, `A`, `B`) which could lead to higher memory usage and potential bugs. If possible, these should be limited to the scope where they are needed.

3. Simplify the prime function: Instead of checking divisibility up to `x-1`, we can simplify the `prime` function to check only up to the square root of `x` as any factor of a number `x` must be less than or equal to the square root of `x`.

4. Use chrono library for random seed: The current code uses a constant seed for `mt19937` generator which means the sequence generated will be the same every time the program is run. This might not be desirable in some situations.

Here is the optimized version of the given program:

Please note that the `gen_max_test` function and the code associated with `DBG` and `MY` are removed since they were not used in the main function. If they are used elsewhere, they should be kept.
