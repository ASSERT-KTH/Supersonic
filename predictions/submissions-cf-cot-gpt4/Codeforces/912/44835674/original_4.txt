This program seems to be an optimized solution to some specific problem, and it's already using a lot of optimization techniques such as binary search, divide-and-conquer, and the use of efficient data structures like vectors and ordered sets. However, there are still a few tweaks that can be made in the program to make it more efficient.

1. Function calls are expensive in terms of time as they involve pushing the current state to stack, jumping to function code and then returning back. In order to avoid this, you can inline the small functions defined in the code. Functions like `safe_mul`, `sqr` and `gen_all` can be inlined.

2. Using `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(NULL)` are good practices to speed up cin and cout, but only when you're not using any other C standard IO function. If you're using any other C standard IO function in your code, this practice will not speed up cin and cout, instead it will slow them down.

3. The use of `assert(cin)` in the function `rd()` is not necessary and can be removed. Assertions are generally used for debugging purpose and they can slow down the code because they add extra instructions to check if the condition is true or false.

4. Instead of using `std::endl`, you can use `"\n"` to print a newline. `std::endl` not only prints a newline but also flushes the output stream, which can slow down your program.

5. The `prime` function can be optimized. Currently, it checks divisibility until `x-1`, but actually, you only need to check it until the square root of `x`. This is because a larger factor of `x` must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.

6. The `gen_all` function is recursive, which could potentially lead to a stack overflow for large inputs. This can be avoided by using an iterative approach instead.

7. The variables `A` and `B` are globally defined vectors. However, they are only used in the main function. Hence, you can define them in the main function to limit their scope and lifetime, thereby saving memory.

Here is the optimized program after applying these modifications:
