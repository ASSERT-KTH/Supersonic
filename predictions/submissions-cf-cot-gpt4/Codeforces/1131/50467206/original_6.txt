In this program, the main optimization would be the way memory is used and the way data is accessed. There are some unnecessary vectors that can be removed and some calculations that can be simplified. Here are the key optimization steps:

1. We are creating vectors `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock` to store input data, but we are storing these values in the arrays `height` and `cost` afterwards. So we can eliminate these vectors and directly store the data in the arrays. This will reduce memory usage and also make the code cleaner.

2. In the calculation of dp[i], minLeft + cost[i] is calculated twice. We can store this value in a variable and reuse it, reducing computations.

3. The while loop that pops elements from the `stackPushRight` vector is unnecessary. The condition that the while loop checks (`idx + height[idx] - 1 < i`) can never be true because we are always pushing i into the vector, and i is always increasing.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define in cin
#define out cout

using ll = long long;

const int NMax = 1e7 + 5;

int height[NMax];
ll cost[NMax], dp[NMax];

int main() {
  int N, M;
  in >> N >> M;
  
  int curr = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    int K;
    in >> K;
    for (int j = 1; j <= K; ++j) {
      in >> height[++curr];
    }
    for (int j = 1; j <= K; ++j) {
      int c;
      in >> c;
      cost[curr-K+j] = 1LL * c;
    }
  }
  
  int Q;
  in >> Q;

  vector<pair<int, ll>> stackPushLeft, stackPushRight;
  for (int i = 1; i <= M; ++i) {
    ll minLeft = dp[i - 1];
    while (stackPushLeft.size() && i - height[i] + 1 <= stackPushLeft.back().first) {
      minLeft = min(minLeft, stackPushLeft.back().second);
      stackPushLeft.pop_back();
    }
    dp[i] = minLeft + cost[i];
    stackPushLeft.push_back({i, min(minLeft, dp[i - 1])});
    
    if (stackPushRight.size()) {
      dp[i] = min(dp[i], stackPushRight.back().second);
    }
    stackPushRight.push_back({i, min(dp[i - 1] + cost[i], stackPushRight.empty() ? dp[i - 1] + cost[i] : stackPushRight.back().second)});
  }
  out << dp[M] << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code will result in the same output as the initial program but with less memory usage and computations.
