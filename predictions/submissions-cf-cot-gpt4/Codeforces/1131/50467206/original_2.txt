Firstly, let's go over the potential optimizations that can be made to the code:

1. Unnecessary usage of `std::vector::clear()`: The `std::vector::clear()` function deallocates the memory occupied by the vector. However, in this case, the vectors `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock` will automatically be deallocated once the scope of the main function ends. So, the explicit `clear()` calls are unnecessary and can be removed to save time.

2. Redundant size checking during vector pop: Before popping an element from `stackPushLeft` or `stackPushRight`, the code checks if the vector is not empty. But this check is unnecessary because the while loop condition already ensures that the vector is not empty.

3. Avoiding unnecessary type casting: The code uses `(int)heightsOfBlock[id].size()` to get the size of the vector. However, it's better to store the size in a variable of the correct type (size_t) to avoid unnecessary type casting.

4. Unnecessary usage of the `std::vector::push_back()` function inside the loops: Instead of pushing each element into the vector one by one, we can use the `std::vector::insert()` function to add multiple elements at once. This can potentially save time.

Let's apply these optimizations to the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

//Same code...

int main() {
  int N, M;
  in >> N >> M;
  vector<vector<int>> heightsOfBlock(N + 1), costsOfBlock(N + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    int K;
    in >> K;
    heightsOfBlock[i].resize(K); //Resizing the vector instead of pushing back one by one
    costsOfBlock[i].resize(K);
    for (int j = 0; j < K; ++j) {
      in >> heightsOfBlock[i][j];
    }
    for (int j = 0; j < K; ++j) {
      in >> costsOfBlock[i][j];
    }
  }
  int Q, curr = 0;
  in >> Q;
  for (int i = 1; i <= Q; ++i) {
    int id, mult;
    in >> id >> mult;
    size_t blockSize = heightsOfBlock[id].size(); //Using size_t to store size
    for (size_t j = 0; j < blockSize; ++j) {
      height[++curr] = heightsOfBlock[id][j];
      cost[curr] = 1LL * mult * costsOfBlock[id][j];
    }
  }
  vector<pair<int, ll>> stackPushLeft, stackPushRight;
  for (int i = 1; i <= M; ++i) {
    ll minLeft = dp[i - 1];
    while (!stackPushLeft.empty() && i - height[i] + 1 <= stackPushLeft.back().first) {
      minLeft = min(minLeft, stackPushLeft.back().second);
      stackPushLeft.pop_back();
    }
    dp[i] = minLeft + cost[i];
    ll valHere = dp[i - 1];
    minLeft = min(minLeft, valHere);
    stackPushLeft.push_back({i, minLeft});
    int idx = -1;
    while (!stackPushRight.empty() && ((idx = stackPushRight.back().first) || true) && idx + height[idx] - 1 < i) {
      stackPushRight.pop_back();
    }
    if (!stackPushRight.empty()) {
      ll dpPlusCost = stackPushRight.back().second;
      dp[i] = min(dp[i], dpPlusCost);
    }
    ll dpPlusCost = dp[i - 1] + cost[i];
    if (!stackPushRight.empty()) {
      dpPlusCost = min(dpPlusCost, stackPushRight.back().second);
    }
    stackPushRight.push_back({i, dpPlusCost});
  }
  out << dp[M] << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
