This code already utilizes several optimization techniques such as using preprocessor directives, long long int for large numbers, usage of vectors and pair for efficient memory utilization. However, there are a few modifications we can make to further optimize this code.

Optimization Steps:
1. The code uses a lot of vectors and pairs, which allocate memory dynamically. These dynamic memory allocations and deallocations can be costly in terms of time. We can try to minimize the usage of dynamic memory allocation. As the size of heightsOfBlock and costsOfBlock is not known in advance, we still need to use vectors. But, we can reserve the size of vectors in advance to avoid reallocation of memory.

2. The global array height, cost, and dp are initialized with a size of NMax (1e7 + 5). If N is much smaller than NMax, then this can result in unnecessary memory allocation. We can move these arrays inside the main function and allocate memory dynamically based on N.

3. The code uses int for loop variables and indices. We can use size_t instead of int for loop variables and indices which will help in avoiding the conversion from size_t (return type of size()) to int, which can potentially improve the performance slightly.

4. While checking the size of stackPushLeft and stackPushRight, size() function is used. The size function returns the number of elements present in the vector which might be costly in terms of time. Instead, we can use the empty() function to check if the vector is empty or not.

5. In the inner loop, the cost is calculated for each id by multiplying mult with c. This can be optimized by calculating the cost once outside the loop and using it inside the loop.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define pb push_back
using ll = long long;
using pii = pair<int, int>;

int main() {
  int N, M;
  cin >> N >> M;

  vector<vector<int>> heightsOfBlock(N + 1), costsOfBlock(N + 1);
  vector<int> height(N + 1);
  vector<ll> cost(N + 1), dp(N + 1);

  for (size_t i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    int K;
    cin >> K;
    heightsOfBlock[i].reserve(K);
    costsOfBlock[i].reserve(K);
    for (size_t j = 1; j <= K; ++j) {
      int val;
      cin >> val;
      heightsOfBlock[i].pb(val);
    }
    for (size_t j = 1; j <= K; ++j) {
      int val;
      cin >> val;
      costsOfBlock[i].pb(val);
    }
  }

  int Q, curr = 0;
  cin >> Q;
  for (size_t i = 1; i <= Q; ++i) {
    int id, mult;
    cin >> id >> mult;
    for (size_t j = 0; j < heightsOfBlock[id].size(); ++j) {
      int h = heightsOfBlock[id][j];
      ll c = 1LL * mult * costsOfBlock[id][j];
      height[++curr] = h;
      cost[curr] = c;
    }
  }

  vector<pair<int, ll>> stackPushLeft, stackPushRight;
  for (size_t i = 1; i <= M; ++i) {
    ll minLeft = dp[i - 1];
    while (!stackPushLeft.empty() &&
           i - height[i] + 1 <= stackPushLeft.back().first) {
      minLeft = min(minLeft, stackPushLeft.back().second);
      stackPushLeft.pop_back();
    }
    dp[i] = minLeft + cost[i];
    ll valHere = dp[i - 1];
    minLeft = min(minLeft, valHere);
    stackPushLeft.push_back({i, minLeft});

    int idx = -1;
    while (!stackPushRight.empty() &&
           ((idx = stackPushRight.back().first) || true) &&
           idx + height[idx] - 1 < i) {
      stackPushRight.pop_back();
    }
    if (!stackPushRight.empty()) {
      ll dpPlusCost = stackPushRight.back().second;
      dp[i] = min(dp[i], dpPlusCost);
    }
    ll dpPlusCost = dp[i - 1] + cost[i];
    if (!stackPushRight.empty()) {
      dpPlusCost = min(dpPlusCost, stackPushRight.back().second);
    }
    stackPushRight.push_back({i, dpPlusCost});
  }

  cout << dp[M] << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The optimized code may still have room for improvement, and the effectiveness of these optimizations can vary depending on the specific hardware and compiler optimizations.
