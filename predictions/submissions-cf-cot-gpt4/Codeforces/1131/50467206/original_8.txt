The given code has a few areas where we can optimize it for better performance.

1. **Avoiding unnecessary calculations**: In the loop where we calculate `minLeft`, we are repeatedly calculating `minLeft` even when the condition in the while loop is not satisfied. This can be avoided by moving the `minLeft` calculation inside the while loop.

2. **Avoiding redundant size calculations**: We are repeatedly calling `stackPushLeft.size()` and `stackPushRight.size()`. It's better to calculate the size once and use it in the loop.

3. **Avoiding repeated array access**: In the loop where we process `stackPushRight`, we access `stackPushRight.back()` multiple times. We can store it in a variable before the loop and use it inside the loop.

4. **Avoiding vector.clear()**: Using vector.clear() does not actually reduce the memory footprint of the program, it just resets the size of the vector to zero but the capacity remains the same. So, it's better to avoid `heightsOfBlock.clear()` and `costsOfBlock.clear()` if not necessary.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
...
int main() {
  ...
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    ...
  }
  int Q, curr = 0;
  in >> Q;
  for (int i = 1; i <= Q; ++i) {
    ...
  }
  vector<pair<int, ll>> stackPushLeft, stackPushRight;
  for (int i = 1; i <= M; ++i) {
    ll minLeft = dp[i - 1];
    int stackPushLeftSize = stackPushLeft.size();
    while (stackPushLeftSize &&
           i - height[i] + 1 <= stackPushLeft.back().first) {
      minLeft = min(minLeft, stackPushLeft.back().second);
      stackPushLeft.pop_back();
      stackPushLeftSize--;
    }
    dp[i] = minLeft + cost[i];
    ll valHere = dp[i - 1];
    minLeft = min(minLeft, valHere);
    stackPushLeft.push_back({i, minLeft});
    int idx = -1;
    int stackPushRightSize = stackPushRight.size();
    while (stackPushRightSize &&
           ((idx = stackPushRight.back().first) || true) &&
           idx + height[idx] - 1 < i) {
      stackPushRight.pop_back();
      stackPushRightSize--;
    }
    if (stackPushRightSize) {
      ll dpPlusCost = stackPushRight.back().second;
      dp[i] = min(dp[i], dpPlusCost);
    }
    ll dpPlusCost = dp[i - 1] + cost[i];
    if (stackPushRightSize) {
      dpPlusCost = min(dpPlusCost, stackPushRight.back().second);
    }
    stackPushRight.push_back({i, dpPlusCost});
  }
  out << dp[M] << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program reduces the unnecessary calculations and redundant size calculations which should make the program run faster. It also avoids redundant array access which can help to reduce memory usage.
