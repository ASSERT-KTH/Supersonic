The given program can be optimized mainly in two ways:

1. Avoid unnecessary string comparisons: In the second for loop, the program is iterating over the entire vector 'v' to find a match for each input string 'z'. This can lead to unnecessary string comparisons, especially when 'z' is not present in 'v'. A more efficient approach would be to directly look up 'z' in the map 'mp'. If 'z' is found in 'mp', this means 'z' is also present in 'v'. The advantage of this method is that map lookup operation is much faster (O(log(n)) in c++) than iterating over a vector (which is an O(n) operation).

2. Minimize the use of std::endl: std::endl not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output stream, which can be a costly operation if done repeatedly. So instead of using std::endl, we can just output a newline character ('\n') directly when needed. We can also create a string stream (std::stringstream) to store the output, and only output the entire string at the end of the program, which can further optimize the program's running time.

Here's the optimized version of the program according to these points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // Speed up cin/cout by disabling synchronization with C stdio
  cin.tie(NULL); // Untie cin from cout to prevent unnecessary flushes

  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  map<string, string> mp;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    string x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    if (x.length() <= y.length()) {
      mp[x] = x;
    } else {
      mp[x] = y;
    }
  }

  stringstream ss; // Create a string stream to store the output
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string z;
    cin >> z;
    auto it = mp.find(z); // Look up z in the map 'mp'
    if (it != mp.end()) { // If z is found in 'mp'
      ss << it->second << " "; // Add the corresponding value to the string stream
    }
  }

  cout << ss.str() << "\n"; // Output the entire string at the end
  return 0;
}
```
