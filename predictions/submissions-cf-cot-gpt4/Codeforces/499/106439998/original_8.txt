The given program could be optimized in the following ways:

1. **Using unordered_map instead of map**: In C++, std::map is implemented as a balanced tree and gives O(logN) time complexity for operations like insert, delete, and search. On the other hand, std::unordered_map is implemented as a hash table and gives O(1) time complexity for these operations on average. So, using an unordered_map can reduce the time complexity of the operations.

2. **Removing unnecessary for loop for searching**: In the original code, a for loop is used to search through the vector v for a matching string, and then the matching string is used to access its corresponding value in the map. This is not necessary as you can directly access the value of a key in the map in O(1) time complexity. So, this for loop could be removed.

3. **Avoid using 'bits/stdc++.h'**: This header file includes quite a lot of files, and it is not a standard C++ header. This increases compile time, and it's better to include only what you need.

4. **The continue keyword is unnecessary**: The continue keyword is unnecessary in the last else statement, removing it would clean up the code slightly as it will continue the loop anyways.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    unordered_map<string, string> mp;
    vector<string> v(m);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        string x, y;
        cin >> x >> y;
        if (x.length() <= y.length()) {
            mp[x] = x;
        } else {
            mp[x] = y;
        }
        v[i] = x;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        string z;
        cin >> z;
        if (mp.find(z) != mp.end()) {
            cout << mp[z] << " ";
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This optimized version of the program reduces the time complexity of some operations from O(logN) to O(1) by using an unordered_map instead of a map, and removes an unnecessary for loop which was used to search through the vector for a matching string. It also avoids including unnecessary header files and removes an unnecessary continue keyword, making the code cleaner and more efficient.
