The main optimization can be made by avoiding the second loop over the vector 'v' and directly accessing the values in the map 'mp'. The map 'mp' is designed to give us constant time access to its elements, so we should make use of this feature. In the current implementation, for every input string 'z', we are iterating over the entire vector 'v'. If 'n' and 'm' are large, this could lead to a significant time complexity of O(n*m).

Step by step optimization:

1. We can remove the second loop over vector 'v' and directly access the values in the map 'mp' using 'mp[z]' for any string 'z'. This would reduce the time complexity significantly.

2. We can remove the else-continue part in the inner loop. This is unnecessary as the loop will automatically continue to the next iteration if the if-condition is not met.

3. We can directly use 'auto&' instead of 'auto' in the loop to avoid unnecessary copying of strings.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  map<string, string> mp;

  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    string x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    if (x.length() <= y.length()) {
      mp[x] = x;
    } else {
      mp[x] = y;
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string z;
    cin >> z;
    cout << mp[z] << " ";
  }

  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program is optimized for both running time and memory usage. The time complexity is now O(n+m) and we have also reduced the memory usage by removing the vector 'v'.
