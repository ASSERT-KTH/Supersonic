Here are the optimization steps:

1. The loop that checks if the inputted string is in the vector and maps it to its output is inefficient. It's a O(n) operation where n is the size of the vector. This can be replaced with a single map lookup, which is a O(log n) operation. So, the second part of the program can be optimized by directly using the map to find the corresponding shorter string.

2. The 'else { continue; }' part is not necessary. If 'if' condition is not met, the loop will continue to the next iteration anyway.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  map<string, string> mp;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    string x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    if (x.length() <= y.length()) {
      mp[x] = x;
    } else {
      mp[x] = y;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string z;
    cin >> z;
    cout << mp[z] << " ";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, the vector `v` is removed because it was just duplicating the keys of the map `mp`. The lookup in the map is faster and uses less memory.
