This program seems to take a set of string mappings (with preference to the shorter string), and then for a given set of strings, it looks up the value in the map and prints it. 

1. Optimization of input and output (cin and cout): 
We can use the fast input and output in C++ which is achieved by tying the NULL to cin and cout, and using '\n' instead of endl.

2. Unnecessary loop removal:
In the second loop, it is iterating through each element of the vector v for each input string z. This is unnecessary. Instead, we can directly look up the string z in the map. This reduces the time complexity from O(n*m) to O(n*log(m)).

3. Memory Usage:
To decrease the memory usage, it's better to not store the strings in the vector v. It is unnecessary to store the strings in vector v, as we can directly look up the string in the map.

4. Unnecessary use of else continue:
There is no need for the else continue statement, as if the condition is not met, the loop automatically continues.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    
    map<string, string> mp;

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        string x, y;
        cin >> x >> y;
        
        if (x.length() <= y.length()) {
            mp[x] = x;
        } else {
            mp[x] = y;
        }
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        string z;
        cin >> z;
        
        cout << mp[z] << " ";
    }
    cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```
