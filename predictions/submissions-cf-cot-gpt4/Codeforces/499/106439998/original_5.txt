The given C++ program seems to be a dictionary type program which maps certain strings to others based on their lengths. It reads in a certain number of mappings, stores them and then uses the stored mappings to output the mapped strings for the given inputs.

Here are the possible optimizations:

1. **Avoiding the use of** `bits/stdc++.h`: This header file includes quite a lot of standard library headers which we may not need in our program. It's generally a bad practice to include this file because it increases the compilation time. We should include only those headers which we are using in our program.

2. **Avoiding unnecessary checks and loops**: In the second loop, the program is iterating through the vector `v` to find the key `z` in the map. This is unnecessary because map data structure in C++ is implemented as a balanced binary search tree and it can find a key in O(log n) time. We don't need to iterate over the vector `v` to find the key.

3. **Use '\n' instead of ' ' for cout**: Using '\n' is faster than using ' ' because '\n' does not cause a flush of the stream while ' ' does. Flushing the stream means emptying the output buffer which can be a time-consuming operation if performed after every output statement.

Let's apply these optimizations to the given program.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  map<string, string> mp;
  vector<string> v(n);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    string x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    if (x.length() <= y.length()) {
      mp[x] = x;
    } else {
      mp[x] = y;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << mp[v[i]] << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program now includes only necessary headers, avoids unnecessary loops and checks, and uses efficient output flushing. This will lead to a significant improvement in both time and space complexity.
