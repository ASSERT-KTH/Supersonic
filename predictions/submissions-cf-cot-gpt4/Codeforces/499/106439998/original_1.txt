1. The first optimization is to use `unordered_map` instead of `map` as the former has an average time complexity of O(1) for search, insert, and delete operations, compared to O(logN) of the latter. This will help in reducing the running time of the program.

2. The second optimization is to eliminate the unnecessary `else` clause in the loop where we're looking for a string in the vector `v`. The `continue` statement is unnecessary because if the `if` condition isn't met, the loop will naturally continue to the next iteration.

3. The third optimization is the removal of the inner loop that searches for each input string in the vector `v`. This is unnecessary because we can directly check if the input string is present in the map or not. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n*m) to O(n), where n is the number of input strings and m is the size of the map.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  unordered_map<string, string> mp;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    string x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    if (x.length() <= y.length()) {
      mp[x] = x;
    } else {
      mp[x] = y;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string z;
    cin >> z;
    if (mp.find(z) != mp.end()) {
        cout << mp[z] << " ";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The above optimizations can significantly improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
