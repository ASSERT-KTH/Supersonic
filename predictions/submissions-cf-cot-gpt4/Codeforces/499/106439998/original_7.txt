The main optimization steps are:

1. **Avoid searching in the vector for each input string:** In the original program, for each input string, we are doing a linear search in the vector. We can avoid this by using the map itself. The map in C++ is implemented as a Red-Black tree and has a logarithmic time complexity for searching. It is a lot faster compared to the linear search in the vector.

2. **Avoid using "bits/stdc++.h" header:** This header file includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which increases the compilation time. We should include only those headers which are being used in the program.

3. **Avoid using "using namespace std" statement:** It might lead to name collision, as it imports all symbols from the std namespace into the global namespace.

4. **Remove redundant "else" and "continue" statements:** The "else" and "continue" statements in the for loop are not needed. The loop will automatically continue to the next iteration if the condition in the if statement is not met.

5. **Use "\n" instead of endl:** The endl causes a flush operation, which can be relatively expensive in terms of time. If you don't need to flush the buffer immediately, using "\n" is more efficient.

After applying the above optimization steps, the optimized program is:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main() {
    int n, m;
    std::cin >> n >> m;
    std::map<std::string, std::string> mp;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        std::string x, y;
        std::cin >> x >> y;
        if (x.length() <= y.length()) {
            mp[x] = x;
        } else {
            mp[x] = y;
        }
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::string z;
        std::cin >> z;
        std::cout << mp[z] << " ";
    }
    
    std::cout << "\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

This program will have a lower running time and memory usage compared to the original one.
