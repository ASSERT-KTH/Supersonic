The given C++ program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Reduce unnecessary use of `std::vector`:
   In the given code, a vector is used to store the keys of the map. However, every time we want to print the shorter version of a string, we iterate over the vector to match the string and then use the matched string to index into the map. This results in a time complexity of O(n*m). This can be avoided by directly using the map to find the shorter version of the string which results in a time complexity of O(log m) which is much more efficient.

2. Avoid unnecessary `else`:
   In the loop where we are trying to match the string, there is an unnecessary `else` block that continues the loop. This is not required as a loop will automatically continue if it doesn't break.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  map<string, string> mp;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    string x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    if (x.length() <= y.length()) {
      mp[x] = x;
    } else {
      mp[x] = y;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string z;
    cin >> z;
    cout << mp[z] << " ";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Remember to compile this code with `-std=c++11` or higher, as the code uses features introduced in C++11.
