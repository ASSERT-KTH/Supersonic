The main goal of the program is to check if the given string `s` of length `n` contains all the 26 alphabets or not. The program creates a map to keep track of the frequency of each character in the string. If all 26 alphabets are present in the string, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. **Remove unused libraries**: The program includes a lot of libraries that are not used in the program. Removing them will reduce the load time of the program.

2. **Remove unused macros**: The program defines a lot of macros that are not used in the program. Removing them will make the program cleaner.

3. **Remove duplicate conversions**: The program converts each character of the string to lowercase twice: once before inserting it into the map and once when checking the map. We can optimize this by converting it to lowercase only once. 

4. **Avoid unnecessary map checks**: The program checks the map for each character. Instead, we can stop as soon as we know that all 26 alphabets are present in the string. 

5. **Remove unused functions and macros**: Functions like `isprime`, `open`, `Adnan`, macros for `gcd`, `lcm`, `my_sizeof`, `watch`, `all`, `per`, `rep`, `ppr`, `sz`, `vec`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `pi` are not used in the program. Removing them will make the program cleaner.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <cctype>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  string s;
  int n;
  cin >> n >> s;
  
  map<char, int> mp;
  for (char c : s) {
    mp[tolower(c)]++;
    if(mp.size() == 26)
      break;
  }
  
  if (mp.size() == 26)
    cout << "YES";
  else
    cout << "NO";
}
```

The optimized program is more concise and efficient. It only includes necessary libraries and removes unused functionalities. It also avoids unnecessary operations by checking if all characters are present as soon as possible.
