The given C++ program checks if a string contains all the alphabets at least once.

Optimization Steps:

1. Unnecessary Macros: The program has a lot of preprocessor macros, many of which are not being used. These can be removed to reduce the memory footprint of the program.

2. Unnecessary Functions: The program contains functions like gcd, lcm, and isprime, which are not being used. These can be removed.

3. Redundant Code: The conversion of each character to lowercase and the mapping of each character in the string can be merged into a single loop.

4. Efficient Character Checking: Instead of using a map to keep track of the characters, we can use a simple integer array of size 26. Each index of the array represents a character (index 0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', and so on). This reduces memory usage and provides constant-time access.

5. Reducing Count: Instead of iterating through the entire map or array to count the number of characters, we can maintain a counter that increments each time we encounter a new character.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cctype>
using namespace std;

void open() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
}

void Adnan() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
}

int main() {
  open(), Adnan();
  string s;
  int n, c = 0, charCount[26] = {0};
  cin >> n >> s;
  for(char& ch: s) {
    ch = tolower(ch);
    if(!charCount[ch - 'a']) {
      charCount[ch - 'a']++;
      c++;
    }
  }
  if (c == 26)
    cout << "YES";
  else
    cout << "NO";
}
```
