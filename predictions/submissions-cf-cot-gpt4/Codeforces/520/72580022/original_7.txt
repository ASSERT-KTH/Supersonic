This program checks if a given string contains all the letters of the alphabet. It does this by converting each character to lowercase, counting the occurrence of each character in a map and finally checking if the map contains 26 unique keys, which corresponds to 26 letters in the alphabet.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove unused headers, macros, and functions: The program includes a lot of libraries, macros, and functions that are not actually used. Removing them will make the code cleaner and faster to compile.

2. Use an array instead of a map: The map in this program is used to count the occurrence of each character. However, since there are only 26 possible characters, we can use an array of size 26 instead. This will be faster and use less memory than a map.

3. Use a boolean array instead of a counter: Instead of incrementing the count for each character and then checking if each character has a count of at least 1, we can use a boolean array to mark if a character has appeared or not. This way, we only need to check the boolean array to determine if all characters have appeared.

4. Skip non-alphabet characters: The current program will also count non-alphabet characters. We can skip these to reduce the amount of work.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;

void Adnan() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
}

int main() {
  Adnan();
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  bool appeared[26] = {false};
  for (char c : s) {
    if (isalpha(c)) {
      appeared[tolower(c) - 'a'] = true;
    }
  }
  for (bool has_appeared : appeared) {
    if (!has_appeared) {
      cout << "NO";
      return 0;
    }
  }
  cout << "YES";
}
```
This program is simpler and more efficient than the original one. It only includes the necessary libraries and uses an array instead of a map, which significantly reduces memory usage and improves runtime.
