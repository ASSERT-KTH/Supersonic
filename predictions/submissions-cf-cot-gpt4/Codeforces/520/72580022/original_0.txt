Here are some steps to optimize this C/C++ program.

1. Remove unnecessary macro definitions and headers: The C/C++ program has some unnecessary macro definitions and headers that are not used in the program. These include `#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS`, `#include <algorithm>`, `#include <cmath>`, `#include <cstdio>`, `#include <cstdlib>`, `#include <ctime>`, `#include <deque>`, `#include <iomanip>`, `#include <queue>`, `#include <set>`, `#include <stack>`, `#include <stdexcept>`, `#include <stdlib.h>`, `#include <string>`, `#include <vector>`, and some macro definitions. Removing these can reduce the memory usage of the program.

2. Remove unused functions and function calls: The C/C++ program has some unused functions such as `bool isprime(ll n)`, `void open()`, and `void Adnan()`. These functions are not called in the `main()` function, so you can remove these to reduce the memory usage of the program.

3. Optimize `for` loop in `main()` function: In the `main()` function, you iterate over the entire string `s` to convert each character to lowercase and then count its occurrences. You can optimize this by checking and counting the lowercase version of each character in the same iteration, which can reduce the running time of the program.

4. Remove unnecessary condition in `main()` function: In the `main()` function, you check if the count of each character is greater than or equal to 1. Since you increment the count of each character when it is found in the string, this condition is always true. So you can remove this condition to reduce the running time of the program.

Now, here is the optimized C/C++ program based on the above steps.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string s;
  int n, c = 0;
  cin >> n >> s;
  map<char, int> mp;
  for (char ch : s) {
    ch = tolower(ch);
    mp[ch]++;
  }
  c = mp.size();
  if (c == 26)
    cout << "YES";
  else
    cout << "NO";
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program has less memory usage and running time than the original program.
