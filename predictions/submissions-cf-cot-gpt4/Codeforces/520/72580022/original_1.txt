The given C/C++ code is checking whether the input string contains all the alphabets or not. 

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary include files: The code has a lot of include files that are unused. Removing them will reduce the overall memory footprint of the code.

2. Remove redundant and unused macros: There are a lot of macros defined in the program that are not used anywhere. Removing them will make the code cleaner and slightly faster, as the preprocessor doesn't have to replace those macros in the code.

3. Optimize the map usage: Instead of using a map to count the occurrences of each alphabet, we can use an integer array of size 26 (as there are 26 alphabets). This will largely speed up the counting process because array access is much faster than map access. 

4. Remove unnecessary function `open()`: The function `open()` is used for redirecting the standard input and output to files. This is often used for testing and debugging purposes and is not needed in the final version of the program.

5. Remove unnecessary function `Adnan()`: This function is used to speed up cin and cout, but in this code, cin and cout are used only a few times. The performance gain from this function will be negligible. 

6. Remove `s[i] = tolower(s[i])`: This line is unnecessary because we are already considering uppercase and lowercase letters as the same.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string s;
  int n;
  cin >> n >> s;
  vector<int> count(26, 0);
  for(char c : s) {
    c = tolower(c);
    count[c - 'a']++;
  }

  for (int i : count) {
    if (i == 0) {
      cout << "NO";
      return 0;
    }
  }
  cout << "YES";
  return 0;
}
```
This code does the same thing as the original one, but it's simpler, cleaner, and faster. It counts the occurrences of each alphabet in the string and then checks if all alphabets are present.
