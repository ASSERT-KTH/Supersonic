Looking at the given code, there are several areas in which we can optimize the code for improved performance and memory usage.

1. The `isprime` function is not used at all, so we can remove it.

2. The `open()` function is only required for local debugging. We can remove it.

3. The `Adnan()` function is used to optimize the I/O operations. However, it is not recommended to mix `scanf/printf` with `cin/cout` in the same program. Since we are only using `cin/cout` in the main function, this operation is needed.

4. The `map<char, int> mp` is used to count the frequency of each character in the string. Instead of a map, we can use an array of 26 elements, each corresponding to a character from 'a' to 'z'. This will improve the memory usage and access time.

5. The 'tolower' function can be directly applied in the loop where we are incrementing the count of each character.

6. The loop to check if all characters are present can be simplified by initializing 'c' to 26 and decreasing it each time a character is not present.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
#include <deque>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#define endl "\n"
using namespace std;

void optimizeIO() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
}

int main() {
  optimizeIO();
  string s;
  int n, c = 26;
  cin >> n >> s;
  vector<int> freq(26, 0);
  for (char ch : s) {
    freq[tolower(ch) - 'a']++;
  }
  for (int i : freq) {
    if (i == 0)
      c--;
  }
  if (c == 26)
    cout << "YES";
  else
    cout << "NO";
}
```

This code is much simpler and efficient than the previous one. It uses less memory and should run faster. It also removes unnecessary functions and operations.
