This program is designed to check whether a string contains all the alphabets or not. Here are few steps to optimize it:

1. The first thing you should do is remove unnecessary headers. This program doesn't need all those headers, removing them will save the time taken by the compiler to process them.

2. The macro definitions are unnecessary complicated and some are not used. We will remove all unnecessary macro definitions.

3. The `isprime` function is not being used, so we will remove it.

4. The `open` and `Adnan` functions are just used once in the main function. We can move the functionality directly into the main function to avoid function call overhead.

5. Instead of using both the `cin` and `scanf` functions to take input, It is better to stick with one method. Here, we will stick with the `cin` method.

6. The existing algorithm uses a map to store the frequency count of each character, then iterates through the map to count the characters with frequency more than 1. This is not very efficient. We can use a set to store the unique characters and then check the size of the set. If the size is 26, then the string contains all the alphabets.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
    freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
    freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif

    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int n;
    string s;
    cin >> n >> s;
    
    set<char> unique_chars;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        unique_chars.insert(tolower(s[i]));
    }
    
    if (unique_chars.size() == 26)
        cout << "YES";
    else
        cout << "NO";
    return 0;
}
```
