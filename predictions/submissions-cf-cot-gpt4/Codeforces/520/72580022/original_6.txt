The main optimization in this program is to reduce the unnecessary use of map which has a time complexity of O(logN) for insertion and access. We can use an array instead of a map to store the frequency of the characters, which will reduce the time complexity to O(1) for both insertion and access. 

Also, we don't need to convert each character to lower case one by one, we can directly put the entire string to lower case at once.

Lastly, we don't need to count the frequency of each character. Since we know that there are 26 alphabets, we can directly check if each alphabet is present in the string or not.

Here is the optimized code based on above mentioned changes:

#define endl "\n"
using namespace std;

void open() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
}

void Adnan() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
}

int main() {
  open(), Adnan();
  string s;
  int n, c = 0;
  cin >> n >> s;
  transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), ::tolower);
  vector<bool> alpha(26, false);
  for (char ch : s) {
    alpha[ch - 'a'] = true;
  }
  for (bool exists : alpha) {
    if (exists)
      c++;
  }
  if (c == 26)
    cout << "YES";
  else
    cout << "NO";
}
```
