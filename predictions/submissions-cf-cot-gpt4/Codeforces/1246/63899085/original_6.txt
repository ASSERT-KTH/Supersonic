This program is pretty optimized, but there are a few things we can tweak:

1. Avoid `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: It's a heavy header that includes a lot of unnecessary things and increases compilation time. Instead, include only the headers you actually use in your program (`iostream`, `map`, `vector`, `cmath`, etc.).

2. Use the pre-increment operator (++i) over the post-increment operator (i++): Pre-increment avoids unnecessary temporary object creation and is generally more efficient.

3. Reuse temporary objects: For instance, in the `factorize()` function, the same map iterator 'it' is being created multiple times. Instead, we can create it once outside the loop and reuse it.

4. In the `Miller_Rabin()` function, the array 'arr' is constant and doesn't change throughout the program. This array can be declared as a global constant to avoid re-creation every time the function is called.

5. Using 'scanf' and 'printf' for I/O operations is faster than using 'cin' and 'cout'. So there's no need to change that.

Here's the optimized program:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;
const int arr[12] = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37};
...
void factorize(long long n, map<long long, int> &cnt, int c = 107) {
  if (n == 1)
    return;
  if (Miller_Rabin(n)) {
    cnt[n]++;
    return;
  }
  long long p = n;
  while (p >= n)
    p = Pollard_rho(p, c--);
  auto it = cnt.find(p);
  if (it != cnt.end())
    it->second++;
  else
    cnt.insert({p, 1});
  factorize(n / p, cnt, c);
}
...
void dfs(map<long long, int>::iterator it, long long val) {
  map<long long, int>::iterator nit;
  for (int i = 0; i <= it->second; ++i) {
    nit = it;
    dfs(++nit, val);
    val *= it->first;
  }
}
...
int main() {
...
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
  ...
  }
  printf("%lld\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the changes in the already efficient code might not yield a significant performance improvement. Also, the improvement might vary depending on the specific compiler and machine.
