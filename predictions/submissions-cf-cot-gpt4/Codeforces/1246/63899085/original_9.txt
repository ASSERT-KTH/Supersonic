This is a pretty complex C++ program to optimize. It involves several number theory algorithms such as Miller-Rabin, Pollard rho, and a method to factorize a number. 

Here are some possible optimizations:

1. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with specific libraries. `bits/stdc++.h` is not a standard library and it includes practically everything, which can slow down compilation time significantly. You should only include the libraries you actually need, such as `<stdio.h>`, `<map>`, `<vector>`, or `<stdlib.h>`.

2. Modify the `mul` function to use fast multiplication under the modulo operation, which can be achieved by using built-in multiplication function (__int128) in some compilers. This can significantly reduce the time complexity of multiplication.

3. Modify the `pow` function to use the built-in `pow` function from `<cmath>` library for better performance.

4. Avoid using `long long` where `int` is sufficient. `long long` uses more memory than `int` and can slow down the program.

5. Use array instead of `map` for `cnt`. Maps in C++ are implemented as Red-Black Trees, which have a time complexity of O(log n) for insertion and access. If the keys are simple integers, as in this case, an array can be more efficient, with a time complexity of O(1) for insertion and access.

Here is the modified version of the program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <map>
#include <vector>
#include <stdlib.h>

using namespace std;

long long gcd(long long a, long long b) {
  if (b == 0)
    return a;
  return gcd(b, a % b);
}

long long mul(long long a, long long b, long long mod) {
  return ((__int128)a * b) % mod;
}

long long pow(long long a, long long b, long long mod) {
  return (long long)std::pow(a, b) % mod;
}

int cnt[100005];

// ... rest of the code remains the same
```

Please note that depending on the compiler you are using, some of these optimizations may not work. For example, __int128 is a GNU extension and is not available on all compilers. Similarly, the built-in pow function may not always be faster due to potential overhead associated with function calls. Always test your optimizations to ensure they are actually improving performance.
