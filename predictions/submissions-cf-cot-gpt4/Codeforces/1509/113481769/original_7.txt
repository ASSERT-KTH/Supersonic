Here are the optimization steps:

1. The first optimization is to remove the `#include<bits/stdc++.h>` directive. This is a non-standard header file, and including it can significantly increase compilation time because it includes all the standard library headers at once.

2. We can use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` to decouple the C and C++ standard streams. This can make I/O operations faster. However, this also means that you can't mix C and C++ style I/O in your program.

3. `cin.tie(0);` and `cout.tie(0);` are used to untie `cin` and `cout` from each other. This can speed up I/O operations, but it also means that you can't mix input and output operations on `cin` and `cout` in an undefined order.

4. Rather than using a macro for a loop, we can use the range-based for loop provided by C++. This makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.

5. Dynamic array `int arr[n];` is not standard in C++. Instead, we should use `std::vector<int>`.

6. Instead of using two vectors to store the odd and even numbers separately, we can store all numbers in one vector and sort it. This will reduce memory usage. 

7. We can directly output the numbers after deciding whether they are odd or even, to avoid storing them in vectors, which will reduce memory usage.

The optimized program is:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> arr(n);
    for (int& num : arr) {
        cin >> num;
    }
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end(), [](int a, int b) {
        return a % 2 != b % 2 ? a % 2 > b % 2 : a < b;
    });
    for (const int& num : arr) {
        cout << num << ' ';
    }
    cout << '\n';
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```
In the optimized program, we sort the number array according to whether the number is odd or even. If the numbers are both odd or both even, we sort them in ascending order. If one number is odd and the other is even, the odd number comes first. This way, we can output the numbers in the required order in one pass, reducing memory usage.
