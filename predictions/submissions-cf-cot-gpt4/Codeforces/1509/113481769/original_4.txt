The given code reads an array of integers and separates them into odd and even numbers. After that, it prints the numbers, first the ones from the group that has more elements. 

Optimizations that can be made:

1. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`. This can improve I/O performance. 

2. Instead of using an array to store the input and then transfer them to vectors, you can directly input them into vectors. This would save memory as we don't need to use an extra array.

3. The `odd` and `even` vectors are not used outside the `solve` function, so they can be cleared after they are used. This would save memory as we don't need to keep these vectors in memory.

4. Instead of using range-based for loops to print the elements of the vectors, you can use the `copy` function from the `<algorithm>` library. It is more efficient and cleaner.

5. Also, you can use the `'\n'` character instead of `endl` to print new lines, because `endl` causes unnecessary flushes of the output stream.

Now let us apply these optimizations to the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define IOS ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);
#define loop(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define ll long long int

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> odd;
  vector<int> even;

  loop(i, n) {
    int num;
    cin >> num;
    if (num % 2) {
      odd.push_back(num);
    } else {
      even.push_back(num);
    }
  }

  vector<int>& first = odd.size() >= even.size() ? odd : even;
  vector<int>& second = odd.size() < even.size() ? odd : even;

  copy(first.begin(), first.end(), ostream_iterator<int>(cout, " "));
  copy(second.begin(), second.end(), ostream_iterator<int>(cout, " "));
  cout << '\n';

  odd.clear();
  even.clear();
}

int main() {
  IOS;
  int te;
  cin >> te;
  while(te--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
