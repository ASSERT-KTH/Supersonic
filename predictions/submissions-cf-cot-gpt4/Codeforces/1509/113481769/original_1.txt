This program separates odd and even numbers from an input array and then prints the larger group first followed by the smaller one.

Here are some steps to optimize this program:

1. Variable-Length Array: Variable-length arrays are not part of the C++ standard. Even though some compilers allow it, it's not a good practice. In this case, we can use a vector instead of a variable-length array for better compatibility and memory management.

2. Vector Resizing: The vectors `odd` and `even` are resized every time an element is pushed back. This can be optimized by reserving the maximum possible space at the beginning.

3. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`: `endl` causes an unnecessary flush of the buffer. Using `'\n'` is faster and accomplishes the same newline effect.

4. Unnecessary Macro Definitions: The `IOS` and `frfr` macro definitions are not used in this program and can be removed.

5. Use of `bits/stdc++.h`: The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes almost all C++ libraries, which increases the compilation time. It is a good practice to include only the libraries you are using.

Optimized Program:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

#define loop(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define ll long long int

void solve(int te) {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> arr(n), odd, even;
  odd.reserve(n);
  even.reserve(n);
  loop(i, n) {
    std::cin >> arr[i];
    if (arr[i] % 2) {
      odd.push_back(arr[i]);
    } else {
      even.push_back(arr[i]);
    }
  }
  if (odd.size() >= even.size()) {
    for (int i : odd) {
      std::cout << i << " ";
    }
    for (int i : even) {
      std::cout << i << " ";
    }
  } else {
    for (int i : even) {
      std::cout << i << " ";
    }
    for (int i : odd) {
      std::cout << i << " ";
    }
  }
  std::cout << '\n';
}

int main() {
  int te;
  std::cin >> te;
  for (int i = 1; i <= te; ++i) {
    solve(i);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program should perform better than the original in terms of both memory usage and execution time.
