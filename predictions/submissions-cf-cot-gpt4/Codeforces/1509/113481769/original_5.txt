The given program reads an array of integers from the standard input, separates the odd and even numbers into two different vectors, and then outputs the contents of these vectors in a particular order. If the number of odd numbers is greater or equal to the number of even numbers, it first outputs all odd numbers and then all even numbers. Otherwise, it first outputs all even numbers and then all odd numbers.

Optimization can be done as follows:

1. Memory usage: Instead of storing the numbers in an array and then pushing them into a vector based on their parity (odd/even), we can directly push them into the vector while reading them. This will save memory as we will not require the array.

2. Running time: We can avoid the multiple for-each loops used for printing the elements of the vectors. Instead, we can use the ostream_iterator along with the copy function from the STL to print the elements. This will decrease the running time as the number of iterations will be reduced.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <iterator>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  vector<int> odd;
  vector<int> even;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int num;
    cin >> num;
    if (num % 2) {
      odd.push_back(num);
    } else {
      even.push_back(num);
    }
  }

  if (odd.size() >= even.size()) {
    copy(odd.begin(), odd.end(), ostream_iterator<int>(cout, " "));
    copy(even.begin(), even.end(), ostream_iterator<int>(cout, " "));
  } else {
    copy(even.begin(), even.end(), ostream_iterator<int>(cout, " "));
    copy(odd.begin(), odd.end(), ostream_iterator<int>(cout, " "));
  }
  cout << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int te;
  cin >> te;
  for (int i = 1; i <= te; ++i) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this code assumes that the compiler supports C++11 or later.
