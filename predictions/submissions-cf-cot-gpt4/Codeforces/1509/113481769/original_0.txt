The given program is pretty well optimized and doesn't need much modification but there are still some steps which can be done to make it little more optimized.

1. The use of `#include<bits/stdc++.h>` is discouraged because it includes a lot of files which are not used here, it increases the compilation time. So, include only those header files which are needed.

2. Use of `#define IOS ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);` is not required in this program. It is used to speed up the I/O operations in competitive programming but in this program, the number of I/O operations are not too high to make a significant impact.

3. The `freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);` is commented out. If it's not required, remove it.

4. The `int arr[n];` is not the standard way in C++ to define an array. You should use `vector<int> arr(n);` for this.

5. The `for (int i : odd)` and `for (int i : even)` are using copies of the integers in the vectors. You should use references `for (int& i : odd)` and `for (int& i : even)` to avoid unnecessary copying.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> arr(n);
  vector<int> odd;
  vector<int> even;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
    if (arr[i] % 2) {
      odd.push_back(arr[i]);
    } else {
      even.push_back(arr[i]);
    }
  }
  if (odd.size() >= even.size()) {
    for (const int& i : odd) {
      cout << i << " ";
    }
    for (const int& i : even) {
      cout << i << " ";
    }
  } else {
    for (const int& i : even) {
      cout << i << " ";
    }
    for (const int& i : odd) {
      cout << i << " ";
    }
  }
  cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
  int te;
  cin >> te;
  while(te--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This program has the same functionality as the above one but is little more optimized in terms of memory usage and the number of I/O operations.
