This program separates even and odd numbers from the input and then prints them out. The odd numbers are printed first if there are more odd numbers than even numbers, otherwise the even numbers are printed first.

There are several optimizations that can be made in this program:

1. Instead of using an array to store the input, you can put the numbers directly into the even or odd vector. This way, you don't need to store all numbers twice which reduces memory usage and thus increases efficiency.

2. You can also calculate the number of odd and even numbers on the fly. This way, you can avoid the need to call the size() function on the vectors.

Here is the updated program implementing these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define IOS ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);
#define endl "\n"
#define frfr freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
#define ll long long int
void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int num;
    vector<int> odd;
    vector<int> even;
    int count_odd = 0, count_even = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> num;
        if (num % 2) {
            odd.push_back(num);
            count_odd++;
        } else {
            even.push_back(num);
            count_even++;
        }
    }
    if (count_odd >= count_even) {
        for (int i : odd) {
            cout << i << " ";
        }
        for (int i : even) {
            cout << i << " ";
        }
    } else {
        for (int i : even) {
            cout << i << " ";
        }
        for (int i : odd) {
            cout << i << " ";
        }
    }
    cout << endl;
}
int main() {
    IOS;
    int te;
    cin >> te;
    while (te--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Note: A suggestion for better coding practice is to avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;` as they include all standard library headers and using namespaces can lead to name clashes. However, as you requested not to rewrite the program and these are not performance related issues, I kept them as is.
