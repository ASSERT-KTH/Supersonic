This program reads a series of numbers, separates them into odd and even categories, and then prints them out in a certain order. If there are more odd numbers, the odd numbers get printed first, otherwise the even numbers get printed first. 

The main optimization for this program would be in memory usage. The program is currently storing all the numbers in two different vectors (odd and even) and an array. This isn't necessary and we can reduce memory usage by only using two vectors and removing the array. 

The optimization steps would be:

1. Remove the array declaration and directly check the input value for odd or even and push it into the respective vector.
2. Use const reference to iterate over vectors to avoid copying of elements during iterations.
3. Avoid using `#define` for loop, use traditional for loop instead.
4. Do not use `bits/stdc++.h` as it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, include only necessary ones.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void solve(int te) {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  vector<int> odd;
  vector<int> even;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int val;
    cin >> val;
    if (val % 2) {
      odd.push_back(val);
    } else {
      even.push_back(val);
    }
  }
  
  const vector<int>& first = odd.size() >= even.size() ? odd : even;
  const vector<int>& second = odd.size() >= even.size() ? even : odd;
  
  for (const int& i : first) {
    cout << i << " ";
  }
  for (const int& i : second) {
    cout << i << " ";
  }
  cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  int te;
  cin >> te;
  for (int i = 1; i <= te; ++i) {
    solve(i);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the code should use less memory and be faster because it avoids unnecessary copying of elements during iterations and the creation of an unnecessary array.
