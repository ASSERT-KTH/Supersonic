This C++ program reads a number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a number of integers, separates them into odd and even integers, and finally prints the numbers in two groups: the larger group of either even or odd numbers goes first, then the smaller group.

Optimization Steps:

1. Dynamic array allocation: You are creating an array 'arr' of 'n' integers dynamically. Dynamic allocation is slower than static allocation. You can use a vector instead if you don't know the size at compile time. However, in this case, you are only using the array to read the input and distribute it into two other vectors. We can eliminate this array completely and directly read the input values into the correct vector, which will save both memory and time.

2. Using std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0): This can speed up the I/O operations, but it is not needed here, so we can remove it to save space and time.

3. Using cin.tie(0) and cout.tie(0): These are not required here, so we can remove them to save space and time.

4. Using vector::size() in an if condition: Calling the size method on a vector returns its size, which is an O(1) operation. However, it makes the code less readable. Instead, we can keep a count of the numbers read into each vector and use these counters in the if condition.

5. Using range-based for loops: Range-based for loops can be slower than traditional for loops, especially when working with larger data sets. We can replace these with traditional for loops.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define endl "\n"

void solve() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> odd;
  std::vector<int> even;
  int odd_count = 0, even_count = 0, num;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> num;
    if (num % 2) {
      odd.push_back(num);
      odd_count++;
    } else {
      even.push_back(num);
      even_count++;
    }
  }
  
  if (odd_count >= even_count) {
    for (int i = 0; i < odd_count; i++) {
      std::cout << odd[i] << " ";
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < even_count; i++) {
      std::cout << even[i] << " ";
    }
  } else {
    for (int i = 0; i < even_count; i++) {
      std::cout << even[i] << " ";
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < odd_count; i++) {
      std::cout << odd[i] << " ";
    }
  }
  std::cout << endl;
}

int main() {
  int te;
  std::cin >> te;
  while (te--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
