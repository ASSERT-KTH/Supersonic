This program is trying to find the number of operations required to convert each even number to an odd number by continuously dividing by 2. For optimization, we can follow the steps below:

1. Instead of using a vector to store the even numbers and then sorting it, we can directly use a set. The set in C++ is implemented as a Red-Black Tree and it stores the elements in sorted order by default. This way, we eliminate the need for a sorting operation which takes O(n log n) time.

2. We don't need the 'used' map because we're already avoiding duplicates by using a set.

3. We don't need to check if the number is even in the while loop since we already have a set of even numbers.

4. The `st` set is not required as we are only interested in unique even numbers which are already handled by the `even` set.

Let's implement these optimizations:

```C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define int long long
using namespace std;
signed main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, res = 0;
    cin >> n;
    set<int, greater<int>> even; // Declare set with custom comparator for descending order
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int x;
      cin >> x;
      if (x % 2 == 0)
        even.insert(x);
    }
    for (auto &e : even) { // Range based loop for set
      int b = e;
      while (b % 2 == 0) {
        b /= 2;
        ++res;
      }
    }
    cout << res << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This program has the same functionality as the previous one but is more optimized in terms of time complexity and memory usage.
