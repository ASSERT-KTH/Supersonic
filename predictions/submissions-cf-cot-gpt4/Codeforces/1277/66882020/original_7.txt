The original program is designed to find all even numbers in the given set, sort them in descending order, and then count the number of times each number can be divided by 2 before becoming an odd number. The program uses multiple data structures such as vector, set, and map. Here are some steps to optimize the program:

1. **Remove Unnecessary Data Structures**: The `set` st is used to avoid duplicates in the `even` vector. The `map` used is used to mark numbers that have been processed. Both can be replaced with a single unordered_set, which has an average time complexity of O(1) for search and insert operations.

2. **Avoid Sorting**: The program sorts the `even` vector in descending order. However, sorting is not necessary for counting the number of times each number can be divided by 2. We can process the numbers as they are inputted.

3. **Use Bitwise Operations**: The program uses the modulo and division operations to check if a number is even and to divide it by 2. These operations can be replaced with bitwise operations, which are faster.

The optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define int long long
using namespace std;

signed main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, res = 0;
    cin >> n;
    unordered_set<int> numbers;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int x;
      cin >> x;
      if ((x & 1) == 0 && numbers.find(x) == numbers.end()){
        int b = x;
        while ((b & 1) == 0) {
          numbers.insert(b);
          b >>= 1;
          ++res;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << res << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimization mainly focuses on reducing the time complexity and memory usage by utilizing a single data structure and avoiding unnecessary sorting. Bitwise operations are used instead of arithmetic operations for faster computation.
