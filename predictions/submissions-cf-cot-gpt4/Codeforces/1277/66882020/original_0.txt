This program accepts a series of numbers, then processes the even numbers in descending order by halving them until they cannot be halved further. The optimization can be done in the following ways:

1. Avoid multiple memory allocations: The program creates a vector, a set, and a map. We can avoid the vector and map by adding elements directly to the set and using the set's properties for our operations.
2. Avoid unnecessary operations: The program checks if a number is already used by storing it in a map, which is unnecessary since we are inserting numbers into the set only if they don't already exist in it. Therefore, the check in the map can be eliminated.
3. Efficient set operations: We can use the set's insert function to check if an element exists. The insert function returns a pair, where the second element is false if the element already exists. This avoids the need for a separate count function call, which increases efficiency.
4. Efficient computation: The while loop can be replaced by counting the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of a number, which directly gives the number of times a number can be halved.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define int long long
using namespace std;

signed main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, res = 0;
    cin >> n;
    set<int, greater<int>> st;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int x;
      cin >> x;
      if (x % 2 == 0)
        st.insert(x);
    }
    for (auto it = st.begin(); it != st.end(); ++it) {
      res += __builtin_ctzll(*it);
    }
    cout << res << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This program uses __builtin_ctzll from GCC, which computes the number of trailing 0-bits in the binary representation of a number. This directly gives the number of times a number can be halved.
