The given C++ program reads an integer t and then for each t, reads an integer n followed by n integer inputs. The program counts the number of times a number can be divided by 2 and prints the total count.

The program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. The map 'used' can be replaced by a set data structure. This is because map consumes more memory than set. It is also slower as it needs to maintain the ordering of elements whereas the set does not need to maintain any order.

2. Avoid using bits/stdc++.h since it includes unnecessary libraries which leads to an increase in the compile time.

3. Avoid using 'long long' if the input range is small. It consumes more memory than int.

4. Avoid using 'pb' macro for push_back. It is not a good practice and reduces the readability of the code.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

bool comp(int a, int b) { return a > b; }

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, res = 0;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> even;
    set<int> st, used;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int x;
      cin >> x;
      if (x % 2 == 0 && st.find(x) == st.end())
        even.push_back(x);
      st.insert(x);
    }
    sort(even.begin(), even.end(), comp);
    for (int i = 0; i < even.size(); i++) {
      if (used.find(even[i]) == used.end()) {
        int b = even[i];
        while (b % 2 == 0) {
          used.insert(b);
          b /= 2;
          ++res;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << res << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Let's explain the changes step by step:

1. Replaced `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`, `#include <set>`, and `#include <algorithm>`. This reduces the unnecessary inclusion of libraries and thus the compile time.

2. Replaced `map<int, bool> used` with `set<int> used`. This reduces the memory usage and improves the program's speed.

3. Replaced `#define int long long` with `int`. This reduces the memory usage.

4. Replaced `#define pb push_back` with direct usage of `push_back`. This improves the readability of the code.

5. Replaced `st.count(x)` with `st.find(x) == st.end()`. This improves the speed as `find` is faster than `count` in C++ sets.

6. Replaced `used[even[i]]` with `used.find(even[i]) == used.end()`. This improves the speed as `find` is faster than `operator[]` in C++ sets.
