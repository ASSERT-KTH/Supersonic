The following optimizations apply to this code:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file includes a lot of unnecessary stuff which can increase the compilation time. Instead, include only what's necessary. Here, we only need `#include <iostream>`, `#include <algorithm>`, `#include <set>`, `#include <map>`. 

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`. This can lead to name clashes because it imports all the names from the namespace `std` into the global namespace.

3. Remove the unused `typedef long long ll;`, `#define PI 3.141592653589793238`, `#define _test_`, `#define file()`, `ll gcd(ll a, ll b)`, `ll lcm(ll a, ll b)`, `int dx[]`, `int dy[]` to save memory. There is no need for these in the given code.

4. The `#define optimize()` is not necessary. It's used to speed up the I/O operations, but in this case, it doesn't make a significant difference. 

5. The `set<int> s;` and `map<int, int> m;` can be moved inside the `_case_()` function to save memory. They don't need to be global variables.

6. The `sort` operation is not necessary. Removing it will save time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <map>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  int a[n];
  std::map<int, int> m;
  std::set<int> s;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (a[i] != 1 and m[a[i] - 1] == 0) {
      s.insert(a[i] - 1);
      m[a[i] - 1]++;
    } else if (m[a[i]] == 0) {
      s.insert(a[i]);
      m[a[i]]++;
    } else if (m[a[i] + 1] == 0) {
      s.insert(a[i] + 1);
      m[a[i] + 1]++;
    }
  }

  std::cout << s.size() << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should have the same output as the original code, but it will use less memory and compile faster.
