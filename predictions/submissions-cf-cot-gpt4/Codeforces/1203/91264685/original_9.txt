The given code is a C++ program that reads an array of integers, sorts it, and then processes it to create a set of unique integers. The program then prints the size of the set. 

The possible optimizations for the given program are:

1. Namespace usage: It is generally considered bad practice to use the entire std namespace. Instead, we can explicitly state which functions we are using from the std namespace.

2. Unnecessary function definitions: The gcd, lcm, and dx, dy arrays are not used anywhere in the program. So, we can remove them.

3. Array allocation: The array 'a' is allocated with a size of 1e6+123, which is a waste of space if 'n' is much smaller. We could use a vector and use push_back to add elements, which would allow us to use only as much space as needed.

4. Unnecessary sort: The array 'a' is sorted, but since we are checking for every element whether it exists in the map, the sort operation is not necessary.

5. Redundant use of map and set: The set 's' and map 'm' are both being used to check if an element exists. We can use only the set for this, which will reduce the memory usage.

Here is the optimized code with the explained steps:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;
using std::set;

void _case_() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  set<int> s;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (a[i] != 1 && s.find(a[i] - 1) == s.end()) {
      s.insert(a[i] - 1);
    } else if (s.find(a[i]) == s.end()) {
      s.insert(a[i]);
    } else if (s.find(a[i] + 1) == s.end()) {
      s.insert(a[i] + 1);
    }
  }
  cout << s.size() << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  _case_();
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code should work faster and consume less memory than the original code.
