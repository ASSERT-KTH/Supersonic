The main optimization here can be done on the data structure used. In this code, a map and a set are used to store the data. Maps in C++ are implemented as binary search trees, and their insert operations are log(N), where N is the number of nodes.

A more efficient approach would be to use an unordered_map and an unordered_set. These are implemented as hash tables, and their insert operations are generally O(1), making them faster than their ordered counterparts.

So, in terms of memory usage, using unordered_map and unordered_set would be more efficient because hash tables generally use less memory than binary search trees.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Replace map<int, int> m; with unordered_map<int, int> m;
2. Replace set<int> s; with unordered_set<int> s;

Now, let's generate the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
#define el << '\n'
#define PI 3.141592653589793238
#define _test_                                                                 \
  int t;                                                                       \
  cin >> t;                                                                    \
  while (t--)
#define optimize()                                                             \
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);                                                \
  cin.tie(NULL);                                                                  \
  cout.tie(NULL)
#define file()                                                                 \
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);                                            \
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout)
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) { return __gcd(a, b); }
ll lcm(ll a, ll b) { return a * (b / gcd(a, b)); }
int dx[] = {0, 0, +1, -1, +1, -1, -1, +1};
int dy[] = {+1, -1, 0, 0, +1, -1, +1, -1};
const int mx = 1e6 + 123;
int n, a[mx], ans, k;
unordered_set<int> s;
unordered_map<int, int> m;
void _case_() {
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  sort(a, a + n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (a[i] != 1 and m[a[i] - 1] == 0) {
      s.insert(a[i] - 1);
      m[a[i] - 1]++;
    } else if (m[a[i]] == 0) {
      s.insert(a[i]);
      m[a[i]]++;
    } else if (m[a[i] + 1] == 0) {
      s.insert(a[i] + 1);
      m[a[i] + 1]++;
    }
  }
  cout << s.size() el;
}
int main() {
  optimize();
  _case_();
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the `optimize()` macro is also updated as mentioned in the comments since there is no guarantee that tying `cin` and `cout` to `NULL` will speed up I/O. Instead, it could lead to unwanted side effects. Therefore, it is usually recommended to set them to `false` and `NULL` respectively.
