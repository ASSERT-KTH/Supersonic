Here are some steps to optimize the given program:

1. **Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`:** This header file is quite large and includes practically the entire standard library, which increases the compilation time significantly. Instead, include only those header files that you need. For example, in this case, you can include `iostream`, `vector`, and `utility`.

2. **Avoid Macros:** It might make your code faster to type, but they are processed by preprocessor and can lead to hard-to-find bugs. For example, you can replace the macros `FTB` and `FT` with standard for loops. Also, the macros `coYES`, `coNO` etc. are not used in this program and can be removed.

3. **Avoid using global variables:** It is good practice to limit the scope of variables as much as possible. Global variables can be accessed and modified by any part of the program, making it harder to reason about their values throughout the program. In this case, if `n`, `m`, `ng`, `dc`, and `a` are only used inside `main()`, it would be better to declare them inside `main()`.

4. **Avoid unnecessary if condition:** In the nested for loop, there is a condition `if (a[i][j] == '.')` and inside it, there are two more conditions which are checking the same thing. It is unnecessary and can be reduced to one condition. 

Here is the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

typedef long long LL;
typedef pair<LL, LL> II;
typedef vector<LL> VI;
typedef vector<II> VII;
typedef vector<bool> VB;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  LL n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  char a[505][505];
  LL ng[505][505] = {0}, dc[505][505] = {0};

  for (LL i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (LL j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
      cin >> a[i][j];
    }
  }

  for (LL i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (LL j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
      ng[i][j] = ng[i][j - 1];
      dc[i][j] = dc[i - 1][j];
      if (a[i][j] == '.' && a[i][j] == a[i][j - 1]) {
        ng[i][j]++;
      }
      if (a[i][j] == '.' && a[i][j] == a[i - 1][j]) {
        dc[i][j]++;
      }
    }
  }
  
  LL q;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    LL t, x, b, y, res = 0;
    cin >> t >> x >> b >> y;
    for (LL i = t; i <= b; i++) {
      res += ng[i][y] - ng[i][x - 1];
      if (a[i][x] == a[i][x - 1] && a[i][x] == '.')
        res--;
    }
    for (LL i = x; i <= y; i++) {
      res += dc[b][i] - dc[t - 1][i];
      if (a[t][i] == a[t - 1][i] && a[t][i] == '.')
        res--;
    }
    cout << res << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should provide the same functionality as the original, with reduced memory usage and improved performance.
