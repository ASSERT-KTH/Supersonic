Here are some steps I would take to optimize this program:

1. Remove unused macros and typedefs: This program has a lot of macros and typedefs that are not being used. Removing them will make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

2. Reduce the number of global variables: Global variables are usually a bad practice because they can be modified anywhere in the program, making it hard to debug and maintain. We can move some of these variables inside the main function.

3. Avoid unnecessary calculations in the loop: In the nested loop where `ng` and `dc` are calculated, there are conditions that check if `a[i][j] == '.'` twice. We can store the result in a variable and use it in both conditions.

4. Use standard types: Instead of using `LL`, which is a typedef for `long long`, use the standard `long long` type. It's more widely recognized and doesn't require looking up a typedef.

5. Use `std::vector` instead of raw arrays: `std::vector` is a safer and more flexible alternative to raw arrays.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  long long n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  vector<vector<char>> a(n + 1, vector<char>(m + 1));
  vector<vector<long long>> ng(n + 1, vector<long long>(m + 1, 0));
  vector<vector<long long>> dc(n + 1, vector<long long>(m + 1, 0));

  for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (long long j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
      cin >> a[i][j];
    }
  }

  for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (long long j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
      ng[i][j] = ng[i][j - 1];
      dc[i][j] = dc[i - 1][j];
      if (a[i][j] == '.') {
        bool isPrevSame = a[i][j] == a[i][j - 1];
        if (isPrevSame)
          ng[i][j]++;
        if (a[i][j] == a[i - 1][j])
          dc[i][j]++;
      }
    }
  }
  long long q;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    long long t, x, b, y, res = 0;
    cin >> t >> x >> b >> y;
    for (long long i = t; i <= b; i++) {
      res += ng[i][y] - ng[i][x - 1];
      if (a[i][x] == a[i][x - 1] && a[i][x] == '.')
        res--;
    }
    for (long long i = x; i <= y; i++) {
      res += dc[b][i] - dc[t - 1][i];
      if (a[t][i] == a[t - 1][i] && a[t][i] == '.')
        res--;
    }
    cout << res << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this code maintains the same logic as the original one. The optimizations were mainly about making the code cleaner and more efficient.
