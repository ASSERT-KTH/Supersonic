The provided code is a complex one and the optimizations that can be done are minor and rather limited. The code seems to be already quite optimized for running time and memory usage, but there are still a couple of things that could be done to improve it a bit further.

1. Use standard libraries: It's not a good practice to use `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This standard header file was designed to simplify the process of including standard libraries, but it also includes a lot of unnecessary code, which can slow down compilation time. Instead, you should include only the libraries that you actually use in your code.

2. Reduce the number of global variables: The code uses a lot of global variables. Global variables are stored in the heap memory, which has a slower access time compared to the stack memory. Hence, it's better to use local variables when possible. However, it's worth mentioning that this might not significantly improve the runtime of the program, but it is a good practice in general.

3. Avoid unnecessary checks: The code checks `if (a[i][j] == '.')` twice, which is unnecessary. The second check can be avoided.

4. Use post-increment instead of pre-increment: Post-increment is faster than pre-increment because post-increment involves one more operation (it saves the current value for returning and then increments it).

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

typedef long long LL;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  LL n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  vector<vector<char>> a(n+1, vector<char>(m+1));
  vector<vector<LL>> ng(n+1, vector<LL>(m+1)), dc(n+1, vector<LL>(m+1));
  for (LL i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (LL j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
      cin >> a[i][j];
    }
  }
  for (LL i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (LL j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
      ng[i][j] = ng[i][j - 1];
      dc[i][j] = dc[i - 1][j];
      if (a[i][j] == '.') {
        if (a[i][j] == a[i][j - 1])
          ng[i][j]++;
        if (a[i][j] == a[i - 1][j])
          dc[i][j]++;
      }
    }
  }
  LL q;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    LL t, x, b, y, res = 0;
    cin >> t >> x >> b >> y;
    for (LL i = t; i <= b; i++) {
      res += ng[i][y] - ng[i][x - 1];
      if (a[i][x] == a[i][x - 1] && a[i][x] == '.')
        res--;
    }
    for (LL i = x; i <= y; i++) {
      res += dc[b][i] - dc[t - 1][i];
      if (a[t][i] == a[t - 1][i] && a[t][i] == '.')
        res--;
    }
    cout << res << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code includes only the necessary libraries, reduces the number of global variables, avoids unnecessary checks, and uses post-increment instead of pre-increment.
