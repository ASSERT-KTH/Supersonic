The given C++ program seems to be a part of a larger system, and it is hard to optimize without understanding the larger context. However, we can identify some potential areas for optimization:

1. Use of Macros: The usage of macros for loops and cout statements can be replaced with their original forms for better readability and maintainability. 

2. Unnecessary calculations: The program calculates `ng[i][j]` and `dc[i][j]` even when `a[i][j]` is not '.'. This could be avoided by moving these calculations inside the if condition.

3. Avoiding Array Bound Check: In the query loop, there are checks on the array `a` for `a[i][x-1]` and `a[t-1][i]` which are not necessary if `x` and `t` are guaranteed to be greater than 1. If this is the case, these checks can be removed for performance improvement.

Here is the optimized version of the code with these changes:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

typedef long long LL;

LL n, m, ng[505][505], dc[505][505];
char a[505][505];

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (LL i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (LL j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
      cin >> a[i][j];
      if (a[i][j] == '.') {
        ng[i][j] = ng[i][j - 1];
        dc[i][j] = dc[i - 1][j];
        if (a[i][j] == a[i][j - 1])
          ng[i][j]++;
        if (a[i][j] == a[i - 1][j])
          dc[i][j]++;
      }
    }
  }
  LL q;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    LL t, x, b, y, res = 0;
    cin >> t >> x >> b >> y;
    for (LL i = t; i <= b; i++) {
      res += ng[i][y] - ng[i][x - 1];
      if (x > 1 && a[i][x] == a[i][x - 1] && a[i][x] == '.')
        res--;
    }
    for (LL i = x; i <= y; i++) {
      res += dc[b][i] - dc[t - 1][i];
      if (t > 1 && a[t][i] == a[t - 1][i] && a[t][i] == '.')
        res--;
    }
    cout << res << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This code improves upon the original by simplifying the macros, reducing unnecessary calculations, and removing array bound checks where not needed. Please verify that the inputs `x` and `t` in the query loop are guaranteed to be greater than 1. If not, the array bound checks should be added back.
