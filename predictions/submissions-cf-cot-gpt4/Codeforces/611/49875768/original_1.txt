In this program, the main potential for optimization lies in the loop structure, as well as how the program handles input and output.

Step 1: Removing unnecessary macros
A lot of macros are defined at the beginning of the program. Not all of them are used. We can remove the following unused macros to make the program cleaner and easier to maintain:
- FT, FGB, FG, debug, coYES, coNO, coyes, cono, coYes, coNo, PI, lbnd, ubnd, y1, lamtron, ALL, ONLINE_JUDGE, getbit, onbit, offbit, cntbit, gcd.

Step 2: Using standard types
Replace the typedef-ed types (like LL, DB, UL, LD, II, VI, VII, VB) with their standard types. This will make the program easier to read and understand for other developers and might also improve performance slightly, as the compiler doesn't have to look up typedefs.

Step 3: Reducing the size of arrays
The arrays ng, dc and a are larger than necessary. We can reduce the size of the arrays by setting them to the maximum size needed, based on the values of n and m.

Step 4: Using fast I/O
The "ios::sync_with_stdio(false);" and "cin.tie(0);" lines are used to speed up cin and cout. However, as we're using cin and cout frequently in the program, it might be more efficient to use scanf and printf instead. This will avoid the overhead of syncing C++'s cin and cout with C's stdin and stdout.

Step 5: Loop optimization
The "while (q--)" loop reads in variables in every iteration. It might be more efficient to read in all queries first, store them in a structure, and then process them one by one.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  vector<vector<char>> a(n+1, vector<char>(m+1));
  vector<vector<int>> ng(n+1, vector<int>(m+1, 0));
  vector<vector<int>> dc(n+1, vector<int>(m+1, 0));

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++)
      cin >> a[i][j];
      
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
      ng[i][j] = ng[i][j - 1];
      dc[i][j] = dc[i - 1][j];
      if (a[i][j] == '.') {
        if (a[i][j] == a[i][j - 1])
          ng[i][j]++;
        if (a[i][j] == a[i - 1][j])
          dc[i][j]++;
      }
    }
  }
  int q;
  scanf("%d", &q);
  vector<pair<int, int>> queries(q);
  for(int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    int t, x, b, y;
    scanf("%d %d %d %d", &t, &x, &b, &y);
    queries[i] = make_pair(t, x, b, y);
  }
  for(int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    int res = 0;
    int t = queries[i].first;
    int x = queries[i].second;
    int b = queries[i].third;
    int y = queries[i].fourth;
    for (int i = t; i <= b; i++) {
      res += ng[i][y] - ng[i][x - 1];
      if (a[i][x] == a[i][x - 1] && a[i][x] == '.')
        res--;
    }
    for (int i = x; i <= y; i++) {
      res += dc[b][i] - dc[t - 1][i];
      if (a[t][i] == a[t - 1][i] && a[t][i] == '.')
        res--;
    }
    printf("%d\n", res);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
