The given program basically reads a matrix of characters from the input and then for each of several queries it calculates the amount of horizontal and vertical neighbouring cells that both contain a dot.

To optimize the existing code, we can follow these steps:

1. Remove unnecessary `#define` statements. The code contains a lot of unused macros which just make the code harder to read and do not contribute to its performance or functionality.

2. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, as it includes more files than needed. Instead, include only required libraries.

3. Instead of using `typedef`, use `using` keyword as it is more modern and flexible.

4. Avoid using global variables when they can be local. In this case, `n`, `m`, `ng`, `dc` and `a` can all be declared inside `main()`.

5. Use `std::array` or `std::vector` instead of C-style arrays. In this case, as the size is fixed to 505, we can use `std::array`.

6. Remove the unneeded check `if (a[i][j] == '.')`, which is already checked inside the conditions of the next `if` statements.

7. Use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output buffer.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;
using LL = long long;
using II = pair<LL, LL>;
using VI = vector<LL>;
using VII = vector<II>;

const int MAXN = 505;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
    freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
    freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
    LL n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    array<array<char, MAXN>, MAXN> a;
    array<array<LL, MAXN>, MAXN> ng = {}, dc = {};

    for(LL i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for(LL j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
            cin >> a[i][j];
            ng[i][j] = ng[i][j - 1];
            dc[i][j] = dc[i - 1][j];
            if (a[i][j] == a[i][j - 1])
                ng[i][j]++;
            if (a[i][j] == a[i - 1][j])
                dc[i][j]++;
        }
    }

    LL q;
    cin >> q;
    while (q--) {
        LL t, x, b, y, res = 0;
        cin >> t >> x >> b >> y;
        for(LL i = t; i <= b; i++) {
            res += ng[i][y] - ng[i][x - 1];
            if (a[i][x] == a[i][x - 1] && a[i][x] == '.')
                res--;
        }
        for(LL i = x; i <= y; i++) {
            res += dc[b][i] - dc[t - 1][i];
            if (a[t][i] == a[t - 1][i] && a[t][i] == '.')
                res--;
        }
        cout << res << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This version of the code is cleaner, more modern, and should perform better because of the removal of the unneeded check for `a[i][j] == '.'` and the usage of `'\n'` instead of `std::endl`.
