This program is already very optimized, but there are still a few changes we can make to slightly optimize it further.

1. Only include the necessary headers: The first line of this program "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" includes all the standard libraries in C++. This makes the compilation time longer. Include only the necessary headers for the program.

2. Avoid using macros: Although macros can make code shorter, they can also make it harder to read and debug. It's better to use functions or constants.

3. Avoid using 'endl': 'endl' not only adds a newline, but also flushes the output buffer, which can slow down the output process. Use "\n" instead.

4. Avoid using global variables: Global variables can be accessed and modified by any part of the program, which can make debugging difficult. They also take up space in memory for the entire life of the program. It's better to use local variables whenever possible.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;
typedef long long LL;
typedef pair<LL, LL> II;
typedef vector<LL> VI;
typedef vector<II> VII;
typedef vector<bool> VB;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  LL n, m, ng[505][505], dc[505][505];
  char a[505][505];
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (LL i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (LL j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
      cin >> a[i][j];
    }
  }
  for (LL i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (LL j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
      ng[i][j] = ng[i][j - 1];
      dc[i][j] = dc[i - 1][j];
      if (a[i][j] == '.') {
        if (a[i][j] == a[i][j - 1])
          ng[i][j]++;
        if (a[i][j] == a[i - 1][j])
          dc[i][j]++;
      }
    }
  }
  LL q;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    LL t, x, b, y, res = 0;
    cin >> t >> x >> b >> y;
    for (LL i = t; i <= b; i++) {
      res += ng[i][y] - ng[i][x - 1];
      if (a[i][x] == a[i][x - 1] && a[i][x] == '.')
        res--;
    }
    for (LL i = x; i <= y; i++) {
      res += dc[b][i] - dc[t - 1][i];
      if (a[t][i] == a[t - 1][i] && a[t][i] == '.')
        res--;
    }
    cout << res << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
