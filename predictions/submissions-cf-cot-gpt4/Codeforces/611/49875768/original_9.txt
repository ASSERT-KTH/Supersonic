The given code is well-optimized in terms of algorithmic complexity, but there are still a few changes that can be made to improve the code in terms of readability and maintainability. The changes won't necessarily speed up the program, as the algorithm used is already efficient, but they will make the code cleaner and easier to understand which is a part of code optimization.

Step 1: Remove unnecessary macros
The code contains a lot of macros which are not used in the program. Removing these macros will make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary typedefs
Similar to the macros, there are a lot of typedefs which are not used in the program. Removing these will also make the code cleaner.

Step 3: Use meaningful variable names
The variable names used in the program are not descriptive, which makes the code hard to understand. By using more meaningful names, the code will become much easier to read.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary template functions
There are several template functions which are not used in the program. These can be removed to simplify the code.

Step 5: Remove the #ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE block
If you're not participating in competitive programming, you most likely won't need the #ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE block. This block can be removed to simplify the code.

Now, let's apply these steps and look at the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

typedef long long LL;

LL rows, columns, horizontal[505][505], vertical[505][505];
char grid[505][505];

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);

  cin >> rows >> columns;
  for (LL i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
    for (LL j = 1; j <= columns; j++) {
      cin >> grid[i][j];
    }
  }

  for (LL i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
    for (LL j = 1; j <= columns; j++) {
      horizontal[i][j] = horizontal[i][j - 1];
      vertical[i][j] = vertical[i - 1][j];
      
      if (grid[i][j] == '.') {
        if (grid[i][j] == grid[i][j - 1]){
          horizontal[i][j]++;
        }
        if (grid[i][j] == grid[i - 1][j]){
          vertical[i][j]++;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  LL queryCount;
  cin >> queryCount;
  
  while (queryCount--) {
    LL top, left, bottom, right, result = 0;
    cin >> top >> left >> bottom >> right;
    
    for (LL i = top; i <= bottom; i++) {
      result += horizontal[i][right] - horizontal[i][left - 1];
      if (grid[i][left] == grid[i][left - 1] && grid[i][left] == '.'){
        result--;
      }
    }
    for (LL i = left; i <= right; i++) {
      result += vertical[bottom][i] - vertical[top - 1][i];
      if (grid[top][i] == grid[top - 1][i] && grid[top][i] == '.'){
        result--;
      }
    }
    cout << result << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
