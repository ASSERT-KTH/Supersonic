There are several optimizations that can be done to this code:

1. **Minimize the use of global variables**: Global variables consume memory for the entire lifetime of the program, which can be quite expensive when you have large arrays like `fact` and `invfact` in your program. If we can, we should try to minimize their scope or make them local to the function where they are needed.

2. **Use of vector instead of C-style arrays**: The use of dynamically allocated C-style arrays (`new int[n + 1]`) can be replaced by vectors which are safer and have similar performance characteristics.

3. **Early termination of the loop**: In the main function, there are loops that don't stop even after the desired condition is found. You can break the loop as soon as the condition is satisfied.

4. **Avoiding unnecessary operations**: In the main function, there is a repetitive operation (`k ^= v[i]`) that can be avoided by redefining the loop condition.

5. **Avoiding redundant function calls**: The modulo_pow function is called multiple times with the same arguments within the preinvfact function. We can reduce these redundant calls by storing the result of the first call and reusing it.

Here is the optimized code considering the above points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int ll;
#define nline "\n"
ll mod = 1e9 + 7;

ll modulo_pow(ll a, ll b) {
  if (b == 0)
    return 1;
  ll d = modulo_pow(a, b / 2);
  if (b & 1)
    return (d % mod * d % mod * a) % mod;
  return (d % mod * d % mod) % mod;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("Input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("Output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<ll> v(n, 0);
    ll d = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> v[i];
      d ^= v[i];
    }
    vector<ll> pref(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      pref[i] = pref[i - 1] ^ v[i - 1];
    }
    vector<ll> suff(n + 2, 0);
    for (int i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
      suff[i] = suff[i + 1] ^ v[i - 1];
    }
    bool ans = false;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; i++) {
      if (pref[i] == suff[i + 1]) {
        ans = true;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (ans) {
      cout << "YES" << nline;
      continue;
    } else if (d == 0) {
      cout << "NO" << nline;
      continue;
    }
    ll k = 0;
    ll c = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n && (k ^= v[i]) != d; i++) {
      if (k == d) {
        k = 0;
        c++;
      }
    }
    if (k == 0 && c >= 3)
      cout << "YES" << nline;
    else
      cout << "NO" << nline;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: I only kept the parts of the code that were being used. There were several functions and global variables declared that were not being used anywhere in the code, so I removed them to avoid confusion.
