The given code has many opportunities for optimization. Here are some of the steps that can be taken to optimize the code:

1. Unnecessary Macros: There are some macros which are not used anywhere in the code. Removing these will not improve the performance, but it will certainly improve the readability and maintainability of the code. The unused macros are pbds, pb, pf, pob, pof, ub, lb, memo, tc, sz, sc, fs, pri, all, vi, pr, mp, spi, fact, invfact, phin, sieve, google, modulo_pow, prefact, preinvfact, ncr.

2. Unnecessary Headers: The header file `bits/stdc++.h` includes almost all the standard C++ libraries which can increase the compilation time. It's better to include only those libraries which are actually needed.

3. Redundant Code: The arrays "pref" and "suff" are computed but never actually used anywhere in the code. They can be removed to save memory and computation time.

4. Use of Global Variables: The global variable "mod" is used but its value is never changed. It can be declared as a constant to improve the performance.

5. The loop which calculates "k" and "c" can be moved inside the else if block, as it's only needed when the condition of the block is true.

Here is the optimized version of the code after applying these steps:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;
typedef long long int ll;

#define nline "\n"
const ll mod = 1e9 + 7;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<ll> v(n, 0);
    ll d = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> v[i];
      d ^= v[i];
    }
    int ans = 0;
    if (d == 0) {
      cout << "NO" << nline;
      continue;
    }
    ll k = 0;
    ll c = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      k ^= v[i];
      if (k == d) {
        k = 0;
        c++;
      }
    }
    if (k == 0 && c >= 3)
      cout << "YES" << nline;
    else
      cout << "NO" << nline;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version of the code will run faster and use less memory than the original version.
