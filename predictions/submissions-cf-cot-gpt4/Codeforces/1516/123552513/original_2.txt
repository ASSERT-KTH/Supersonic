There isn't much that can be optimized in this code in terms of running time as the time complexity is linear due to the single iteration over the array "a". However, there are a few things that can be done to improve readability and maintainability of the code. 

1. Avoiding the use of `#define`: The `#define` preprocessor directive is usually not recommended in modern C++. It doesn't respect scope and it doesn't follow the rules of the language. Instead, you can use `constexpr` for constants and inline functions. 

2. Avoiding use of `using namespace std`: It's considered bad practice to use the `using namespace std` statement in global scope in C++. This is because it includes the entire std namespace, which can lead to name clashes. 

3. Use of `auto` in range-based for loops: Instead of declaring the type explicitly in the range-based for loop, `auto` can be used. It makes the code easier to read and maintain.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

template <class T, class U> bool ckmin(T &a, U b) {
  return a > b ? a = b, 1 : 0;
}
template <class T, class U> bool ckmax(T &a, U b) {
  return a < b ? a = b, 1 : 0;
}
constexpr int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int MX = 2005;

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  int TC;
  std::cin >> TC;
  for(int t = 0; t < TC; ++t) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    int k = 2;
    std::vector<long long> a(n);
    long long x = 0;
    for(auto &i: a) {
      std::cin >> i;
      x ^= i;
    }
    if (x == 0) {
      std::cout << "YES" << "\n";
      continue;
    }
    int cnt = 0;
    long long cur = 0;
    for(auto &i: a) {
      cur ^= i;
      if (cur == x) {
        ++cnt;
        cur = 0;
      }
    }
    std::cout << ((cnt & 1) && cnt > k ? "YES" : "NO") << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: This optimized version is based on the assumption that the input and output are being handled correctly as per the problem requirements. If there are any specific functional issues with the code, they would need to be addressed separately.
