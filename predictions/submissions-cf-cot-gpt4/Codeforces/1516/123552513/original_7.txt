The given program appears to be a competitive programming solution. The main optimizations possible here are:

1. Avoiding unnecessary type definitions.
2. Avoiding unnecessary macros.
3. Avoiding use of the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` directive.
4. Avoiding unnecessary use of `sync_with_stdio(0)`, `cin.tie(0)`, and `cin.exceptions(cin.failbit)`.
5. Avoiding use of the `each` macro which is equivalent to a range-based for loop.
6. Optimizing the solve function to avoid unnecessary operations.

Here is the optimized version:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <chrono>
#include <random>
using namespace std;

#define FOR(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); ++i)

void setIO(string S = "") {
  if (S.size()) {
    freopen((S + ".in").c_str(), "r", stdin);
    freopen((S + ".out").c_str(), "w", stdout);
  }
}

int main() {
  setIO();
  int TC;
  cin >> TC;
  FOR(i, 1, TC + 1) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int k = 2;
    vector<long long> a(n);
    long long x = 0;
    for(auto &i : a) {
      cin >> i;
      x ^= i;
    }
    if (x == 0) {
      cout << "YES\n";
      continue;
    }
    int cnt = 0;
    long long cur = 0;
    for(auto &i : a) {
      cur ^= i;
      if (cur == x) {
        ++cnt;
        cur = 0;
      }
    }
    cout << ((cnt & 1) && cnt > k ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized version, we simplified the function `solve` into the `main` function to remove the function call overhead. We also removed unnecessary type definitions and macros, optimizing the program for both running time and memory usage. The use of `each` macro was replaced by range-based for loops and verbose I/O operations were replaced by standard ones. The use of `sync_with_stdio(0)`, `cin.tie(0)`, and `cin.exceptions(cin.failbit)` was removed as there was no mixing of C and C++ I/O in the code. We also removed the RNG initialization as it was not being used in the program.
