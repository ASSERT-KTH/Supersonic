The given code is a competitive programming style code. It already appears to be optimized in terms of algorithmic efficiency, but there are a few points that can be improved:

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is generally considered bad practice because it includes more than necessary which can slow down the compilation time. Instead, include only those headers which are actually used in the code.

2. The use of `#define` for common operations is good, but overuse can make the code less readable. For instance, `#define f first` and `#define s second` can make the code harder to understand for someone who is not aware of these definitions.

3. The use of the `inline namespace IO` and the corresponding macros can also make the code less readable. Instead, we can use standard cin and cout statements for input and output.

4. The `setIO()` function can be removed if we are not reading from and writing to files.

5. Although the code is highly modularized, which is good, the `solve()` function can be simplified to improve readability.

Optimized Code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
#include <cassert>
#include <chrono>
#include <random>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

constexpr int pct(int x) { return __builtin_popcount(x); }
constexpr int bits(int x) {
  assert(x >= 0);
  return x == 0 ? 0 : 31 - __builtin_clz(x);
}
constexpr ll bits(ll x) {
  assert(x >= 0);
  return x == 0 ? 0 : 63 - __builtin_clzll(x);
}

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<ll> a(n);
    ll x = 0;
    for(auto& i : a) {
        cin >> i;
        x ^= i;
    }
    if (x == 0) {
        cout << "YES" << "\n";
        return;
    }
    int cnt = 0;
    ll cur = 0;
    for(auto& i : a) {
        cur ^= i;
        if (cur == x) {
            ++cnt;
            cur = 0;
        }
    }
    cout << (cnt & 1 && cnt > 2 ? "YES" : "NO") << "\n";
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    int TC;
    cin >> TC;
    while(TC--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This version of code removes unnecessary includes and `#define`s, improves readability by simplifying some parts of the code and uses standard cin and cout for input and output operations.
