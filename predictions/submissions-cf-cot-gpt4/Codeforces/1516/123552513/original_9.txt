This program seems already fairly optimized, but there are some steps that we can take to make it even more efficient:

1. Unnecessary macro definitions: The program defines a lot of macros that are not used in the code. Redefining them to use functions instead can make the code more readable and maintainable. Moreover, unused code increases the size of the executable file, which can result in higher memory usage. We should remove these unused macros.

2. Use of global variables: The program uses global variables (n, k, a) which can be moved to the local scope of main() and solve() functions. This will reduce the memory footprint of the program, as global variables stay in memory for the duration of the program, whereas local variables are removed from memory as soon as their function ends.

3. Use of `bits/stdc++.h`: This header file includes practically all the useful standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process significantly. It's better to include only the headers that are actually used in the program.

4. Use of `each(i, a)` macro: The macro is used to iterate over the array 'a'. Instead of this, we can use a range-based for loop, which is more readable and performs the same task.

5. The `setIO()` function: This function is used to set up input/output streams. The `cin.tie(0)->sync_with_stdio(0);` line is used to untie the cin and cout streams, which can speed up I/O operations, but only if we're not mixing cin/cout and scanf/printf. Since the program only uses cin and cout, we can remove this line.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <chrono>
#include <random>
#include <cassert>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

mt19937 rng((uint32_t)chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());

inline void setIO() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.exceptions(cin.failbit);
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  int k = 2;
  vector<ll> a(n);
  ll x = 0;
  for (auto &i : a) {
    cin >> i;
    x ^= i;
  }

  if (x == 0) {
    cout << "YES\n";
    return;
  }

  int cnt = 0;
  ll cur = 0;
  for (auto i : a) {
    cur ^= i;
    if (cur == x) {
      ++cnt;
      cur = 0;
    }
  }

  cout << ((cnt & 1) && cnt > k ? "YES" : "NO") << "\n";
}

int main() {
  setIO();
  int TC;
  cin >> TC;
  while (TC--) {
    solve();
  }
}
```

This version of the program should have reduced memory usage due to the removal of global variables and should compile faster due to the removal of the `bits/stdc++.h` include. The changes also make the code easier to read and understand.
