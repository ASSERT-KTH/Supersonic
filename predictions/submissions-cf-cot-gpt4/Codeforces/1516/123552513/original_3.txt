The given program is already quite optimized, but there are a few small changes which can be made to potentially improve it:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This code tends to include more files than necessary, which can slow down the compilation. It's better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This can lead to name conflicts, which can cause unexpected behaviors.

3. Replace `#define` with `const` or `constexpr`: The preprocessor `#define` does not respect scope and does not do type checking, which can lead to more difficult to detect bugs. `const` and `constexpr` are better alternatives.

4. Using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up console I/O.

5. Instead of using `freopen()` for file I/O, use `fstream` as it is more C++ style and less prone to errors.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
#include <chrono>
#include <random>
#include <assert.h>
#include <fstream>

using ll = long long;
using db = long double;
using pi = std::pair<int, int>;
using pl = std::pair<ll, ll>;
using pd = std::pair<db, db>;
using vi = std::vector<int>;
using vl = std::vector<ll>;
using vd = std::vector<db>;
using vpi = std::vector<pi>;
using vpl = std::vector<pl>;
using vpd = std::vector<pd>;
const int f = first;
const int s = second;
constexpr int OO = 1e18;
constexpr int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
constexpr int MX = 2005;
std::mt19937 rng((uint32_t)std::chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  // rest of your code
}
```

Remember that you should replace the rest of your code with the optimized version of your own. The most important thing is to always keep your code clean and understandable for others and for yourself.
