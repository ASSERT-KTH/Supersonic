The given code is already quite optimized. But there are still some minor improvements possible:

1. We can remove the 'using namespace std;' line and use 'std::' before cin, cout and max. This is because 'using namespace std;' can sometimes lead to name collision, especially in larger projects. 

2. We can put the 'int a, b, n;' declaration on separate lines for better readability.

3. We can add 'default' case in switch statement to improve robustness of the code. It would prevent undefined behavior if 'n' somehow doesn't match any of the case values.

4. We can directly calculate the value of 'n' in the switch statement without storing it in a variable. This may make a slight improvement in memory usage.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a;
  int b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  
  switch (7 - std::max(a, b)) {
  case 1:
    std::cout << "1/6";
    break;
  case 2:
    std::cout << "1/3";
    break;
  case 3:
    std::cout << "1/2";
    break;
  case 4:
    std::cout << "2/3";
    break;
  case 5:
    std::cout << "5/6";
    break;
  case 6:
    std::cout << "1/1";
    break;
  default:
    std::cout << "Invalid input";
    break;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Keep in mind that these are minor optimizations and may not result in noticeable improvements in real world usage.
