This program takes two inputs, finds the maximum one, subtracts it from 7 and then prints a string representation of a fraction based on the result.

Here is a step-by-step optimization process:

1. Remove `using namespace std;`. Although this is not a performance optimization, it's a good practice to avoid potential name collisions and ambiguities. You will need to prefix `cin`, `cout` and `max` with `std::`.

2. Instead of using `std::max` function, use a conditional operator (ternary operator). The `std::max` function could be a little bit slower due to the function call.

3. You could store the string representations of the fractions in an array and index it directly using the calculated value. This will remove the need for the `switch` statement which could be slower due to branching.

Here is the optimized code:

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a, b, n;
    std::cin >> a >> b;
    n = 7 - ((a > b) ? a : b);
    const char* fractions[] = {"", "1/6", "1/3", "1/2", "2/3", "5/6", "1/1"};
    std::cout << fractions[n];
    return 0;
}
```

In the optimized version, we use an array `fractions` to store the string representations of the fractions. The array is indexed directly using the calculated value `n`, eliminating the need for the `switch` statement.
