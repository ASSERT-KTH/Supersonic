Step 1: Use array instead of switch-case

Instead of using a "switch-case" block, you can use an array to store the results. This way, you won't have to compare "n" with each case one by one. You can directly access the result using the index, which is faster.

Step 2: Avoid using "std" namespace

Avoiding the use of the "std" namespace can prevent naming conflicts. 

Step 3: Eliminate unnecessary variable "n"

We don't need to use an extra variable "n". We can directly use the expression "7-max(a, b)" as an index to access the array.

The optimized program is as follows:

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  const char* results[] = {"1/6", "1/3", "1/2", "2/3", "5/6", "1/1"};
  std::cout << results[7 - std::max(a, b) - 1];
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program uses less memory (because it doesn't need to store the intermediate result in "n") and runs faster (because it avoids the "switch-case" block).

Note that we subtract 1 from the index because arrays are 0-based in C++.
