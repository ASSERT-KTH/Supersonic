Optimization Steps:

1. We can remove the usage of variable 'n' and directly put the expression inside the switch statement.
2. Instead of using cout for each case in switch, we can use an array of strings to store the results and directly print the result based on the index. This will reduce the number of lines and improve readability.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  string results[] = {"1/6", "1/3", "1/2", "2/3", "5/6", "1/1"};
  cout << results[6 - max(a, b)];
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

- `max(a, b)` gives the maximum of a and b.
- `6 - max(a, b)` gives the index for the corresponding result in the `results` array.
- `results[6 - max(a, b)]` will give the required result which is then printed using `cout`.
