The given program looks like it's trying to solve a competitive programming problem. It reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), then for each test case it reads an integer `n` (number of elements) and a sequence of integers `v` (elements). For each element in the sequence, it counts how many times it appears, sorts the sequence, then calculates some dynamic programming `dp` array based on divisors of each element. Finally, it calculates and outputs the difference between the number of elements and the maximum value in the `dp` array.

Optimizations:

1. The `sort(v.begin(), v.end())` operation is not used anywhere in the code. Removing this operation will save time spent on unnecessary sorting, making the program faster.

2. The `vector<long long> cnt(2e5 + 1, 0);` creates a large vector with size 200001 to count the values. However, we could use a `map<long long, long long> cnt;` instead. This reduces the memory usage from a fixed 200001 elements to only as many elements as there are distinct values in the sequence.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#define LSOne(S) ((S) & -(S))
const long long P = 1e9 + 7;
const double EPS = 1e-11;
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<long long> v(n);
    map<long long, long long> cnt;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> v[i];
      cnt[v[i]]++;
    }
    vector<long long> dp(2e5 + 1, 0);
    long long best = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < dp.size(); i++) {
      if (cnt[i] == 0)
        continue;
      for (int j = 2; j <= sqrt(i); j++) {
        if (i % j == 0) {
          dp[i] = max(dp[i], max(dp[j], dp[i / j]));
        }
      }
      dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[1]);
      dp[i] += cnt[i];
      best = max(best, dp[i]);
    }
    cout << n - best << '\n';
  }
}
```

This optimized code will run faster and use less memory than the original code.
