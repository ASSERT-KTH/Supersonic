The given program calculates the maximum number of same elements in an array and calculates how many elements need to be removed to leave only equal elements in the array. The program is optimized for running time and memory usage.

There are several opportunities for optimization in this code:

1. Avoiding unnecessary computation: The inner loop that starts with `for (int j = 2; j <= sqrt(i); j++)` checks the divisibility of `i` with all numbers from 2 to sqrt(i). This is unnecessary as we only need to check divisibility with the prime numbers up to sqrt(i). However, generating these prime numbers also has a cost. So, a better approach would be to loop from 2*i to `n` with a step of `i`. This will check all multiples of `i` which is more relevant for our problem.

2. Avoiding unnecessary memory usage: The `cnt` and `dp` vectors are declared with a size of 2e5 + 1. This could potentially waste a lot of memory if `n` is much less than 2e5. A more memory efficient approach would be to declare these vectors with a size of `n+1`.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define LSOne(S) ((S) & -(S))
const long long P = 1e9 + 7;
const double EPS = 1e-11;
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<long long> v(n);
    vector<long long> cnt(n+1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> v[i];
      cnt[v[i]]++;
    }
    sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    vector<long long> dp(n+1, 0);
    long long best = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      if (cnt[i] == 0)
        continue;
      for (int j = i*2; j <= n; j += i) {
        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j]);
      }
      dp[i] += cnt[i];
      best = max(best, dp[i]);
    }
    cout << n - best << '\n';
  }
}
```

This optimized code is more efficient in terms of memory and CPU usage.
