To optimize this program, we will do several steps:

1. Remove unnecessary standard template library (STL) includes. The libraries <algorithm>, <climits>, <cmath>, <iomanip>, <iterator>, <list>, <map>, <numeric>, <queue>, <set>, <stack>, <tuple> are not being used in this program, so they can be safely removed. This will slightly reduce the compilation time.

2. The vector cnt is being initialized with a size of 2e5 + 1, which may be unnecessary if the input numbers are small. Instead, we can initialize it with the maximum number in the input array, which will reduce the memory usage.

3. Rather than checking all the numbers up to sqrt(i) for each i, we can iterate over the multiples of each number in the cnt array. This will reduce the number of operations, thus optimizing the program for running time.

4. The call to sort the vector v is not necessary and can be removed. The sorted order of the vector is not used anywhere in the program.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define LSOne(S) ((S) & -(S))
const long long P = 1e9 + 7;
const double EPS = 1e-11;
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<long long> v(n);
    int max_val = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> v[i];
      max_val = max(max_val, (int)v[i]);
    }
    vector<long long> cnt(max_val + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cnt[v[i]]++;
    }
    vector<long long> dp(max_val + 1, 0);
    long long best = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= max_val; i++) {
      if (cnt[i] == 0)
        continue;
      for (int j = i; j <= max_val; j += i) {
        dp[j] = max(dp[j], max(dp[i], dp[j / i]));
      }
      dp[i] += cnt[i];
      best = max(best, dp[i]);
    }
    cout << n - best << '\n';
  }
}
```

Please note that the actual improvement in running time and memory usage will depend on the specific input data. These optimizations aim to reduce the computational complexity and memory usage in general cases.
