This program's main bottleneck seems to be the nested loop where it iterates from 2 to sqrt(i) for every i from 1 to dp.size(). That part of the code has a time complexity of O(n*sqrt(n)) which can be quite expensive for large inputs. 

A better approach for this part could be to iterate over multiples of i instead. This way, we can avoid unnecessary iterations and the time complexity becomes O(n log(n)).

The overall optimization would be:

1. Replace the loop `for (int j = 2; j <= sqrt(i); j++)` with `for (int j = i; j < dp.size(); j += i)`.
2. Inside the loop, update dp[j] based on dp[i] and cnt[j].

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <cmath>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <list>
#include <map>
#include <numeric>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <stack>
#include <tuple>
#include <vector>
#define LSOne(S) ((S) & -(S))
const long long P = 1e9 + 7;
const double EPS = 1e-11;
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<long long> v(n);
    vector<long long> cnt(2e5 + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> v[i];
      cnt[v[i]]++;
    }
    sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    vector<long long> dp(2e5 + 1, 0);
    long long best = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < dp.size(); i++) {
      if (cnt[i] == 0)
        continue;
      for (int j = i; j < dp.size(); j += i) {
        dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[i] + cnt[j]); // Updating dp[j] based on dp[i] and cnt[j]
      }
      best = max(best, dp[i]);
    }
    cout << n - best << '\n';
  }
}
```
This optimized program should have a better performance for large inputs. It's worth noting that this optimization assumes that the input numbers will be distributed more or less evenly. If there are lots of repeated numbers in the input, the original program might perform better.
