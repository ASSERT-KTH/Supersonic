In this code, there are a few areas where we can optimize for both memory usage and running time. 

1. The vector 'cnt' is initialized with a size of 2e5 + 1 and all zeroes. If we analyze the code, 'cnt' is used to count the occurrences of elements in 'v'. It is possible that we are not using the entire size of 'cnt' which would lead to wasted memory. We can replace it with a map which only stores the elements that exist and their counts.

2. Similarly, the vector 'dp' is also initialized with a size of 2e5 + 1 and all zeroes. It is used to store the result of some computation based on the elements in 'v'. Again, it is possible that we are not using the entire size of 'dp' which would lead to wasted memory. We can replace it with a map which only stores the results for the elements that exist.

3. The inner loop is iterating from 2 to sqrt(i). Instead of checking every number, we can check only the divisors of 'i', which will reduce the number of iterations.

Let's implement these changes:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <cmath>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <list>
#include <map>
#include <numeric>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <stack>
#include <tuple>
#include <vector>
#define LSOne(S) ((S) & -(S))
const long long P = 1e9 + 7;
const double EPS = 1e-11;
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<long long> v(n);
    map<long long, long long> cnt;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> v[i];
      cnt[v[i]]++;
    }
    sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    map<long long, long long> dp;
    long long best = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= v.back(); i++) {
      if (cnt[i] == 0)
        continue;
      for (int j = 1; j * j <= i; j++) {
        if (i % j == 0) {
          if (j != i/j) {
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], max(dp[j], dp[i / j]));
          } else {
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j]);
          }
        }
      }
      dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[1]);
      dp[i] += cnt[i];
      best = max(best, dp[i]);
    }
    cout << n - best << '\n';
  }
}
```

Please note that while this code may be more memory efficient, using maps instead of vectors can cause a slowdown due to the overhead of maintaining a balanced binary search tree in a map. This trade-off between time and space complexity should be considered based on the specific requirements of your application.
