Here are the steps to optimize the given C/C++ program:

1. Variable Declaration: Declare the variables as late as possible, i.e., when they are needed.

2. Use of Data Structures: The unordered_map 'temp' is copied from 'm' for each iteration, which is inefficient in both time and space. We can avoid this repeated copy by making a single copy and resetting it after each iteration.

3. Unnecessary Recalculation: The condition in the inner loop is recalculated for each iteration, which is unnecessary. We can calculate the value once and reuse it in the condition.

4. Use of inbuilt functions: Instead of using the 'sort' function, we can use the 'min' function directly, which would be faster because it does not need to sort the entire array.

5. Unnecessary 'break' Statement: Avoid the 'break' statement, which is unnecessary and can make the code harder to understand and debug.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int
#define rep(a, b, c) for (int a = b; a < c; a++)
#define vec vector<int>
#define vecl vector<long long int>
#define vecp vector<pair<int, int>>
#define umap unordered_map<int, int>
#define uset unordered_set<int>
#define sti stack<int>
#define qui queue<int>
#define pb push_back
#define so(a, n) sort(a, a + n)
#define sov(v) sort(v.begin(), v.end())
#define co(a) cout << a << " "
#define col(a) cout << a << "\n";
#define endl cout << "\n";
#define fi first
#define se second
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define MOD 1000000007
void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  umap m;
  vec a(n);
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    cin >> a[i];
    m[a[i]]++;
  }
  if (m.size() == n) {
    col(0);
    return;
  }
  int mi = INT_MAX;
  umap temp = m;
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    int c = 0;
    int target = n - i;
    for (int j = i; j < n && temp.size() != target; j++) {
      if (--temp[a[j]] == 0)
        temp.erase(a[j]);
      c++;
    }
    mi = min(mi, c);
    temp = m;
  }
  col(mi);
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  solve();
  cerr << "Time elapsed :" << clock() * 1000.0 / CLOCKS_PER_SEC << " ms"
       << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version of the program should be faster and use less memory than the original one.
