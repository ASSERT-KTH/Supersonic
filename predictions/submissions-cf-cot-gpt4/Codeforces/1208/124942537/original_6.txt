This C++ program seems to solve an optimization problem where it is trying to find the minimum length of a subarray that can be removed so that all remaining elements in the array are unique.

Let's optimize the program:

1. Reduction of #define statements: The #define statements in the beginning are not necessarily the best way to define these types and functions. It's better to directly use them in the code for better readability and understanding. However, as we should not completely rewrite the code, we will leave them as is.

2. Use of vector instead of a raw array: Raw arrays in C++ do not check for bounds and can cause unexpected behavior, e.g. buffer overflow. As such, it's generally better to use vectors which are safer and easier to use.

3. Avoid copying entire map in every iteration: The most critical optimization will be to avoid copying the entire map in every loop iteration. This operation is very costly in terms of time and memory. Instead, we can directly operate on the original map.

4. Avoid using break statement: We can eliminate the break statement by modifying our condition in the inner loop.

After these optimizations, the optimized code would look like:

```C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define ll long long int
#define rep(a, b, c) for (int a = b; a < c; a++)
#define vec vector<int>
#define vecl vector<long long int>
#define vecp vector<pair<int, int>>
#define umap unordered_map<int, int>
#define uset unordered_set<int>
#define sti stack<int>
#define qui queue<int>
#define pb push_back
#define so(a, n) sort(a, a + n)
#define sov(v) sort(v.begin(), v.end())
#define co(a) cout << a << " "
#define col(a) cout << a << "\n"
#define endl cout << "\n"
#define fi first
#define se second
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define MOD 1000000007

void solve() {
  unordered_map<int, int> m;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    cin >> a[i];
    m[a[i]]++;
  }
  if (m.size() == n) {
    col(0);
    return;
  }
  int mi = INT_MAX;
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    int c = 0;
    for (int j = i; j < n && m.size() != (n - c); j++) {
      m[a[j]]--;
      if (m[a[j]] == 0)
        m.erase(a[j]);
      c++;
      mi = min(mi, c);
    }
    m.clear();
    rep(k, i+1, n) {
      m[a[k]]++;
    }
  }
  col(mi);
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int t = 1;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  cerr << "Time elapsed :" << clock() * 1000.0 / CLOCKS_PER_SEC << " ms"
       << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
The optimization in this code reduces the time and space complexity by avoiding unnecessary copying of the map and using vector instead of raw arrays for safety and ease of use.
