The program given above has a significant time complexity because of nested loops in the solve() function. The outer loop goes from 0 to n, and the inner loop also goes from i to n, which makes the worst-case time complexity of the program as O(n^2). 

The memory usage of the program is also high because it uses two unordered maps, 'm' and 'temp', to store the elements and their frequency, which can be a lot if 'n' is a large number.

Optimization Steps:

1. We can avoid the use of the 'temp' unordered map. Instead of creating a copy of 'm' in each iteration, we can use one unordered map and decrement the counts as we go on. If a count becomes zero, we can remove the element from the map.

2. To avoid the use of two loops, we can use the two-pointer technique. Instead of checking all subarrays, we can start with the largest subarray and try to reduce its size. We can maintain two pointers 'i' and 'j'. Initially, 'i' can be set to 0 and 'j' can be set to n-1. We can decrement 'j' as long as the size of the map is less than 'j - i + 1'. If it's not possible, we can increment 'i'.

void solve() {
  unordered_map<int, int> m;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    cin >> a[i];
    m[a[i]]++;
  }
  if (m.size() == n) {
    col(0);
    return;
  }
  int mi = n;
  for(int i = 0, j = n - 1; i <= j; ) {
    if(m.size() < j - i + 1) {
      m[a[j]]--;
      if(m[a[j]] == 0) {
        m.erase(a[j]);
      }
      j--;
    } else {
      mi = min(mi, j - i + 1);
      m[a[i]]--;
      if(m[a[i]] == 0) {
        m.erase(a[i]);
      }
      i++;
    }
  }
  col(mi);
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int t = 1;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  cerr << "Time elapsed :" << clock() * 1000.0 / CLOCKS_PER_SEC << " ms"
       << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized program, the time complexity is reduced to O(n) because we are visiting each element only once. The space complexity is also reduced because we are using only one unordered map.
