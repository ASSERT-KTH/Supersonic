This program seems to be solving a problem where it needs to find the minimum length of a subarray such that the remaining elements form a distinct set. However, the current program does a lot of repeated work in the inner loop of the `solve` function. Each time the outer loop iterates, it creates a copy of the entire map `m` and then reduces this copy in the inner loop.

We can optimize this by keeping track of the distinct elements in the current subarray and the total distinct elements in the original array. If we encounter a duplicate element, we move the start of the subarray forward until we remove one instance of this duplicate. This way, we do not need to copy the entire map for each subarray, and we do not need to iterate through the entire array for each starting position.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Keep a `unordered_map<int, int> current` to track the current elements in the subarray.
2. Keep a `int distinct` to track the total distinct elements in the original array.
3. Keep a `int start` to track the start of the current subarray.
4. Iterate through the array. When you encounter an element, increase its count in `current`. If its count is 1, increase `distinct`.
5. If `distinct` is equal to the size of `current`, check if this subarray is smaller than `mi`. If it is, update `mi`.
6. If the count of the current element in `current` is more than 1 (meaning we have a duplicate), move `start` forward until we remove one instance of this duplicate.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  unordered_map<int, int> m;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int a[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    m[a[i]]++;
  }
  
  int distinct = m.size();
  
  if (distinct == n) {
    cout << 0 << "\n";
    return;
  }

  int start = 0, mi = INT_MAX;
  unordered_map<int, int> current;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    current[a[i]]++;
    while (current[a[i]] > 1) {
      current[a[start]]--;
      if (current[a[start]] == 0) {
        current.erase(a[start]);
      }
      start++;
    }
    if (current.size() == distinct) {
      mi = min(mi, i - start + 1);
    }
  }
  
  cout << mi << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int t = 1;
  while (t--)
    solve();

  cerr << "Time elapsed :" << clock() * 1000.0 / CLOCKS_PER_SEC << " ms"
       << '\n';
  
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The optimization suggested here reduces the time complexity to O(n) from O(n^2) in the worst case scenario. However, the memory usage remains the same, since we are still using two unordered_maps to store the elements and their counts.
