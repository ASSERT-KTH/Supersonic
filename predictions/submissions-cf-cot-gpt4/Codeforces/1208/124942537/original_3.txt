The program you provided uses a lot of resources for memory and running time. The main reason is the use of nested loops and unnecessary copying of unordered_map 'm' to 'temp' in each iteration of the outer loop. 

Here are the steps to optimize this program:

1. Avoid copying the unordered_map in each outer loop iteration: A new unordered_map 'temp' is created and assigned the same values as 'm' in each iteration of the outer loop. This operation is unnecessary and consumes a lot of memory. Instead, we can manipulate 'm' directly and refresh it after the outer loop.

2. Reduce the number of unordered_map operations: In the inner loop, the program checks if 'temp[a[j]]' equals 0, and if so, erases 'a[j]' from 'temp'. Erasing an element from a map consumes more resources than necessary. Instead, we can create a counter to track the number of unique elements.

3. Reduce the number of iterations in the inner loop: Currently, the program has a time complexity of O(n^2) because it iterates through the entire array 'a' for each element of 'a'. We can optimize this by using the sliding window technique, which moves the start and end of the window one step at a time, thereby reducing the time complexity to O(n).

Now, let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  unordered_map<int, int> m;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    m[a[i]]++;
  }
  if (m.size() == n) {
    cout << 0 << "\n";
    return;
  }
  int mi = INT_MAX;
  unordered_map<int, int> temp = m;
  int count = temp.size();
  int start = 0, end = 0;
  while (start < n && end < n) {
    if (temp[a[end]] > 1) {
      temp[a[end]]--;
      end++;
    } else if (start != end) {
      temp[a[start]]++;
      start++;
    } else {
        end++;
        start++;
    }
    if (count == (n - (end - start))) {
      mi = min(mi, end - start);
    }
  }
  cout << mi << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif

  int t = 1;
  while (t--)
    solve();

  cerr << "Time elapsed :" << clock() * 1000.0 / CLOCKS_PER_SEC << " ms"
       << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program should have significantly improved running time and memory usage compared to the original program.
