Optimizations:

1. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h` as it includes all the standard libraries, which can increase the compile time. Instead, only include the necessary libraries.
2. Avoid using `#define` for for-loop (`rep(a, b, c)`) and other standard functions or data types. It does not improve performance and makes the code harder to read and debug.
3. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(NULL);` only when you are mixing `cin/cout` with `scanf/printf`. If not, remove them as they can cause unnecessary overhead.
4. Avoid using `temp = m;` inside the loop, as it involves creating a copy of the map on each iteration which can increase time complexity. Instead, create the copy outside the loop and reset only when necessary.
5. Avoid using `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` directive unless you're specifically coding on an online platform. It's better to use command line arguments to handle input/output from files.
6. `m.size() == n` check is unnecessary, you can just check `m.size()` and if it's less than `n`, then there are duplicates, otherwise not.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
  unordered_map<int, int> m;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    m[a[i]]++;
  }
  
  if (m.size() < n) {
    int mi = INT_MAX;
    unordered_map<int, int> temp(m);
    int c = 0;
  
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (i != 0) { // Reset temp and c only if i != 0
        temp = m;
        c = 0;
      }
      for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
        temp[a[j]]--;
        if (temp[a[j]] == 0)
          temp.erase(a[j]);
        c++;
        if (temp.size() == (n - c)) {
          mi = min(mi, c);
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << mi << "\n";
  } else {
    cout << 0 << "\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  while(t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

In your code, the most costly part is the nested loop which has a time complexity of O(n^2). Unfortunately, without changing the core logic of your code, we can't reduce this time complexity. However, the suggested optimizations can still help to reduce some unnecessary operations.
