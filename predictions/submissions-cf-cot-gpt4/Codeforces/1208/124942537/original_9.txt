This program has two main areas where it can be optimized:

1. The input array `a` has a static size which is not recommended. Dynamic allocation should be used instead.
2. The nested loop in the `solve` function gives this code a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not efficient. We can improve this by eliminating the need for the inner loop.

Optimized Steps:

1. Instead of using a static array `a`, we can use a vector. This way, we won't have to worry about the size of the array at compile time. Also, vectors are more efficient as they can grow dynamically.
2. We can eliminate the need for the inner loop by using two pointers, `start` and `end`. We can iterate through the array, and whenever we encounter a value that we have already seen (which we can check using the map `m`), we can increment `start` until the value at `end` is unique again. This way, we are essentially "sliding" our window over the array, and the size of our window will be the current minimum number of unique elements.
3. We can reduce the number of calls to the `col` function by using a local variable to hold the result and outputting it at the end of the function.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int
#define rep(a, b, c) for (int a = b; a < c; a++)
#define vec vector<int>
#define vecl vector<long long int>
#define vecp vector<pair<int, int>>
#define umap unordered_map<int, int>
#define uset unordered_set<int>
#define sti stack<int>
#define qui queue<int>
#define pb push_back
#define so(a, n) sort(a, a + n)
#define sov(v) sort(v.begin(), v.end())
#define co(a) cout << a << " "
#define col(a) cout << a << "\n";
#define endl cout << "\n";
#define fi first
#define se second
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define MOD 1000000007
void solve() {
  unordered_map<int, int> m;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    cin >> a[i];
    m[a[i]]++;
  }
  if (m.size() == n) {
    col(0);
    return;
  }
  int mi = INT_MAX;
  int start = 0;
  m.clear();
  for (int end = 0; end < n; end++) {
    m[a[end]]++;
    while (m[a[end]] > 1) {
      m[a[start]]--;
      start++;
    }
    mi = min(mi, end - start + 1);
  }
  col(mi);
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int t = 1;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  cerr << "Time elapsed :" << clock() * 1000.0 / CLOCKS_PER_SEC << " ms"
       << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code should run faster and use less memory than the original version, while producing the same results.
