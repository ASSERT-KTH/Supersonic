The given program seems to be calculating the minimum length of the subarray which needs to be removed to make the array distinct (no duplicate elements). The main problem with the code is that it is using two nested loops which makes the time complexity of the solution O(n^2). This might not be efficient for larger inputs. 

We can optimize this by using the sliding window technique. Here's how:

1. We first calculate the frequency of each number in the array.
2. We start from the 0th index and keep moving towards end. Each time we move, we decrease the frequency of the current element by 1. 
3. If we find an element which is not present in our frequency map, it means we have found all distinct elements till now. So, we keep track of this length.
4. We now move the starting pointer of our window towards the end until we find a duplicate element. We keep on updating our minimum length during this process.
5. We keep on doing this until we reach the end of our array.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int
#define rep(a, b, c) for (int a = b; a < c; a++)
#define vec vector<int>
#define vecl vector<long long int>
#define vecp vector<pair<int, int>>
#define umap unordered_map<int, int>
#define uset unordered_set<int>
#define sti stack<int>
#define qui queue<int>
#define pb push_back
#define so(a, n) sort(a, a + n)
#define sov(v) sort(v.begin(), v.end())
#define co(a) cout << a << " "
#define col(a) cout << a << "\n";
#define endl cout << "\n";
#define fi first
#define se second
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define MOD 1000000007
void solve() {
  unordered_map<int, int> m;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int a[n];
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    cin >> a[i];
    m[a[i]]++;
  }
  if (m.size() == n) {
    col(0);
    return;
  }
  int mi = INT_MAX;
  int counter = m.size();
  int start = 0;
  for(int end = 0; end < n; end++) {
    m[a[end]]--;
    if(m[a[end]] == 0) counter--;
    while(counter == 0) {
      mi = min(mi, end-start+1);
      m[a[start]]++;
      if(m[a[start]] > 0) counter++;
      start++;
    }
  }
  col(mi);
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int t = 1;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  cerr << "Time elapsed :" << clock() * 1000.0 / CLOCKS_PER_SEC << " ms"
       << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program has a time complexity of O(n) and could handle larger inputs more efficiently.
