The given program is a graph traversal program using the breadth first search algorithm (BFS). It seems to be implemented correctly, but there are a few places where we can optimize for speed and memory.

1. Include Necessary Libraries: Including "bits/stdc++.h" in C++ programs is not a good practice as it includes all the standard libraries, which increases the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries.

2. Avoid Global Variables: Global variables can increase memory usage and decrease performance. In this case, vector 'v' and boolean array 'vis' can be moved to the main function to avoid making them global.

3. Use Fast Input/Output: Using scanf and printf instead of cin and cout can significantly increase the speed of input and output.

4. Use reserve() for vector: If you know the maximum size of your vector, use the reserve() function to preallocate memory. This can potentially reduce the number of memory reallocations and copying of the entire vector when the vector needs to grow.

5. Avoid Redundant Visits: In your BFS function, you are marking a node as visited twice, once at the start and once inside the while loop. This is redundant. You only need to mark a node as visited once when it's first discovered.

6. Use 'emplace_back' Instead of 'push_back': The 'emplace_back' function constructs the element in-place, whereas 'push_back' constructs it and then copies or moves it into the vector. So 'emplace_back' can be more efficient.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <cstdio>

using namespace std;

void bfs(int u, vector<vector<int>>& v, vector<bool>& vis, int& nn, int& ne) {
  nn = 0, ne = 0;
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(u);
  vis[u] = true;
  while (!q.empty()) {
    u = q.front();
    q.pop();
    nn++;
    if (v[u].size() == 2)
      ne++;
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)v[u].size(); i++) {
      int p = v[u][i];
      if (!vis[p]) {
        vis[p] = true;
        q.push(p);
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int i, n, m, a, b, c = 0;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  vector<vector<int>> v(n+1);
  vector<bool> vis(n+1, false);
  int nn, ne;
  while (m--) {
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    v[a].emplace_back(b);
    v[b].emplace_back(a);
  }
  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (!vis[i]) {
      bfs(i, v, vis, nn, ne);
      if (nn == ne)
        c++;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", c);
  return 0;
}
```
