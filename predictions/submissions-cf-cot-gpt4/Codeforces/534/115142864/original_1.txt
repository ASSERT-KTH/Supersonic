The program is a dynamic programming (DP) solution to a problem. In general, the optimization process involves minimizing the amount of redundant computation and memory usage. Here are the steps to optimize this program.

1. Reducing the Recursion Depth: The function `f(int tt, int speed)` is a recursive function that can potentially lead to a stack overflow if `t` is large. To avoid this, you can use a bottom-up approach where you iteratively fill up the dp table from the base case to the final result.

2. Removing Unnecessary Computation: In the function `f(int tt, int speed)`, the loop iterates from `0` to `d` inclusive. However, the function `f(tt + 1, speed - i)` is only executed if `speed - i >= 0`. This means that for `i > speed`, `f(tt + 1, speed - i)` is never executed. Therefore, the loop should only iterate from `0` to `min(speed, d)`.

3. Use of Global Variables: The use of global variables makes it harder to understand the program and can lead to errors. The variables `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d` should be passed as arguments to the function `f(int tt, int speed)`. However, this might not lead to performance improvement but it will make your code more manageable and readable.

Here is the optimized code:
```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;
const int N = 1234;
long long dp[N][N];

long long f(int tt, int speed, int t, int v2, int d) {
  if (tt == t) {
    return speed == v2 ? v2 : -1e10;
  }
  if (dp[tt][speed] != -1) {
    return dp[tt][speed];
  }
  long long x = -1e9;
  for (int i = 0; i <= min(speed, d); ++i) {
    x = max(x, f(tt + 1, speed + i, t, v2, d));
    if (speed - i >= 0) {
      x = max(x, f(tt + 1, speed - i, t, v2, d));
    }
  }
  return dp[tt][speed] = speed + x;
}

int main() {
  int v1, v2, t, d;
  scanf("%d %d %d %d", &v1, &v2, &t, &d);
  memset(dp, -1, sizeof dp);
  printf("%lld\n", f(1, v1, t, v2, d));
  return 0;
}
```
This optimization is minor and won't have a significant effect on runtime or memory usage. If the inputs were larger and the recursion depth was a problem, then a bottom-up approach would be more beneficial. The real bottleneck in this code is the fact that it's doing a lot of redundant computation due to overlapping subproblems, which is inherent to the problem it's solving and can't be easily optimized away. The dynamic programming approach is already addressing this issue by caching and reusing the results of subproblems.
