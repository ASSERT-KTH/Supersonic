This program seems to use a recursive function `f()` with a memoization table `dp[][]`. It looks like it is implementing a type of dynamic programming algorithm. 

The first optimization I can see is to remove unnecessary recursion calls. This could be achieved by changing the loop that calls the `f()` function twice inside. But, we can calculate the maximum value for the next speed in the range [speed - d, speed + d] in one line instead of checking every value in the range.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;
const int N = 1234;
long long dp[N][N];
int v1, v2, t, d;
long long f(int tt, int speed) {
  if (tt == t) {
    return speed == v2 ? v2 : -1e10;
  }
  if (dp[tt][speed] != -1) {
    return dp[tt][speed];
  }
  long long x = -1e9;
  int lower_limit = max(0, speed - d);
  int upper_limit = speed + d;
  for (int i = lower_limit; i <= upper_limit; ++i) {
    x = max(x, f(tt + 1, i));
  }
  return dp[tt][speed] = speed + x;
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d %d %d %d", &v1, &v2, &t, &d);
  memset(dp, -1, sizeof dp);
  printf("%lld\n", f(1, v1));
  return 0;
}
```

In this version, we calculate the lower and upper limit for the speed in the next moment and loop through this range to get the maximum value. This modification reduces the amount of recursive calls and therefore optimizes the running time. 

Please note that this optimization is effective when the variable `d` (the maximum change in speed) is relatively small compared to the current `speed`. If `d` is relatively large, this optimization may not have a significant impact on the running time.
