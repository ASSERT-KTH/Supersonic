The given C/C++ program is a dynamic programming problem which is used to calculate the maximum possible total speed. For each time step and for each speed, it tries out all possible speed changes (increase or decrease by at most `d`) and then takes the maximum of these.

The main optimization that can be applied here is to reduce the number of recursive calls to the function `f`. Right now, the function is called twice inside the loop for every speed change `i`. By reordering the conditions, we can reduce this to one function call per loop iteration. Specifically, we can first check if `speed - i >= 0`, and if true, call `f(tt + 1, speed - i)`. Otherwise, call `f(tt + 1, speed + i)`.

Additionally, we can also reduce the size of the `dp` array. Right now, it is declared as a 2D array with dimensions `[N][N]`, where `N` is a constant equal to 1234. However, based on the input values, it is likely that not all of these `N * N` elements are needed. Instead, we can declare `dp` as a 2D array with dimensions `[t+1][max(v1, v2) + t * d]`, which should be sufficient for all possible time steps and speeds. This optimization can potentially save a lot of memory if `N` is significantly larger than the maximum needed size.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;
int v1, v2, t, d;
long long f(int tt, int speed, vector<vector<long long>>& dp) {
  if (tt == t) {
    return speed == v2 ? v2 : -1e10;
  }
  if (dp[tt][speed] != -1) {
    return dp[tt][speed];
  }
  long long x = -1e9;
  for (int i = 0; i <= d; ++i) {
    if (speed - i >= 0) {
      x = max(x, f(tt + 1, speed - i, dp));
    } else {
      x = max(x, f(tt + 1, speed + i, dp));
    }
  }
  return dp[tt][speed] = speed + x;
}
int main() {
  scanf("%d %d %d %d", &v1, &v2, &t, &d);
  vector<vector<long long>> dp(t + 1, vector<long long>(max(v1, v2) + t * d, -1));
  printf("%lld\n", f(1, v1, dp));
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized program, the function `f` has an additional parameter `dp`, which is a reference to the `dp` array. This is required because in C++, arrays (and vectors) are passed by value, so any changes made to `dp` inside the function would not be reflected outside. By passing `dp` as a reference, we ensure that any updates made to `dp` inside the function are also visible outside.
