Here are the steps we can follow to optimize the given program:

1. First, we notice that the function `f` is called recursively for the same values multiple times. This leads to unnecessary computation. We can avoid this by storing the computed results for each pair of values `(tt, speed)` in a 2D array `dp`. This technique is known as memoization.

2. Second, we observe that the `for` loop inside the function `f` iterates from 0 to `d`. However, the function `f` is called twice inside the loop. This can be optimized by calling the function only once per iteration and storing the result in a variable. This will help to reduce the number of recursive calls.

3. We notice that the program includes `bits/stdc++.h`, which is a header file that includes all the standard library header files. This is generally not recommended because it can lead to slower compilation times. It is better to include only the necessary header files.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
const int N = 1234;
long long dp[N][N];
int v1, v2, t, d;
long long f(int tt, int speed) {
  if (tt == t) {
    return speed == v2 ? v2 : -1e10;
  }
  if (dp[tt][speed] != -1) {
    return dp[tt][speed];
  }
  long long x = -1e9;
  for (int i = 0; i <= d; ++i) {
    long long temp = f(tt + 1, abs(speed - i));
    x = max(x, temp);
  }
  return dp[tt][speed] = speed + x;
}
int main() {
  scanf("%d %d %d %d", &v1, &v2, &t, &d);
  memset(dp, -1, sizeof dp);
  printf("%lld\n", f(1, v1));
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized version, the function `f` is called only once per iteration inside the loop. The absolute value of `(speed - i)` is passed as the second argument to ensure that it is always non-negative. This saves computational time and also reduces memory usage. Also, only the necessary header files are included.
