Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid Recomputation: The given program uses recursion and often recalculates the same value many times. We can avoid this by storing the computed values in a data structure. This technique is known as memoization. In this program, it's already been used, but we will make sure it's used correctly.

2. Limit the Loop: In the function `f(int tt, int speed)`, there is a loop that runs `d` number of times where `d` is the input. But the `speed` is not always allowed to change by `d` because `speed` can never be less than zero. To optimize the loop, we can calculate the upper limit for `i` using `min(d, speed)` instead of `d`.

3. Use Fast I/O Methods: Here, `scanf` and `printf` are used for input and output operations which are slower compared to other methods. We can use `std::cin` and `std::cout` with `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up the I/O operations.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;
const int N = 1234;
long long dp[N][N];
int v1, v2, t, d;
long long f(int tt, int speed) {
  if (tt == t) {
    return speed == v2 ? v2 : -1e10;
  }
  if (dp[tt][speed] != -1) {
    return dp[tt][speed];
  }
  long long x = -1e9;
  int upper_limit = min(d, speed);
  for (int i = 0; i <= upper_limit; ++i) {
    x = max(x, f(tt + 1, speed + i));
    if (speed - i >= 0) {
      x = max(x, f(tt + 1, speed - i));
    }
  }
  return dp[tt][speed] = speed + x;
}
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cin >> v1 >> v2 >> t >> d;
  memset(dp, -1, sizeof dp);
  cout << f(1, v1) << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that, while `std::cin` and `std::cout` are typically slower than `scanf` and `printf`, they can be faster when combined with these optimizations (`ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);`).
