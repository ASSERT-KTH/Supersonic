This C/C++ program is already fairly optimized in terms of memory usage and running time, but there are still some modifications we can make to potentially improve the performance. Here's what we can do:

1. Avoid Recomputation: The function f() is recursively called with the same arguments multiple times which leads to redundant computations. We can use memoization to store the results of the function calls and avoid re-computation. The program already has a memoization table dp[][], but it's not used in all recursive calls. We can modify the function to use dp[][] before making any recursive calls.

2. Avoid invalid recursive calls: In the current function, we are making recursive calls for speed - i even when it is less than 0, which leads to unnecessary computations. We can avoid this by checking if speed - i is greater than or equal to 0 before making the recursive call.

3. Use Fast Input/Output Methods: The use of scanf and printf makes the program faster because these functions are faster than cin and cout in C++. So, no changes are required here.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;
const int N = 1234;
long long dp[N][N];
int v1, v2, t, d;

long long f(int tt, int speed) {
  if (tt == t) {
    return speed == v2 ? v2 : -1e10;
  }
  if (dp[tt][speed] != -1) {
    return dp[tt][speed];
  }
  long long x = -1e9;
  for (int i = 0; i <= d; ++i) {
    if (dp[tt + 1][speed + i] != -1) {
      x = max(x, dp[tt + 1][speed + i]);
    } else {
      x = max(x, f(tt + 1, speed + i));
    }
    if (speed - i >= 0) {
      if (dp[tt + 1][speed - i] != -1) {
        x = max(x, dp[tt + 1][speed - i]);
      } else {
        x = max(x, f(tt + 1, speed - i));
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[tt][speed] = speed + x;
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d %d %d %d", &v1, &v2, &t, &d);
  memset(dp, -1, sizeof dp);
  printf("%lld\n", f(1, v1));
  return 0;
}
```
