The given program is a C++ program that reads a list of nodes of a tree and then finds and outputs the good nodes which are defined as those nodes that have no child node and the node itself has a value of 0.

Optimization steps:
1. Change the data type of the 'tree' from vector of vectors to array of vectors. This is because accessing elements in an array is faster than accessing elements in a vector. 
2. Preallocate memory for the 'tree' array. This is because dynamic allocation and deallocation of memory during the execution of the program can be costly in terms of time.
3. Minimize the usage of 'tree[ve[i]]' by assigning it to a variable because accessing array elements using index is costly in terms of time.
4. Use 'puts()' function instead of 'cout' for printing as it is faster. 

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#define N 100005
using namespace std;
int n, x, y, t;
vector<int> tree[N]; // Changed from vector of vectors to array of vectors
int c[N], par[N], h[N], ve[N];
bool ans[N], yes;
bool cmp(int x, int y) { return h[x] > h[y]; }
void built_h(int i, int k) {
  for (int j = 0; j < tree[i].size(); j++) {
    if (par[i] != tree[i][j]) {
      h[tree[i][j]] = k + 1;
      built_h(tree[i][j], k + 1);
    }
  }
}
int main() {
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    ve[i] = i;
    cin >> x >> y;
    if (x == -1)
      t = i, par[i] = i;
    else
      par[i] = x;
    c[i] = y;
    if (x != -1)
      tree[x].push_back(i);
  }
  h[t] = 1;
  built_h(t, 1);
  sort(ve + 1, ve + n + 1, cmp);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    bool ok = false;
    vector<int>& curr_tree = tree[ve[i]]; // Assign tree[ve[i]] to a variable
    for (int j = 0; j < curr_tree.size(); j++)
      if (!c[curr_tree[j]]) {
        ok = true;
        break;
      }
    if (!c[ve[i]])
      ok = true;
    if (!ok)
      ans[ve[i]] = true, yes = true;
  }
  if (!yes)
    puts("-1"); // Changed from cout to puts()
  else
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      if (ans[i])
        cout << i << " ";
}
```
