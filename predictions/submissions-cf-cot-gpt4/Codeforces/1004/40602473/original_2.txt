While the given C++ program does not contain any glaring inefficiencies, there are a few changes that can be made to improve its performance. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the optimization process:

1. Change `fill` function to direct assignments: In the `main` function and `isvalid` function, the `fill` function is used to initialize the `freq` and `cfreq` arrays to zero. However, the `fill` function is slower than direct assignments in C++. Therefore, we can replace the `fill` function with a `for` loop that directly assigns each element of the array to zero.

2. Reduce the number of computations inside the loop: Inside the nested `for` loop in the `isvalid` function, the expression `(abs(x - i) + abs(y - j))` is computed for each iteration of the loop. However, `abs(x - i)` only depends on `i` and `abs(y - j)` only depends on `j`. Therefore, we can compute these values outside the inner loop and reuse them, reducing the number of computations.

3. Remove unused variables and libraries: The `random` macro and the `assert`, `ctime`, `iomanip`, `map`, `set`, `sstream`, and `vector` libraries are not used in the program. Removing them could slightly improve the compilation time and reduce the executable size.

4. Remove `goto` statement: The `goto` statement is generally discouraged in modern programming as it can lead to spaghetti code that is hard to understand and debug. Instead, we can use a boolean variable (`found`) to track whether a valid pair of integers has been found, and break out of the `for` loop if it has.

5. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. When it is turned off, the C++ streams are allowed to have their own independent buffers, which can potentially speed up the I/O operations.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i, N) for (int i = 0; i < (N); i++)
const int MAXN = 1000000;
int freq[MAXN], cfreq[MAXN];
bool isvalid(int, int, int, int);
int T;
int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int t, b = -1, x;
  cin >> T;
  rep(t, T) {
    int k;
    cin >> k;
    freq[k]++;
    b = max(b, k);
  }
  rep(t, T) if (t > 0 && (freq[t] != (t << 2))) break;
  x = t;
  int n, m, y;
  bool found = false;
  for (n = 1; n * n <= T && !found; n++)
    if (T % n == 0) {
      m = T / n;
      y = n + m - b - x;
      if (isvalid(n, m, x, y) || isvalid(m, n, x, y)) {
        cout << n << " " << m << "\n" << x << " " << y << "\n";
        found = true;
      }
    }
  if (!found) cout << -1 << "\n";
  return 0;
}
inline bool isvalid(int n, int m, int x, int y) {
  if (x < 1 || x > n || y < 1 || y > m)
    return false;
  rep(i, MAXN) cfreq[i] = 0;
  x--; y--;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int dx = abs(x - i);
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) cfreq[dx + abs(y - j)]++;
  }
  rep(i, T) if (cfreq[i] != freq[i]) return false;
  return true;
}
```
