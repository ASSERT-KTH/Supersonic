There are several places where this program could be optimized:

1. The `rep(t, T)` loop is used to find the first `t` such that `freq[t]` is not equal to `t << 2`. Instead of looping through all values of `t`, we can directly calculate the `t` value with the formula `t = freq[t] >> 2`. This would save us from unnecessary iterations.

2. The `isvalid` function is called twice for each pair of `n` and `m` if the first call returns `false`. This could be optimized by storing the result of the first call and reusing it in the second call if necessary.

3. The `isvalid` function fills the `cfreq` array with zeros at every call. This could be optimized by maintaining a separate `cfreq` array for each `n` and `m`, and updating them only when necessary.

4. The `isvalid` function recalculates the distance `abs(x - i) + abs(y - j)` for each `i` and `j`. This could be optimized by precomputing these distances and storing them in a separate array.

Unfortunately, some of these optimizations would require a significant rewrite of the program, which you asked to avoid. Therefore, I'll only implement the first two optimizations, which can be done with small modifications to the original program. 

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <ctime>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <sstream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define rrep(i, N) for (i = (N - 1); i >= 0; i--)
#define rep(i, N) for (i = 0; i < (N); i++)
#define sqr(x) (x) * (x)
#define all(v) (v.begin(), v.end())
#define pb push_back
#define random (rand() << 16 ^ rand())
typedef pair<int, int> ii;
const int64_t inf = 1e18 + 7;
const int64_t mod = 1e9 + 7;
const int MAXN = 1000000;
int freq[MAXN];
int cfreq[MAXN];
bool isvalid(int, int, int, int);
int T;
int main() {
  fill(freq, freq + MAXN, 0);
  int t, b = -1, x;
  cin >> T;
  rep(t, T) {
    int k;
    cin >> k;
    freq[k]++;
    b = max(b, k);
  }
  x = freq[x] >> 2;
  int n, m, y;
  for (n = 1; n * n <= T; n++)
    if (T % n == 0) {
      m = T / n;
      y = n + m - b - x;
      bool valid = isvalid(n, m, x, y);
      if (valid) {
        cout << n << " " << m << endl;
        cout << x << " " << y << endl;
        goto l1;
      } else if (!valid && isvalid(m, n, x, y)) {
        cout << m << " " << n << endl;
        cout << x << " " << y << endl;
        goto l1;
      }
    }
  cout << -1 << endl;
l1:
  return 0;
}
inline bool isvalid(int n, int m, int x, int y) {
  if (x < 1 || x > n || y < 1 || y > m)
    return false;
  fill(cfreq, cfreq + MAXN, 0);
  int i, j;
  x--;
  y--;
  rep(i, n) rep(j, m) cfreq[(abs(x - i) + abs(y - j))]++;
  rep(i, T) if (cfreq[i] != freq[i]) return false;
  return true;
}
```

Note: The `goto` statement is generally considered bad practice in C++ because it can make the control flow of the program difficult to understand. If possible, you should refactor the program to eliminate the `goto` statements.
