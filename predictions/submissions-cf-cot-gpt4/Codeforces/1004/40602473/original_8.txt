This program reads a number T from the input, then reads T numbers and stores their frequencies. It then finds a number which doesn't meet certain condition and stores it into x. Afterwards the program checks all pairs of numbers (n, m) that are divisors of T and for each pair checks if they are valid according to a certain condition. If such pair is found, it is printed out.

Here are some optimizations that can be applied:

1. Reduce the number of times the "fill" function is called: This function fills an array with a certain value. In the given code, it's called multiple times to fill the same array to zero. This can be optimized by keeping track of which indices have been modified in the previous iteration and only resetting those indices to zero.
2. Use vector instead of array: The size of array is fixed, so if the number of elements are less than the size of array, it will cause memory waste. A vector is dynamic, it can change its size at the runtime. However, since the size of the array is known in advance and does not change, using an array here is more efficient. We can keep the array.
3. Replace "endl" with "\n": "endl" causes a flush operation, which can be expensive in terms of time. Replacing it with "\n" can save some time.

This is the optimized version of the code:
