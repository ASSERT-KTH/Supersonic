The given program has a couple of areas that could be optimized.

1. The first for loop is performing a redundant operation. It increments 'i' by 1, then immediately decrements it by 1. This doesn't change the value of 'i', and it doesn't have any side effects. It just wastes CPU cycles. We can remove this loop entirely without changing the behavior of the program.

2. The second for loop reads an integer from the standard input, counts down from that integer to 0, and prints the remainder of the current count divided by 2. If the input is a large number, this could take a long time and generate a lot of unnecessary output. However, without more context, it's not clear how this could be optimized, since it's not clear what the purpose of this loop is.

3. The variable 'n' is declared at a global scope. This isn't strictly necessary, as it's only used inside the main function. It's generally a good idea to limit the scope of variables as much as possible, to avoid potential name conflicts and make the program easier to understand.

Here's the optimized version of your program:

```c++
#pragma G++ optimize("-O2")
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n;
  for (scanf("%d", &n); n--; printf("%d", n % 2))
    ;
  return 0;
}
```

With these changes, the program should run much faster and use less memory. However, without more context, it's not clear if this is the correct or best optimization.
