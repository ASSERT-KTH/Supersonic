The program has some unnecessary computations which can be removed. There are two main parts that can be optimized.

1. The first loop "for (int i = 1; i <= 1000000000; i++) i++, i = i - 1;" is not doing anything useful. It increments and then immediately decrements i, making it a no-op. This loop can be removed entirely.

2. The second loop prints whether each integer from n to 0 is even or odd. The printf function is generally slower than using putchar or cout due to the overhead of parsing the format string. You can use putchar to speed this up.

Here is the optimized program, taking into account the above points:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
int main() {
  int n;
  for (scanf("%d", &n); n--; putchar('0' + (n % 2)));
  return 0;
}
```
This program takes an integer n as input, and then prints whether each integer from n to 0 is even or odd. The optimization removes unnecessary computations and uses a faster output function.
