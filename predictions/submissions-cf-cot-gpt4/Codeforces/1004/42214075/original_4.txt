The given code has two main parts that can be optimized:

1. The first loop: This loop simply increments and then decrements the loop variable 'i', serving no real purpose. This loop can be completely removed, since it doesn't affect the rest of the program.

2. The second loop: This loop reads an integer 'n' and then prints the remainder of 'n' when divided by 2, decrementing 'n' after each iteration. This operation is a bit inefficient because it's using printf function for each iteration. Instead, we can use a string to store the result, and print it once after the loop finishes. It will reduce the number of I/O operations which are expensive in terms of time complexity.

The optimized program is shown below:

```cpp
#pragma G++ optimize("-O2")
#include <cstdio>
#include <string>
int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  std::string result;
  while(n--) {
    result += std::to_string(n % 2);
  }
  printf("%s", result.c_str());
  return 0;
}
```
Please note, in C++ 'main' function should have a return type, it's good practice to add 'int' before 'main'.
