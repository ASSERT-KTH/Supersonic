The program you've provided consists of two parts:

1. A loop that increments and then immediately decrements a variable 'i' a billion times.
2. A loop that reads an integer 'n' from the input, counts down from 'n' to 0, and prints the remainder when 'n' is divided by 2.

Here's how we can optimize it:

1. The first loop can be completely removed. It's doing nothing useful as it increments a variable 'i' but then immediately decrements it back. This is a no-operation and can be safely removed without changing the functionality of the program. This will drastically reduce both the running time and memory usage of the program.

2. The second loop is reading 'n' from the input, then counts down from 'n' to 0, and prints the remainder when 'n' is divided by 2. Here, instead of doing 'n' operations, we can directly print the result by checking if 'n' is even or odd. If 'n' is even, then it would print '0' 'n' times, and if 'n' is odd, then it would print '1' 'n' times. This reduces the number of operations from 'n' to 1.

Here is the optimized program:

```
#pragma G++ optimize("-O2")
#include <cstdio>
int n;
main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  printf("%d", n % 2);
}
```

This program will have the same output as the original one, but will run much faster and use much less memory.
