The given C/C++ program doesn't really do anything meaningful. However, let's analyze the code and try to optimize it, even though we might be optimizing a no-op.

1. Removing unnecessary loop and operations: The first loop in this program increments `i` by one, then immediately decrements it. This is essentially a no-op (it has no effect on the program outcome), and the loop runs one billion times. This is a huge waste of processor time. We can simply remove this loop to improve the running time.

2. Optimizing input/output operations: The second loop reads an integer value `n`, then prints the remainder of `n` divided by 2, decrements `n`, and repeats until `n` is zero. This repeated calling of `printf` function inside the loop can be costly. Instead, it's better to store the output in a buffer and print it all at once after the loop.

3. Using `scanf` and `printf` for input/output operations: These functions are slower compared to their counterparts in C++, `cin` and `cout`. If speed is important, and you can use C++ instead of C, it would be beneficial to use `cin` and `cout` with `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` which can speed up the input/output operations significantly.

After considering these optimization steps, the optimized version of the program would look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n;
    cin >> n;
    string res;
    while (n--) {
        res += to_string(n % 2);
    }
    cout << res;
    return 0;
}
```

Note: Optimization can be problem-specific and sometimes it needs a deeper understanding of the problem to apply the most effective optimization. Here, we applied general optimizations to improve the running time and memory usage.
