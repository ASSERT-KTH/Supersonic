The given C/C++ program has some unnecessary operations that need to be optimized:

1. The first for loop is an infinite loop where the variable 'i' is incremented and then decremented immediately. It doesn't do anything useful and will consume lots of CPU cycles. We should remove it.

2. The usage of `scanf` and `printf` functions can be optimized a bit. These functions have significant overhead because they have to parse the format string at runtime. We can replace `scanf` with `std::cin` and `printf` with `std::cout` to speed up I/O operations.

3. The `#pragma G++ optimize("-O2")` directive is not standard C++ and is only recognized by some compilers. It's better to set optimization level during the compilation process.

4. The `main` function is missing a return type. In C++, the main function should have an `int` return type.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  while(n--) {
    std::cout << (n % 2);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version removes unnecessary operations, uses faster I/O, and fixes the main function's return type. The optimization level should be set during the compilation process, for example, by using the `-O2` flag with the g++ command: `g++ -O2 program.cpp`.
