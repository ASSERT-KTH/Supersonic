Firstly, we can see a loop running 1,000,000,000 times, where nothing happens. This loop is useless, as it only increments the value of 'i', then decrements it, and doesn't have any effect on the rest of the program. Therefore, we can remove it. This will save a lot of running time.

Secondly, the second loop prints the modulus of n by 2, which will always be either 0 or 1. This loop does not need to run 'n' times to print the result, it only needs to run once. Thus, we can simplify it.

The optimized version of the code is:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
int n;
main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  printf("%d", n % 2);
}
```

This version of the code accepts an integer input 'n' and prints 'n' modulus 2, which was the actual operation performed by the original code.

The #pragma G++ optimize("-O2") line is also removed as it is not necessary in this case. It is used to direct the compiler to optimize the code, but the optimized code is simple enough that it should not make a difference.
