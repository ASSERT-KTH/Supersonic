The program you've provided can be optimized in the following ways:

1) The first loop has no effect: The loop incrementally increases `i` from 1 to 1000000000. However, in each iteration `i` is increased by 1 and then immediately decreased by 1. This operation has no effect and is a waste of processing power. We can safely remove this loop.

2) Use faster I/O methods: In C++, `scanf` and `printf` are slower compared to `cin` and `cout` with `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`. It's also a good idea to use '\n' instead of `endl` as `endl` causes a flush operation which can be slower.

3) The counter `n` is decremented each time in the loop and then the modulus operation is performed. To reduce the number of operations, we can decrement `n` after performing the modulus operation.

4) There is a missing return type for the main function. It should be `int`.

Here is the optimized version of the given program:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);

    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    
    while(n) {
        std::cout << (n - 1) % 2 << '\n';
        --n;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Remember, this program now does not do anything meaningful but it's optimized according to the instructions.

The first loop is removed, `scanf` and `printf` are replaced with `cin` and `cout` with `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`. The modulus operation is performed before decrementing `n` and the main function now has a return type of `int`.
