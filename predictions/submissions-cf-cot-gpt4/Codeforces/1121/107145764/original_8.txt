The optimization process is as follows:

1. **Use of `reserve` function**: When we know the size of elements that will be added to a vector, it is better to use the `reserve` function to pre-allocate memory. This will avoid unnecessary re-allocations during runtime.

2. **Use of `auto` in for loop**: In the for loop where we're iterating through the map, we can use `auto` to deduce the type automatically, which simplifies the code.

3. **Avoiding the use of `long long`**: In your code, you are using `long long` for the sum of two integers. This isn't necessary because the sum of two `int`s can't exceed the limit of `int`.

4. **Avoiding the use of `std::endl`**: `std::endl` not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output buffer. If the performance is a concern and you don't need to flush the buffer at every newline, use `'\n'` instead.

Below is the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int n, z = 0, c = 0;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> v;
  v.reserve(n);
  unordered_map<int, int> mp;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    v.push_back(x);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      int x = v[i] + v[j];
      mp[x]++;
    }
  }
  for (const auto &it : mp) {
    if (it.second > c) {
      z = it.first;
      c = it.second;
    }
  }
  cout << c << '\n';
}
```
