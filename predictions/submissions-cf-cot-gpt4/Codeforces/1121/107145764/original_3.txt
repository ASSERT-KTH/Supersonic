The given C++ program reads an integer n, then reads n integers and stores them in a vector. It then calculates all possible sums of pairs of these integers, and finds the sum that occurs the most frequently.

Here are a few things that we can do to optimize the program:

1. We can avoid using `vector::push_back` in a loop, as it can potentially cause several reallocations. Instead, we can resize the vector to its final size before the loop, then set each element by index. This only works if we know the final size of the vector in advance, which we do in this case.

2. We can eliminate the second loop that searches for the most frequent sum. This can be done by keeping track of the most frequent sum and its frequency while we are inserting the sums into the map.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<int> v(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
  }

  map<int, int> mp;
  int max_freq = 0, max_sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      int sum = v[i] + v[j];
      int freq = ++mp[sum];
      if (freq > max_freq) {
        max_freq = freq;
        max_sum = sum;
      }
    }
  }

  cout << max_freq << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This program should run faster and use less memory than the original program, as it avoids potential vector reallocations and it only does a single pass over the sums.
