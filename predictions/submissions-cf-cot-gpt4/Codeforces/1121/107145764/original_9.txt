The program calculates all the possible sums of pairs of numbers from the input, stores them in a map and then finds the most frequently occurring sum. 

Optimization steps:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation by reserving space for the vector v in advance. This can be done using vector::reserve function before the loop. This can lead to a significant performance gain, since it reduces the number of reallocations and copyings of the vector data.

2. The map is used to keep track of frequency of each sum. However, in C++ STL, map is implemented using a self balancing Binary Search Tree thus insertions and deletions take logarithmic time. Lessening the time complexity to constant time would improve the performance. This can be achieved by using an unordered_map instead of map. unordered_map in C++ STL is implemented using Hash Table.

3. Use auto keyword for iterator in the final loop. This is not an optimization, but it is a good practice to simplify the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int n, z = 0, c = 0;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> v;
  v.reserve(n); // reserve space for the vector
  unordered_map<int, int> mp; // use unordered_map instead of map
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    v.push_back(x);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      long long x = v[i] + v[j];
      mp[x]++;
    }
  }
  for (auto it = mp.cbegin(); it != mp.cend(); ++it) {
    if (it->second > c) {
      z = it->first;
      c = it->second;
    }
  }
  cout << c << endl;
}
```

Note: The optimized program still takes quadratic time in calculating the sum of all pairs of numbers. If you want to further optimize this program, you might need to change the algorithm fundamentally.
