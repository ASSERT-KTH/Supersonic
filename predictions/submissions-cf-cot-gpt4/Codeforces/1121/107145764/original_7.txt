The above program reads a sequence of integers, calculates all possible sums of two different elements, and counts how many times each sum occurs. Then it prints the count of the most frequent sum. 

Here are the steps for optimization:

1. Replace vector push_back() operation with direct assignment after the vector size is known. This will save time from dynamic resizing of the vector.
2. Use unordered_map instead of map for storing the frequency of sums. Unordered_map has average constant-time complexity for access/insertion while map has logarithmic time complexity.
3. In the last loop, we can use auto instead of map<int,int>::iterator for convenience and improved readability. This doesn't affect performance but makes the code cleaner.

The optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int n, z = 0, c = 0;
  cin >> n;

  vector<int> v(n);
  unordered_map<int, int> mp;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      long long x = v[i] + v[j];
      mp[x]++;
    }
  }

  for (auto it = mp.cbegin(); it != mp.cend(); ++it) {
    if (it->second > c) {
      z = it->first;
      c = it->second;
    }
  }

  cout << c << endl;
}
```
This program now allocates the required memory for the vector at once, and uses an unordered_map to improve the time complexity of the frequency storage and lookup.
