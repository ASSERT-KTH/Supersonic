The given C++ program reads a list of integers, calculates the frequency of sums of every pair of integers, and then outputs the highest frequency of these sums. Here are some optimization steps:

1. The program uses `std::vector::push_back` to add elements. Since the size `n` is known beforehand, we can reserve space for `n` elements in the `vector` using `std::vector::reserve`. This will prevent reallocation of memory when elements are added.

2. The nested loop that calculates the sum of every pair has a time complexity of O(n^2). This is very inefficient for large inputs. Since we are only interested in the frequency of the sums, we can keep a count of the frequency of each number using an `std::unordered_map` (or `std::map` if the numbers are not too large). Then we can loop over the map to calculate the sum of every pair. This reduces the time complexity to O(n log n) for `std::map` and O(n) for `std::unordered_map`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int n, z = 0, c = 0;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> v;
  v.reserve(n);
  unordered_map<int, int> mp, count;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    v.push_back(x);
    count[x]++;
  }
  for (auto &a : count) {
    for (auto &b : count) {
      long long x = a.first + b.first;
      mp[x] += a.second * b.second;
    }
  }
  for (auto &it : mp) {
    if (it.second > c) {
      z = it.first;
      c = it.second;
    }
  }
  cout << c << endl;
}
```

Please note that the unordered_map `count` is used for counting occurrence of each number in the input. Then we calculate the sum of every pair using these counts, which greatly reduces the number of iterations in the nested loop. This optimization is based on the assumption that the number of distinct numbers in the input is much less than `n`. If this is not the case, the original program might be more efficient.
