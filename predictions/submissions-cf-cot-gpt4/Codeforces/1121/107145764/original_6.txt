The given C++ program is a program that reads integers into a vector, calculates all possible sums of two different numbers in the vector, counts the occurrence of each sum, and then finds out the sum with the highest frequency.

Now, let's optimize the program. The main optimization can be done in the two nested loops where we calculate all possible sums of two different numbers. This can lead to an O(n^2) time complexity which is not good when n is large. 

We can use an unordered_map instead of a map to store the sums and their frequencies. The unordered_map has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertions and lookups, while the map has a time complexity of O(log n). This can significantly reduce the time complexity of the program.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int n, z = 0, c = 0;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> v(n);
  unordered_map<int, int> mp;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      mp[v[i] + v[j]]++;
    }
  }
  for (auto it = mp.cbegin(); it != mp.cend(); ++it) {
    if (it->second > c) {
      z = it->first;
      c = it->second;
    }
  }
  cout << c << endl;
}
```

In this version, we preallocate the size of the vector v to avoid reallocation when pushing back elements. We also replace the map mp with an unordered_map for faster insertions and lookups. The rest of the code remains the same.

Please note that this optimization is mainly focused on the time efficiency, and the memory usage remains relatively the same. The memory optimization of this program could be a more complex task and may require a completely different approach.
