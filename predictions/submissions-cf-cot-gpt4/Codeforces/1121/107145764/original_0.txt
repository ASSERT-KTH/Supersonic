Step 1: Use Reserve for Vector
To avoid multiple resizing operations when you are pushing back elements into your vector, you can reserve the maximum size you know your vector will reach.

Step 2: Use Unordered Map Instead of Map
Unordered_map in C++ STL uses a hashing mechanism, so the time complexity of insert and find operations is O(1) on average. But for the ordered map, these operations are O(log n). Therefore, unordered_map is faster in case of insert and find operations.

Step 3: Simplify Loop for Map
You don't need to use an iterator to loop through your map. You can use a simple range-based for loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int n, z = 0, c = 0;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> v(n); // Reserve the size of vector
  unordered_map<int, int> mp; // Use unordered_map instead of map
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      long long x = v[i] + v[j];
      mp[x]++;
    }
  }
  for (const auto &it : mp) { // Simplify loop for map
    if (it.second > c) {
      z = it.first;
      c = it.second;
    }
  }
  cout << c << endl;
}
```

Please remember, unordered_map doesn't maintain any ordering of elements while map maintains elements in sorted order. If ordering is required, then map should be used.
