The given code is a C++ program that processes a grid of characters in a specific way. It seems to be optimized already, but there are still some parts that can be optimized further. Here are the steps to optimize the provided code:

1. Avoid `using namespace std;` : This is not directly related to performance, but it's a bad practice that could cause name clashes. It doesn't cause a performance issue, but it's a common practice in C++ to avoid potential issues.

2. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` : This will disconnect C++ standard streams from their C counterparts, and potentially speed up input/output operations.

3. Reduce variable scope: The variable `tps` is declared globally, which is unnecessary. Its scope can be reduced to local scope within the `main` function.

4. Avoid global variables: The variables `nbLig`, `nbCol`, `nbReq` are global variables, and it's usually a good idea to avoid global variables if possible. In this case, we can pass them as parameters to the functions that need them.

5. Use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl`: `std::endl` causes a flush of the output stream buffer, which can slow down the program. A better choice is to use `'\n'`, which doesn't cause a flush.

6. Avoid unnecessary computations: The computation of `fin` in `compBloc` is done even when `deb > nbLig`. This computation can be avoided.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using pii = std::pair<int, int>;
const int maxLig = (1e5) + 5;
const int maxCol = 12;
const int maxReq = (1e5) + 5;
const int sqr = 600;

char grille[maxLig][maxCol];
int proc[maxLig][maxCol];
std::pair<int, int> go[maxLig][maxCol];
int blocRef[maxLig];

void comp(int lig, int col, int safeLig, int tps) {
  // ... same as before ...
}

pii getFin(int lig, int col) {
  // ... same as before ...
}

bool compBloc(int bloc, int tps, int nbLig, int nbCol) {
  int deb = bloc * sqr;
  if (deb > nbLig)
    return false;
  int fin = std::min(nbLig, (bloc + 1) * sqr);
  // ... same as before ...
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int nbLig, nbCol, nbReq, tps = 0;
  std::cin >> nbLig >> nbCol >> nbReq;
  
  std::fill_n(&grille[0][0], maxLig * maxCol, '~');
  // ... same as before ...

  ++tps;
  for (int bloc = 0;; ++bloc) {
    if (!compBloc(bloc, tps, nbLig, nbCol))
      break;
  }
  // ... same as before ...
}
```
