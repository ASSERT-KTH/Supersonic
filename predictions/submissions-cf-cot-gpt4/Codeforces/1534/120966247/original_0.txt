The given code is a C++ program that uses depth-first search (DFS) to count the number of nodes in a graph that are not visited yet. There are a few possible optimizations that could be applied to this code:

1. **Avoid Multiple Memory Access**: In the DFS function, the vector element `e[u][i]` is accessed twice. We can optimize this by storing the value in a variable and using this variable instead.

2. **Avoid Recomputation in Loop**: In the main while loop, `a[i]` is accessed multiple times. This can be stored in a variable once and used multiple times.

3. **Reserve Memory for Vector**: Before pushing back elements into vector `e[a[i]]`, we can reserve memory for it. This will reduce the cost of resizing the vector every time an element is added.

4. **Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`**: This will stop C++ from syncing with the C standard library streams on every I/O operation, making `cin` and `cout` faster.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
const int N = 1e9 + 7;
int t, n, cnt;
int a[400005], vis[400005];
vector<int> e[400005];
void dfs(int u) {
  vis[u] = 1;
  for (int v, i = 0; i < e[u].size(); ++i) {
    v = e[u][i];
    if (!vis[v])
      dfs(v);
  }
}
int qmi(int cnt) {
  int x = 2, s = 1;
  while (cnt) {
    if (cnt & 1)
      s = s * x % N;
    x = x * x % N;
    cnt >>= 1;
  }
  return s % N;
}
signed main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n;
    cnt = 0;
    memset(vis, 0, sizeof vis);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
      e[i].clear();
      e[i].reserve(n);
    }
    for (int v, i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> v;
      int ai = a[i];
      e[ai].push_back(v);
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      if (!vis[a[i]])
        cnt++, dfs(a[i]);
    cout << qmi(cnt) << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Remember, the effectiveness of these optimizations can vary based on the specific inputs and the compiler used. Always profile your code to see if the optimizations are effective in your particular case.
