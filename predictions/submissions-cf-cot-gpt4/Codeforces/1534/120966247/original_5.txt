The initial program seems to be well structured and mostly optimized. However, there are few changes that can be applied to improve the performance of the code.

Optimization Changes:
1. Use 'reserve' function to pre-allocate memory for 'vector<int> e[400005]'. This is useful when we know beforehand how much elements the vector will hold. This reduces the number of memory reallocations, and thus, improves performance.

2. The 'dfs' function can be optimized by using a range-based loop, which is less error-prone and offers better readability. 

3. In 'qmi' function, the final modulus operation 's % N' is unnecessary because 's' is already being taken modulo 'N' in the loop. So, we can remove that.

4. Use 'ios::sync_with_stdio(false)' and 'cin.tie(NULL)'. These two lines turn off the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding C streams if it is called before the program performs its first input or output operation. Adding 'cin.tie(NULL)' is a method that unties 'cin' from 'cout'. Tied streams ensure that one stream is flushed automatically before each I/O operation on the tied stream.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
const int N = 1e9 + 7;
int t, n, cnt;
int a[400005], vis[400005];
vector<int> e[400005];
void dfs(int u) {
  vis[u] = 1;
  for (const auto& v : e[u]) {
    if (!vis[v])
      dfs(v);
  }
}
int qmi(int cnt) {
  int x = 2, s = 1;
  while (cnt) {
    if (cnt & 1)
      s = s * x % N;
    x = x * x % N;
    cnt >>= 1;
  }
  return s;
}
signed main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n;
    cnt = 0;
    memset(vis, 0, sizeof vis);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
      e[i].reserve(n);
      e[i].clear();
    }
    for (int v, i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> v;
      e[a[i]].push_back(v);
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      if (!vis[a[i]])
        cnt++, dfs(a[i]);
    cout << qmi(cnt) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations are generally applied to reduce the time complexity, but they won't necessarily make a significant difference in the overall execution time of the program.
