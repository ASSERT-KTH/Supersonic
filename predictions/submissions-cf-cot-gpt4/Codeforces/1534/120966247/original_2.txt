There are several points where we can optimize this program:

1. Avoid clearing the vector `e` in every iteration: Instead of clearing the vector `e` in every iteration, we can create a new vector `e` for every iteration. This would avoid the overhead of clearing the vector in every iteration.

2. Avoiding redundant mod operation: In `qmi` function, there is no need to take modulo `N` at the end because we already take modulo `N` at every step.

3. Using bit manipulation instead of multiplication: In `qmi` function, to calculate x*x, we can use bit manipulation which is faster than multiplication.

4. Use prefix increment: In the for loop inside `dfs` function, use prefix increment as it is faster than postfix increment. In postfix, a temporary copy of the object is created which increases the operation cost.

5. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`: These are used to untie C and C++ standard streams which can make I/O operations faster.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
const int N = 1e9 + 7;
int t, n, cnt;
int a[400005], vis[400005];

void dfs(int u, vector<int> *e) {
  vis[u] = 1;
  for (int v, i = 0; i < e[u].size(); ++v) {
    v = e[u][i];
    if (!vis[v])
      dfs(v, e);
  }
}

int qmi(int cnt) {
  int x = 2, s = 1;
  while (cnt) {
    if (cnt & 1)
      s = (s << 1) % N;
    x = (x << 1) % N;
    cnt >>= 1;
  }
  return s;
}

signed main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n;
    cnt = 0;
    memset(vis, 0, sizeof vis);
    vector<int> e[400005];
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
    }
    for (int v, i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> v;
      e[a[i]].push_back(v);
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      if (!vis[a[i]])
        cnt++, dfs(a[i], e);
    cout << qmi(cnt) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The bitwise left shift `<<` operation is equivalent to multiplying by 2.
