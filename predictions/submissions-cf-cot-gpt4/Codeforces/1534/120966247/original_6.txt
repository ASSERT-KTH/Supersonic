The above C++ program is used to perform depth-first search (DFS) on a graph. Here are some possible optimizations:

1. Avoid Recursion: The DFS function is currently implemented using recursion. Recursion consumes a lot of memory, especially for large inputs, because each recursive call adds a layer to the system call stack. This can be optimized by using an iterative DFS with a stack.

2. Use Bitwise Operation: In the qmi function, we can use bitwise operations to optimize the calculation of the power of a number. Bitwise operations are faster than normal arithmetic operations.

3. Reserve Vector Size: Before inserting elements into a vector, if we know the maximum number of elements that will be inserted, we can use the reserve function to allocate memory beforehand. This will avoid the reallocation of memory which happens when the vector grows beyond its current capacity, thereby improving the performance.

4. Use Fast I/O Methods: The cin and cout operations are slower. We can use faster methods for I/O operations.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
const int N = 1e9 + 7;
int t, n, cnt;
int a[400005], vis[400005];
vector<int> e[400005];
void dfs(int u) {
  stack<int> st;
  st.push(u);
  vis[u] = 1;
  while (!st.empty()) {
    int v = st.top();
    st.pop();
    for (int i = 0; i < e[v].size(); ++i) {
      if (!vis[e[v][i]]) {
        vis[e[v][i]] = 1;
        st.push(e[v][i]);
      }
    }
  }
}
int qmi(int cnt) {
  int x = 2, s = 1;
  while (cnt) {
    if (cnt & 1)
      s = (s * x) % N;
    x = (x * x) % N;
    cnt >>= 1;
  }
  return s % N;
}
signed main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n;
    cnt = 0;
    memset(vis, 0, sizeof vis);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
      e[i].clear();
      e[i].reserve(n);
    }
    for (int v, i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> v;
      e[a[i]].push_back(v);
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      if (!vis[a[i]])
        cnt++, dfs(a[i]);
    cout << qmi(cnt) << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized version of the program, I have removed recursion from the DFS function and used a stack to make it iterative. I have also used bitwise operations in the qmi function to speed up the calculation of power. I have reserved space in the vector before inserting elements. Finally, I have used faster I/O operations by disabling the synchronization of the C and C++ standard streams and untied cin from cout.
