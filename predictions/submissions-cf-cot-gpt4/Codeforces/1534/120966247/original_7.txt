The original program does not seem to be much unoptimized. It uses DFS and some simple calculations. However, there are still some possible optimizations:

1. Instead of calling `e[i].clear();` inside the loop, we can call `e.clear();` before the loop. This makes the code more readable and efficient.

2. Instead of using `cin` and `cout`, we can use `scanf` and `printf` which are faster.

3. Instead of using `memset` to initialize the array, we can use `fill` function from `<algorithm>` library which is more efficient because `memset` function is designed for byte arrays and not for other types of arrays.

4. We can replace `vis[u] = 1;` with `vis[u]++;` which may make the code run slightly faster on some compilers.

5. Instead of using the `[]` operator to access elements of the `vector`, we can use `.at()` method which is safer as it throws an exception if the index is out of range.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
const int N = 1e9 + 7;
int t, n, cnt;
int a[400005], vis[400005];
vector<int> e[400005];
void dfs(int u) {
  vis[u]++;
  for (int v, i = 0; i < e[u].size(); ++i) {
    v = e.at(u).at(i);
    if (!vis[v])
      dfs(v);
  }
}
int qmi(int cnt) {
  int x = 2, s = 1;
  while (cnt) {
    if (cnt & 1)
      s = s * x % N;
    x = x * x % N;
    cnt >>= 1;
  }
  return s % N;
}
signed main() {
  scanf("%lld", &t);
  e.clear();
  while (t--) {
    scanf("%lld", &n);
    cnt = 0;
    fill(vis, vis+n, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      scanf("%lld", &a[i]);
    }
    for (int v, i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      scanf("%lld", &v);
      e[a[i]].push_back(v);
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      if (!vis[a[i]])
        cnt++, dfs(a[i]);
    printf("%lld\n", qmi(cnt));
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that some of these optimizations may not make a significant difference in performance for small inputs or on some compilers and hardware configurations.
