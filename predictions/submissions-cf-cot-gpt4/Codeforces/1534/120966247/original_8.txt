Here are some steps to optimize this program:

1. Change the type of `int` to `int32_t` instead of `long long` for reducing the memory usage, as `int32_t` uses 4 bytes whereas `long long` uses 8 bytes.

2. For the `dfs` function, we can avoid copying the vector element by using a constant reference in the loop.

3. The function `qmi` can be optimized by removing the modulo operation from the loop condition to the end of the function, as modulo operation is expensive.

4. The vectors `e` are being cleared each time in the loop. Instead of clearing them, we can re-initialize them. This way, we won't have to deallocate and then reallocate memory for the vectors.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```C++
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define int int32_t
const int N = 1e9 + 7;
int t, n, cnt;
int a[400005], vis[400005];
vector<int> e[400005];
void dfs(int u) {
  vis[u] = 1;
  for (const auto& v : e[u]) {
    if (!vis[v])
      dfs(v);
  }
}
int qmi(int cnt) {
  int x = 2, s = 1;
  while (cnt) {
    if (cnt & 1)
      s = s * x;
    x = x * x;
    cnt >>= 1;
  }
  return s % N;
}
signed main() {
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n;
    cnt = 0;
    memset(vis, 0, sizeof vis);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
      e[i] = vector<int>();
    }
    for (int v, i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> v;
      e[a[i]].push_back(v);
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      if (!vis[a[i]])
        cnt++, dfs(a[i]);
    cout << qmi(cnt) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these are only minor optimizations and the real-world impact may vary depending on the specific use case and data.
