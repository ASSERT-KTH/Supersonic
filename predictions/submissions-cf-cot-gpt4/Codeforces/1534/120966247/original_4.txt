The program is a graph traversal problem and is already quite optimized, but there are a few steps that can be taken to make it more efficient.

1. Use `reserve()` for vector: This method is used to reserve storage for the vector elements. This will reduce the time taken to allocate memory dynamically while pushing back elements into the vector.

2. Avoid repeated array indexing: `v = e[u][i];` and `if (!vis[a[i]])` can be optimized by storing the value in a variable and using it instead of indexing the array multiple times.

3. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);`: These lines turn off synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. This makes `cin` and `cout` much faster.

4. Use prefix increment in for loop: Prefix increment is faster than postfix increment because postfix increment involves a copy operation. This is not a significant improvement, but it's good practice in C++.

5. Change `signed main()` to simply `main()`: The `signed` keyword is not necessary here. It's an extra word that doesn't add anything to the program.

Here is the optimized code implementation:

```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
const int N = 1e9 + 7;
int t, n, cnt;
int a[400005], vis[400005];
vector<int> e[400005];
void dfs(int u) {
  vis[u] = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < e[u].size(); ++i) {
    int v = e[u][i];
    if (!vis[v])
      dfs(v);
  }
}
int qmi(int cnt) {
  int x = 2, s = 1;
  while (cnt) {
    if (cnt & 1)
      s = s * x % N;
    x = x * x % N;
    cnt >>= 1;
  }
  return s % N;
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n;
    cnt = 0;
    memset(vis, 0, sizeof vis);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      cin >> a[i];
      e[i].reserve(n);
      e[i].clear();
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      int v;
      cin >> v;
      e[a[i]].push_back(v);
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      int ai = a[i];
      if (!vis[ai])
        cnt++, dfs(ai);
    }
    cout << qmi(cnt) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
