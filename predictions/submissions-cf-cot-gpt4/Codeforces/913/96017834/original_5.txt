This program seems to be already quite efficient but there are a few small optimizations that can be made. 

1. The first optimization is to use reserve() function for the vector g. If you know that you're going to insert a large number of items into a vector, use the reserve() function to preallocate the required memory in advance. It will prevent multiple reallocations and copying of data which can be expensive in terms of time.

2. The second optimization is to break the inner loop as soon as the value of k reaches 3. There is no need to continue checking other elements in the list if we already know that k is more than 2.

3. The third optimization is to return directly from main function when we find that the answer is false. In this case, we don't need to execute the remaining code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

constexpr const char *s[2] = {"No", "Yes"};

void solve(const std::vector<std::vector<size_t>> &g) {
  const size_t n = g.size();
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (g[i].empty())
      continue;
    unsigned k = 0;
    for (const size_t x : g[i]) {
      k += g[x].empty();
      if (k >= 3)
        break;
    }
    if (k < 3) {
      std::cout << s[0] << '\n';
      return;
    }
  }
  std::cout << s[1] << '\n';
}

int main() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<std::vector<size_t>> g;
  g.reserve(n);  // preallocate memory
  for (size_t i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    unsigned p;
    std::cin >> p;
    g[p - 1].push_back(i);
  }
  solve(g);
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the effect of these optimizations might not be noticeable for small inputs, but they can make a difference for large inputs. They will help to reduce the running time by avoiding unnecessary operations and memory usage by avoiding unnecessary reallocations.
