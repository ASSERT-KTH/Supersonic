The given C++ program does not seem to have any major issues in terms of running time and memory usage. However, there are a few things that can be optimized:

1. I/O Operations: Standard I/O operations are slow. To speed them up, we can use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(NULL);` before starting to take input. This will untie `cin` from `cout`, allowing them to operate independently and improve I/O speed.

2. Use of `std::vector::reserve()`: The `push_back` function may cause reallocation of the vector which is a costly operation. To avoid this, if you know the number of elements that will be inserted, you can call `reserve()` which preallocates a certain amount of space.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void answer(bool v) {
  constexpr const char *s[2] = {"No", "Yes"};
  std::cout << s[v] << '\n';
}

void solve(const std::vector<std::vector<size_t>> &g) {
  const size_t n = g.size();
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (g[i].empty())
      continue;
    unsigned k = 0;
    for (const size_t x : g[i])
      k += g[x].empty();
    if (k < 3)
      return answer(false);
  }
  answer(true);
}

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::vector<std::vector<size_t>> g(n);
  g.reserve(n);
  
  for (size_t i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    unsigned p;
    std::cin >> p;
    g[p - 1].push_back(i);
  }
  
  solve(g);
  return 0;
}
```

This program does exactly the same thing as the original one, but it should run slightly faster due to the optimized I/O operations and vector reallocation prevention.
