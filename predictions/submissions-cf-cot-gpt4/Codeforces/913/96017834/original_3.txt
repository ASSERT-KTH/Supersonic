The given program reads the number of elements (n) and then reads n-1 values, each of which is used to populate a vector of vectors (g). The solve function then checks each vector in g and counts the number of empty vectors it contains. If any vector contains fewer than 3 empty vectors, it outputs "No" and returns. If it checks all vectors and none of them contains fewer than 3 empty vectors, it outputs "Yes".

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Reduce the number of lookups in the nested vectors:
   The current program performs a lookup of `g[x]` twice in the solve function. We can reduce this to a single lookup by storing the result in a local variable.

2. Use reserve function to avoid reallocations:
   Vectors in C++ start with a small amount of allocated memory, and the amount of memory allocated grows as elements are added. This can lead to unnecessary memory reallocations and copying of elements. We can avoid this by using the reserve function to allocate enough memory for all the elements at the start.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
void answer(bool v) {
  constexpr const char *s[2] = {"No", "Yes"};
  std::cout << s[v] << '\n';
}
void solve(const std::vector<std::vector<size_t>> &g) {
  const size_t n = g.size();
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (g[i].empty())
      continue;
    unsigned k = 0;
    for (const size_t x : g[i]) {
      const std::vector<size_t>& gx = g[x];
      k += gx.empty();
    }
    if (k < 3)
      return answer(false);
  }
  answer(true);
}
int main() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<std::vector<size_t>> g(n);
  for (size_t i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    unsigned p;
    std::cin >> p;
    g[p - 1].reserve(n); // reserve memory to avoid reallocations
    g[p - 1].push_back(i);
  }
  solve(g);
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have reduced the number of lookups in the vector of vectors from 2 to 1 in the solve function. We have also used the reserve function to allocate enough memory for all the elements at the start, reducing the number of memory reallocations and copying of elements.
