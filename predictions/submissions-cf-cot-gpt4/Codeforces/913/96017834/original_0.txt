This program seems to be quite optimized already, but there are a few minor improvements that can be made:

1. Use prefix increment (++i) instead of postfix increment (i++): In C++, the prefix increment operator is generally more efficient than the postfix increment operator for non-primitive types such as iterators or other objects. This is because the postfix increment operator needs to return a copy of the original value, which can require an extra copy operation. 

2. Use cin.tie(0) and ios::sync_with_stdio(false): These two lines of code help speed up I/O operations in C++. The first line breaks the tie between cin and cout, and the second line turns off synchronization with the C standard library's stdio, making cin and cout faster.

3. In the answer function, instead of using an array of strings and indexing it with the boolean value, you could use a ternary operator. This would avoid the need for array indexing and make the code slightly faster.

Here is your optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
void answer(bool v){
    std::cout << (v ? "Yes\n" : "No\n");
}
void solve(const std::vector<std::vector<size_t>> &g){
    const size_t n = g.size();
    for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i){
        if (g[i].empty())
            continue;
        unsigned k = 0;
        for (const size_t x : g[i])
            k += g[x].empty();
        if (k < 3)
            return answer(false);
    }
    answer(true);
}
int main(){
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(0);
    size_t n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<std::vector<size_t>> g(n);
    for (size_t i = 1; i < n; ++i){
        unsigned p;
        std::cin >> p;
        g[p - 1].push_back(i);
    }
    solve(g);
    return 0;
}
```

Remember these optimizations are minor and may not bring noticeable changes in performance. The algorithm and data structures used in the code are already efficient.
