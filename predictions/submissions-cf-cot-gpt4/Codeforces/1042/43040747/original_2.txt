The given code is already quite optimized in terms of data structures and algorithm used. However, there are a few areas that could be optimized:

1. Remove unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file includes a large number of standard C++ libraries, which can significantly increase compilation time. It's better to include only needed libraries.

2. Use `auto` for type deduction when declaring variables to make the code cleaner and less error-prone.

3. Use `std::pair` instead of `{}` when inserting to `A`. This will improve the readability of the code and also avoid the possible overhead of initializer list.

Optimized code would look something like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
using namespace std;
using namespace __gnu_pbds;
typedef long long ll;
typedef tree<pair<ll, ll>, null_type, less<pair<ll, ll>>, rb_tree_tag,
             tree_order_statistics_node_update>
    pbdsm;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  ll n, t;
  cin >> n >> t;
  vector<ll> v(n + 1);
  v[0] = 0;
  pbdsm A;
  A.insert(make_pair(0, 0));
  ll ans = 0, k = 1;
  for (auto i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    cin >> v[i];
    v[i] += v[i - 1];
    ans += A.size() - A.order_of_key(make_pair(v[i] - t, 2e6));
    A.insert(make_pair(v[i], k++));
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this code is already highly optimized, and these changes may not bring significant improvements in terms of running time and memory usage. The major improvements are in terms of best coding practices and readability.
