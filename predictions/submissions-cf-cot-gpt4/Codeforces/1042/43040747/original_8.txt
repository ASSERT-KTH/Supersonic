Here are the steps to optimize this C++ program:

1. The first optimization can be done by replacing `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with specific include statements. The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes quite a number of standard C++ libraries which can increase the compilation time. It's better to include only the libraries that are actually being used in the program.

2. The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` are used to increase the speed of cin and cout. But in this program, we only have one cin and one cout. Therefore, these lines are unnecessary and can be removed.

3. We can reduce the size of the vector `v` by 1, by running the loop from 0 to n instead of 1 to n. This way we will save extra memory.

After these optimizations, here is the refactored program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
using namespace std;
using namespace __gnu_pbds;
typedef long long ll;
typedef tree<pair<ll, ll>, null_type, less<pair<ll, ll>>, rb_tree_tag, tree_order_statistics_node_update> pbdsm;

int main() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  ll n, t, ans = 0, k = 0;
  cin >> n >> t;
  vector<ll> v(n);
  pbdsm A;
  A.insert({0, 0});
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> v[i];
    if(i>0)
      v[i] += v[i - 1];
    ans += A.size() - A.order_of_key({v[i] - t, 2e6});
    A.insert({v[i], k++});
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version of the program will consume less memory due to the reduced vector size and will compile faster due to the removal of the `bits/stdc++.h` header.
