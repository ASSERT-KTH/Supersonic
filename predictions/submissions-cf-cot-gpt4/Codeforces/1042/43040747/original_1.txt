The code provided is already optimized in terms of time complexity. It's using an Order Statistic Tree (OST) for maintaining a sorted sequence of numbers in a way that allows very efficient (logarithmic in size on average) insertions, deletions, and lookups. It also allows efficient order statistics operations like finding the rank of a number and locating an element by its rank.

However, there's a small improvement that can be done. There's no need to initialize the first element of the vector 'v' to zero and insert it into the OST 'A', because the zero doesn't affect the cumulative sum and the order statistics later. We can remove these redundant operations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
using namespace std;
using namespace __gnu_pbds;
typedef long long ll;
typedef tree<pair<ll, ll>, null_type, less<pair<ll, ll>>, rb_tree_tag,
             tree_order_statistics_node_update>
    pbdsm;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  ll n, t, ans = 0, k = 1;
  cin >> n >> t;
  vector<ll> v(n);
  pbdsm A;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> v[i];
    if (i > 0) v[i] += v[i - 1];
    ans += A.size() - A.order_of_key({v[i] - t, 2e6});
    A.insert({v[i], k++});
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
The optimization is minor but it reduces the number of insertions into the tree by one and removes the redundant initialization of the first element of the vector 'v'.
