The provided program does not have a lot of room for optimization as it is already designed to perform well for its intended purpose. However, one small improvement can be made to slightly reduce the memory usage by eliminating the vector 'v' and instead using a single variable to hold the accumulated sum. This change will decrease the memory usage because we no longer need to store all the accumulated sums in a vector, but it will not affect the running time.

The modified program is shown below:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
using namespace std;
using namespace __gnu_pbds;
typedef long long ll;
typedef tree<pair<ll, ll>, null_type, less<pair<ll, ll>>, rb_tree_tag,
             tree_order_statistics_node_update>
    pbdsm;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  ll n, t, ans = 0, k = 1, accumulatedSum = 0;
  cin >> n >> t;
  pbdsm A;
  A.insert({0, 0});
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    ll x;
    cin >> x;
    accumulatedSum += x;
    ans += A.size() - A.order_of_key({accumulatedSum - t, 2e6});
    A.insert({accumulatedSum, k++});
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
