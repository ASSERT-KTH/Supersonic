The given program is already quite optimized in terms of runtime and memory usage. It's using a policy-based data structure (pbds) from the GNU C++ library, which provides relatively efficient operations like `order_of_key()`.

However, there are still few improvements we can make:

1. Avoid using `<bits/stdc++.h>`. It includes most of the standard C++ libraries, which can increase the compile time significantly. Instead, only include necessary headers.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;` and `using namespace __gnu_pbds;`. Namespaces are designed to prevent name conflicts. Using entire namespaces can lead to name clashes, which could cause bugs that are hard to track down.

3. Instead of storing `v[i]` and `v[i - 1]` in the vector, we can use two variables to keep track of them. This will save memory because we won't need to store all the elements in the vector.

4. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl` to print the newline character. `endl` causes an unnecessary flush of the output buffer, which can slow down the output operation.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>

typedef long long ll;
typedef __gnu_pbds::tree<std::pair<ll, ll>, __gnu_pbds::null_type, std::less<std::pair<ll, ll>>, __gnu_pbds::rb_tree_tag,
                         __gnu_pbds::tree_order_statistics_node_update>
    pbdsm;

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  ll n, t, ans = 0, k = 1, v_prev = 0, v_curr;
  std::cin >> n >> t;
  pbdsm A;
  A.insert({0, 0});
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> v_curr;
    v_curr += v_prev;
    ans += A.size() - A.order_of_key({v_curr - t, 2e6});
    A.insert({v_curr, k++});
    v_prev = v_curr;
  }
  std::cout << ans << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
