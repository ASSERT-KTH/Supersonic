The given code is already quite optimized. However, there are still a few small changes we can make to potentially improve performance. These changes will likely not have a major impact, but they can help make the code cleaner and slightly more efficient.

1. Avoid unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which can increase compile time. It's better to only include what you need.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;` and `using namespace __gnu_pbds;`: This can cause name clashes, which can be a source of bugs. It's better to use the std:: and __gnu_pbds:: prefixes where needed.

3. Remove `v[0] = 0;`: This line is unnecessary as vector elements are default initialized to 0.

4. Use prefix increment: Prefix increment (`++i`) is generally faster and more efficient than postfix increment (`i++`).

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>

typedef long long ll;
typedef __gnu_pbds::tree<std::pair<ll, ll>, __gnu_pbds::null_type, std::less<std::pair<ll, ll>>, __gnu_pbds::rb_tree_tag,
             __gnu_pbds::tree_order_statistics_node_update>
    pbdsm;

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  ll n, t, ans = 0, k = 1;
  std::cin >> n >> t;
  std::vector<ll> v(n + 1);
  pbdsm A;
  A.insert({0, 0});
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> v[i];
    v[i] += v[i - 1];
    ans += A.size() - A.order_of_key({v[i] - t, 2e6});
    A.insert({v[i], ++k});
  }
  std::cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations will not drastically improve the performance of your program. The main bottlenecks in your program are the tree operations, which already have optimal time complexity.
