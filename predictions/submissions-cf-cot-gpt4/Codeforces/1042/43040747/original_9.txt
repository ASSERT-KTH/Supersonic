This program seems to be quite optimized already in terms of both memory and running time. However, there are still a few small changes that could be made to further optimize it.

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of headers that you might not need in your program. This could slow down the compilation time.

2. Avoid Global Variables: Global variables are usually stored in the heap, which can reduce the speed of the program. In this case, `n`, `t`, `ans`, `k` and `v` can be declared within the main function. 

3. Using `fast_io()`: You can create a function `fast_io()` and place the lines `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` inside it to speed up the I/O operations. Call this function in the main function. 

4. Avoid using `endl`: You can use `"\n"` instead of `endl` for newline. `endl` not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the stream, which can be time-consuming.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>

using namespace std;
using namespace __gnu_pbds;

typedef long long ll;
typedef tree<pair<ll, ll>, null_type, less<pair<ll, ll>>, rb_tree_tag,
             tree_order_statistics_node_update>
    pbdsm;

void fast_io() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
}

int main() {
    fast_io();

#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
    freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
    freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif

    ll n, t, ans = 0, k = 1;
    cin >> n >> t;

    vector<ll> v(n + 1);
    v[0] = 0;

    pbdsm A;
    A.insert({0, 0});

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        cin >> v[i];
        v[i] += v[i - 1];
        ans += A.size() - A.order_of_key({v[i] - t, 2e6});
        A.insert({v[i], k++});
    }

    cout << ans << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

Please note that these are micro-optimizations and may not have a significant impact on the performance of the program. It's always better to focus more on the algorithmic complexity of the program for significant performance improvements.
