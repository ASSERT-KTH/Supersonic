The given C++ program is already optimized in terms of data structures used. It uses Policy-Based Data Structures (PBDS), which is a very efficient way to perform operations in C++. 

However, there is a small improvement that can be made. The vector `v` is currently being used to store the cumulative sum of the input values. This vector is not required as we can maintain the cumulative sum in a separate variable and update it as we read the input. 

This will save some space as we will not need to store all the cumulative sums at once. 

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
using namespace std;
using namespace __gnu_pbds;
typedef long long ll;
typedef tree<pair<ll, ll>, null_type, less<pair<ll, ll>>, rb_tree_tag,
             tree_order_statistics_node_update>
    pbdsm;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  ll n, t, ans = 0, k = 1;
  cin >> n >> t;
  ll sum = 0;
  pbdsm A;
  A.insert({0, 0});
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    ll temp;
    cin >> temp;
    sum += temp;
    ans += A.size() - A.order_of_key({sum - t, 2e6});
    A.insert({sum, k++});
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
