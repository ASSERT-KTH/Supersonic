This program is already quite optimized but there are few things we can do to make it run faster and use less memory:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes almost all standard library headers which can considerably increase the compilation time. It's better to include only those headers which are required for the program. 

2. Use `reserve()` for vectors: If the maximum size of a vector is known in advance, calling `reserve()` can reduce the number of memory reallocations (which are expensive operations), as the vector grows in size.

3. Pass large objects by constant reference: This can avoid expensive copy operations. In the given program, `vector<pair<pll, int>> v` and `map<ll, int> mp` are passed by value to the functions `solve()` and `update()`, respectively. It would be better to pass them by constant reference.

4. Avoid global variables if possible: Global variables consume memory for the entire lifetime of the program and can lead to naming conflicts and make the program harder to understand.

5. Use appropriate data types: For example, if a variable will only hold non-negative numbers, use unsigned data types.

6. Use prefix increment (++i) instead of postfix (i++): The prefix version avoids unnecessary temporary object creation and is generally more efficient.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<map>
#include<algorithm>
#include<limits>

using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pll;

const int N = 6e5 + 5;

void fast() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
}

void update(int x, int y, int val, vector<int> &segtree, vector<int> &lazy, int node = 0, int l = 0, int r = N - 1) {
  //...
  update(x, y, val, segtree, lazy, 2 * node + 1, l, mid);
  update(x, y, val, segtree, lazy, 2 * node + 2, mid + 1, r);
  //...
}

int query(int x, int y, const vector<int> &segtree, vector<int> &lazy, int node = 0, int l = 0, int r = N - 1) {
  //...
  return min(query(x, y, segtree, lazy, 2 * node + 1, l, mid),
             query(x, y, segtree, lazy, 2 * node + 2, mid + 1, r));
}

void solve(vector<pll> &v, map<ll, int> &mp, vector<ll> &inv_map, vector<int> &segtree, vector<int> &lazy, int n, int k) {
  //...
}

int main() {
  fast();
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  vector<pll> v;
  v.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    ll a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    v.push_back({{a, b}, i});
  }
  map<ll, int> mp;
  vector<ll> inv_map(N);
  vector<int> segtree(4 * N, 0);
  vector<int> lazy(4 * N, 0);
  solve(v, mp, inv_map, segtree, lazy, n, k);
}
```
