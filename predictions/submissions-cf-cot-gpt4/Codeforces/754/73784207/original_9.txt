This is an advanced program with various complex operations. The optimizations that can be applied here are not extensive, but there are a few changes that could potentially improve the performance in terms of running time and memory usage.

1. Avoid std::endl: Using std::endl to insert a newline character and flush the stream can be costly in terms of performance when writing to an output stream frequently. It would be better to replace std::endl with "\n" where possible, and flush the stream manually when needed.

2. Use reserve for vectors: For std::vector, if you know the number of elements that will be inserted ahead of time, you can use the reserve function to allocate memory once and avoid reallocations.

3. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The spread function is called on every call of the update and query functions, regardless of whether lazy[node] is zero or not. You can add a condition to check if lazy[node] is non-zero before calling spread.

4. Use prefix increment: Prefix increment is faster than postfix increment. Although the difference is negligible for built-in types like int, it's still a good practice to use prefix increment, especially when dealing with iterators or custom objects.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define F first
#define S second
#define pb push_back
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pll;

template <class T> ostream &operator<<(ostream &os, const vector<T> &v) {
  for (T i : v)
    os << i << ", ";
  return os << "\n";
}
template <class T> ostream &operator<<(ostream &os, const set<T> &v) {
  for (T i : v)
    os << i << " ";
  return os << "\n";
}
template <class T> ostream &operator<<(ostream &os, const multiset<T> &v) {
  for (T i : v)
    os << i << " ";
  return os << "\n";
}
template <class T, class S>
ostream &operator<<(ostream &os, const pair<T, S> &v) {
  return os << v.F << ' ' << v.S << "\n";
}
template <class T, class S>
ostream &operator<<(ostream &os, const map<T, S> &v) {
  for (auto i : v)
    os << '(' << i.F << " => " << i.S << ')' << ' ';
  return os << "\n";
}

void fast() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
}

const int N = 6e5 + 5;
vector<pair<pll, int>> v;
map<ll, int> mp;
vector<ll> inv_map(N);
int n, k;
vector<int> segtree(4 * N, 0), lazy(4 * N, 0);

void spread(int node, int l, int r) {
  if (lazy[node] != 0) {
    segtree[node] += lazy[node];
    if (l != r) {
      lazy[2 * node + 1] += lazy[node];
      lazy[2 * node + 2] += lazy[node];
    }
    lazy[node] = 0;
  }
}

// Other parts of code remain the same
```

Please note that the effectiveness of these optimizations can vary depending on the compiler, the specific workload, and other factors. A profiler should be used to measure the actual improvement.
