The given code is a complex piece of code that implements a Segment Tree along with Lazy Propagation. It seems that the code's main purpose is to find a sub-sequence of a given sequence that satisfies certain conditions. However, there are a few optimizations that can be made to improve this program. 

1. Instead of using `bits/stdc++.h`, include only the necessary standard libraries. `bits/stdc++.h` includes all standard libraries which increases the compilation time. 

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`. This can cause name conflicts if the standard library has a function with a name that you want to use in your code. 

3. Use `ios::sync_with_stdio(0)` and `cin.tie(0)` only when you are dealing with a large input-output problem. These lines can slow down the code when used unnecessarily.

4. Minimize the use of global variables. In this case, `segtree`, `lazy`, `v`, `mp`, `inv_map`, `n`, and `k` are all global variables. This might increase memory usage and can also lead to bugs.

5. Use meaningful variable names. This can greatly improve the readability of your code.

6. Use `std::endl` only when you need to flush the output buffer. Use `'\n'` otherwise since it's faster.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <utility>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::vector;
using std::map;
using std::pair;
using std::set;
using std::multiset;
using std::endl;
using std::min;
using std::max;
using std::sort;
using std::ios;

typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pll;

const int N = 6e5 + 5;

void solve() {
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  vector<pair<pll, int>> v;
  map<ll, int> mp;
  vector<ll> inv_map(N);
  vector<int> segtree(4 * N, 0), lazy(4 * N, 0);
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    ll a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    v.push_back({{a, b}, i});
  }
  // The rest of the code remains the same
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code has only local variables, includes only the necessary libraries, avoids using `std::endl` when not necessary, and doesn't use `ios::sync_with_stdio(0)` and `cin.tie(0)`. Thus, it should run faster and use less memory than the original code.
