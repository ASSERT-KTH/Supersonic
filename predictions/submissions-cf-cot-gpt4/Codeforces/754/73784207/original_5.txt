This program is fairly optimized and well-written. However, there are some small changes that can be made to improve the performance of the code.

1. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` at the beginning of the main function. This will turn off synchronization with the C standard streams which can speed up the IO operations.

2. Use `std::cin.tie(NULL);` and `std::cout.tie(NULL);` after the previous step. These two calls untie cin from cout which can speed up cin and cout operations.

3. Avoid using `std::endl`. Instead, use `"\n"`. `std::endl` causes an unnecessary flush operation which can slow down the program.

4. Use `reserve` function for vectors when the size is known in advance. This can reduce the number of reallocations when the size of the vector grows dynamically.

5. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back` when adding elements to a vector. `emplace_back` directly constructs the object in memory and can be faster than `push_back`.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define F first
#define S second
#define pb emplace_back
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pll;

void fast() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
}

const int N = 6e5 + 5;
vector<pair<pll, int>> v;
map<ll, int> mp;
vector<ll> inv_map(N);
int n, k;
vector<int> segtree(4 * N, 0), lazy(4 * N, 0);

// rest of the code remains the same

int main() {
  fast();
  cin >> n >> k;
  v.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    ll a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    v.pb({{a, b}, i});
  }
  solve();
}
```

Note: The optimization of the program depends on the compiler and the environment. The changes that I suggested may not always increase performance. It's always a good idea to measure the performance before and after optimization.
