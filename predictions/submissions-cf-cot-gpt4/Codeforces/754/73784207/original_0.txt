This program seems to be a segment tree-based solution. I notice that there's a lazy propagation technique used here, which is a good practice for efficiently updating a range in such data structures. But, there's a room for optimization in the way memory is used and some other minor changes that could help the performance of the program.

Here are the optimizations I propose:

1. The use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is discouraged as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, increasing the compile time. It's better to include only the necessary libraries, which in this case are `iostream`, `vector`, `map`, `algorithm`, `climits` and `utility`.

2. In the `update` function, you could omit the check `if (x > y)` since it should not happen in a well-constructed segment tree.

3. In the `update` and `query` functions, you could avoid the spread operation `spread(node, l, r)` if the conditions `if (l > y || r < x)` are met, as it is unnecessary to process those nodes.

4. As for memory optimization, the vectors `segtree`, `lazy` and `inv_map` are currently initialized with a size of `4*N` or `N`, which might be larger than required. Instead of initializing with a fixed size, you could use `push_back` or `emplace_back` to add elements as needed.

5. Avoid `endl` to improve speed. Using `endl` will cause a flush operation, which can be a performance problem. Use `'\n'` instead.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;
#define F first
#define S second
#define pb push_back
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pll;
void fast() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
}
vector<pair<pll, int>> v;
map<ll, int> mp;
vector<ll> inv_map;
vector<int> segtree, lazy;
void spread(int node, int l, int r) {
  if (lazy[node] != 0) {
    segtree[node] += lazy[node];
    if (l != r) {
      lazy[2 * node + 1] += lazy[node];
      lazy[2 * node + 2] += lazy[node];
    }
    lazy[node] = 0;
  }
}
void update(int x, int y, int val, int node = 0, int l = 0, int r = v.size() - 1) {
  if (l > y || r < x)
    return;
  spread(node, l, r);
  if (l >= x && r <= y) {
    lazy[node] += val;
    spread(node, l, r);
    return;
  }
  int mid = (l + r) >> 1;
  update(x, y, val, 2 * node + 1, l, mid);
  update(x, y, val, 2 * node + 2, mid + 1, r);
  segtree[node] = min(segtree[2 * node + 1], segtree[2 * node + 2]);
}
int query(int x, int y, int node = 0, int l = 0, int r = v.size() - 1) {
  if (l > y || r < x)
    return INT_MAX - 1;
  spread(node, l, r);
  if (l >= x && r <= y) {
    return segtree[node];
  }
  int mid = (l + r) >> 1;
  return min(query(x, y, 2 * node + 1, l, mid),
             query(x, y, 2 * node + 2, mid + 1, r));
}
// Rest of the code remains the same
```
