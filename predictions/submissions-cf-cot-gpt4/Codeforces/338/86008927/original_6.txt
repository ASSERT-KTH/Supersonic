Your code seems really optimized, but there are a few things that can be improved:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is quite large and contains practically everything from the standard library. This can considerably slow down your compile time. Instead, include only the headers that you actually use. 

2. Use `std::vector<ll> a(N);` instead of `ll a[N];` to automatically manage memory.

3. Using `std::endl` can cause unnecessary flushes of the output buffer, slowing down your program. Use `'\n'` instead.

4. Use `auto` when declaring variables with obvious types, to make the code cleaner and easier to read. It also reduces the chance of type mismatch errors.

5. Use `constexpr` for constant expressions to potentially improve performance.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <chrono>
#include <random>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>

#define NAME "File"
using ll = long long;
using ld = long double;

std::mt19937
    rnd(std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());

constexpr double PI = atan2(0.0, -1.0);
constexpr int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
constexpr ll LINF = (ll)2e18;
constexpr int N = 10100;

ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  if (b == 0) {
    return a;
  }
  return gcd(b, a % b);
}

ll lcm(ll a, ll b) {
  ll d = gcd(a, b);
  a /= d;
  if (a > LINF / b) {
    printf("NO\n");
    exit(0);
  }
  return a * b;
}

//... rest of the code

int main(void) {
  auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  run();
  auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

  std::cerr << "Execution time: "
            << std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(end -
                                                                     start)
                   .count()
            << " ms" << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

Notice that I didn't include `#ifdef PERVEEVM_LOCAL` and `#define debug(x)` as they seem to be specific to your developing environment and don't have an impact on the optimization.
