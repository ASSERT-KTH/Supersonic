There are several possible optimizations for this program:

1. **Remove unused variables and #defines:** Unused constants and variables are not necessarily a problem, as they do not affect the execution time of the code, but they do make the code longer and more difficult to read. For example, the `debug(x)` macro and the `PI` constant are never used.
2. **Precompute the lcm in the gcd function:** The lcm function first calculates the gcd and then divides by it. Since the gcd is also calculated before the lcm in other parts of the code, it would be better to store the result of the gcd calculation and reuse it in the lcm function.
3. **Avoid unnecessary modulo operations:** Modulo operation is a costly operation. In multiple places in the code, modulo operation is applied even when the number is already within the range. This can be avoided by adding conditions to check if the modulo operation is necessary.
4. **Avoid unnecessary function calls:** In the gcdEx function, the gcdEx function is recursively called before assigning x = y1 and y = x1 - y1 * (a / b). These assignments do not depend on the result of the recursive call, so they could be performed before the recursive call, which would save one function call in the case where b == 0.
5. **Use prefix increment (++i) instead of postfix (i++) in loops:** It's a good practice to use prefix increment in loops since it could potentially provide performance benefits over postfix increment in some cases.

Below is the optimized code:

    return 0;
  }

    return binmul((a + a) % mod, b / 2, mod);

  }
}
