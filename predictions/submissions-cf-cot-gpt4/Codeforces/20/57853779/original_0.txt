The given program is implementing Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. Dijkstra's algorithm is already pretty optimized, but there are a few things in the code that we can optimize.

Here are some possible optimization steps:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The vectors `distance` and `processed` are allocated with size `maxn`, which is a constant set to 100005. In case the actual number of nodes `n` is much smaller, this will lead to unnecessary memory allocation. We can allocate these vectors with size `n+1` instead, because the nodes are numbered from 1 to `n`.

2. Use `reserve()` for vectors: When we know the maximum size a vector can grow to, it's a good idea to use the `reserve()` function. This will allocate all the necessary memory at once, avoiding reallocations as elements are added.

3. Avoid copying in range-based for loop: When we use range-based for loop like `for (auto u : adj[a])`, it creates a copy of each element of `adj[a]`. We can avoid this by using reference like `for(auto& u : adj[a])`.

Here's the optimized program according to these steps:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
const int INF = 1e18;

int32_t main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  if (m == 0) {
    cout << "-1" << endl;
    return 0;
  }
  vector<pair<int, int>> adj[n+1];
  adj->reserve(n+1); // Reserve memory for adj
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int a, b, w;
    cin >> a >> b >> w;
    adj[a].push_back({b, w});
    adj[b].push_back({a, w});
  }
  int x = 1;
  vector<bool> processed(n+1, false); // Allocate with size n+1
  vector<int> distance(n+1, INF); // Allocate with size n+1
  vector<int> p(n+1, -1); // Allocate with size n+1
  distance[x] = 0;
  using pii = pair<int, int>;
  priority_queue<pii> q;
  q.push({0, x});
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int a = q.top().second;
    q.pop();
    if (processed[a])
      continue;
    processed[a] = true;
    for (auto& u : adj[a]) { // Avoid copying in range-based for loop
      int b = u.first, w = u.second;
      if (distance[a] + w < distance[b]) {
        distance[b] = distance[a] + w;
        p[b] = a;
        q.push({-distance[b], b});
      }
    }
  }
  if (p[n] == -1) {
    cout << "-1" << endl;
    return 0;
  }
  vector<int> path;
  path.reserve(n); // Reserve memory for path
  for (int v = n; v != x; v = p[v]) {
    path.push_back(v);
  }
  path.push_back(x);
  reverse(path.begin(), path.end());
  for (auto i : path)
    cout << i << ' ';
  cout << endl;
}
```
