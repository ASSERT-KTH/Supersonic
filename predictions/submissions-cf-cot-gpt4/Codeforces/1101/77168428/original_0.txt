The code provided is already quite optimized, but there are some small changes that could be made.

1. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with specific includes: This header file is quite large and includes more than you probably need, which might slow down your compile time.
2. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` instead of `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0)`: Although both are equivalent in functionality, the former is more universally recognized and understood.
3. Avoid using `#define`: It's generally better to use constant variables or inline functions instead of `#define` as they are type safe.
4. Use `reserve` for vectors: If you know the size of a vector beforehand, you can use the `reserve` function to preallocate the required memory. This can save time by avoiding reallocations.
5. Remove `primes` vector: It seems that the `primes` vector is not used anywhere in the program. Therefore, we can safely remove it to save memory.

Now, taking these points into consideration, let's modify the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

constexpr int N = 2e5 + 100;
vector<int> g[N], val(N), d(N);
map<int, int> dp[N];
int ans = 0;

vector<int> get(int x) {
  vector<int> ret;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= x; i++) {
    if (x % i == 0) {
      ret.push_back(i);
      while (x % i == 0)
        x /= i;
    }
  }
  if (x != 1)
    ret.push_back(x);
  return ret;
}

struct max2 {
  int x = 0, y = 0;
  max2() {}
  void rlx(int z) {
    if (z >= x)
      y = x, x = z;
    else if (z >= y)
      y = z;
  }
  int sum() { return x + y; }
};

void dfs(int v, int p) {
  vector<int> cur = get(val[v]);
  cur.reserve(val[v]);
  vector<max2> t(cur.size());
  for (auto u : g[v]) {
    if (u == p)
      continue;
    dfs(u, v);
    for (int i = 0; i < cur.size(); i++) {
      int x = cur[i];
      if (!dp[u].count(x))
        continue;
      t[i].rlx(dp[u][x]);
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < cur.size(); i++) {
    int x = cur[i];
    ans = max(ans, t[i].sum() + 1);
    dp[v][x] = t[i].x + 1;
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
    if (d[i] == 0) {
      d[i] = i;
    }
  }

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> val[i];
  for (int i = 0, a, b; i < n - 1; i++) {
    cin >> a >> b;
    a--;
    b--;
    g[a].push_back(b);
    g[b].push_back(a);
  }
  dfs(0, -1);
  cout << ans << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the optimization will not bring a noticeable increase in performance, as the original code was already fairly optimized. The changes are more about best practices and slightly more efficient memory usage.
