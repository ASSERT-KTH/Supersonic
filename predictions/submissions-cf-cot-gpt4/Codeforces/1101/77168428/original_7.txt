The given C++ program is already optimized using common practices. However, there are still a few things we can adjust to slightly improve its performance.

1. Replace `vector` with `array` where possible: The C++ `vector` is a dynamic array that can grow as needed. This is convenient but comes with a small performance overhead. Where the size is known and does not change, we can use `std::array` instead, which does not have this overhead. However, in this case, most vectors seem to require dynamic sizing, so this optimization may not be applicable.

2. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations: The function `get(int x)` is creating a new vector `ret` every time it's called, which involves memory allocation. If this function is called very frequently, this could become a performance issue. We could potentially pass `ret` as an argument to `get(int x, vector<int>& ret)` and clear it at the beginning of the function to avoid these allocations. However, this would require changes to the calling code as well.

3. Avoid `std::map` where possible: `std::map` is a tree-based dictionary that provides O(log(n)) access time. If the keys are integers and the range is not too large, `std::unordered_map` (a hash table) might provide faster average-case access time. However, this can also increase memory usage, so it's a trade-off.

4. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The `sz(x)` function is called multiple times with the same argument within a loop. The result of this function call could be stored in a variable to avoid repeating the function call.

Here is the slightly optimized version of your code considering the 3rd and 4th points. Other optimizations either cannot be applied to this code or would require more changes:

const int N = 2e5 + 100;
vector<int> g[N], val(N), d(N), primes;
unordered_map<int, int> dp[N]; // Change map to unordered_map
int ans = 0;

vector<int> get(int x) {
  vector<int> ret;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= x; i++) {
    if (x % i == 0) {
      ret.pb(i);
      while (x % i == 0)
        x /= i;
    }
  }
  if (x != 1)
    ret.pb(x);
  return ret;
}

struct max2 {
  int x = 0, y = 0;
  max2() {}
  void rlx(int z) {
    if (z >= x)
      y = x, x = z;
    else if (z >= y)
      y = z;
  }
  int sum() { return x + y; }
};

void dfs(int v, int p) {
  vector<int> cur = get(val[v]);
  int curSize = sz(cur); // Store the size of cur to avoid multiple function calls
  vector<max2> t(curSize);
  for (auto u : g[v]) {
    if (u == p)
      continue;
    dfs(u, v);
    for (int i = 0; i < curSize; i++) { // Use stored size
      int x = cur[i];
      if (!dp[u].count(x))
        continue;
      t[i].rlx(dp[u][x]);
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < curSize; i++) { // Use stored size
    int x = cur[i];
    ans = max(ans, t[i].sum() + 1);
    dp[v][x] = t[i].x + 1;
  }
}
