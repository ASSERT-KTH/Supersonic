The given C/C++ code is not optimized for running time as it has two nested loops which iterate 4000 times each and this leads to a time complexity of O(n^2). In each iteration, it calculates the number of "C" for the given constraints and checks if it is greater than or equal to 0 and also if the remainder when 'n' subtracted by 'A*a' and 'B*b' divided by 'c' is zero, then it updates the value of 'ans' with the maximum value.

The memory usage of this code is optimal as only a few variables are used and there are no unnecessary memory allocations.

Here are the steps to optimize this code:

1. To optimize the time complexity, we can reduce the number of iterations of the loops. In the given code, the loops are iterating until 4000 which is unnecessary. Instead, we can iterate until 'n/a' and 'n/b' for the variables 'A' and 'B' respectively as these are the maximum possible values for these variables.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, a, b, c;
  cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;
  int ans = 0;
  for (int A = 0; A*a <= n; A++) {
    for (int B = 0; A*a + B*b <= n; B++) {
      int C = (n - (A * a + B * b)) / c;
      if ((n - (A * a + B * b)) % c == 0) {
        ans = max(ans, A + B + C);
      }
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code has a smaller time complexity and thus will run faster. The memory usage is still optimal as no unnecessary memory allocations are made.
