First, let's analyze the original program to understand what it does and identify potential bottlenecks.

The program calculates all possible combinations of variables A, B, and C (where C is based on A and B and the inputs n, a, b, and c), and then keeps track of the maximum sum of A, B, and C where 'n - (A * a + B * b) is exactly divisible by c'. 

The bottleneck in this program is obviously the two nested loops, which give us a time complexity of O(n^2). 

Optimization Steps:

1. We do not need to iterate A and B up to 4000. It is enough to iterate up to 'n/a' for A and 'n/b' for B, because 'A * a' and 'B * b' cannot exceed 'n'.

2. The calculation of C can be optimized. We calculate C for every pair of A and B, but we can calculate it once for every A and B. We can declare C outside the loop of B and calculate it only when B changes.

3. We are calculating '(n - (A * a + B * b))' twice, once for calculating C and once for the if condition. We can calculate it once, store the result in a variable, and use it both times.

4. We don't need to check '(n - (A * a + B * b)) % c == 0' because C is calculated by integer division, so it is always true that 'n - (A * a + B * b) == C * c'.

Now let's apply these optimizations to the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, a, b, c;
  cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;
  int ans = 0;
  for (int A = 0; A <= n/a; A++) {
    for (int B = 0; B <= (n - A * a) / b; B++) {
      int left = n - (A * a + B * b);
      int C = left / c;
      ans = max(ans, A + B + C);
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version of the program will have the same output as the original one, but it will run faster, especially for large inputs.
