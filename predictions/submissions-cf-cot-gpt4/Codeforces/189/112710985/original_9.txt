The optimization primarily focuses on reducing the number of operations and also memory usage. 

Here are the steps for optimization:

1. Remove the unnecessary function declaration: The function "Max" is declared but not defined or used anywhere in the program. Therefore, it is not necessary and can be removed to clean up the code.

2. Reduce the range of the loops: Currently, the loops iterate from 0 to 4000, which is not optimal. We should limit the number of iterations by calculating the maximum possible values of A and B. This can be achieved by dividing 'n' with 'a' and 'b' respectively. 

3. Avoid repetitive calculations: The same calculation (n - (A * a + B * b)) is done twice in the if condition. We can store the calculation in variable 'remaining' and use it in the if condition and while calculating C.

Now, let's put these steps into code:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, a, b, c;
  cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;
  int ans = 0;
  for (int A = 0; A <= n/a; A++) {
    for (int B = 0; B <= (n - A*a)/b; B++) {
      int remaining = n - (A * a + B * b);
      int C = remaining / c;
      if (remaining % c == 0) {
        ans = max(ans, A + B + C);
      }
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program reduces the number of iterations and also avoids repetitive calculations, thus improves both time and memory efficiency.
