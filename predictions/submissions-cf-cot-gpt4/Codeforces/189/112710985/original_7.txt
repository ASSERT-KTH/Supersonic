This program seems to be finding the maximum number of pieces that can be cut from a rod of length 'n' where the possible lengths of the pieces are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. It does this by trying every combination of 'a', 'b', and 'c' using two nested loops, which results in a time complexity of O(n^2). This is quite inefficient.

Optimizations:

1. Change the limits of the loops: The maximum value of A and B can only be (n/a) and (n/b) respectively, there is no need to run the loops up to 4000. This reduces the number of iterations significantly.

2. Remove the modulo operation: The modulo operation in the if condition is checking that the total length of the rods cut is exactly 'n'. However, this is unnecessary because the condition (C >= 0) already ensures this.

Here's the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, a, b, c;
  cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;
  int ans = 0;
  for (int A = 0; A <= n/a; A++) {
    for (int B = 0; B <= (n-A*a)/b; B++) {
      int C = (n - (A * a + B * b)) / c;
      if (C >= 0) {
        ans = max(ans, A + B + C);
      }
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This code will work faster and consume less memory than the original one.
