Step 1: Eliminate Unnecessary Operation

In the existing code, the operation `(n - (A * a + B * b))` is performed twice. We can store this result in a variable and use that variable instead, this will reduce the number of operations.

Step 2: Reduce the Range of Loops

The loops are running till 4000, which might be unnecessary. We can reduce this to `n / a` for loop A and `n / b` for loop B. This will significantly reduce the number of iterations.

Step 3: Break Loop Earlier

We can break the inner loop once `C` becomes negative, this will avoid unnecessary iterations.

Step 4: Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`

This is a technique often used in competitive programming to speed up input/output operations.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, a, b, c;
  cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;
  int ans = 0;
  for (int A = 0; A <= n/a; A++) {
    for (int B = 0; B <= (n - A * a) / b; B++) {
      int diff = n - (A * a + B * b);
      int C = diff / c;
      if (diff % c == 0) {
        ans = max(ans, A + B + C);
      }
      else if (C < 0) {
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

The above modifications will significantly reduce the execution time of the code.
