The given program tries to find the maximum sum of A, B, and C, where A, B, and C are the number of times a, b, and c (respectively) can divide the number n.

Optimization steps:

1. The first problem here is the nested for loops, which have a time complexity of O(n^2). But in this case, we can use a dynamic programming approach to reduce this to O(n).

2. Secondly, the calculation of C and the condition checking are done repeatedly inside the inner loop. We can calculate it once outside the inner loop to avoid repeated calculations.

3. Furthermore, we can replace the use of max() with a simple if condition to speed up the program.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, a, b, c;
  cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;

  int dp[4005] = {0};

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (i >= a) dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - a] + 1);
    if (i >= b) dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - b] + 1);
    if (i >= c) dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - c] + 1);
  }

  cout << dp[n] << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

We are using a dynamic programming array dp[] to store the maximum sum of A, B, C that can be obtained for each possible value of n from 1 to n. For each i (1 <= i <= n), we calculate the maximum sum that can be obtained if we divide it by a, b, or c (if i is larger or equal to a, b, or c, respectively), and store the maximum of these values in dp[i]. The maximum sum for the given n is then stored in dp[n]. This approach reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).
