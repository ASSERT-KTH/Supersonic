The provided code determines the maximum number of pieces a rope can be cut into. It uses three types of pieces, each of different lengths a, b, and c, to cut a rope of length n. The current code uses three nested loops which leads to a time complexity of O(n^3). As a result, it isn't efficient for large inputs.

Optimization steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary third loop that calculates C. Instead, calculate C directly after B is calculated. If the number of pieces of type C is negative, it means the combination of A and B is invalid, and we can break the current loop.

2. The "Max" function declaration at the top is not used in the code. So, it can be removed to save memory.

3. We can use prefix increment (++A, ++B) instead of postfix (A++, B++) to slightly enhance the performance.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, a, b, c;
    cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;
    int ans = 0;
    for (int A = 0; A <= 4000; ++A) {
        for (int B = 0; B <= 4000; ++B) {
            int temp = A * a + B * b;
            if (temp > n) break;
            int C = (n - temp) / c;
            if ((n - temp) % c == 0) {
                ans = max(ans, A + B + C);
            }
        }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code has a time complexity of O(n^2) which is a substantial improvement over the original code. However, it's important to note that it could still be slow for large inputs.
