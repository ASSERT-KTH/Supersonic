The original program is trying to find the maximum possible number of items (A, B, C) that can be created from a given total `n`, where each item A, B, C costs `a`, `b`, `c` respectively.

The current program uses a nested loop to go through all possible combinations of A and B (from 0 to 4000), and then calculates the possible number of C. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2), which can be quite slow for larger inputs.

We can optimize the program by reducing the number of iterations. Since the maximum number of A and B items that can be created is `n/a` and `n/b` respectively, we can reduce the upper limit of the loops from 4000 to `n/a` and `n/b`. This will significantly reduce the number of iterations and thus improve the running time.

The optimized program does not require additional memory, so the memory usage remains the same.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, a, b, c;
  cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;
  int ans = 0;
  for (int A = 0; A*a <= n; A++) {
    for (int B = 0; B*b <= n - A*a; B++) {
      int C = (n - (A * a + B * b)) / c;
      if (C >= 0 && (n - (A * a + B * b)) % c == 0) {
        ans = max(ans, A + B + C);
      }
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program significantly improves the running time by reducing the number of iterations in the loops.
