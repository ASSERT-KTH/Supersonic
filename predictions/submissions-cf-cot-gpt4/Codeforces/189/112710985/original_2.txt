The given code is trying to find the maximum possible sum of A, B, and C such that A*a + B*b + C*c equals to n. It is using brute force and checking every possible value of A and B from 0 to 4000. This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), which can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The first optimization is that we don't need to iterate B up to 4000. If we have A*a + B*b = n, then B should not be greater than n/b. Therefore, we can limit the loop of B to n/b which can significantly reduce the number of iterations.
2. The second optimization is that we don't need to calculate C and check the condition in every iteration. We can calculate C outside the loop of B, because C is only dependent on A, not B.
3. We can further optimize the calculation of C and the condition check by calculating C only when (n - A*a) is divisible by b. If it's not, we can continue to the next iteration of A without calculating C and checking the condition.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int n, a, b, c;
    cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;
    int ans = 0;
    for (int A = 0; A*a <= n; A++) {
        if ((n - A*a) % b == 0) {
            int B = (n - A*a) / b;
            int C = (n - A*a - B*b) / c;
            ans = max(ans, A + B + C);
        }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This optimized code reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n), which greatly improves the running time.
