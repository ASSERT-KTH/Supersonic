Alright. Let's optimize the code step by step.

1. Removal of unused macros: 

    The macro definitions like `#define F first`, `#define S second`, `#define debug1(a)`, `#define debug2(a, b)`, and `#define debug3(a, b, c)` are not used anywhere in the code. So, they are redundant and can be removed.

2. Avoiding unnecessary copying of vectors:

    In the for loop `for (auto x : m)`, `x` is the copy of the map element. And again, `vector<ll> v = x.second;` is another copy from that copy. This might significantly affect the performance when the map and vector size are huge. We can avoid this copying by using references.

3. Avoiding unnecessary vector size checking:

    In the code, `if (v.size() > 1)` is used to check if the size of the vector is more than 1, and then we are looping from 1 to the size of vector. This check can be avoided by starting the loop from 0. If the size is not more than 1, it will not enter the loop anyway.

4. Using `const auto &` in range-based loops:

    Using `const auto &` instead of `auto` in range-based `for` loops can avoid unnecessary copying of objects and can significantly improve the speed when working with large objects.

Now let's put these optimizations into code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int ll;
#define endl '\n'
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  map<ll, vector<ll>> m;
  rep(i, n) {
    ll val;
    cin >> val;
    m[val].push_back(i + 1);
  }
  ll minres = LLONG_MAX;
  for (const auto &x : m) {
    const vector<ll> &v = x.second;
    for (int i = 1; i < v.size(); i++) {
      if ((v[i] - v[i - 1]) > 0) {
        minres = min(minres, v[i] - v[i - 1] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  if (minres == LLONG_MAX) {
    cout << -1 << endl;
  } else {
    cout << minres << endl;
  }
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
}
```
This optimized code should run faster and consume less memory than the original version.
