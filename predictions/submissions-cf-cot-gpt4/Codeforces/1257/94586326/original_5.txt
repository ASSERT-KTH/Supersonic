Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary imports: The first line "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" contains all the libraries of C++, many of which are not necessary for this program. It is better to include only those libraries which are being used.

2. Use "reserve" for vector: If we know the maximum number of elements that will be stored in the vector, we can use the "reserve" function to preallocate memory. It can avoid reallocation of the memory when more elements are added to it, which can save time.

3. Avoid copying in the range-based for loop: In the line "for (auto x : m)" we make a copy of each item in the map. If the data is large, it can lead to a significant slowdown. Instead, we can use a reference to avoid copying.

4. Avoid creating a temporary vector: In the line "vector<ll> v = x.second;", we create a temporary vector which is not necessary. We can directly use "x.second" in the loop.

Here's the optimized code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int ll;
#define endl '\n'
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  map<ll, vector<ll>> m;
  m.reserve(n); // Reserve memory for map
  rep(i, n) {
    ll val;
    cin >> val;
    m[val].push_back(i + 1);
  }
  ll minres = LLONG_MAX;
  for (const auto &x : m) { // Avoid copying, use reference
    if (x.second.size() > 1) {
      for (int i = 1; i < x.second.size(); i++) { // Use x.second directly
        if ((x.second[i] - x.second[i - 1]) > 0) {
          minres = min(minres, x.second[i] - x.second[i - 1] + 1);
        }
      }
    }
  }
  if (minres == LLONG_MAX) {
    cout << -1 << endl;
  } else {
    cout << minres << endl;
  }
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
}
```
Please note that the "#define" macros used for debugging are removed as they are not used anywhere in code. If they are required, they can be added back.
