This program appears to be an implementation of a problem-solving function, where it reads an input size and values, stores them in a map with their indices, and then finds the smallest difference between indices of the same number. The optimization can be made in terms of readability, memory usage and running time.

1. Avoid using #include <bits/stdc++.h>. bits/stdc++.h> is actually quite heavy because it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increases the compilation time. It's better to include only the libraries that you need.

2. The debug macros at the top are not being used and can be removed.

3. Instead of copying the vector `v` from the map `m`, we can use a constant reference to avoid the overhead of copying.

4. The if (v.size() > 1) check is redundant because if the size of the vector is less than or equal to 1, the code inside the loop will not be executed anyway.

5. Instead of checking if (minres == LLONG_MAX) to output -1, we can initialize minres to -1 and update it only when a smaller valid result is found.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;
typedef long long int ll;

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  map<ll, vector<ll>> m;
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ll val;
    cin >> val;
    m[val].push_back(i + 1);
  }
  ll minres = -1;
  for (const auto& x : m) {
    const vector<ll>& v = x.second;
    for (ll i = 1; i < v.size(); i++) {
      ll res = v[i] - v[i - 1] + 1;
      if (res > 0 && (minres == -1 || res < minres)) {
        minres = res;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << minres << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program preserves the original logic, but reduces memory usage by avoiding unnecessary vector copies, increases readability by removing unused code, and might also slightly improve running time by reducing the number of conditions and comparisons.
