The given code seems to be pretty well optimized in terms of algorithmic complexity. However, few optimizations can be made mostly in terms of code readability, and memory usage.

1. The debug macros are not being used in the code, so we can remove them.

2. In the solve function, instead of creating a new vector `v` to hold `x.second` we can directly use `x.second`.

3. We don't necessarily need to check if `(v[i] - v[i - 1]) > 0`, because `v` stores indices and indices are always non-decreasing.

The optimized version of the code will look like this:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int ll;
#define endl '\n'
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  map<ll, vector<ll>> m;
  rep(i, n) {
    ll val;
    cin >> val;
    m[val].push_back(i + 1);
  }
  ll minres = LLONG_MAX;
  for (auto x : m) {
    if (x.second.size() > 1) {
      for (int i = 1; i < x.second.size(); i++) {
        minres = min(minres, x.second[i] - x.second[i - 1] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  if (minres == LLONG_MAX) {
    cout << -1 << endl;
  } else {
    cout << minres << endl;
  }
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
}
```

These changes will not drastically improve the performance of the program but will make it look cleaner and more efficient in terms of memory usage.
