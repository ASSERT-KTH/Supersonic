The given C++ program is a brute force solution for finding three numbers i, j, and z such that 3*i + 5*j + 7*z equals a given number n. The code uses nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of i and j, then calculates z based on n, i, and j, checks if the equation holds, and finally prints out the values. 

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Calculating 'p' and 'z' inside the inner loop is unnecessary as 'p' only depends on 'i' and 'j', and 'z' depends on 'p'. So, these can be calculated outside the inner loop.
2. The variable 'flag' is used to break out of both loops when a solution is found. Instead, we can use a function to return from it as soon as we find the solution, which would directly exit from both loops.
3. The variables a, b, and c are declared but not used anywhere in the program. So, we can remove them.
4. The variables i, j, and k are declared outside the solve function, but they are not used outside it. So, we can move them inside the function.

Now, let's rewrite the code considering these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define endl "\n"
#define MOD 1000000007
using namespace std;

bool solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  for (ll i = 0; i <= 335; i++) {
    ll p = 3 * i;
    for (ll j = 0; j <= 210; j++) {
      p += 5 * j;
      ll z = (n - p) / 7;
      if (p + z * 7 == n && z >= 0) {
        cout << i << " " << j << " " << z << endl;
        return true;
      }
      p -= 5 * j;
    }
  }
  return false;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int tests = 1;
  cin >> tests;
  while (tests--) {
    if (!solve()) {
      cout << -1 << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: This solution assumes that you are okay with changing the function signature of 'solve'. If not, you might need to keep the 'flag' variable but move it inside the 'solve' function.
