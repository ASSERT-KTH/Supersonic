This is a C++ program where the main optimization can be achieved by reducing the number of iterations in the nested loop. The optimization can be done by using a mathematical approach.

Currently, the program is checking for every possible combination of i and j, which leads to a large number of iterations. However, we can optimize this by calculating the maximum possible value of i (let's call it i_max) for a given n, and then iterating i from i_max to 0. For each i, we calculate j and k, and check if they satisfy the conditions. If they do, we can break the loop early.

Here's the step by step explanation:

1. Calculate the maximum possible value of i by using the formula i_max = n/3.

2. Iterate i from i_max to 0. For each i, calculate j and k as follows:

   - Calculate p = 3 * i.
   
   - Calculate j by using the formula j = (n - p) / 5. If j is not an integer, decrement i and continue to the next iteration.
   
   - Calculate z = n - p - 5*j. If z is negative, decrement i and continue to the next iteration.
   
   - Calculate k by using the formula k = z / 7. If k is not an integer, decrement i and continue to the next iteration.
   
3. If all conditions are satisfied, output i, j, and k, and break the loop.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define endl "\n"
#define MOD 1000000007
using namespace std;
void solve() {
  ll n, i, j, k;
  cin >> n;
  ll a, b, c;
  bool flag = false;
  ll i_max = n / 3;
  for (i = i_max; i >= 0; i--) {
    ll p = 3 * i;
    if ((n - p) % 5 != 0) continue;
    ll j = (n - p) / 5;
    ll z = n - p - 5*j;
    if (z < 0) continue;
    if (z % 7 != 0) continue;
    ll k = z / 7;
    cout << i << " " << j << " " << k << endl;
    flag = true;
    break;
  }
  if (flag == false)
    cout << -1 << endl;
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int tests = 1;
  cin >> tests;
  while (tests--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

This approach significantly reduces the number of iterations, leading to faster execution time and lower memory usage.
