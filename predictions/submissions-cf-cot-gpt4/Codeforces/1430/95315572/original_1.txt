The given program is a brute-force search solution for a problem, which tries all possibilities until it finds the solution. Though it is hard to optimize this kind of program significantly without changing the algorithm, there are a few minor improvements that can be made:

1. Declare variables `p` and `z` inside the inner loop. This reduces the scope of these variables and makes it easier for the compiler to optimize their usage, which could potentially reduce memory use.
2. Combine the calculation of `p` and `z` into a single line. This will reduce the number of operations, which could potentially improve the performance.
3. Remove the unused variable `k`.
4. Remove the unused variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.
5. Use the `return` statement instead of `break` to exit from the function once the solution is found. This could potentially improve performance because it eliminates the need to check the value of the flag after every iteration.

Now, here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define endl "\n"
#define MOD 1000000007
using namespace std;
void solve() {
  ll n, i, j;
  cin >> n;
  bool flag = false;
  for (i = 0; i <= 335; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j <= 210; j++) {
      ll p = 3 * i + 5 * j;
      ll z = (n - p) / 7;
      if (p + z * 7 == n && z >= 0) {
        cout << i << " " << j << " " << z << endl;
        return;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << -1 << endl;
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int tests = 1;
  cin >> tests;
  while (tests--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these improvements are trivial and may not result in a noticeable improvement in performance or memory use. A significant improvement would require a change in the algorithm, which is not allowed as per the question's requirements.
