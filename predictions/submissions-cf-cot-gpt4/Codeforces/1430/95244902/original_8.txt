1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is generally not recommended for real-world programs as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, thus increasing compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary headers.

2. `using namespace std;` is also not recommended in large programs, because it can lead to name conflicts when the program grows.

3. The `speed()` macro is a good practice for competitive programming, but consider using more descriptive names for macros.

4. The program uses a lot of macros, which can lead to code that is hard to understand and debug. It's better to use these constructs directly in the code.

5. The `typedef` definitions are a matter of style, but they can sometimes make the code harder to understand. It's better to use the original types directly in the code.

6. The `power` function is not used in the program, so it can be removed.

7. The `print` function is not used in the program, so it can be removed.

8. The `gcd` and `lcm` functions are not used in the program, so they can be removed.

9. The `dx` and `dy` arrays are not used in the program, so they can be removed.

10. The `const ll mx`, `MOD` and `INF` are not used in the program, so they can be removed.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <utility>
#include <climits>

#define rep(i, a) for (long long int i = 0; i < a; i++)
#define file() freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin); freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);

typedef long long int ll;
typedef std::vector<ll> vi;
typedef std::map<ll, ll> mi;
typedef std::pair<ll, ll> pll;
typedef std::vector<pll> vll;
typedef std::set<ll> st;
typedef std::set<char> sc;

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);

  ll t, a, i, x, y, o;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    std::cin >> a;
    o = 1;
    std::cout << 2 << std::endl;
    x = (a + (a - 1) + 1) / 2;
    std::cout << a << " " << a - 1 << std::endl;
    for (i = a - 2; i >= 1; i--) {
      std::cout << x << " " << i << std::endl;
      x = (x + i + 1) / 2;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program should run faster and use less memory than the original one.
