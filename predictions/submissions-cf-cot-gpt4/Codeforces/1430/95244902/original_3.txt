Step 1: Avoid using #include <bits/stdc++.h> because this includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which increases compilation time. Instead, include only the libraries that are necessary.

Step 2: The #define speed() and #define file() are not being used in this code. So, we can remove them. This will reduce the code size and improve readability.

Step 3: Remove unused typedefs. They are not necessary and just cluttering the code. In this case, we can remove `vi`, `mi`, `pll`, `vll`, `st`, `sc`.

Step 4: We should also avoid using global variables if they are not necessary (like `dx[]`, `dy[]`, `mx`, `MOD`, `INF`). In this case, they are not used so we can remove them.

Step 5: Template functions are not used in this code. We can remove `power`, `print`, `gcd`, `lcm`.

Step 6: The variable `y` is not used in the code. We can remove it for better readability.

Step 7: Try to use more descriptive variable names. It will improve the readability of your code.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

typedef long long int ll;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  ll t, a, i, x, o;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> a;
    o = 1;
    cout << 2 << endl;
    x = (a + (a - 1) + 1) / 2;
    cout << a << " " << a - 1 << endl;
    for (i = a - 2; i >= 1; i--) {
      cout << x << " " << i << endl;
      x = (x + i + 1) / 2;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the real world optimization process might involve more steps and a deep understanding of the program's logic. This is just a basic optimization based on the given simple program.
