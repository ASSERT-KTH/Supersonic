There are several ways to optimize this program. Here are some suggestions:

1. Remove unnecessary macros: Macros make code harder to debug and maintain. Macros such as `speed()`, `file()`, `rep()`, `rep1()`, `trace()`, `mem()`, `sl()`, `pb()`, `pf()`, `mp()`, `F()`, `S()`, `pi()`, `en` are not used in the code and should be removed. The `all()` and `rall()` macros are also not needed and can be replaced with `v.begin(), v.end()` and `v.rbegin(), v.rend()` respectively.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This is generally considered bad practice as it can lead to name conflicts.

3. Use more descriptive variable names: Variable names like `t`, `a`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `o` are not very descriptive and can make the code harder to understand and debug.

4. Remove unused type definitions: The type definitions `vi`, `mi`, `vll`, `st`, `sc` are not used in the code and should be removed.

5. Remove unused functions: The functions `power()`, `print()`, `gcd()`, `lcm()` are not used in the code and should be removed.

6. Remove unused constants: The constants `dx`, `dy`, `mx`, `MOD`, `INF` are not used in the code and should be removed.

7. Replace `typedef` with `using`: In modern C++, `using` is generally preferred over `typedef` for defining type aliases.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

using ll = long long int;
using pll = std::pair<ll, ll>;

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(0);

  ll testCases, number, iterator, midValue;

  std::cin >> testCases;

  while (testCases--) {
    std::cin >> number;
    std::cout << 2 << std::endl;
    midValue = (number + (number - 1) + 1) / 2;
    std::cout << number << " " << number - 1 << std::endl;
    for (iterator = number - 2; iterator >= 1; iterator--) {
      std::cout << midValue << " " << iterator << std::endl;
      midValue = (midValue + iterator + 1) / 2;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This code performs the same functionality as the original one but is more optimized, more readable and easier to maintain.
