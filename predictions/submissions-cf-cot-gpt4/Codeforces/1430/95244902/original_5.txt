The code you provided is relatively optimized but still, there are few things which can be optimized in this code.

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of files, which your program may not even need. This increases the compilation time of the program. Instead, include only those header files which you are actually using.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std`: This can potentially lead to name clashes, which can be hard to debug.

3. Minimize the use of macros: The use of macros makes the code hard to debug. For example, the macros "rep", "rep1", "sl", "pb", "pf", "mp", "F", "S", "pi", "en", can be replaced with their actual expressions. This makes the code more readable and easier to debug.

4. Use const or constexpr for constants: The constants "mx", "MOD", "INF" can be declared as const or constexpr. This makes sure that their values cannot be accidentally modified.

5. Avoid using global variables: Global variables make the program harder to understand and debug. It is better to pass these variables as function arguments.

6. Avoid using long long int when int is enough: Using long long int consumes more memory than int. If the number can fit into an int, prefer using int.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

typedef long long int ll;
typedef std::vector<ll> vi;

ll power(ll a, ll b) {
  const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;
  a %= MOD;
  if (!a)
    return 0;
  ll p = 1;
  while (b > 0) {
    if (b & 1) {
      p *= a;
      p %= MOD;
    }
    a *= a;
    a %= MOD;
    b = b >> 1;
  }
  return p;
}

void print(vi &v) {
  for (ll u : v) {
    std::cout << u << " ";
  }
  std::cout << "\n";
}

ll gcd(ll a, ll b) { return (b != 0 ? gcd(b, a % b) : a); }

ll lcm(ll a, ll b) { return (a / gcd(a, b) * b); }

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  ll t, a, i, x, y, o;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    std::cin >> a;
    o = 1;
    std::cout << 2 << "\n";
    x = (a + (a - 1) + 1) / 2;
    std::cout << a << " " << a - 1 << "\n";
    for (i = a - 2; i >= 1; i--) {
      std::cout << x << " " << i << "\n";
      x = (x + i + 1) / 2;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: I made the assumption that the global variables `dx[]`, `dy[]` and the template function `print()` are not being used elsewhere in the code as they were not used in the provided code snippet. If they are being used elsewhere, they should not be removed.
