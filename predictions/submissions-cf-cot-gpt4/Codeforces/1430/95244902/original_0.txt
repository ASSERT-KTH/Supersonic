Step 1: Remove unnecessary #defines and typedefs
The program has a lot of #define and typedef statements that are not used in the program. Removing these will make the code cleaner and easier to read. This will also slightly reduce the memory usage of the program.

Step 2: Use fast I/O
The program already uses fast input/output operations (ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);) which is good for optimizing the running time of the program.

Step 3: Avoid using global variables
This program does not use any global variables, which is good for memory usage. 

Step 4: Optimize the loop
The loop in the program can be optimized by reducing the number of operations inside it. In this case, the operation of calculating 'x' can be moved outside the loop and updated inside the loop, thus reducing the number of operations.

Step 5: Use '\n' instead of endl
It is faster to use '\n' instead of endl for printing newlines because endl causes a flush operation, which can be slow.

Here is the modified program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

typedef long long int ll;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);                                                    
  cin.tie(0); 

  ll t, a, i, x;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> a;
    cout << 2 << '\n';
    x = (a + (a - 1) + 1) / 2;
    cout << a << " " << a - 1 << '\n';
    for (i = a - 2; i >= 1; i--) {
      cout << x << " " << i << '\n';
      x = (x + i + 1) / 2;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program is cleaner, uses less memory, and is faster than the original program.
