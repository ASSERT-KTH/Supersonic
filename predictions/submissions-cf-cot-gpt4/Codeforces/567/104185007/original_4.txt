The given C++ program counts the number of triplets in an array such that the product of numbers at index i, j, and k is equal to arr[i] * arr[j] / arr[k] = k where j > i > k. It uses three map containers (two for prefix and suffix frequency and one for the current element) which increases the space complexity. There's also unnecessary usage of macros and other data structures that aren't being used, making the program look cluttered and difficult to understand.

Optimizations:

1. Avoid the use of #define for defining constants, and instead use the const keyword. This will help in type checking and debugging.
2. The array 'arr' can be replaced with a vector. It has the advantage of being dynamically resizable and provides the functionality of automatic memory management.
3. The maps 'pre' and 'suf' can be replaced with unordered_map. Unordered_map performs operations in O(1) time on average as compared to map which performs operations in O(logn) time.
4. Remove the unnecessary macros and data structures which are not being used in the code.
5. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of <bits/stdc++.h> and <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp> which are heavy libraries and can slow down the compilation time.

Here is the optimized version of the given code.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);                                                
  cin.tie(0);                                                                  
  cout.tie(0);

  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }
  unordered_map<int, int> pre, suf;
  pre[arr[0]]++;
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 2; i--) {
    suf[arr[i]]++;
  }
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if (arr[i] % k == 0 && pre[arr[i] / k] > 0 && suf[arr[i] * k] > 0) {
      ans += pre[arr[i] / k] * suf[arr[i] * k];
    }
    pre[arr[i]]++;
    suf[arr[i + 1]]--;
  }
  cout << ans << "\n";
}
```
This optimized version of the program is cleaner, easier to understand, and more efficient in terms of space and time complexity.
