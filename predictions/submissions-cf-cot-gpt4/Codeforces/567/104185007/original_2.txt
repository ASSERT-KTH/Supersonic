The given C/C++ program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Removing unused includes: The program includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes almost all standard library header files. This is not recommended because it can slow down the compilation process. The program should only include the necessary header files.

2. Changing the way the input array is declared: The program declares an array `arr[n]` where `n` is a variable. In C++, the size of an array must be a constant expression. This code can lead to undefined behavior. The recommended way to declare an array with variable size is to use `std::vector`.

3. Reducing the number of operations: The program calculates `pre[arr[i] / k]` and `suf[arr[i] * k]` twice in the same loop. It's better to calculate these values once, save them into variables, and then use these variables.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

#define int long long

int32_t main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }
  map<int, int> pre, suf;
  pre[arr[0]]++;
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 2; i--) {
    suf[arr[i]]++;
  }
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if (arr[i] % k == 0) {
      int pre_val = pre[arr[i] / k];
      int suf_val = suf[arr[i] * k];
      if (pre_val > 0 && suf_val > 0) {
        ans += pre_val * suf_val;
      }
    }
    pre[arr[i]]++;
    suf[arr[i + 1]]--;
  }
  cout << ans << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program has the same functionality as the original one but with improved compilation speed and more efficient memory usage.
