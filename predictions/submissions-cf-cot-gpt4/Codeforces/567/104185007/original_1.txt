The original code has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) due to the usage of the unordered map for 'pre' and 'suf'. One optimization could be to avoid using unordered maps and use a vector to store the frequency of numbers instead. This would reduce memory usage and further optimize the code. However, this can only be applied if the range of the input numbers is known and is not too large.

Also, 'mod' and 'inf' defined at the top are not used, so you can remove them.

The 'io' macro is used to speed up the I/O operations. It is a common practice in competitive programming to decrease the time of I/O operations to avoid TLE(Time Limit Exceeded).

One more thing, I see that you are using an mt19937 random number generator and a 'pbds' type which is a policy-based data structure. However, these are not used in the program, so we can remove them to clean up the code.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define ff first
#define ss second
#define int long long
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
#define mt make_tuple
#define pii pair<int, int>
#define vi vector<int>
#define mii map<int, int>
#define pqb priority_queue<int>
#define pqs priority_queue<int, vi, greater<int>>
#define setbits(x) __builtin_popcountll(x)
#define ps(x, y) fixed << setprecision(y) << x
#define mk(arr, n, type) type *arr = new type[n];
#define test int t; cin >> t; while (t--)
#define io ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0)

int32_t main() {
  io;
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  int arr[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }
  mii pre, suf;
  pre[arr[0]]++;
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 2; i--) {
    suf[arr[i]]++;
  }
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if (arr[i] % k == 0 && pre[arr[i] / k] > 0 && suf[arr[i] * k] > 0) {
      ans += pre[arr[i] / k] * suf[arr[i] * k];
    }
    pre[arr[i]]++;
    suf[arr[i + 1]]--;
  }
  cout << ans << "\n";
}
```

Remember, C++ STL's map and unordered_map use a significant amount of memory due to their underlying data structures. In competitive programming problems, where the constraints are very large, using these data structures can lead to Memory Limit Exceeded errors. In such cases, one must think of other data structures or algorithms to solve the problem.
