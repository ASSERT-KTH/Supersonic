The given C++ program can be optimized by removing unnecessary macro definitions, using an array instead of a map for pre and suf, and reducing the number of map operations.

Here are the steps to do it:

1. Remove unnecessary macro definitions: Macros like `ff`, `ss`, `pb`, `mp`, `mt`, `pii`, `vi`, `mii`, `umii`, `pqb`, `pqs`, `setbits`, `mod`, `inf`, `ps`, `mk`, `test`, `io` and `pbds` are not used in the program, so we can remove them.

2. Use an array instead of map for pre and suf: The `pre` and `suf` maps are used to count the occurrences of elements in the array. However, if the range of the elements is known and not too large, we can use an array instead of a map to do the counting, which is faster and uses less memory.

3. Reduce the number of map/array operations: In the for loop, we perform multiple operations on the `pre` and `suf` maps/arrays for the same key. We can reduce the number of operations by storing the results in variables. 

Now, let's implement these changes in the code.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define int long long

int32_t main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;

  int arr[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }

  int pre[n] = {0}, suf[n] = {0};
  pre[arr[0]]++;
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 2; i--) {
    suf[arr[i]]++;
  }

  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if (arr[i] % k == 0) {
      int pre_val = pre[arr[i] / k];
      int suf_val = suf[arr[i] * k];
      if (pre_val > 0 && suf_val > 0) {
        ans += pre_val * suf_val;
      }
    }
    pre[arr[i]]++;
    suf[arr[i + 1]]--;
  }

  cout << ans << "\n";
}
```

Please note that this optimization assumes that the range of the array elements is not too large. If the range can be very large, using an array instead of a map could cause an out-of-memory error. In that case, we should stick with the map but still apply the other optimizations.
