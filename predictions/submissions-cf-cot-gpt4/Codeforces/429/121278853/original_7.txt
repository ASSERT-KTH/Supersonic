This code is already quite optimized and uses efficient algorithms and data structures. It also uses bitwise operations which are inherently fast. However, there are a few minor improvements that can be made:

1. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h` because this header file includes much more than is usually needed, which can lead to longer compile times. Instead, only include the specific header files that you need.

2. Avoid `#define` for constants. Instead use `const`. This provides type safety and better debugging information.

3. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` only if you are mixing cin/cout and scanf/printf in your code. Using this can actually make your code slower if you are not mixing these IO functions.

4. Use `reserve` before pushing elements into a vector to avoid reallocations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long int ll;
typedef vector<ll> vll;

const ll mod = int(1e9 + 7);

ll mul(ll a, ll b) { return ((a % mod) * (b % mod)) % mod; }
ll add(ll a, ll b) { return ((a % mod) + (b % mod)) % mod; }
ll sub(ll a, ll b) {
  ll ans = ((a % mod) - (b % mod)) % mod;
  ans %= mod;
  ans = (ans + mod) % mod;
  return ans;
}

ll n, init[100100], goal[100100], ans;
vector<ll> g[100100];
vll res;

void dfs(ll node, ll par, ll pre, ll ppre) {
  if (ppre) {
    init[node] ^= 1;
  }
  if (init[node] != goal[node]) {
    ans++;
    res.push_back(node);
    ppre ^= 1;
  }
  for (auto v : g[node]) {
    if (v == par)
      continue;
    dfs(v, node, ppre, pre);
  }
}

void solve() {
  cin >> n;
  res.reserve(n);
  for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++) {
    ll a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    g[a].push_back(b);
    g[b].push_back(a);
  }
  for(int i=0;i<n;i++) { cin >> init[i + 1]; }
  for(int i=0;i<n;i++) { cin >> goal[i + 1]; }
  dfs(1, 0, 0, 0);
  cout << ans << '\n';
  for (auto v : res) {
    cout << v << '\n';
  }
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
Remember, the main goal of optimization should be to make the code more efficient without compromising its readability and maintainability. Complete rewrites are often not necessary and can make the code harder to understand and debug.
