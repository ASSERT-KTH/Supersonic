Optimization Steps:
1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: including this header file includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increases compilation time and binary size. Instead, only include the specific libraries which are used in the code.
2. Reduce the number of macros and typedefs: macros and typedefs can make code more readable and easy to write, but too many can make it confusing, and they can slightly increase compilation time. Only use them when necessary.
3. Eliminate global variables: global variables can lead to confusing code and can increase memory usage. They should be avoided when possible.
4. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(nullptr);` and `std::cout.tie(nullptr);`: these lines can speed up cin and cout, but they can also cause problems when mixing cin/cout with scanf/printf. If you're only using cin/cout, then these lines can be beneficial.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

typedef long long int ll;
typedef vector<ll> vll;
typedef vector<vll> vvll;

void dfs(ll node, ll par, ll pre, ll ppre, ll& ans, vll& res, vvll& g, vll& init, vll& goal) {
  if (ppre) {
    init[node] ^= 1;
  }
  if (init[node] != goal[node]) {
    ans++;
    res.push_back(node);
    ppre ^= 1;
  }
  for (auto v : g[node]) {
    if (v == par)
      continue;
    dfs(v, node, ppre, pre, ans, res, g, init, goal);
  }
}

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vvll g(n + 1);
  for(ll i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    ll a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    g[a].push_back(b);
    g[b].push_back(a);
  }
  vll init(n + 1), goal(n + 1);
  for(ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) { cin >> init[i]; }
  for(ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) { cin >> goal[i]; }
  ll ans = 0;
  vll res;
  dfs(1, 0, 0, 0, ans, res, g, init, goal);
  cout << ans << '\n';
  for (auto v : res) {
    cout << v << '\n';
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);
  solve();
}
```

In this optimized program, all the optimizations are applied. Also, it's better to pass the variables by reference to the function `dfs` instead of using them as global, to avoid side effects and make the function easier to understand and test.
