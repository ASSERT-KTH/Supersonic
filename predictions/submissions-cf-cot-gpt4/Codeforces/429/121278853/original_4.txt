The provided code is already quite optimized in terms of algorithms used, but there are several small changes that could potentially improve the performance:

1. The use of `bits/stdc++.h` is generally discouraged because it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which increases the compilation time. You should include only the necessary headers. 

2. `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);` these lines are used to make the I/O operations faster, but in this program, there's no heavy I/O operations. So, we can remove these lines.

3. `#define` macros are used for constants, but here it's used for loops and other things which can make the program hard to read and debug. Instead of using `#define fr(l, h)`, `#define rep(i, a, b)`, `#define repo(i, b)`, `#define repb(i, a, b)` and `#define repbo(i, b)`, we can directly use the for loop in the required places.

4. `ll mul(ll a, ll b)`, `ll add(ll a, ll b)` and `ll sub(ll a, ll b)` functions are not used in the program, so we can remove these functions.

5. The `mpow(ll a, ll b)` function is not used in the program, so we can remove it.

6. The `solve()` function is only called once, so the content of this function can be put into the `main()` function.

7. We can replace `typedef` with `using` for better readability.

8. The `res` vector is only used to store nodes where `init` and `goal` differ. We can directly print them in the `dfs` function to reduce memory usage.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long int;
using vll = vector<ll>;
using vvll = vector<vll>;

#define MOD int(1e9 + 7)
#define mod int(1e9 + 7)

vll g[100100];
ll init[100100], goal[100100], ans;

void dfs(ll node, ll par, ll pre, ll ppre) {
    if (ppre) {
        init[node] ^= 1;
    }
    if (init[node] != goal[node]) {
        ans++;
        cout << node << endl;
        ppre ^= 1;
    }
    for (auto v : g[node]) {
        if (v == par)
            continue;
        dfs(v, node, ppre, pre);
    }
}

int main() {
    ll n;

    cin >> n;

    for (ll i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        ll a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;
        g[a].push_back(b);
        g[b].push_back(a);
    }

    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> init[i + 1];
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> goal[i + 1];

    dfs(1, 0, 0, 0);

    cout << ans << endl;
}
