The given C/C++ program seems to be well structured and uses a lot of macros which can increase readability and maintainability of the code. However, there are some places we can optimize this code for better performance.

1. **Unnecessary use of macros:** There are many macros defined which are not used in the code at all, such as `fr(l, h), rep(i, a, b), repo(i, b), repb(i, a, b), repbo(i, b), pr(l, h, arr), MP, csort(a, compare), vi, vll, vvll, pi, pll, vpi, vpll, vs, MAX, MOD, mod, INF, MINF, IL, MIL, PI, mem(a, n), gcd(a, b), lcm(a, b), sz(x), pb, ff, ss`. Removing these macros will make the code cleaner and more memory efficient.

2. **Memory usage in DFS:** In the Depth-First Search (DFS), there is a use of `vector<ll> g[100100]`. This can consume quite a lot of memory, especially when the number `n` is not close to `100100`. It would be more memory efficient to allocate the memory dynamically according to the input `n`.

3. **Unused function:** There are several functions defined which are not used in the code like `mul, add, sub, mpow`. Removing these functions will make the code cleaner and more memory efficient.

4. **Use of auto in for loop:** In the `dfs` and `solve` function there are for loops where the keyword `auto` is used. This can lead to unnecessary type conversions and slow down the code. It's better to specify the type explicitly.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define fast ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0)
#define endl '\n'
typedef long long int ll;
typedef vector<ll> vll;
#define pb push_back

ll n, init[100100], goal[100100], ans;
vll *g;
vll res;

void dfs(ll node, ll par, ll pre, ll ppre) {
  if (ppre) {
    init[node] ^= 1;
  }
  if (init[node] != goal[node]) {
    ans++;
    res.pb(node);
    ppre ^= 1;
  }
  for (ll v : g[node]) {
    if (v == par)
      continue;
    dfs(v, node, ppre, pre);
  }
}

void solve() {
  cin >> n;
  g = new vll[n+1];
  for(ll i=0; i<n-1; i++) {
    ll a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    g[a].pb(b);
    g[b].pb(a);
  }
  for(ll i=0; i<n; i++) { cin >> init[i + 1]; }
  for(ll i=0; i<n; i++) { cin >> goal[i + 1]; }
  dfs(1, 0, 0, 0);
  cout << ans << endl;
  for (ll v : res) {
    cout << v << endl;
  }
  delete[] g;
}

signed main() {
  fast;
  solve();
}
```

This optimized code is cleaner and more memory efficient. It also avoids unnecessary type conversions with `auto` keyword. The DFS function now uses dynamically allocated memory which can be a big boost in memory efficiency.
