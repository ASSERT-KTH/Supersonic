The provided C++ program is already quite well optimized, but there are still a few things that can be done to improve its efficiency.

1. Reserve memory for vector: In the function `test_case()`, we use a vector `a` and we know its size `n` before the vector is filled. We can use `reserve(n)` to pre-allocate memory for the vector, which can improve performance by reducing the number of memory reallocations when the vector grows.

2. Avoid unnecessary calculations: In the `solve()` function, we calculate `d = a[i] - a[i - 1]` and subtract `d` from `a[j]` for all `j >= i`. This operation can be expensive and we can avoid it by directly comparing `a[j]` and `a[i - 1]` and updating `a[j]` to `a[i]` if `a[j]` is larger.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

template <typename T>
std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &input, std::vector<T> &v) {
  for (T &a : v)
    input >> a;
  return input;
}

void answer(bool v) {
  constexpr const char *s[2] = {"NO", "YES"};
  std::cout << s[v] << '\n';
}

void solve(std::vector<unsigned> &a) {
  const size_t n = a.size();
  for (size_t i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    if (a[i - 1] < a[i]) {
      for (size_t j = i; j < n; ++j) {
        if (a[j] < a[i - 1])
          return answer(false);
        if(a[j] > a[i])
            a[j] = a[i];
      }
    }
  }
  answer(true);
}

void test_case() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<unsigned> a;
  a.reserve(n);
  std::cin >> a;
  solve(a);
}

int main() {
  size_t t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0)
    test_case();
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations might not significantly improve the performance of this program due to the nature of the logic implemented. Therefore, the impact on running time and memory usage might be minimal.
