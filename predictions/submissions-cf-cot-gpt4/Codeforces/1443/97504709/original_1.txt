The given C++ program can be optimized in terms of running time. The major bottleneck in this program is the nested loop in the `solve` function. For each element in the array, it checks the remaining elements in the array and subtracts `d` (the difference between the current element and the previous one) from them if they are greater than `d`. This leads to quadratic time complexity.

The optimized solution will take a linear pass over the array. The idea is to keep track of the minimum element seen so far while traversing from right to left. If at any point, the difference between the current element and the minimum element seen so far is less than the previous element, we return false. Otherwise, we return true at the end.

Optimization Steps:
1. Initialize minElement with the last element of the array.
2. Traverse the array from the second last element to the first one. For each element:
   - Compute the difference between the current element and the previous one (if exists).
   - Update minElement with the smaller value between minElement and the current element.
   - If the difference is less than minElement, return false.
3. If the loop completes, return true.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

template <typename T>
std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &input, std::vector<T> &v) {
  for (T &a : v)
    input >> a;
  return input;
}

void answer(bool v) {
  constexpr const char *s[2] = {"NO", "YES"};
  std::cout << s[v] << '\n';
}

void solve(std::vector<unsigned> &a) {
  const size_t n = a.size();
  unsigned minElement = a[n - 1];
  for (size_t i = n - 1; i > 0; --i) {
    if (a[i - 1] > a[i]) {
      if (a[i - 1] - a[i] > minElement) {
        return answer(false);
      }
    }
    minElement = std::min(minElement, a[i - 1]);
  }
  answer(true);
}

void test_case() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<unsigned> a(n);
  std::cin >> a;
  solve(a);
}

int main() {
  size_t t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0)
    test_case();
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version of the program works in O(n), which is a considerable improvement over the original version's O(n^2) time complexity.
