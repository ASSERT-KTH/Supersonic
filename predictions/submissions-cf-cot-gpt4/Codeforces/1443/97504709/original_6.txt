Step-by-step optimization:

1. There is a nested for loop in the solve function. We are iterating over the vector 'a' from the index 'i' every time we find that a[i-1] < a[i]. This operation can be optimized by only iterating once through the vector. We can maintain a variable to keep track of the minimum number encountered so far and another variable to keep track of the difference encountered so far. This difference should be less than or equal to the minimum number encountered so far. 

2. In the answer function, we are using the array s[] to print "YES" or "NO". While this approach is fine, we can simplify it to a ternary operator that directly prints "YES" or "NO" depending on the value of v. This reduces the memory usage slightly.

Below is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

template <typename T>
std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &input, std::vector<T> &v) {
  for (T &a : v)
    input >> a;
  return input;
}

void answer(bool v) {
  std::cout << (v ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
}

void solve(std::vector<unsigned> &a) {
  unsigned min_val = a[0], diff = 0;
  for (size_t i = 1; i < a.size(); ++i) {
    if (a[i] < min_val) {
      min_val = a[i];
    }
    if (a[i] > a[i - 1]) {
      diff = a[i] - a[i - 1];
      if (diff > min_val) {
        return answer(false);
      }
    }
    a[i] -= diff;
  }
  answer(true);
}

void test_case() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<unsigned> a(n);
  std::cin >> a;
  solve(a);
}

int main() {
  size_t t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0)
    test_case();
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version of the program behaves similarly to the original version, but with improved running time due to the elimination of the nested loop in the solve function. It also uses less memory by avoiding the creation of the array s[] in the answer function.
