In the given code, we can see a couple of potential opportunities for optimization:

1. **Avoiding unnecessary calculations**: In the nested loop, there's a subtraction operation that's performed on each element of the vector. This could be optimized by calculating the difference only once and then subtracting it from the current and future elements.

2. **Avoiding unnecessary function calls**: The `answer` function is called many times, which could increase the running time. We can avoid this by using a boolean flag to store the result and call the function only once at the end of the `solve` function.

3. **Reserve memory for vector**: When we know the size of the vector beforehand, it is a good practice to reserve the memory in advance. This can potentially speed up the push_back operation as it does not have to constantly reallocate memory.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

template <typename T>
std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &input, std::vector<T> &v) {
  for (T &a : v)
    input >> a;
  return input;
}

void answer(bool v) {
  constexpr const char *s[2] = {"NO", "YES"};
  std::cout << s[v] << '\n';
}

void solve(std::vector<unsigned> &a) {
  const size_t n = a.size();
  bool is_valid = true;
  for (size_t i = 1; i < n && is_valid; ++i) {
    if (a[i - 1] < a[i]) {
      const unsigned d = a[i] - a[i - 1];
      for (size_t j = i; j < n; ++j) {
        if (a[j] < d){
          is_valid = false;
          break;
        }
        a[j] -= d;
      }
    }
  }
  answer(is_valid);
}

void test_case() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<unsigned> a;
  a.reserve(n);
  std::cin >> a;
  solve(a);
}

int main() {
  size_t t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0)
    test_case();
  return 0;
}
```
In this version, the `solve` function only calls `answer` once, and the vector `a` reserves memory before receiving input. This should result in an improvement in both running time and memory usage.
