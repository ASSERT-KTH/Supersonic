Optimization Steps:
1. Reserve space in vector: The vector `a` is going to have `n` elements, which we know in advance. By calling `reserve(n)` before adding elements to the vector, we can prevent multiple reallocations of the vector's internal array, which could be costly in terms of time.

2. Avoid calculating the same value over and over: In the nested loop, we calculate `d = a[i] - a[i - 1]` and within the same loop, we check `if (a[j] < d)` for different values of `j`. The value of `d` doesn't change within a given iteration of the outer loop, so we calculate `d` once outside the inner loop and reuse the value.

3. Eliminate unnecessary subtraction operation: Once we've checked `if (a[j] < d)`, there's no need to subtract `d` from `a[j]` if `a[j] >= d`. So, we only do the subtraction when it's necessary.

4. Exit early when possible: In the nested loop, as soon as we find a `j` where `a[j] < d`, we can return from the function. There's no need to continue checking the rest of the array elements.

Here's the optimized code with the above changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

template <typename T>
std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &input, std::vector<T> &v) {
  for (T &a : v)
    input >> a;
  return input;
}

void answer(bool v) {
  constexpr const char *s[2] = {"NO", "YES"};
  std::cout << s[v] << '\n';
}

void solve(std::vector<unsigned> &a) {
  const size_t n = a.size();
  for (size_t i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    if (a[i - 1] < a[i]) {
      const unsigned d = a[i] - a[i - 1];
      for (size_t j = i; j < n; ++j) {
        if (a[j] < d)
          return answer(false);
        else if(a[j] >= d)
          a[j] -= d;
      }
    }
  }
  answer(true);
}

void test_case() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<unsigned> a;
  a.reserve(n);
  std::cin >> a;
  solve(a);
}

int main() {
  size_t t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0)
    test_case();
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code should run faster and use less memory than the original program.
