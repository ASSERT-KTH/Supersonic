The given C++ program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Avoid repeated vector resizing: In the original code, the vector 'a' is resized every time the function 'test_case' is called. This can be avoided by defining the vector 'a' globally and then clearing it before reusing it. This saves memory and reduces the time taken for resizing the vector.
2. Avoid unnecessary calculations in the 'solve' function: In the original code, there is an inner loop in the 'solve' function which subtracts the variable 'd' from every element of the vector 'a' starting from the index 'i'. This can be optimized by keeping track of the minimum element in the vector and subtracting 'd' only from the minimum element. If the resulting value is less than 0, return 'false', else continue with the next iteration.
3. Use fast I/O: Using 'cin' and 'cout' for input and output operations can be slow. Using faster I/O methods such as 'scanf' and 'printf' can reduce the running time of the program.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
std::vector<unsigned> a;
void answer(bool v) {
  constexpr const char *s[2] = {"NO", "YES"};
  printf("%s\n", s[v]);
}
void solve() {
  const size_t n = a.size();
  unsigned min = a[0];
  for (size_t i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    if (a[i - 1] < a[i]) {
      const unsigned d = a[i] - a[i - 1];
      min -= d;
      if (min < 0)
        return answer(false);
    } else {
      min = a[i];
    }
  }
  answer(true);
}
void test_case() {
  size_t n;
  scanf("%lu", &n);
  a.clear();
  a.reserve(n);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    unsigned x;
    scanf("%u", &x);
    a.push_back(x);
  }
  solve();
}
int main() {
  size_t t;
  scanf("%lu", &t);
  while (t-- > 0)
    test_case();
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version, the 'solve' function iterates over the input vector only once, reducing its time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n). The 'test_case' function clears the 'a' vector before reusing it, avoiding unnecessary memory allocations. Furthermore, the use of 'scanf' and 'printf' for I/O operations speeds up the program.
