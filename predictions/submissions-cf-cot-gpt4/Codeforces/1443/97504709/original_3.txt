The given program reads a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a sequence of numbers and checks if each number is greater than or equal to the difference of the next number and the previous number.

This program can be optimized for running time by reducing the number of iterations in the 'solve' function. Currently, the program is using a nested loop, which results in a time complexity of O(n^2). This can be reduced to O(n) by keeping track of the minimum number encountered so far and subtracting it from the current number, rather than subtracting the difference from all subsequent numbers.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
template <typename T>
std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &input, std::vector<T> &v) {
  for (T &a : v)
    input >> a;
  return input;
}
void answer(bool v) {
  constexpr const char *s[2] = {"NO", "YES"};
  std::cout << s[v] << '\n';
}
void solve(std::vector<unsigned> &a) {
  const size_t n = a.size();
  unsigned min_val = a[0];
  for (size_t i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    if (a[i] < min_val)
      return answer(false);
    min_val = std::min(min_val, a[i] - (i > 0 ? a[i - 1] : 0));
  }
  answer(true);
}
void test_case() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<unsigned> a(n);
  std::cin >> a;
  solve(a);
}
int main() {
  size_t t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0)
    test_case();
  return 0;
}
```
This optimization works by eliminating the need for the inner loop in the 'solve' function. Instead, it keeps track of the minimum value encountered so far, and checks if the current number is greater than or equal to the difference between the current number and the minimum value. This reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n), resulting in a significant performance improvement for large inputs.
