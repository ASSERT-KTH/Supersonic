The given program seems to be performing a bunch of operations on a vector of pair<int, int> and a map<int, int>. Here are some optimization steps that we can take to improve the program:

1. **Avoid unnecessary copying of pairs**: In the given program, the pairs are first created with the first value and then updated with the second value. This results in additional computation and memory overhead. Instead, we can create the pair with both values in a single step.

2. **Replace map with unordered_map**: A `std::map` in C++ keeps its elements sorted and this comes at a cost of log(n) insertions. If we don't need the elements to be sorted, `std::unordered_map` can be used for constant time insertions and lookups.

3. **Combine two loops into one**: The program has two separate loops for input reading and processing. These can be combined into a single loop to reduce the number of iterations.

4. **Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);`**: These lines of code can speed up the I/O operations in C++.

Here is the optimized version of your program after applying these steps:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define int long long
using namespace std;
signed main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<pair<int, int>> vec(n);
    unordered_map<int, int> timeSum;
    int total = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int a, b;
      cin >> a >> b;
      vec[i] = {a, b};
      total += b;
    }
    sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
    int ans = total;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      timeSum[vec[i].first] += vec[i].second;
      if (i > 0 && vec[i].first == vec[i - 1].first)
        continue;
      int temp = vec[i].first +
                 max(0LL, (total - timeSum[vec[i].first] - vec[i].first));
      ans = min(ans, temp);
      total -= timeSum[vec[i].first];
    }
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
}
```
Each step aims to reduce the number of operations or the amount of memory used by the program.
