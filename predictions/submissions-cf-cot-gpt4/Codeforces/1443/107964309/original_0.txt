This program reads some test cases (T), and for each test case, it reads a number (n) and creates a vector of pairs of integers of size n. It fills the first elements of each pair and then the second elements. It then sorts the vector and calculates a map with the sum of the second elements grouped by the first element. It calculates a total of all second elements and then calculates a minimum "ans" over some operation involving the first element, the total, and the mapped sum.

Here are some steps to optimize this program:

1. We don't need to initialize the vector with pairs of {a, 0} and then update the pairs to {a, b}. We can directly initialize the pairs with {a, b}.

2. The map "timeSum" can be replaced with a vector of the same size as 'vec'. This will reduce the time complexity from O(logN) to O(1) for each access operation.

3. The total sum of the second elements in 'vec' is calculated twice - once before the loop 'for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)' and then again within the loop in the 'total -= timeSum[vec[i].first]' statement. We can avoid this redundancy by calculating the total sum only once and then updating the total within the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define int long long
using namespace std;
signed main() {
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<pair<int, int>> vec(n);
    vector<int> timeSum(n, 0);
    int total = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> vec[i].first;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> vec[i].second;
      total += vec[i].second;
    }
    sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      timeSum[i] = (i == 0 ? 0 : timeSum[i-1]) + vec[i].second;
    }
    int ans = total;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (i > 0 && vec[i].first == vec[i - 1].first)
        continue;
      int temp = vec[i].first +
                 max(0LL, total - (i == 0 ? 0 : timeSum[i-1]) - vec[i].first);
      ans = min(ans, temp);
      total -= vec[i].second;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
