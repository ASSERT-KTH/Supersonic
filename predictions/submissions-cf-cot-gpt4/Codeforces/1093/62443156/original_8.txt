This is a complex piece of code, but there are still some potential optimizations that could be made. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. Reducing unnecessary includes: The code contains several includes that are not used in the code. Removing unnecessary includes can help to reduce compile time.

2. In the main function, the code is creating a segment tree for every possible subset of the array 'a'. However, only the trees for subsets that are queried are actually needed. We could use a map structure to store the trees instead of a vector, and only create the tree when it is actually queried. This would reduce both memory usage and potentially running time, depending on the query distribution.

3. The code is using a pair of integers to represent the minimum and maximum values in a segment. Instead of using a pair, we could use a struct with two integer fields. This might help the compiler to generate more efficient code.

4. The code is using a template for the seg_tree class. If the seg_tree class is only used with a specific type (pair<int, int> in this case), we could remove the template and directly use this type in the class. This would reduce compile time.

5. The code includes debugging functionality that is not needed for the final version of the program. We could remove this to reduce both running time and memory usage.

Now, let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

struct MinMax {
    int min, max;
};

class SegTree {
public:
    SegTree(int n): n_(n), data_(2 * next_power_of_two(n_) - 1, {1e9, -1e9}) {}
    void update(int pos, const MinMax &val);
    MinMax query(int first, int last) const;
    // ... rest of the functions ...

private:
    int n_;
    vector<MinMax> data_;
    // ... rest of the members ...
};

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<vector<int>> a(n, vector<int>(k));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
            cin >> a[i][j];
        }
    }

    map<int, SegTree> trees;
    int q;
    cin >> q;
    while (q--) {
        int type;
        cin >> type;
        if (type == 1) {
            int i;
            cin >> i;
            --i;
            vector<int> b(k);
            for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
                cin >> b[j];
            }
            for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << k); ++mask) {
                if (trees.find(mask) != trees.end()) {
                    int val = 0;
                    for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
                        if (mask & (1 << j)) {
                            val += b[j];
                        } else {
                            val -= b[j];
                        }
                    }
                    trees[mask].update(i, {val, val});
                }
            }
        } else {
            int l, r;
            cin >> l >> r;
            --l, --r;
            int ans = -1e9;
            for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << k); ++mask) {
                if (trees.find(mask) == trees.end()) {
                    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                        int val = 0;
                        for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
                            if (mask & (1 << j)) {
                                val += a[i][j];
                            } else {
                                val -= a[i][j];
                            }
                        }
                        trees[mask].update(i, {val, val});
                    }
                }
                auto a = trees[mask].query(l, r);
                ans = max(ans, a.max - a.min);
            }
            cout << ans << '\n';
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that this is a rough implementation, and the SegTree class methods have been omitted for brevity. The actual implementation of these methods would be the same as in the original code, with the necessary adjustments to use the MinMax struct instead of the pair<int, int>.
