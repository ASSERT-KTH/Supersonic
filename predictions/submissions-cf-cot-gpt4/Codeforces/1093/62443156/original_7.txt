In this given code, the major optimization can be done by avoiding the recalculation of the same values in a loop. The code also has some unnecessary standard library includes which can be removed to reduce memory usage. Here are the steps for optimization:

1. Remove the unneeded library includes from the top of the code. This will reduce the memory usage of the program.

2. The code is performing bitwise operations in a loop to calculate the value of val from the array a. This calculation is repeated multiple times in the code. This can be optimized by calculating and storing the results in an array in a single loop, and then using the pre-calculated results in the subsequent loops. This is a form of dynamic programming, where the program avoids recalculating the same values, thus saving computation time.

3. The debug macro is not needed in a production environment. It should be removed to make the code cleaner and easier to read.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;

template <typename T, typename JoinFn>
class seg_tree {
// ... keep all the code inside class unchanged ...
};

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);
  std::cout << std::boolalpha;

  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  vector<vector<int>> a(n, vector<int>(k));
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
      cin >> a[i][j];
    }
  }
  auto join = [](const pair<int, int> &a, const pair<int, int> &b) {
    return pair(min(a.first, b.first), max(a.second, b.second));
  };
  auto update = [](pair<int, int> &a, const pair<int, int> &b) { a = b; };
  vector<seg_tree<pair<int, int>, decltype(join)>> trees(
      1 << k, seg_tree<pair<int, int>, decltype(join)>(n, {1e9, -1e9}, join));

  vector<vector<int>> vals(n, vector<int>(1<<k, 0));
  for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << k); ++mask) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
        if (mask & (1 << j)) {
          vals[i][mask] += a[i][j];
        } else {
          vals[i][mask] -= a[i][j];
        }
      }
      trees[mask].update(i, {vals[i][mask], vals[i][mask]}, update);
    }
  }
  
  // ... remaining part of main() function unchanged ...
}
```

All the remaining parts of the main function stay unchanged, because they are already optimized.
