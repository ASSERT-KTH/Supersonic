Here are some optimization steps for the above C/C++ program:

1. Avoid I/O synchronization: Although the "dragonforce()" macro is already used to speed up I/O operations by disabling synchronization of C++ and C I/O operations and untie cin and cout. This is a common optimization for competitive programming.

2. Avoid expensive operations in the loop: It is better to avoid expensive operations in the loop. In this case, the power operation is performed in a loop. Pre-calculating these values and storing them in an array for direct access can improve performance.

3. Use fast input/output methods: Instead of using cin and cout for input/output, using faster methods like scanf and printf can slightly improve the performance.

4. Avoid unnecessary calls to the size() function: In the bfs function, a call to sz(nodes[itr].adj) is made each time in the loop. This value can be stored in a variable before the loop to avoid repeated calls to the size() function.

5. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations: In the addEdge method, the adjacency list and weight list are stored as vectors. If the graph is dense, this can lead to a lot of memory overhead. A more memory-efficient data structure like a linked list or an adjacency matrix could be used instead.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> pi;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef vector<string> vs;

#define pb push_back
#define sz(k) k.size()
#define mod 998244353
#define MAX 20000000

class graphNode {
public:
  vi adj;
  int a;
  graphNode() { a = 0; }
};

class graph {
public:
  int n;
  vector<graphNode> nodes;
  graph(int nodeNumber) {
    n = nodeNumber;
    nodes.resize(n + 1);
  }
  void addEdge(int a, int b) {
    nodes[a].adj.pb(b);
    nodes[b].adj.pb(a);
  }
  ll findans(vi &powr) {
    vector<bool> visited(n + 1, false);
    vi col(n + 1);
    vi grcol(3);
    grcol[1] = 1;
    ll res = 1;
    for (int c = 1; c < n + 1; c++) {
      if (!visited[c]) {
        col[c] = 1;
        if (!bfs(c, col, visited, grcol)) {
          return 0;
        } else {
          res = (res * (powr[grcol[1]] + powr[grcol[2]])) % mod;
        }
        grcol[2] = 0;
        grcol[1] = 1;
      }
    }
    return res;
  }
  bool bfs(int p, vi &col, vector<bool> &visited, vi &grcol) {
    queue<int> q;
    visited[p] = true;
    q.push(p);
    while (!q.empty()) {
      int itr = q.front();
      q.pop();
      int chcol = (col[itr] == 2) ? 1 : 2;
      int adj_size = sz(nodes[itr].adj);
      for (int i = 0; i < adj_size; i++) {
        int k = nodes[itr].adj[i];
        if (col[k] == 0 || col[k] == chcol) {
          if (col[k] == 0) {
            col[k] = chcol;
            grcol[chcol]++;
          }
        } else
          return false;
        if (!visited[k]) {
          visited[k] = true;
          q.push(k);
        }
      }
    }
    return true;
  }
};

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  vector<ll> powr(3 * 100000);
  ll k = 1;
  for (int c = 0; c < 3 * 100000; c++) {
    powr[c] = k;
    k = (k * 2) % mod;
  }
  ll o;
  cin >> o;
  while (o--) {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    graph mygraph(n);
    for (int c = 0; c < m; c++) {
      int a, b;
      cin >> a >> b;
      mygraph.addEdge(a, b);
    }
    cout << mygraph.findans(powr) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimization, the method addEdge was simplified by removing unnecessary parameters and operations. The bfs method was optimized by storing the size of the adjacency list in a variable before the loop. The findans method was simplified by removing unnecessary operations and parameters. The main function was simplified by removing unnecessary macros and operations. The power calculations were pre-calculated and stored in a vector for direct access.
