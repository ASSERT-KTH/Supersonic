There are a few steps that we can take to optimize this program:

1. Avoid unnecessary I/O operations: The existing program reads the entire vector from the input, and then performs calculations on it. Instead, we can read each element, perform the necessary calculations, and then move on to the next one. This reduces the memory footprint and avoids an unnecessary pass over the data.

2. Use `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout`: `cin` and `cout` are generally slower than `scanf` and `printf`. This is because `cin` and `cout` have a lot of overhead due to their type safety features and synchronization with C streams.

3. Use less memory by avoiding storing all data: The existing program stores the entire vector before performing calculations on it. Instead, we can read each element, perform the necessary calculations, and then move on to the next one. This reduces the memory footprint and avoids an unnecessary pass over the data.

Here is an optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define mod 1000000007
#define endl "\n"
void fast(void) __attribute__((constructor));
void fast(void) {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
}
int getN(int n, int x) {
  int cnt = 0LL;
  while (n > 0LL && n % x == 0LL) {
    ++cnt;
    n /= x;
  }
  return cnt;
}
void solve() {
  int n, x;
  scanf("%lld %lld", &n, &x);
  int a, sum = 0, tok;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%lld", &a);
    int b = getN(a, x);
    if (i != 0)
      b = min(b, tok);
    tok = min(tok, b);
    if (i == n - 1) {
      b = min(b, 1 + tok);
      tok = min(tok, b);
    }
    sum += b * a + a;
  }
  printf("%lld", sum);
}
signed main(void) {
  int t;
  scanf("%lld", &t);
  while (t--) {
    solve();
    printf("\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program reduces the memory footprint by not storing the entire vector in memory at once. It also uses `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output. It performs the necessary calculations on each element as it is read, rather than reading all the elements and then performing the calculations.
