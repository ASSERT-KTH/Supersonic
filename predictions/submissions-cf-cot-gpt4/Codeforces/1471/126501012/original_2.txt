This program has a few areas where it can be optimized.

1. Reduce unnecessary `min()` function calls: In the loop where `tok` is calculated, `min()` function is called twice. We can optimize this by calling it only once.
2. Reduce the number of variables: We can use `b[i]` directly instead of storing its value in `tok`. This reduces the need for an extra variable.
3. Avoid extra multiplication: In the calculation of `sum`, `b[i] * a[i]` is calculated. This can be optimized by first calculating `b[i] + 1` and then multiplying it with `a[i]`.
4. Use '\n' instead of `endl`: `endl` causes a flush of the output buffer which makes your program slower. Using '\n' is a better option as it doesn't cause a flush.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define mod 1000000007
#define endl "\n"
void fast(void) __attribute__((constructor));
void fast(void) {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
}
int getN(int n, int x) {
  int cnt = 0LL;
  while (n > 0LL && n % x == 0LL) {
    ++cnt;
    n /= x;
  }
  return cnt;
}
void solve() {
  int n, x;
  cin >> n >> x;
  vector<int> a(n), b(n);
  for (auto &c : a)
    cin >> c;
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    b[i] = getN(a[i], x);
  }
  for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    b[i] = min(b[i], b[i-1]);
  }
  for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
    b[i] = min(b[i], 1 + b[i+1]);
    sum += (b[i] + 1) * a[i];
  }
  cout << sum;
}
signed main(void) {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
    cout << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The `__attribute__((constructor))` fast function and the macro `ONLINE_JUDGE` are typically used in competitive programming, where the former is used to make I/O operations faster and the latter is used to switch between file I/O and standard I/O depending on whether the code is being run on an online judge or a local environment. They might not be needed or even recommended in a normal development setting.
