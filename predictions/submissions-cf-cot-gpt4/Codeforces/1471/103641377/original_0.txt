1. Avoid `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is quite large and includes much more than you probably need, slowing down the compile time. It's better to include only the libraries that you need.

2. Avoid `using namespace std;`: This can lead to name clashes if your code, or any libraries you're using, have the same names as the standard library functions.

3. `#define boost ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL)`: This code isn't being used anywhere and can be removed.

4. `#define int long long`: This can lead to confusion because `int` and `long long` are different types. It's better to use `typedef long long int64;` if you want a shorthand for `long long`.

5. `#define mem(a) memset(a, 0, sizeof(a))`: This macro can lead to mistakes if you use it on non-static arrays. Better remove it and use `memset` directly where needed.

6. `#define debug(x...)`: This macro isn't used anywhere and can be removed.

7. The `sortbysec` and `compBySec` functions are not used anywhere and can be removed.

8. The `__print` functions and `_print` function are not used anywhere and can be removed.

9. Avoid using `unordered_map` if the order of the elements doesn't matter. `unordered_map` uses more memory and can be slower than `map` because of hash collisions. 

10. The `preprocess` function: instead of using a loop to find the smallest divisor, you can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all the smallest prime divisors of numbers up to `N`. This will be faster and use less memory.

Here is the optimized code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <chrono>

using ll = long long;

const int N = 1e6 + 5;
std::vector<ll> dp(N);
void preprocess() {
  dp[0] = dp[1] = 1;
  for (int i = 2; i < N; ++i)
    if (dp[i] == 0)
      for (int j = i; j < N; j += i)
        if (dp[j] == 0)
          dp[j] = i;
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::unordered_map<int, int> mp;
  std::vector<ll> a(n);
  for (ll &x : a) std::cin >> x;
  int ans1 = 1;
  for (int x : a) {
    mp[dp[x]]++;
    ans1 = std::max(ans1, mp[dp[x]]);
  }
  int ans2 = 0;
  for (auto it : mp) {
    if (it.second % 2 == 0 || it.first == 1)
      ans2 += it.second;
  }
  int q;
  std::cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    int w;
    std::cin >> w;
    if (w == 0)
      std::cout << ans1 << "\n";
    else
      std::cout << std::max(ans1, ans2) << "\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  preprocess();
  int t = 1;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  std::chrono::duration<double> diff = end - start;
  std::cout << "\nExecuted in: " << std::fixed << diff.count() << " sec";
  return 0;
}
```
