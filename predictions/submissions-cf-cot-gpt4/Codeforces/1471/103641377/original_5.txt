The main optimization can be done in the preprocess() function where we are calculating the divisors of the numbers. To reduce the execution time, we can use a prime sieve algorithm to calculate the smallest prime divisor of the numbers. This would reduce the time complexity from O(N*sqrt(N)) to O(N*log(log(N))).

The prime sieve is a classic number theory algorithm that generates all the prime numbers up to a given limit. It begins by assuming every integer greater than 1 is prime until proven that it is not. The algorithm iteratively marks the multiples of each prime number starting from 2. This way, we can easily find the smallest prime divisor for each number.

In the 'solve()' function, we can avoid calculating 'mp[dp[a[i]]]' twice in one iteration which can save us a little bit of execution time.

Here is the optimized program with the mentioned optimizations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define boost ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL)
#define nl "\n"
#define ll long long
#define pb push_back
#define mpr make_pair
#define fr(i, a, n) for (ll i = a; i < n; ++i)
#define fr0(i, n) for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i)
#define pii pair<ll, ll>
#define mem(a) memset(a, 0, sizeof(a))
#define F first
#define S second
#define sp ' '
#define vi vector<ll>
#define vii vector<pair<ll, ll>>
#define all(a) a.begin(), a.end()

const int N = 1e6 + 5;
vi dp(N);

void preprocess() {
  for (ll i = 1; i < N; i++) dp[i] = i;
  for (ll i = 2; i * i < N; i++) {
    if (dp[i] == i) {
      for (ll j = i * i; j < N; j += i) {
        if (dp[j] == j) dp[j] = i;
      }
    }
  }
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  unordered_map<int, int> mp;
  mp.reserve(1024);
  mp.max_load_factor(0.25);
  vi a(n);
  fr0(i, n) cin >> a[i];
  int ans1 = 1;
  fr0(i, n) {
    int val = dp[a[i]];
    mp[val]++;
    ans1 = max(ans1, mp[val]);
  }
  int ans2 = 0;
  for (auto it : mp) {
    if (it.S % 2 == 0 || it.F == 1)
      ans2 += it.S;
  }
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    int w;
    cin >> w;
    if (w == 0)
      cout << ans1 << nl;
    else
      cout << max(ans1, ans2) << nl;
  }
}

int32_t main() {
  boost;
  preprocess();
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```
For the debugging and timing code, you can keep them if you are debugging or testing the program's performance. But in a final version of the program, it's better to remove them to make the code cleaner and easier to read.
