Optimization Steps:

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes all the standard library files which can increase compile time. Instead, include only those libraries that are actually used in the program. This will reduce memory usage.

2. The `preprocess()` function calculates the factors for all numbers up to `N`, but it may be possible that many of these numbers are not even used in the `solve()` function. This is unnecessary computation and memory usage. Instead, calculate the factors only when required.

3. In the `solve()` function, the `unordered_map` is used to count the frequency of each number. A more memory efficient approach would be to use a `std::array` if the range of numbers is known and not too large. However, in this case, it seems the range could be quite large, so stick with the `unordered_map`.

4. In the `solve()` function, the `for (auto it : mp)` loop iterates over the map to calculate `ans2`. Instead, calculate `ans2` within the previous loop to avoid another iteration over the map.

5. The `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` blocks are used to provide functionality that is only needed when not submitting to an online judge. If you are not using an online judge, you can remove these blocks to simplify the program.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cmath>
#include <chrono>
using namespace std;

#define nl "\n"
#define ll long long
#define pii pair<ll, ll>
#define vi vector<ll>

#define boost                                                                  \
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);                                                 \
  cin.tie(NULL);                                                               \
  cout.tie(NULL)

const int N = 1e6 + 5;
vi dp(N);

void preprocess(int num) {
  dp[1] = 1;
  for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(num) + 1; ++i) {
    if (num % i == 0) {
      if (dp[num / i] % i)
        dp[num] = dp[num / i] * i;
      else
        dp[num] = dp[num / i] / i;
      break;
    }
  }
  if (dp[num] == 0)
    dp[num] = num;
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  unordered_map<int, int> mp;
  vi a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) 
    cin >> a[i];
  
  int ans1 = 1, ans2 = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    preprocess(a[i]);
    mp[dp[a[i]]]++;
    ans1 = max(ans1, mp[dp[a[i]]]);
    if (mp[dp[a[i]]] % 2 == 0 || dp[a[i]] == 1)
      ans2 += mp[dp[a[i]]];
  }

  int q;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    int w;
    cin >> w;
    if (w == 0)
      cout << ans1 << nl;
    else
      cout << max(ans1, ans2) << nl;
  }
}

int main() {
  boost;
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
