The given program is a competitive programming code that has already been optimized a lot. However, there are still a few places where it can be slightly improved:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes a large number of standard library files and can slow down the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary header files.

2. Avoid using `#define` for constants: It's better to use `const` for constant values. In modern C++, `constexpr` is even better because it allows for more optimization.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This can cause name conflicts if the standard library has names that are the same as your own.

4. Use direct assignment for `unordered_map` capacity: It's better to assign the capacity directly in the constructor.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cmath>
#include <chrono>
#include <iomanip>

using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;
using std::unordered_map;
using std::pair;
using std::make_pair;

using ll = long long;
constexpr ll N = 1e6 + 5;

vector<ll> dp(N);

void preprocess() {
  dp[1] = 1;
  for (ll num = 1; num < N; ++num) {
    for (ll i = 2; i <= sqrt(num) + 1; ++i) {
      if (num % i == 0) {
        if (dp[num / i] % i)
          dp[num] = dp[num / i] * i;
        else
          dp[num] = dp[num / i] / i;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (dp[num] == 0)
      dp[num] = num;
  }
}

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  unordered_map<ll, ll> mp(n); // direct assignment
  vector<ll> a(n);
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) cin >> a[i];
  ll ans1 = 1;
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    mp[dp[a[i]]]++;
    ans1 = std::max(ans1, mp[dp[a[i]]]);
  }
  ll ans2 = 0;
  for (auto it : mp) {
    if (it.second % 2 == 0 || it.first == 1)
      ans2 += it.second;
  }
  ll q;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    ll w;
    cin >> w;
    if (w == 0)
      cout << ans1 << endl;
    else
      cout << std::max(ans1, ans2) << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  preprocess();
  ll t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  double tt = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::nanoseconds>(end - start).count();
  cout << "\nExecuted in: " << std::fixed << tt * 1e-9 << std::setprecision(9) << " sec";
  return 0;
}
```

Please note, the original code seems to be written for a specific online judge, where certain things are allowed or required, but might not be best practices for a general case. For instance, the `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` directives are used to handle input/output differently when testing locally vs. when submitting to the online judge. The same applies to the debug function. If you're not using an online judge that expects this behavior, these parts should be removed.
