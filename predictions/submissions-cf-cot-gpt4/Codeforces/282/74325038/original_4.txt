This C++ program increments or decrements an integer `s` based on the string input it receives. The program is already quite efficient, but there are a few small changes that can be made to optimize the program further:

1. The `string str` is currently being declared inside the loop, which means a new string is created on each iteration. By moving the declaration of `str` outside of the loop, we can reuse the same string and avoid the overhead of creating and destroying a string on each iteration.

2. The two `if` statements can be combined into one `if-else` statement. This is because the conditions in the `if` statements are mutually exclusive - a string cannot be both "++X" and "--X" at the same time. By using `if-else`, we can potentially save some CPU time because if the first condition is met, the second condition will not be checked.

3. The `s = s + 1` and `s = s - 1` can be simplified to `s++` and `s--` respectively. This will not have a significant impact on performance, but it will make the code shorter and easier to read.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, s = 0;
  cin >> n;
  string str;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> str;
    if (str == "++X" || str == "X++") {
      s++;
    }
    else if (str == "--X" || str == "X--") {
      s--;
    }
  }
  cout << s;
  return 0;
}
```
