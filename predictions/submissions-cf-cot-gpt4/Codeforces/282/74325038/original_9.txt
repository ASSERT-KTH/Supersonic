Here are some optimization steps:

1. Declare the string outside of the loop to avoid unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation. This will reduce the overhead of creating and deleting this variable on each iteration.

2. Replace `s = s + 1` with `++s` and `s = s - 1` with `--s`. This will be faster as increment and decrement operators are faster than addition and subtraction.

3. Combine the two `if` conditions into one using `else if` to avoid checking the second condition if the first one is true. This will reduce the number of checks and therefore improve the performance.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, s = 0;
  cin >> n;
  string str;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> str;
    if (str == "++X" || str == "X++") {
      ++s;
    } else if (str == "--X" || str == "X--") {
      --s;
    }
  }
  cout << s;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version of the program should run faster and use less memory than the original version.
