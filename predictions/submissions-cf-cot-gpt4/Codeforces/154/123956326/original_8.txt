Let's look at the potential optimization:

1. Using unordered_map instead of map: The map in C++ is implemented as a self-balancing binary search tree and it takes O(log(n)) time for insert and find operations. If we replace it with unordered_map, which is a hash table, the average time complexity for these operations becomes O(1). 

2. Minimize the number of calls to solve(): We can combine the two solve() calls into one by moving the second loop where you add val[i] to adj[i] before the solve() function. This way, we only need to calculate mp[adj[i]] once for each i.

3. Avoiding unnecessary operations: In the loop where you calculate adj[u] and adj[v], we can avoid the decrement operations for u and v by simply using a zero-based index when reading from the input.

4. Use fast I/O methods: Instead of using cin and cout, we can use scanf and printf to speed up the I/O process.

Here is the optimized code:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define ar array
#define ull unsigned ll
mt19937_64 rng(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
const int mxN = 1e6;
int n, m;
ull val[mxN], adj[mxN];
ll ans;
void solve() {
  unordered_map<ull, int> mp;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    ans += mp[adj[i]]++;
}
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    val[i] = rng();
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    scanf("%d %d", &u, &v);
    adj[u-1] += val[v-1];
    adj[v-1] += val[u-1];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    adj[i] += val[i];
  solve();
  printf("%lld", ans);
  return 0;
}
```
