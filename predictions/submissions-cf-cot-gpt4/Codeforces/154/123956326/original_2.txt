Before we start with the optimization, let's discuss what the original C++ program is doing. The program is reading from standard input several pairs of values, updating an adjacency list with some calculated values and counting the adjacency values using a map.

Here are the steps to optimize this code:

1. **Prefer unordered_map over map:** `std::map` in C++ is implemented as a Red-Black Tree, which provides a logarithmic time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations. If we don't need the keys to be ordered, we can use `std::unordered_map` which uses hashing and provides constant time complexity on average for these operations. This change will significantly improve the time complexity of our `solve()` function.

2. **Move the `ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);` statements at the start of main:** These statements are used to speed up the I/O operations in C++. As they affect all the I/O operations in the program, it's better to call them at the start of the program.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define ar array
#define ull unsigned ll
mt19937_64 rng(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
const int mxN = 1e6;
int n, m;
ull val[mxN], adj[mxN];
ll ans;
void solve() {
  unordered_map<ull, int> mp;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    ans += mp[adj[i]]++;
}
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    val[i] = rng();
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v, --u, --v;
    adj[u] += val[v];
    adj[v] += val[u];
  }
  solve();
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    adj[i] += val[i];
  solve();
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that `unordered_map` uses more memory than `map` but in this case, we are trying to optimize for running time.
