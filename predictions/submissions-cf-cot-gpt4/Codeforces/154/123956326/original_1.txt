Step 1 - Avoiding namespace std
Using the entire std namespace in the program can lead to name conflicts. Hence, instead of using namespace std, we should only use what is necessary.

Step 2 - Avoiding Global Variables
Global variables consume memory for the entire lifetime of the program, which could be unnecessary if they are only used in specific functions or scopes. Hence, it's recommended to keep variable scope as local as possible.

Step 3 - Avoiding #define for Constants
The #define directive does not respect scope and type rules, which can lead to problems. It's better to use const or constexpr for defining constants.

Step 4 - Using std::unordered_map Instead of std::map
std::unordered_map has an average case time complexity of O(1) for search, insert, and delete operations, which makes it faster than std::map for large data sets.

Step 5 - Avoiding std::endl
std::endl is slower because it causes a flush operation. We can use "\n" for new lines instead.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>
#include <random>
#include <unordered_map>

using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::mt19937_64;
using std::unordered_map;

mt19937_64 rng(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
constexpr int mxN = 1e6;

void solve(unsigned long long* adj, int n, long long& ans) {
  unordered_map<unsigned long long, int> mp;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    ans += mp[adj[i]]++;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  unsigned long long val[mxN], adj[mxN] = {};
  long long ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    val[i] = rng();
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v, --u, --v;
    adj[u] += val[v];
    adj[v] += val[u];
  }
  solve(adj, n, ans);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    adj[i] += val[i];
  solve(adj, n, ans);
  cout << ans << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
