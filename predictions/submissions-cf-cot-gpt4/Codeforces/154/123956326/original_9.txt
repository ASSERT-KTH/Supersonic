The primary optimizations for this program can be made in two areas:

1. Data Structure: Using the map data structure is not efficient in this case because the keys (ull adj[i]) are just indices, so we can use an array or vector instead. This will reduce the time complexity from O(log n) to O(1) for each operation.

2. Repeated Operations: The "solve" function is called twice and each time it loops through the entire 'adj' array. It's better to combine these two operations into one to avoid unnecessary repetition.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define ar array
#define ull unsigned ll
mt19937_64 rng(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
const int mxN = 1e6;
int n, m;
ull val[mxN], adj[mxN];
ll ans;
vector<int> mp(mxN, 0);
void solve() {
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    adj[i] += val[i];
    ans += mp[adj[i]]++;
  }
}
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    val[i] = rng();
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v, --u, --v;
    adj[u] += val[v];
    adj[v] += val[u];
  }
  solve();
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the `mp` vector's size is set to `mxN`. This assumes that the maximum value of `adj[i]` won't exceed `mxN`. If this can't be guaranteed, consider using the `unordered_map` data structure from the Standard Library. It has an average time complexity of O(1) for the insertion and retrieval of elements, which is more efficient than `map`.
