This program can be optimized by using an unordered_map instead of a map. The map in C++ is implemented as a balanced binary tree which gives a time complexity of O(log(n)) for insertion and access. While, the unordered_map in C++ is implemented as a hash table which gives a time complexity of O(1) for average case and O(n) in the worst case. So, in most cases unordered_map will be faster. This change will optimize the program for running time.

This program can also be optimized in terms of memory usage. I see that the program creates two large arrays, 'val' and 'adj', with a size of 1e6. But then, it only uses the first 'n' elements of these arrays. This can be optimized by using dynamic memory allocation. Instead of declaring the arrays with a constant size of 1e6, we can declare them as pointers and allocate the required memory after getting the value of 'n'. This will save a significant amount of memory if 'n' is much less than 1e6.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define ar array
#define ull unsigned ll
mt19937_64 rng(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
ull *val, *adj;
ll ans;
void solve(int n) {
  unordered_map<ull, int> mp;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    ans += mp[adj[i]]++;
}
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  val = new ull[n];
  adj = new ull[n]();
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    val[i] = rng();
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v, --u, --v;
    adj[u] += val[v];
    adj[v] += val[u];
  }
  solve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    adj[i] += val[i];
  solve(n);
  cout << ans;
  delete[] val;
  delete[] adj;
  return 0;
}
```
Note: Remember to free the allocated memory using delete[] after you're done using the arrays to avoid memory leaks.
