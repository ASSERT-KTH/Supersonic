The optimizations that can be made in the given C/C++ code are:
1. Using an unordered_map instead of a map. The reason is that a map in C++ is implemented as a Red-Black Tree which has a time complexity of O(log(n)) for insertions and access. On the other hand, an unordered_map is implemented as a Hash Table, which has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertions and access.
2. Replacing the post-increment operator "++" with the pre-increment operator. This is because the post-increment operator involves an extra step of creating a copy of the object, incrementing the original, and then returning the copy. The pre-increment operator increments the original object and returns it, thus avoiding the creation of an unnecessary copy.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define ar array
#define ull unsigned ll
mt19937_64 rng(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
const int mxN = 1e6;
int n, m;
ull val[mxN], adj[mxN];
ll ans;
void solve() {
  unordered_map<ull, int> mp;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    ans += ++mp[adj[i]];
}
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    val[i] = rng();
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v, --u, --v;
    adj[u] += val[v];
    adj[v] += val[u];
  }
  solve();
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    adj[i] += val[i];
  solve();
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
