In the given C++ program, we have a nested loop which is causing the program to have a time complexity of O(n^2). This is because for each element in the outer loop, we're iterating over every other element in the inner loop. This can be optimized by reducing the number of unnecessary iterations.

We can do this by noticing that the condition `(a[i].first * a[j].first) >= 2 * n` only depends on `a[j].first` and `n`, not on `a[i].first`. Therefore, we can calculate the maximum possible value for `a[j].first` before the inner loop, and only loop up to that value. This value (`maxJ`) can be calculated as `2*n / a[i].first`.

Moreover, we can see that the vector `a` is only sorted to be used in the inner loop to find the condition `(a[i].first * a[j].first) >= 2 * n` and break the loop. If we calculate `maxJ` as suggested, we no longer need the array to be sorted.

Here are the steps:
1. Remove the `sort(all(a));` line as it's no longer needed.
2. Calculate `maxJ` before the inner loop starts.
3. Change the inner loop to iterate only up to `maxJ`.

Now let's implement the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define pb push_back
#define ll long long
#define pi pair<int, int>
#define pll pair<ll, ll>
#define vii vector<pi>
#define vi vector<int>
#define vvi vector<vi>
#define vll vector<long long>
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define print(x) cout << (#x) << " : " << x << endl;
#define loop(n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define pb push_back
using namespace std;
void fastIo() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
}
void solve() {
  ll n, ans = 0;
  cin >> n;
  vector<pair<ll, ll>> a(n);
  loop(n) {
    cin >> a[i].first;
    a[i].second = i + 1;
  }
  for (ll i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    ll maxJ = min(n, (ll)(2 * n / a[i].first));
    for (ll j = i + 1; j < maxJ; j++) {
      if ((a[i].first * a[j].first) == (a[i].second + a[j].second))
        ans++;
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}
int main() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  fastIo();
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the actual performance improvement depends on the input data. If the inputs for `a[i].first` are generally much smaller than `2*n`, then the optimization will not have a significant impact. However, for larger inputs, the difference will become more noticeable.
