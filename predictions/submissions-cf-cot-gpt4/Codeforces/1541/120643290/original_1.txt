This program seems to be already optimized in many ways, but here are a few optimizations that could be applied:

1. Removing duplicate `#define pb push_back`: This is unnecessary and add clutter to the code.
2. Using `reserve()` for vector initialization: This can potentially improve performance by preventing unnecessary reallocations and copies when the vector is grown.
3. Use pre-increment (++i) instead of post-increment (i++): In C++, the pre-increment operator could be more efficient than the post-increment operator when the object is of a user-defined type because post-increment involves a copy of the object.
4. Avoiding use of `std::endl`: `std::endl` not only inserts a newline character, but also flushes the output buffer, which can negatively impact performance. Instead, use '\n'.
5. Fast I/O: You've already implemented the fastIO() function which provides faster I/O operations. It's a good practice for competitive programming.

Let's apply these optimizations to the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define pi pair<int, int>
#define pll pair<ll, ll>
#define vii vector<pi>
#define vi vector<int>
#define vvi vector<vi>
#define vll vector<long long>
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define print(x) cout << (#x) << " : " << x << '\n';
#define loop(n) for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
using namespace std;
void fastIo() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
}
void solve() {
  ll n, ans = 0;
  cin >> n;
  vector<pair<ll, ll>> a;
  a.reserve(n);
  loop(n) {
    cin >> a[i].first;
    a[i].second = i + 1;
  }
  sort(all(a));
  for (ll i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
    for (ll j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
      if ((a[i].first * a[j].first) >= 2 * n)
        break;
      else if ((a[i].first * a[j].first) == (a[i].second + a[j].second))
        ans++;
    }
  }
  cout << ans << '\n';
}
int main() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  fastIo();
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```
These optimizations might not drastically improve the performance of this code, but they can still make a slight difference. They are more about good practices and cleanliness of the code.
