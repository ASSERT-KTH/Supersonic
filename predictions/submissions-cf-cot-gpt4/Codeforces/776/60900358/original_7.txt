This program appears to implement a 2-SAT (Two Satisfiability) problem solver. It uses depth-first search (DFS) for traversing the graph of logical implications. It also uses Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm to find groups of variables that must all take the same truth value. The program reads in an input problem, constructs a graph of implications, and then uses this graph to determine if there is a satisfying assignment to the variables or not. 

Here, I will walk you through the steps to optimize the program:

1) **Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`**: This header file is quite large and including it increases the compilation time. It is better to include only those header files which are actually used in the program. In this case, we are using `vector`, `iostream` from the standard library. So, we can replace `<bits/stdc++.h>` with `<vector>` and `<iostream>`.

2) **Avoid global variables**: It's generally a good idea to avoid global variables if it's possible to do so, as they can make the program harder to understand and debug. However, in competitive programming, using global variables can sometimes make the code faster and easier to write. 

3) **Use `reserve()` for vectors**: If you know the size of the vector in advance, you can use the `reserve()` function which can prevent unnecessary re-allocations and copies in vectors when the elements are being added to it. This can be a considerable time saver.

4) **Avoid using `endl`**: `endl` causes a flush operation, which can be a bottleneck in terms of performance. Using `'\n'` instead of `endl` can improve the performance of the program. 

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

const int N = 1e5 + 5;
int n, vis[2 * N], ord[2 * N], ordn, cnt, cmp[2 * N], val[N];
vector<int> adj[2 * N], adjt[2 * N];
int m, st[N], sw[N][2];

int v(int x) { return 2 * x; }
int nv(int x) { return 2 * x + 1; }

void add(int a, int b) {
  adj[a ^ 1].push_back(b);
  adj[b ^ 1].push_back(a);
  adjt[b].push_back(a ^ 1);
  adjt[a].push_back(b ^ 1);
}

void dfs(int x) {
  vis[x] = 1;
  for (auto v : adj[x])
    if (!vis[v])
      dfs(v);
  ord[ordn++] = x;
}

void dfst(int x) {
  cmp[x] = cnt, vis[x] = 0;
  for (auto v : adjt[x])
    if (vis[v])
      dfst(v);
}

bool run2sat() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    if (!vis[v(i)])
      dfs(v(i));
    if (!vis[nv(i)])
      dfs(nv(i));
  }
  for (int i = ordn - 1; i >= 0; i--)
    if (vis[ord[i]])
      cnt++, dfst(ord[i]);
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    if (cmp[v(i)] == cmp[nv(i)])
      return false;
    val[i] = cmp[v(i)] > cmp[nv(i)];
  }
  return true;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(NULL);
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    cin >> st[i];
  int q, a;
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    cin >> q;
    while (q--) {
      cin >> a;
      sw[a][0] ? sw[a][1] = i : sw[a][0] = i;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    int p = sw[i][0];
    int q = sw[i][1];
    if (!st[i])
      add(v(p), v(q)), add(nv(p), nv(q));
    else
      add(nv(p), v(q)), add(v(p), nv(q));
  }
  cout << (run2sat() ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
}
```

These optimizations are minor and potentially negligible given the scale of your code, but they are good practices to follow in general for efficient C++ programming.
