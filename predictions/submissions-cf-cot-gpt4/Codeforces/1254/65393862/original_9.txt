This program is quite complex and well-optimized already. However, there are a couple of minor changes that could help improve performance:

1. Avoid copying: In this code, there are several places where the objects are unnecessarily copied which can be avoided. Instead of copying, you can simply use the reference of the objects. For example in the functions like `mod_int operator+(const mod_int &a, const mod_int &b)` and `mod_int operator-(const mod_int &a, const mod_int &b)`, you are creating a copy of `mod_int a` which can be avoided.

2. Use `reserve` for vectors: If you know the size of the vector beforehand, you can use the `reserve` function to avoid unnecessary reallocations.

Here's a sample of the optimized version following these steps:

```cpp
//...
friend mod_int operator+(mod_int &a, const mod_int &b) { // avoid copy of a
    return a += b;
}
friend mod_int operator-(mod_int &a, const mod_int &b) { // avoid copy of a
    return a -= b;
}
//...
void build(const vector<T> &_values) {
    values = _values;
    n = values.size();
    levels = largest_bit(n) + 1;
    range_low.reserve(levels); // reserve space for vectors
    //...
}
void dfs(int node, int par) {
    //...
    euler.reserve(n*2); // reserve space for vectors
    //...
}
void build() {
    //...
    euler.reserve(n*2); // reserve space for vectors
    vector<int> euler_depths;
    euler_depths.reserve(euler.size()); // reserve space for vectors
    //...
}
//...
int main() {
    //...
    values.reserve(N); // reserve space for vectors
    vector<query> pending_queries;
    pending_queries.reserve(APPLY); // reserve space for vectors
    //...
}
```

Remember that the improvement in performance might not be significant because the original code is already well-optimized. However, these minor changes can add up in a large-scale application and help to improve performance.
