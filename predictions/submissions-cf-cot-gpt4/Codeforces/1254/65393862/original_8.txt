There seem to be a few places where we could optimize this program:

1) Use of `ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(nullptr);`:
This line of code is used to untie C++'s cin from cout, allowing them to operate independently, which can increase input/output speed. However, if both cin and cout are used in the program, it could potentially lead to bugs and undefined behavior. This program only uses cin for input and cout for output without any need for them to be tied together. Therefore, this line of code can be safely removed to reduce the complexity of the program.

2) Use of `assert()` function:
This function is used to catch logical errors in the code during debugging. In this code, it is used in the `pow()` and `child_ancestor()` methods to ensure that the conditions are met. However, when the program is ready for production, these assert() calls can be removed to increase performance.

3) #if !defined(_WIN32) || defined(_WIN64)
`fast_mod` function has conditional compilation based on the platform. If this code is going to be run on a known platform, this condition can be removed.

4) Use of `cerr` for debugging:
The `cerr` stream is used for error output, but in this code, it is being used for displaying debug information. This could potentially slow down the program. If the debug information is not necessary, this line can be removed.

5) Repeated computation in 'for' loop:
In the 'for' loop in the `build()` function, the variable 'k' is repeatedly shifted left by 1 in each iteration. This operation could be replaced with a variable that is doubled in each iteration, saving some computation time.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int MOD = 998244353;
struct mod_int {
  // Rest of the code
  static unsigned fast_mod(uint64_t x, unsigned m = MOD) {
    return x % m;
  }
  // Rest of the code
};
// Rest of the code
void RMQ::build(const vector<T> &_values) {
    // Rest of the code
    for (int k = 1, b = 2; k < levels; k++, b <<= 1)
      for (int i = 0; i <= n - b; i++)
        range_low[k][i] = better_index(range_low[k - 1][i],
                                       range_low[k - 1][i + b / 2]);
  }
// Rest of the code
int main() {
  cin >> N >> Q;
  APPLY = 1.0 * sqrt(N) + 1;
  lca.init(N);
  // Rest of the code
    if ((int)pending_queries.size() >= APPLY) {
      updates.assign(N, 0);
      query_d.assign(N, 0);
      // Rest of the code
      for (int node : lca.tour_list) {
        values[node] += updates[node];
        for (int child : lca.adj[node])
          updates[child] += updates[node];
      }
      pending_queries.clear();
    }
  }
}
```

To summarize, the main optimizations were removing unnecessary code (asserts, debugging output, and untie of cin and cout) and reducing repeated computation in a loop.
