The original program is a solution for a competitive programming problem, which finds the minimum non-negative integer that is not found after a series of operations. There are two loops in the code, one for inserting elements into the set and another for retrieving and processing user input. 

Steps to optimize the code:

1. Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of libraries which may not be used in your program. It's always better to include only those headers that you are using in your program.

2. Combine the `for` loop with the `while` loop: The `for` loop at the beginning is used to initialize the set `s`. This could be combined with the `while` loop that processes the user inputs.

3. Precompute the size for the set: Instead of using the `max` function in the loop to determine the size, we can precompute it before the loop to save some computation time.

4. Use `printf` and `scanf` instead of `cin` and `cout`: `printf` and `scanf` are faster than `cin` and `cout`.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <cstdio>
#define ll long long int
#define M 1000000007
#define D 998244353
#define PI 3.14159265
using namespace std;
bool sortbysec(const pair<int, int> &a, const pair<int, int> &b) {
  return (a.second < b.second);
}
int main() {
  int tests = 1;
  while (tests-- > 0) {
    int q, x;
    scanf("%d %d", &q, &x);
    int a[x] = {0};
    set<int> s;
    int size = max(2 * q, q + 100);
    int i = 0;
    while (i < size || q-- > 0) {
      if (i < size) {
        s.insert(i);
        i++;
      }
      if (q >= 0) {
        int y;
        scanf("%d", &y);
        int z = a[y % x] * x + y % x;
        s.erase(z);
        a[y % x]++;
        printf("%d\n", *(s.begin()));
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
