The given C++ code is already fairly optimized. It contains a lot of utility functions for handling modular arithmetic and debug printing. It also uses a breadth-first search (BFS) for traversing the graph.

However, there are few things that can be optimized:

1. The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes many unnecessary header files which increase the compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary headers.

2. In the function `dfs()`, the `make_pair()` function is used to create a pair. Instead of using this function, you can directly initialize the pair which will save some execution time.

3. The vector `vec` is defined globally and used in `main()` and `bfs()`. Instead, it can be defined in `main()` and passed as a reference to `bfs()`, avoiding the need for global variable.

4. The `bfs()` function calculates the maximum value of `d[i]` in a separate loop. Instead, it can be calculated in the same loop where `d[v]` is calculated, saving one pass over the array.

5. Also, `bfs()` function returns nothing and just prints the result. It's better to return the result and print it in the main function for better readability and maintainability.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

#define INF 1 << 30
#define endl '\n'
#define maxn 1000005
#define FASTIO ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0);
typedef long long ll;
const double PI = acos(-1.0);
const ll mod = 1e9 + 7;

// ... rest of the code ...

int main() {
  FASTIO
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    graph[u].push_back(v);
    graph[v].push_back(u);
  }
  auto da = dfs(1);
  auto df = dfs(da.second);
  int v = df.second;
  vector<int> vec;
  while (v != da.second) {
    vec.push_back(v);
    v = par[v];
  }
  vec.push_back(da.second);
  if ((int)vec.size() == n) {
    cout << n - 1 << endl;
    cout << vec[0] << " " << vec[1] << " " << vec.back() << endl;
  } else {
    pair<int, pair<int, int>> ret = bfs(vec);
    cout << ret.first << endl;
    cout << ret.second.first << " " << ret.second.second << " " << ret.second.third << endl;
  }
}
```
