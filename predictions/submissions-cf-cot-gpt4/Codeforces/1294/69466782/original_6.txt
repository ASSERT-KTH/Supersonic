Optimization Steps:

1. The "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" is usually discouraged because it includes everything in the Standard Library, which increases the compilation time. It's better to include only the headers that are actually used.

2. Using "ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0);" is often recommended to speed up cin and cout, but in this program, it doesn't have any effect because there's no mixing of cin/cout and scanf/printf. So, this line can be removed.

3. The macro "FASTIO" is defined but used only once. It can be removed, and its content can be written directly in the main function.

4. The function "faltu" and the macro "dbg" are used for debugging purposes, but they are not used in the program and can be removed.

5. The "#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE" block is not needed unless the code is to be submitted to an online judge that supports this directive. For a general purpose program, it can be removed.

6. The vector "vec" is used as a global, but it's used only in the main function and the bfs function, so it can be moved to the main function and passed as a parameter to the bfs function.

7. The array "par" is also a global variable that is used only in the main function and the dfs function. Similarly, it can be moved to the main function and passed as a parameter to the dfs function.

8. The INT_MAX variable can be used instead of the custom-defined INF. This will reduce the number of defined constants and make the code more standard.
