The given code is actually quite optimized, but there are still a few things we can do to make small improvements:

1. **Header Files**: Instead of including "bits/stdc++.h", include only necessary header files. This can help to reduce compilation time.

2. **Inline Functions**: While inline functions can speed up the program by saving the time of function calls, they also increase the memory usage because the compiler replaces the function call with the actual function code. If a function is not called frequently, it's better to not make it inline.

3. **Macros**: Avoid using macros whenever possible. In this code, timeStamp and dbg macros are defined but never used, so we can remove them.

4. **Pre-increment**: Use pre-increment instead of post-increment in loops. Although modern compilers can optimize it, it's a good practice to use pre-increment to avoid unnecessary temporary object creation.

5. **Input/Output Optimization**: The use of std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0), and cout.tie(0) can significantly speed up cin and cout, but it can cause problems if you're mixing cin/cout with scanf/printf. Since you're only using cin and cout in this code, it's fine to use them.

6. **Use of auto**: While auto can make code easier to write and read, it also makes the code harder to understand because the type of the variable is not explicitly stated. It's better to explicitly state the type of the variable whenever possible.

7. **Global Variables**: Avoid using global variables whenever possible. Although it's not a big problem in this code, using global variables can easily lead to bugs and it makes the code hard to understand and maintain. 

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <cmath>

#define INF 1 << 30
#define MAXN 1000005
#define MOD 1e9 + 7

using namespace std;

const double PI = acos(-1.0);

vector<int> graph[MAXN];
int par[MAXN];
int n;
vector<int> vec;

pair<int, int> dfs(int u, int p = -1, int dist = 0) {
  par[u] = p;
  pair<int, int> x = make_pair(dist, u);
  for (int v : graph[u]) {
    if (v == p)
      continue;
    x = max(x, dfs(v, u, dist + 1));
  }
  return x;
}

void bfs() {
  queue<int> Q;
  vector<int> d(n + 1, -1);
  for (int v : vec) {
    d[v] = 0;
    Q.push(v);
  }
  while (!Q.empty()) {
    int u = Q.front();
    Q.pop();
    for (int v : graph[u]) {
      if (d[v] == -1) {
        d[v] = d[u] + 1;
        Q.push(v);
      }
    }
  }
  pair<int, int> ret = make_pair(d[1], 1);
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    ret = max(ret, make_pair(d[i], i));
  }
  cout << vec.size() - 1 + ret.first << endl;
  cout << vec[0] << " " << ret.second << " " << vec.back() << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    graph[u].push_back(v);
    graph[v].push_back(u);
  }
  pair<int, int> da = dfs(1);
  pair<int, int> df = dfs(da.second);
  int v = df.second;
  while (v != da.second) {
    vec.push_back(v);
    v = par[v];
  }
  vec.push_back(da.second);
  if (vec.size() == n) {
    cout << n - 1 << endl;
    cout << vec[0] << " " << vec[1] << " " << vec.back() << endl;
  } else {
    bfs();
  }
  return 0;
}
