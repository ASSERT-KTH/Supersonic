This C++ program is already highly optimized, but there are still a few minor changes that could slightly improve its performance:

1. Using namespace std: Using the entire std namespace could potentially lead to conflicts with other libraries. It's better to specify exactly which elements from the std namespace you're using.

2. Include unnecessary headers: It's better to include only headers that are necessary for your program. The <bits/stdc++.h> header file, includes all the standard library headers in one go, which can increase compilation time.

3. Macros: Macros like FASTIO can cause problems because they don't have any scope. They can also be hard to debug because they're replaced by the preprocessor before the code is compiled. It would be better to use a function or a code block instead.

4. Unnecessary code: Some of the code, such as the debug macros, is unnecessary and can be removed to simplify the program.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>

using std::vector;
using std::pair;
using std::make_pair;
using std::queue;
using std::max;
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

#define INF 1 << 30
#define endl '\n'
#define maxn 1000005
#define PI acos(-1.0)
#define mod 1e9 + 7

typedef long long ll;

const int N = 3e5 + 5;
vector<int> graph[N];
int par[N];
int n;
vector<int> vec;

pair<int, int> dfs(int u, int p = -1, int dist = 0) {
  par[u] = p;
  auto x = make_pair(dist, u);
  for (auto v : graph[u]) {
    if (v == p)
      continue;
    x = max(x, dfs(v, u, dist + 1));
  }
  return x;
}

void bfs() {
  queue<int> Q;
  vector<int> d(n + 1, -1);
  for (auto v : vec) {
    d[v] = 0;
    Q.push(v);
  }
  while (!Q.empty()) {
    int u = Q.front();
    Q.pop();
    for (auto v : graph[u]) {
      if (d[v] == -1) {
        d[v] = d[u] + 1;
        Q.push(v);
      }
    }
  }
  auto ret = make_pair(d[1], 1);
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    ret = max(ret, make_pair(d[i], i));
  }
  cout << (int)vec.size() - 1 + ret.first << endl;
  cout << vec[0] << " " << ret.second << " " << vec.back() << endl;
  return;
}

int main() {
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    graph[u].push_back(v);
    graph[v].push_back(u);
  }
  auto da = dfs(1);
  auto df = dfs(da.second);
  int v = df.second;
  while (v != da.second) {
    vec.push_back(v);
    v = par[v];
  }
  vec.push_back(da.second);
  if ((int)vec.size() == n) {
    cout << n - 1 << endl;
    cout << vec[0] << " " << vec[1] << " " << vec.back() << endl;
  } else {
    bfs();
  }
}
```

It's important to note that the performance gain from these changes will be very small. The original program is already highly optimized, and these changes are mostly to improve readability and maintainability.
