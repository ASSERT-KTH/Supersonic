Firstly, I see that this program is using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This line includes all standard libraries in C/C++, which increases the compilation time. So, replace it with specific libraries you are actually using.

Secondly, the program makes extensive use of `long long` data type. Though `long long` is needed for very large numbers, if the numbers in your application do not require it, consider using `int` for better performance. 

Thirdly, the program uses a string `s` variable to handle character-based conditions (U, D, L, R). We can reduce the memory usage by using integer codes for these conditions instead.

Fourthly, the function `check` is called with vectors of `long long` integers. Passing vectors this way means they get copied, which can be expensive in terms of time and memory. It would be more efficient to pass references to these vectors instead.

Fifthly, the program uses a binary search approach to find the minimum possible time. However, the initial value of `r` is set to a very large number (`1e18`). This can be optimized by determining a more practical upper bound.

Lastly, the program outputs `-1` if `r > 1e17`. This condition can be avoided by initializing `r` with `-1` and updating it only when `check(x, y, n, mid)` returns true.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

ll x1, y1, x2, y2;

bool check(vector<ll>& x, vector<ll>& y, int n, ll pos) {
  ll full_periods = pos / n;
  ll this_day = pos % n;
  ll current_x = x1 + full_periods * x[n] + x[this_day];
  ll current_y = y1 + full_periods * y[n] + y[this_day];
  return abs(x2 - current_x) + abs(y2 - current_y) <= pos;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> x(n + 1, 0), y(n + 1, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    char direction;
    cin >> direction;
    if (direction == 'U')
      y[i + 1]++;
    else if (direction == 'D')
      y[i + 1]--;
    else if (direction == 'L')
      x[i + 1]--;
    else if (direction == 'R')
      x[i + 1]++;
    x[i + 1] += x[i], y[i + 1] += y[i];
  }
  ll l = 0, r = -1;
  ll upper_bound = abs(x2 - x1) + abs(y2 - y1);
  upper_bound += (upper_bound % 2 != n % 2) ? 1 : 0;
  while (l <= upper_bound) {
    ll mid = (l + upper_bound) / 2;
    if (check(x, y, n, mid)) {
      r = mid;
      upper_bound = mid - 1;
    } else {
      l = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  cout << r;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version reduces the number of standard libraries included, uses references when passing vectors, and sets a more practical upper bound for the binary search. Also, it removes the string s and uses direct character input to reduce memory usage. Finally, it avoids the condition that outputs -1 by initializing r with -1 and updating it only when necessary.
