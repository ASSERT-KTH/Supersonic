First, let's discuss what the given program does. It reads a list of integers and finds the maximum length of consecutive occurrences of the maximum number in the list.

The program is already quite optimal, but there are few areas where it can be improved:

1. We can use a single loop to both read the array and calculate the maximum element and its consecutive occurrences. This will reduce the time complexity from O(2n) to O(n).

2. The 'bits/stdc++.h' header file includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which can increase the compilation time. We can replace it with the specific libraries that we use in the program, which are 'iostream' and 'algorithm'.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
#define M 100001
int arr[M], n, mx = -1, cnt, ans = 1;

int main() {
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
    if(i == 1 || arr[i] != arr[i - 1]) cnt = 1;
    if (arr[i] > mx) {
      mx = arr[i];
      cnt = 1;
    } else if(arr[i] == mx) {
      cnt++;
      ans = max(ans, cnt);
    }
  }
  cout << ans << '\n';
}
```

The optimized program now reads the array and calculates the maximum element and its consecutive occurrences in a single loop, which reduces the time complexity. We also replaced 'bits/stdc++.h' with 'iostream' and 'algorithm' to reduce the compilation time.
