The given C++ program can be optimized in several ways.

1. Minimize the usage of `std::cin >> a;` function. This function requires a temporary vector to be created and filled with input data, but it is then immediately discarded. This operation can be costly in terms of time and space. Instead, the vector could be filled directly from the input stream.

2. Avoid the usage of `const auto b = std::minmax_element(a.cbegin(), a.cend());` to find the minimum and maximum element in the vector. This function will traverse the vector two times which is inefficient. Instead, we can compute the minimum and maximum in a single traversal.

3. Avoid using the `std::cout << separator << x;` inside the loop in the `answer` function. Instead, just print the first element before the loop, and then inside the loop print the separator and the element. This way the separator will only be printed if there is a next element.

Here is the optimized version of the C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void answer(const std::vector<int> &v) {
  if (v.empty()) {
    std::cout << '\n';
    return;
  }

  std::cout << v.front();
  for (auto it = std::next(v.begin()); it != v.end(); ++it)
    std::cout << " " << *it;
    
  std::cout << '\n';
}

void solve(std::vector<int> &a, unsigned long long k) {
  int min = a[0], max = a[0];
  for (int x : a) {
    if (x < min)
      min = x;
    if (x > max)
      max = x;
  }
  for (int &x : a)
    x = max - x;
  if (k % 2 == 0) {
    for (int &x : a)
      x = max - min - x;
  }
  answer(a);
}

void test_case() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  unsigned long long k;
  std::cin >> k;
  std::vector<int> a(n);
  for (auto &x : a)
    std::cin >> x;
  solve(a, k);
}

int main() {
  size_t t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0)
    test_case();
  return 0;
}
```

Here, the `operator>>` function is not used anymore, so it is removed. The `answer` function has been optimized to avoid unnecessary checks for the separator inside the loop and the `solve` function has been modified to compute the minimum and maximum in a single traversal. The `test_case` function has been modified to read directly into the vector.
