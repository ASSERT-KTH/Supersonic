The optimization steps to consider are as follows:

1. Reserve memory for vector: Since we know the size of the vector `a` before inserting any elements into it, we can reserve the required amount of memory for it in advance using the `reserve` function. This step helps to avoid reallocations during the insertion of the elements.

2. Reduce number of for-loops: We currently have two separate for-loops which iterate over the vector `a`. Each of these loops perform an operation on each element in the vector. We can combine these two separate loops into a single loop which performs both operations. This will reduce the number of iterations over the vector by half, thereby reducing the running time of the program.

3. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`: By default, the iostreams and cstdio streams are synchronized so that they can be mixed. However, this synchronization takes some processor time. If you're sure that you're not mixing them, you can disable the synchronization using `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`. This can result in faster input/output operations.

4. Use `std::cin.tie(NULL)`: The `cin` object is by default tied to the `cout` object, meaning that `cout` is flushed before `cin` is used. By using `std::cin.tie(NULL)`, we untie `cin` from `cout`, so `cout` will not be flushed unnecessarily. This can result in faster input/output operations.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
template <typename T>
std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &input, std::vector<T> &v) {
  for (T &a : v)
    input >> a;
  return input;
}
void answer(const std::vector<int> &v) {
  const char *separator = "";
  for (const int x : v) {
    std::cout << separator << x;
    separator = " ";
  }
  std::cout << '\n';
}
void solve(std::vector<int> &a, unsigned long long k) {
  const auto b = std::minmax_element(a.cbegin(), a.cend());
  const int min = *b.first;
  const int max = *b.second;
  for (int &x : a) {
    x = max - x;
    if (k % 2 == 0)
      x = max - min - x;
  }
  answer(a);
}
void test_case() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  unsigned long long k;
  std::cin >> k;
  std::vector<int> a;
  a.reserve(n);
  std::cin >> a;
  solve(a, k);
}
int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  size_t t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0)
    test_case();
  return 0;
}
```
