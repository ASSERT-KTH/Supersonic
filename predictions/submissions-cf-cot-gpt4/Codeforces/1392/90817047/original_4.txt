This is an interesting C++ program. It seems to be a solution for a competitive programming problem, where it gets the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of elements, the value of k, and the array. Then, it performs operations on the array based on the value of k. 

Let's discuss potential optimization steps, and then I'll write the optimized version of the program:

1. **Limit the use of std::minmax_element:** 

The algorithm "std::minmax_element" computes both the smallest and largest elements in the range [first, last). This computation can be costly. In the original program, we calculate the min and max values of the array twice when k is even. We can optimize this by only computing it once at the start of the function, storing these values, and then using them later.

2. **Avoid redundant operations:** 

When k is odd, we don't need to do the operation to make every element "max - min - x" after the "max - x" operation. We can just skip the first loop when k is odd.

3. **Avoid unnecessary copying of data:** 

In the function "answer", it is passing the vector by value, which will cause a copy of the vector to be made. This is unnecessary and can lead to increased memory usage and runtime, especially for large vectors. We can instead pass the vector by reference to avoid this copying.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

template <typename T>
std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &input, std::vector<T> &v) {
  for (T &a : v)
    input >> a;
  return input;
}

void answer(const std::vector<int> &v) {
  const char *separator = "";
  for (const int x : v) {
    std::cout << separator << x;
    separator = " ";
  }
  std::cout << '\n';
}

void solve(std::vector<int> &a, unsigned long long k) {
  const auto b = std::minmax_element(a.cbegin(), a.cend());
  const int min = *b.first;
  const int max = *b.second;

  if(k % 2 == 0) {
    for (int &x : a)
      x = max - min - x;
  } else {
    for (int &x : a)
      x = max - x;
  }
  
  answer(a);
}

void test_case() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  unsigned long long k;
  std::cin >> k;
  std::vector<int> a(n);
  std::cin >> a;
  solve(a, k);
}

int main() {
  size_t t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0)
    test_case();
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program should run faster and use less memory than the original version, especially for large inputs.
