The given C++ program seems to be well written. However, there is one small optimization which can be done in the solve function.

The solve function first calculates the maximum and minimum of the input vector, then it subtracts each element of the vector from the maximum. If the k value is even, it does this operation once again but this time subtracting from (max - min).

The second loop where the same operation is performed for even k can be avoided. This operation is already done in the first loop, and the result is the same no matter how many times it is repeated for even k. This means, if k is even, we do not need to perform the operation again in the second loop.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
template <typename T>
std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &input, std::vector<T> &v) {
  for (T &a : v)
    input >> a;
  return input;
}
void answer(const std::vector<int> &v) {
  const char *separator = "";
  for (const int x : v) {
    std::cout << separator << x;
    separator = " ";
  }
  std::cout << '\n';
}
void solve(std::vector<int> &a, unsigned long long k) {
  const auto b = std::minmax_element(a.cbegin(), a.cend());
  const int min = *b.first;
  const int max = *b.second;
  if (k % 2 == 0) {
    for (int &x : a)
      x = max - min - x;
  } else {
    for (int &x : a)
      x = max - x;
  }
  answer(a);
}
void test_case() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  unsigned long long k;
  std::cin >> k;
  std::vector<int> a(n);
  std::cin >> a;
  solve(a, k);
}
int main() {
  size_t t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0)
    test_case();
  return 0;
}
```

This optimization reduces the time complexity of the solve function from O(2n) to O(n) for even k values, which can make a significant difference when the size of the vector is large.
