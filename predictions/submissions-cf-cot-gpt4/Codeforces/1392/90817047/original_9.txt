First, let's look at the function solve(). In this function, we perform a minmax_element operation, followed by two loops over the vector 'a'. The first loop subtracts each element of 'a' from the max, and the second loop, conditionally, subtracts each element of 'a' from the difference of max and min. This results in two full traversals of the vector 'a', which can be costly if 'a' is large.

To optimize this, we can combine these two loops into one. We can calculate the new value of 'x' in a single line, using a conditional expression (ternary operator). The condition will be 'k % 2 == 0', and depending on it we will either subtract 'x' from the max, or subtract 'x' from the difference of max and min.

This optimization will reduce the number of full traversals of 'a' from two to one, which will make the function run faster, especially for large vectors.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

template <typename T>
std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &input, std::vector<T> &v) {
  for (T &a : v)
    input >> a;
  return input;
}

void answer(const std::vector<int> &v) {
  const char *separator = "";
  for (const int x : v) {
    std::cout << separator << x;
    separator = " ";
  }
  std::cout << '\n';
}

void solve(std::vector<int> &a, unsigned long long k) {
  const auto b = std::minmax_element(a.cbegin(), a.cend());
  const int min = *b.first;
  const int max = *b.second;
  for (int &x : a)
    x = k % 2 == 0 ? max - min - (max - x) : max - x;
  answer(a);
}

void test_case() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  unsigned long long k;
  std::cin >> k;
  std::vector<int> a(n);
  std::cin >> a;
  solve(a, k);
}

int main() {
  size_t t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0)
    test_case();
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program performs the same operations as the original one, but it does so in a more efficient way by reducing the number of full traversals of the vector 'a'.
