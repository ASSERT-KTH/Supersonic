The provided program appears to be already quite optimized, but there are a few small improvements which we can do:

1. Reserve memory for the vector: This is one of the most common ways to optimize memory usage in programs that use vectors. By using the `reserve` function, we can avoid unnecessary reallocations and copies when the vector grows.

2. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This can potentially speed up I/O operations by unsynchronizing C++'s I/O streams with C's.

3. Use `std::cin.tie(NULL)`: It unties `std::cin` from `std::cout`. By default, before any I/O operation on `cin`, all the buffered data in `cout` will be flushed. This could be unnecessary and result in a performance hit.

4. Reduce the number of times `max` and `min` are computed in `solve` function: Currently, `max` and `min` are computed twice when `k` is even. We can optimize this by computing them only once and storing the results.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

template <typename T>
std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &input, std::vector<T> &v) {
  for (T &a : v)
    input >> a;
  return input;
}

void answer(const std::vector<int> &v) {
  const char *separator = "";
  for (const int x : v) {
    std::cout << separator << x;
    separator = " ";
  }
  std::cout << '\n';
}

void solve(std::vector<int> &a, unsigned long long k) {
  const auto b = std::minmax_element(a.begin(), a.end());
  const int min = *b.first;
  const int max = *b.second;
  for (int &x : a)
    x = max - x;
  if (k % 2 == 0) {
    int newMax = max - min;
    for (int &x : a)
      x = newMax - x;
  }
  answer(a);
}

void test_case() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  unsigned long long k;
  std::cin >> k;
  std::vector<int> a;
  a.reserve(n);
  std::cin >> a;
  solve(a, k);
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  size_t t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0)
    test_case();
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations may not always result in noticeable performance improvements. The actual impact will depend on several factors, including the specific inputs to your program and the characteristics of your hardware and operating system.
