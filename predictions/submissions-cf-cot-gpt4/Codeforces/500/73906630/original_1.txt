This program seems to be implementing a form of Union-Find data structure and then sorting the elements of each group. The main inefficiencies are:

1. The use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. It includes a lot of unnecessary headers which can increase the compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary libraries.
2. The use of `#define int long long` might not be necessary. If the numbers are not exceeding the limit of `int`, then it would be better to use `int` instead of `long long` to save memory.
3. The initialization of arrays and vectors in the `main` function can be done at the time of declaration, which will make the code cleaner and more efficient.
4. The sorting operation can be optimized by using priority_queue instead of sorting the vector each time.
5. The use of `root` and `merge` functions can be optimized by using some kind of path compression and union by rank technique.

Let's optimize it:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

const int N = 400;
int a[N], sz[N];
vector<int> v_i[N];
priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> v_e[N];

void initialize(int n) {
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    a[i] = i;
    sz[i] = 1;
  }
}

int root(int i) {
  if(a[i] != i) a[i] = root(a[i]); // path compression technique
  return a[i];
}

void merge(int x, int y) {
  int u = root(x);
  int v = root(y);
  if (u != v) {
    if (sz[u] < sz[v]) swap(u, v); // Union by rank technique
    a[v] = u;
    sz[u] += sz[v];
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  initialize(n);

  int v[n + 1];
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) cin >> v[i];

  string s[n + 1];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> s[i];
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      if (s[i][j] == '1') merge(i + 1, j + 1);
    }
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) v_e[root(i)].push(v[i]);

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    int x = root(i);
    cout << v_e[x].top() << " ";
    v_e[x].pop();
  }

  cout << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```

Here, we've replaced `long long` with `int`, removed unnecessary macros, used path compression and union by rank in the union-find algorithm, replaced sorting with a priority queue to keep elements sorted and made sure to only merge distinct sets. This version of the code will be faster and use less memory.
