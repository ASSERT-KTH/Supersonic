The given program consists of a union-find algorithm. It seems to be reading an adjacency matrix and grouping nodes that are connected. Then it sorts the values associated with each group and prints them out.

Optimization steps:

1. The `root` method is using path compression for the union-find data structure. However, it's not performing the path compression in the most optimal way. The standard way is to set `a[i] = root(a[i])` instead of `a[i] = a[a[i]]`. This compresses the path more efficiently by directly linking each node in the path to the root.

2. In the `merge` method, `a[v] = a[u]` should be `a[v] = u`. This is because `u` is the root of `x`, there is no need to access `a[u]`.

3. The `v_e` vector is being resized every time an element is added, which is inefficient. Instead, call `v_e[i].reserve(sz[i])` after the merges. This will preallocate memory for the vector, reducing the number of allocations.

4. `v_e` vector is sorted for each `i`, but it's more efficient to sort it after all elements have been added. This way, the sort operation is done only once per vector instead of `n` times.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define IOS ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
#define pb push_back
const int N = 400;
int sz[N];
int a[N], ans[N];
vector<int> v_i[N], v_e[N];
void initialize() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= N - 1; i++) {
    a[i] = i;
    sz[i] = 1;
  }
}
int root(int i) {
  while (a[i] != i) {
    a[i] = root(a[i]);
    i = a[i];
  }
  return i;
}
void merge(int x, int y) {
  int u = root(x);
  int v = root(y);
  if (sz[u] < sz[v]) {
    swap(u, v);
  }
  a[v] = u;
  sz[u] += sz[v];
}
int cnt[N];
int32_t main() {
  IOS;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  initialize();
  int v[n + 1];
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
  }
  string s[n + 1];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> s[i];
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      if (s[i][j] == '1') {
        if (root(i + 1) != root(j + 1)) {
          merge(i + 1, j + 1);
        }
      }
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    v_e[root(i)].pb(v[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    v_e[i].reserve(sz[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sort(v_e[i].begin(), v_e[i].end());
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    int x = root(i);
    cout << v_e[x][cnt[x]++] << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
}
