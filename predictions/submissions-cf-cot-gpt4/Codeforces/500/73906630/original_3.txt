The provided program is a C++ program that performs some kind of merging operation based on the input and then outputs the results. The main optimization that can be done here is to reduce the use of redundant operations and calculations, and to improve the efficiency of loop operations.

Here are the steps to optimize the code:

1. Many of the defined constants and types are not used in the program, so we can remove them to reduce memory footprint.
2. The `IOS` macro is used to sync the C++ standard streams with the standard C streams for faster I/O operations, but it's not necessary in this case because it doesn't significantly affect the performance. Removing this can simplify the code.
3. The `root` function is being called multiple times with the same arguments during the execution of the program. You can reduce the number of calls to the `root` function by storing its results in a map and reusing them when needed.
4. In the `merge` function, `sz[u] += sz[v];` should only be executed when `a[v] != a[u]` to avoid unnecessary operations.
5. The `sort` operation in the loop can be expensive. We can use a priority queue to keep the elements in sorted order as they are inserted, allowing us to retrieve the minimum element in constant time.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long

const int N = 400;
int sz[N];
int a[N];
vector<int> v_i[N], v_e[N];
map<int, int> root_map;

void initialize() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= N - 1; i++) {
    a[i] = i;
    sz[i] = 1;
  }
}

int root(int i) {
  while (a[i] != i) {
    a[i] = a[a[i]];
    i = a[i];
  }
  return i;
}

void merge(int x, int y) {
  int u = root(x);
  int v = root(y);
  if (sz[u] < sz[v]) {
    swap(u, v);
  }
  if (a[v] != a[u]) {
    a[v] = a[u];
    sz[u] += sz[v];
  }
}

int cnt[N];

int32_t main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  initialize();
  int v[n + 1];
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
  }
  string s[n + 1];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> s[i];
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      if (s[i][j] == '1') {
        int root_i = root_map.count(i + 1) ? root_map[i + 1] : root(i + 1);
        int root_j = root_map.count(j + 1) ? root_map[j + 1] : root(j + 1);
        if (root_i != root_j) {
          merge(i + 1, j + 1);
          root_map[j + 1] = root_map[i + 1] = root(i + 1);
        }
      }
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    v_e[root(i)].push_back(v[i]);
    push_heap(v_e[root(i)].begin(), v_e[root(i)].end(), greater<int>());
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cout << v_e[root(i)][0] << " ";
    pop_heap(v_e[root(i)].begin(), v_e[root(i)].end(), greater<int>());
    v_e[root(i)].pop_back();
  }
  cout << endl;
}
```

Please note that the efficiency of the optimized code still largely depends on the input, and the actual performance improvement may vary.
