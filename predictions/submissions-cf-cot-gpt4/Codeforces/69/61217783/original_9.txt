The program is already quite optimized, but we can make small improvements:

1. We can use fast input/output to reduce the time taken by cin and cout. This is done by using ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL). This will drastically reduce the input/output time, which is beneficial when dealing with large amounts of data.

2. We can reduce the scope of the variables x, y, and z by declaring them inside the loop. This will not improve the performance but is a good practice to restrict the scope of variables as much as possible. 

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int sum_x = 0, sum_y = 0, sum_z = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x, y, z;
    cin >> x >> y >> z;
    sum_x += x;
    sum_y += y;
    sum_z += z;
  }
  if (sum_x == 0 && sum_y == 0 && sum_z == 0) {
    cout << "YES";
  } else {
    cout << "NO";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the code optimization largely depends on the program and sometimes the compiler or the programming language itself optimizes the code. In this case, the original code was already quite optimized, so only a few minor improvements could be made.
