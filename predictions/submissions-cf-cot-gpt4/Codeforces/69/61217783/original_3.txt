The optimization for this program is pretty straightforward. However, we can do a slight optimization for the memory usage.

Here is the optimization step by step:

1. Instead of storing x, y, and z in separate variables for every iteration, you can directly add them to sum_x, sum_y, and sum_z. This way, we can save the usage of three integer variables.

The optimized program will look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int sum_x = 0, sum_y = 0, sum_z = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x, y, z;
    cin >> x >> y >> z;
    sum_x += x;
    sum_y += y;
    sum_z += z;
  }
  cout << ((sum_x == 0 && sum_y == 0 && sum_z == 0) ? "YES" : "NO");
  return 0;
}
```

By using a ternary operator instead of the if-else statement, we can make the code cleaner and more concise. However, it does not necessarily optimize the running time or memory usage.
