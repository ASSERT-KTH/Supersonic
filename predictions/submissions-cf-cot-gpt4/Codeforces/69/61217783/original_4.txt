The code you provided is already quite optimized, but there is still a small room for improvement. Here is the step-by-step optimization process:

1. The three integer variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are only used within the loop and do not need to be declared each time the loop runs. Declaring them outside the loop will save a little bit of time because the operation of creating and destroying these variables is not performed `n` times.

2. The `if` statement checks if `sum_x`, `sum_y`, and `sum_z` are all `0`. Since the program only outputs "YES" or "NO" based on the condition and then immediately returns, the `else` statement is not necessary. Simply `return` after outputting "YES" to terminate the program immediately.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, x, y, z;
  cin >> n;
  int sum_x = 0, sum_y = 0, sum_z = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> x >> y >> z;
    sum_x += x;
    sum_y += y;
    sum_z += z;
  }
  if (sum_x == 0 && sum_y == 0 && sum_z == 0) {
    cout << "YES";
    return 0;
  }
  cout << "NO";
  return 0;
}
```
This slightly optimized version of the program will perform marginally better, especially with large `n`, due to reduced variable creation and destruction operations. However, the difference in performance might not be noticeable in most cases as the original code was already quite efficient.
