The given code is already quite well optimized in terms of memory usage and runtime. The major time-consuming operations in this program are the I/O operations. C++ I/O operations are usually slower than C-style I/O operations. As such, we could replace the C++ style I/O operations with C-style ones to gain some performance. 

Also, we can optimize the code by directly printing the result without checking the conditions twice. We can use the ternary operator (?:) instead of using if-else. 

Here is your optimized code:

```c
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    int n, x, y, z;
    int sum_x = 0, sum_y = 0, sum_z = 0;

    scanf("%d", &n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d %d %d", &x, &y, &z);
        sum_x += x;
        sum_y += y;
        sum_z += z;
    }

    printf(sum_x == 0 && sum_y == 0 && sum_z == 0 ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
    
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that using C-style I/O in C++ is generally not recommended due to the lack of type safety and other features of C++ streams. The C-style I/O operations might be faster, but they are not as secure or robust. However, in a controlled environment where performance is of utmost importance, this might be a tradeoff you are willing to make.
