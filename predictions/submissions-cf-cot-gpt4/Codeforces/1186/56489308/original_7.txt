The given C++ program performs the following steps:

1. Reads a list of real numbers,
2. Counts how many of these numbers are integers,
3. Rounds the sum of the numbers towards the nearest integer,
4. Prints each number of the list rounded towards the nearest integer, increasing by one the rounding of the first non-integer numbers if the total sum has been rounded down.

The program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Avoid using the `floor()` function twice for the same number. Instead, store the result of the `floor()` function in a variable and use it later.
2. The vector `a` is only used to store the input numbers temporarily. However, each number is processed individually and does not depend on the other numbers. Therefore, the storage of the numbers in `a` is not necessary. Instead, process each number immediately after reading it. This way, the memory for storing `n` numbers can be saved.
3. The usage of `cerr` for debugging purpose should be removed for the final optimized version of the program.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pi;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.precision(20);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  double tol = 1.e-7;
  int ent = 0;
  double tot = 0.;
  double floor_value;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    double temp;
    cin >> temp;
    floor_value = floor(temp);
    if (abs(floor_value - temp) < tol) {
      ent++;
    }
    tot += floor_value;
  }
  ll rem = llround(tot);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    double temp;
    cin >> temp;
    floor_value = floor(temp);
    if (rem < 0 and abs(floor_value - temp) > tol) {
      cout << round(floor_value) + 1 << "\n";
      rem++;
    } else
      cout << round(floor_value) << "\n";
  }
}
```

Please note that the optimized program reads the input twice. If reading the input twice is not possible (e.g., if the input is a stream of data), then the numbers would have to be stored temporarily, which would require the usage of the vector `a` again.
