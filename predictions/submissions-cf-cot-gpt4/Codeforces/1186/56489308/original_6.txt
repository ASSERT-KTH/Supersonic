We can optimize this C++ program in several ways:

1. Remove the use of function `abs()`. The function `abs()` is called twice for each element in vector `a`, which is unnecessary. We can store the result of `floor(a[i])` in a separate variable and use it afterwards. This will reduce the time complexity.

2. Avoid `floor()` and `round()` function calls in the second loop. This is unnecessary since we have already called `floor()` in the first loop. We can store the results in another vector and use that in the second loop. This will reduce time complexity.

3. Avoid the use of `cerr` for debugging information. Using `cerr` slows down the program because it flushes the buffer after each insertion. Unless it's necessary to display debug information, we should avoid using `cerr`.

4. Avoid the use of `endl` in `cout`. `endl` flushes the buffer and slows down the program. We can use `"\n"` instead, which doesn't flush the buffer.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pi;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.precision(20);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<double> a(n);
  vector<ll> b(n);
  double tol = 1.e-7;
  int ent = 0;
  double tot = 0.;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    b[i] = floor(a[i]);
    if (abs(b[i] - a[i]) < tol) {
      ent++;
    }
    tot += b[i];
  }
  
  ll rem = llround(tot);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (rem < 0 and abs(b[i] - a[i]) > tol) {
      cout << b[i] + 1 << "\n";
      rem++;
    } else
      cout << b[i] << "\n";
  }
}
```
