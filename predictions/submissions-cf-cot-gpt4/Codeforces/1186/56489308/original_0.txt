The current code is already decently optimized, but here are some small changes that could be made to improve it slightly:

1. The `abs(floor(a[i]) - a[i])` operation is performed twice for each element of the array `a[]`. This can be expensive, so we should store the result in a temporary variable to avoid unnecessary computation. 
   
2. The `floor()` function is used multiple times, it could be replaced with type casting to `int` to improve performance. 

3. The vector `a[]` is taking double values but in the logic of program we are working mostly with integer part of the values, so we could change vector to `vector<int>` which would save memory.

4. The `ent` variable is declared and incremented but never used, so it can be removed.

5. The `cerr` logging isn't necessary for the program's logic, so it could be removed to improve performance.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pi;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.precision(20);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  double tol = 1.e-7;
  double tot = 0.;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    double val;
    cin >> val;
    a[i] = static_cast<int>(val);
    if (abs(a[i] - val) < tol) 
      tot += a[i];
    else 
      tot += a[i] + 1;
  }
  ll rem = llround(tot);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (rem < 0 && abs(a[i] - (double)i) > tol) {
      cout << a[i] + 1 << "\n";
      rem++;
    } else
      cout << a[i] << "\n";
  }
}
```

Please note that this optimization might not make a significant difference in running time or memory usage for small inputs, but for large inputs and repeated calls to this function, the savings could add up.
