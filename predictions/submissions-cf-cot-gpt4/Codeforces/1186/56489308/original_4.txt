The code you provided reads an array of floating point numbers, checks how many are almost integers (within a certain tolerance), sums the floor of all numbers, and finally prints the rounded floor of each number, with a special case where extra 1 is added if the sum of the floor of all numbers is negative.

Here are the steps for optimization:

1. Instead of storing all the numbers in a vector and iterating over it twice, we can process each number immediately as it comes in. This saves memory because we don't need to store the entire array, and it may save time because we don't need to go over the array twice.

2. We can remove the check for almost integer numbers because it does not affect the final result. It only increments the `ent` variable, which is not used anywhere in the program.

3. There's no need to round the floor of a number because floor function already returns the largest integer less than or equal to the number, which is an integer.

4. We can directly cast the result of the floor function to an integer instead of first rounding it to the nearest integer and then casting it to a long long integer.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.precision(20);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  double tol = 1.e-7;
  double tot = 0.;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    double num;
    cin >> num;
    tot += floor(num);
    if (tot < 0 and abs(floor(num) - num) > tol) {
      cout << int(floor(num)) + 1 << "\n";
      tot++;
    } else {
      cout << int(floor(num)) << "\n";
    }
  }
}
```
Please note that the optimization depends on the specific use case of the program. It is possible that in some cases the program requires to store all the numbers or to know how many of them are almost integers.
