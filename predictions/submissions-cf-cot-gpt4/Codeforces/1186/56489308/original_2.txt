The given code takes n inputs and checks if they are integers or not. If the number is not an integer, it rounds down the number and adds it to a total sum. It then prints out the floored number. If the total sum is less than 0, it rounds down and adds 1 to the non-integer numbers until the total sum becomes 0 or greater.

Here are the steps to optimize this code:

1. The 'cerr' output of 'rem' is not required and can be removed. This line is typically used for debugging purposes.
2. The 'floor' function is being called twice for the same value in the second loop. This can be avoided by storing the result of the 'floor' operation in a separate variable.
3. The 'round' function is being applied to 'floor', which is not necessary because 'floor' already returns an integer. 
4. The 'abs' function is being applied to the difference between 'floor(a[i])' and 'a[i]', which is always non-negative, hence 'abs' operation is unnecessary.
5. The 'and' keyword can be replaced with '&&' operator which will perform short-circuit evaluation, meaning the second condition won't be evaluated if the first one is false. This will save some time when 'rem' is not less than 0.

Now, let's optimize the code with the above steps.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.precision(20);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<double> a(n);
  double tol = 1.e-7;
  int ent = 0;
  double tot = 0.;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    if (floor(a[i]) - a[i] < tol) {
      ent++;
    }
    tot += floor(a[i]);
  }
  ll rem = llround(tot);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    double floored = floor(a[i]);
    if (rem < 0 && floored - a[i] > tol) {
      cout << floored + 1 << "\n";
      rem++;
    } else
      cout << floored << "\n";
  }
}
```

This optimized code avoids unnecessary computations and function calls, thereby making it more efficient in terms of runtime. Also, it uses the same amount of memory as the original code.
