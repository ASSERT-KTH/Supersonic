The given C/C++ program takes an integer 'n' as input and then reads 'n' floating-point numbers. It then calculates the total of the numbers after flooring them and checks if each number is an integer. If the total is negative, it adds 1 to the non-integer numbers until the total becomes non-negative, and then prints the numbers.

Here are a few suggestions to optimize the program:

1. We are using 'floor' and 'round' functions multiple times on the same value. This calculation can be done once and stored in another vector to be used later. This will save computation time.

2. The 'cerr' statement seems to be for debugging purposes and can be removed to save time during the execution.

Let's modify the code accordingly.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pi;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.precision(20);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<double> a(n);
  vector<ll> floored(n);
  double tol = 1.e-7;
  int ent = 0;
  double tot = 0.;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    floored[i] = floor(a[i]);
    if (abs(floored[i] - a[i]) < tol) {
      ent++;
    }
    tot += floored[i];
  }
  ll rem = llround(tot);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (rem < 0 and abs(floored[i] - a[i]) > tol) {
      cout << floored[i] + 1 << "\n";
      rem++;
    } else
      cout << floored[i] << "\n";
  }
}
```

In this optimized code, we calculate and store the floor of each number in the 'floored' vector. When we need to print the numbers, we use the 'floored' vector instead of calculating the floor of each number again. This saves computation time by reducing the number of calls to the 'floor' function. The 'cerr' statement has also been removed.
