The provided C++ program is already well-optimized. However, there are a few changes you can make to potentially improve the performance:

1. Remove unused variables: The 'ent' variable isn't used anywhere in the program after it's incremented. Removing it won't affect the functionality of the program.

2. Avoid calling the same function multiple times: Instead of calling 'floor(a[i])' two times in your loop, you can call it once and store the result in a variable.

3. Use '\n' instead of endl: '\n' is faster than 'endl' because 'endl' causes a flush operation, which can be costly. 

Here's the optimized version of the program following the steps mentioned above:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pi;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.precision(20);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<double> a(n);
  double tol = 1.e-7;
  double tot = 0.;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    double floor_value = floor(a[i]);
    if (abs(floor_value - a[i]) < tol) {
      tot += floor_value;
    }
  }
  ll rem = llround(tot);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    double floor_value = floor(a[i]);
    if (rem < 0 and abs(floor_value - a[i]) > tol) {
      cout << round(floor_value) + 1 << "\n";
      rem++;
    } else
      cout << round(floor_value) << "\n";
  }
}
```
Note: It's not recommended to use '#include <bits/stdc++.h>' in production code because it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can slow down the compilation time. It's better to include only the headers you actually need. Also, 'using namespace std;' is considered bad practice because it can lead to name conflicts.
