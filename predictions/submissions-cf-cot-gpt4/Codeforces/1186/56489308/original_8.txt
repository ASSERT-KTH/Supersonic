The optimization steps are as follows:

1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes more libraries than necessary, which can slow down the compile time. It is also not portable across different platforms. Instead, include only necessary libraries.

2. Remove `using namespace std;` to avoid namespace pollution.

3. The `vector` of doubles `a` is only being used to store the input temporarily for checking if it is an integer and summing. We can avoid the usage of this vector and perform the operations directly upon receiving the input. This saves memory.

4. The `floor` function is being used multiple times on the same variable which leads to redundant computations. We can store the floor value in a variable and reuse it.

5. The `cerr` stream is used for error output and it's unbuffered, which means it could slow down your program if you output a lot of data. We can remove its usage if not required.

6. `round` function is not necessary since we have already used `floor` which rounds down the floating point number.

Let's see how these modifications look in the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

typedef long long ll;
typedef std::pair<int, int> pi;

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.precision(20);

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  double tol = 1.e-7;
  int ent = 0;
  double tot = 0.;
  
  ll rem;
  double val;
  double floor_val;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> val;
    floor_val = std::floor(val);
    
    if (std::abs(floor_val - val) < tol) {
      ent++;
    }
    
    tot += floor_val;
    
    if (i == n - 1) {
      rem = llround(tot);
    }
    
    if (rem < 0 && std::abs(floor_val - val) > tol) {
      std::cout << floor_val + 1 << "\n";
      rem++;
    } else {
      std::cout << floor_val << "\n";
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program uses less memory by avoiding the unnecessary vector and performs fewer computations by reusing the result of `floor` function. It also removes unnecessary usage of `cerr` and `round` function.
