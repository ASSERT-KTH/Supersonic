Optimization Steps:

1. We can cut out the usage of `std::vector<double> a(n)`. Instead of storing all the values in a vector, we can process them as we read them. This will reduce memory usage.

2. The `floor` function is being called multiple times on the same value, which is inefficient. We can store the result of `floor(a[i])` in a variable and use that instead.

3. We're calling `round` on the result of `floor`, which is unnecessary because `floor` already returns an integral value.

4. We are using `cerr` for printing debugging information. If we don't need it, we can remove it.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdint>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  double tol = 1.e-7;
  double tot = 0.;
  ll rem;
  int ent = 0;
  double val, floored_val;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> val;
    floored_val = floor(val);
    if (abs(floored_val - val) < tol) {
      ent++;
    }
    tot += floored_val;
  }

  rem = llround(tot);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> val;
    floored_val = floor(val);
    if (rem < 0 and abs(floored_val - val) > tol) {
      cout << floored_val + 1 << "\n";
      rem++;
    } else
      cout << floored_val << "\n";
  }
}
```

This version of the program uses less memory because it doesn't store all the input values in a vector. It also runs faster because it avoids unnecessary function calls and computations.
