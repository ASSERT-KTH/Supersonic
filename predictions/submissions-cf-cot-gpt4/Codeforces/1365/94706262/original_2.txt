The given C++ program appears to be using Depth-First Search (DFS) to navigate through a given maze. The program is already quite efficient, but there are a couple of minor tweaks that can be made to improve its performance.

Optimization Steps:

1. As the program is using depth-first search, it has a risk of stack overflow for large inputs. This is due to the recursive nature of DFS. To overcome this, we can use an iterative approach with a stack data structure.

2. We can reduce the size of the maze and visited array. The maximum size of the maze is 51x51, but we can dynamically allocate these arrays based on the input size n and m.

3. As the logic in the block function is quite similar for each direction, we can use a loop with an array of direction vectors to simplify the code and make it more readable.

4. Instead of checking if the current cell is 'B' or 'G' in the main function, we can do it within the dfs function. This can reduce the time complexity of the program.

5. The boolean variable flag is used to break from the nested loop. Instead of using a flag, we can return from the function directly when we find that block(i, j) is false.

Given these steps, it's important to note that these optimizations might not significantly improve the runtime or memory usage due to the already efficient nature of the original program.

Here is the optimized version of the program:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string.h>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;
int t, n, m, G;
char **maze;
bool **visited;
int dir[4][2] = {{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};

bool block(int r, int c) {
  for(int i=0; i<4; i++){
    int nr = r + dir[i][0];
    int nc = c + dir[i][1];
    if(nr>0 && nr<=n && nc>0 && nc<=m){
      if (maze[nr][nc] == 'G' || (nr==n && nc==m && G > 0)) return false;
      if (maze[nr][nc] == '.') maze[nr][nc] = '#';
    }
  }
  return true;
}

void dfs(int r, int c) {
  stack<pair<int, int>> s;
  s.push({r, c});
  while (!s.empty()) {
    pair<int, int> p = s.top();
    s.pop();
    int x = p.first, y = p.second;
    if (x <= 0 || y <= 0 || x > n || y > m || maze[x][y] == '#' || visited[x][y]) continue;
    visited[x][y] = true;
    if (maze[x][y] == 'G') G--;
    for(int i=0; i<4; i++) s.push({x + dir[i][0], y + dir[i][1]});
  }
}

int main() {
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n >> m;
    G = 0;
    maze = new char*[n+1];
    visited = new bool*[n+1];
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
      maze[i] = new char[m+1];
      visited[i] = new bool[m+1];
      memset(visited[i], 0, (m+1)*sizeof(bool));
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) 
      for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) cin >> maze[i][j]; 
      
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
      for(int j=1; j<=m; j++){
        if(maze[i][j] == 'B' && !block(i, j)){
          cout << "No\n";
          goto end;
        }
        if(maze[i][j] == 'G') G++;
      }
    }
    dfs(n, m);
    cout << (G == 0 ? "Yes\n" : "No\n");
    end:
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
      delete[] maze[i];
      delete[] visited[i];
    }
    delete[] maze;
    delete[] visited;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that drastic changes might make the code harder to understand and maintain. It's always a good practice to keep a balance between code optimization and code readability.
