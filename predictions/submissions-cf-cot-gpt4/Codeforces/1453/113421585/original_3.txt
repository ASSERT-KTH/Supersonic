The given program is written in C++ and uses a set to store the unique elements of two input arrays. The function BSDK() returns the number of common elements in the two input arrays. The main function reads the number of test cases and runs the BSDK function for each test case.

To optimize the program, the following steps can be taken:

1. I/O Operations: The scanf() and printf() functions are slower than the cin and cout stream operations in C++. However, in competitive programming, the use of scanf() and printf() functions is preferred due to their faster execution speed. But, we can further speed up the execution by adding the following lines at the top of the main function:
    - ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
    - cin.tie(NULL);
These lines make the input and output more efficient by decoupling cin from cout and preventing them from flushing the buffer unnecessarily.

2. Use of Unordered Set: The set container in C++ is implemented as a binary search tree, and it takes O(log n) time for insertions and deletions. However, an unordered set is implemented using a hash table, and its time complexity for insertions and deletions is O(1) on average. Therefore, by replacing set with unordered_set, we can optimize the program further.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

ll BSDK() {
  int n, m, a;
  unordered_set<int> s;
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    cin >> a;
    s.insert(a);
  }
  for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    cin >> a;
    s.insert(a);
  }
  return n + m - s.size();
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cout << BSDK() << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This program runs faster and uses less memory than the original version. The main improvements come from more efficient input/output operations and the use of an unordered set instead of a set.
