This program is already quite efficient, but there are two potential improvements we could make:

1. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(NULL);` to unbind `cin` and `cout` and thus speed up I/O operations.

2. Instead of using `scanf` and `printf`, switch to `std::cin` and `std::cout`. This is because `scanf` and `printf` are slower than their C++ equivalents. This is due to C++ iostreams having the advantage of type safety and extensibility.

Here's the optimized version:

```cpp
typedef long long ll;
#define INF 1000000000
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
using namespace std;
ll BSDK() {
  int n, j, m, a;
  set<int> s;
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    cin >> a;
    s.insert(a);
  }
  for (j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    cin >> a;
    s.insert(a);
  }
  return n + m - s.size();
}
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t, i;
  cin >> t;
  for (i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    cout << BSDK() << "\n";
  }
}
```
This modification results in slightly faster I/O operations, which could make a difference in a program that performs a large number of them. However, the overall algorithmic complexity remains the same.
