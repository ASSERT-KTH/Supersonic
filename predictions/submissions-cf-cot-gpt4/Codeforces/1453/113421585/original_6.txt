The given C/C++ program reads from standard input a number of test cases (t), and for each test case, two sequences of numbers. The program reads the numbers from both sequences and stores them in a set (which automatically removes duplicates), then it calculates and prints the number of duplicate numbers between the two sequences.

The optimization steps:

1. The use of scanf and printf in C++ is not recommended since these functions are slower than their C++ counterparts (cin and cout). Replacing scanf and printf with cin and cout will not only make the code more C++ idiomatic but will also slightly optimize the running time.

2. Instead of inserting all elements into the set then counting the number of duplicates, we can check if an element is already in the set before inserting it. This way, we can save the overhead of inserting a duplicate element into the set and we can calculate the number of duplicates on the fly. This optimization will decrease the running time and the memory usage.

Optimized program:

```cpp
typedef long long ll;
#define INF 1000000000
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

ll BSDK() {
  int n, m, a, duplicates = 0;
  set<int> s;
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    cin >> a;
    if (!s.insert(a).second) // insert returns a pair, the second element is false if the element is already in the set
      duplicates++;
  }
  for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    cin >> a;
    if (!s.insert(a).second)
      duplicates++;
  }
  return duplicates;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cout << BSDK() << '\n';
  }
}
```
