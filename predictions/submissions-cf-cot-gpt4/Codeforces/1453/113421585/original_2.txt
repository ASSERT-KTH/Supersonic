The given program is reading two different sets of integers and storing them in a set data structure. Then it calculates and returns the number of duplicate elements between these two sets.

The main optimization potential in this program is to avoid inserting the second set of integers into the set, if they are already present in the set. This will save us memory and also reduce the time complexity of the program from O(n+m) to O(n+m/2) in the best-case scenario (when all elements of the second set are already present in the first set).

We can achieve this by checking if an element is already in the set before inserting it. If it is already in the set, we do not insert it again. This can be done using the count function of the set class in C++. The count function returns 1 if the element is in the set and 0 otherwise.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
typedef long long ll;
#define INF 1000000000
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
using namespace std;
ll BSDK() {
  int n, j, m, a;
  set<int> s;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    scanf("%d", &a);
    s.insert(a);
  }
  for (j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    scanf("%d", &a);
    if (s.count(a) == 0) {
      s.insert(a);
    }
  }
  return n + m - s.size();
}
int main() {
  int t, i;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  for (i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    printf("%lld\n", BSDK());
  }
}
```
