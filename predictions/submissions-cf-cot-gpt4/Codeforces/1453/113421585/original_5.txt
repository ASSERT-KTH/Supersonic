This program finds the number of overlapping elements in two sequences of integers. The number of elements in each sequence is provided as input. It uses a set to store the elements of both sequences, as set in C++ does not allow duplicate elements. Therefore, the size of the set after inserting all elements will be less than the sum of the numbers of elements in both sequences if there are overlapping elements. The number of overlapping elements is then calculated by subtracting the size of the set from the sum of the numbers of elements in both sequences.

We can make a few optimizations to this program:

1. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` at the beginning of the main() function to speed up the I/O operations.

2. Avoid using `scanf` and `printf`, instead, use `cin` and `cout`. They are slightly slower than `scanf` and `printf`, but they are safer and more C++ friendly. The difference in speed can be negligible when we use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`.

3. Use `unordered_set` instead of `set`. `unordered_set` has an average time complexity of O(1) for insert and find operations, while `set` has O(log n). Although `unordered_set` may use more memory, it is more efficient in terms of time complexity.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

ll BSDK() {
  int n, j, m, a;
  unordered_set<int> s;
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    cin >> a;
    s.insert(a);
  }
  for (j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    cin >> a;
    s.insert(a);
  }
  return n + m - s.size();
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int t, i;
  cin >> t;
  for (i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    cout << BSDK() << "\n";
  }
}
```

These changes should speed up the program and reduce its memory usage.
