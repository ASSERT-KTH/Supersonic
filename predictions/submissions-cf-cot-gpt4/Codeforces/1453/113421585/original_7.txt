The program calculates the number of duplicate elements from the two sets of input. It uses a set data structure to remove duplicates, which is inefficient as it requires the program to iterate over each element of the set. 

The optimization can be achieved by:

1. Using unordered_set instead of set: Unordered_set has an average time complexity of O(1) for insert and find operations compared to O(log n) for set. This would speed up the program significantly when dealing with large inputs.

2. Using fast input/output methods: The scanf and printf functions are slower compared to cin and cout. But cin and cout can be made faster by using the ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) function and cin.tie(NULL). This speeds up the input/output operations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
typedef long long ll;
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

ll BSDK() {
  int n, j, m, a;
  unordered_set<int> s;
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    cin >> a;
    s.insert(a);
  }
  for (j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    cin >> a;
    s.insert(a);
  }
  return n + m - s.size();
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while(t--) {
    cout << BSDK() << "\n";
  }
}
```

This optimized program uses an unordered_set to increase the speed of insert and find operations, and uses fast input/output methods to speed up the program. It should run faster and use less memory than the original program.
