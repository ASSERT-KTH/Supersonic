The given program is written in C++ and its main function is to find the number of duplicate elements in two different arrays. The optimization can be done by reducing the number of insert operations in the set data structure. 

In the original code, all elements of the two arrays are inserted into the set. This can be expensive in terms of time complexity as the worst-case time complexity of set insertion in C++ STL is O(Logn). 

Optimization can be done by only inserting elements from the smaller array into the set, and then checking for the presence of elements of the larger array in the set. This will reduce the number of insert operations thereby optimizing the running time. 

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

ll BSDK() {
  int n, m, a;
  set<int> s;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  int min_size = min(n, m);
  int max_size = max(n, m);

  for (int j = 0; j < min_size; j++) {
    scanf("%d", &a);
    s.insert(a);
  }

  int duplicates = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j < max_size; j++) {
    scanf("%d", &a);
    if (s.count(a)) duplicates++;
  }

  return duplicates;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    printf("%lld\n", BSDK());
  }
}
```
In the optimized code, we first calculate the minimum and maximum of 'n' and 'm'. Then, we only insert elements from the smaller array into the set. For the larger array, we check if each of its elements is present in the set. If it is, we increment the 'duplicates' counter. The function then returns this counter.

This optimized code has a lower time complexity than the original one as it reduces the number of set insertion operations. The memory usage is also optimized as we are storing less elements in the set data structure.
