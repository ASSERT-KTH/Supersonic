The given C/C++ program is performing a set operation to find the number of duplicate elements from two different input arrays. The code can be optimized by reducing the number of insert operations on the set data structure. Each insert operation on a set in C++ takes O(log n) time, so if we can reduce the number of insert operations, we may be able to make the program faster.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Instead of inserting elements from both arrays into the set one by one, we can first insert all elements from the first array, then for the second array, we first check if the element is already in the set. If it is not, we add it to the set and increment a counter. The counter will represent the number of unique elements in the second array.

2. We use `fast i/o` methods to reduce the time consumed by `cin` and `cout` operations. We do this by adding `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` at the beginning of `main()` function.

3. We can also avoid using `printf` and `scanf` for `i/o` operations and use `cin` and `cout` which are more C++ idiomatic.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
typedef long long ll;
#define INF 1000000000
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
using namespace std;
ll BSDK() {
  int n, j, m, a, unique = 0;
  set<int> s;
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    cin >> a;
    s.insert(a);
  }
  for (j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    cin >> a;
    if (s.find(a) == s.end()) {
      s.insert(a);
      unique++;
    }
  }
  return n + m - n - unique;
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t, i;
  cin >> t;
  for (i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    cout << BSDK() << "\n";
  }
}
```
This optimized program should run faster than the original one due to the reduction in the number of insert operations on the set and the use of fast `i/o` methods.
