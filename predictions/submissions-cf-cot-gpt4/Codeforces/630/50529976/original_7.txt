Optimizations:

1. The include directive `<bits/stdc++.h>` includes a lot of libraries, which could slow down the program's compilation time. Specific libraries needed for the program should be included instead.

2. The `#define` directive is used to define constants and macros in the C language. This can lead to unwanted side-effects if not used carefully and can make the code hard to understand and debug. Instead, we will use `const` for constants and inline functions for macros.

3. The for-loop iterating from `1` to `2 * n - 2 - n + 1` can be simplified to `1` to `n`.

4. The calculation of `temp` is the same within the loop except for a single multiplication factor. This calculation can be moved out of the loop and the factor can be applied inside the loop.

5. The usage of `LL temp = 1;` before every calculation is repetitive and can be avoided by resetting the value at the end of the loop.

6. IO functions are not used in the code, so they can be removed.

7. The main function is not using any exception handling or any performance affecting codes that can be optimized.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

const int M = 200010;
const long long int mod = 1000000000 + 7;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    long long int ans = 0;
    long long int temp = 1;

    // Calculate power of 4
    for(int i = 0 ; i < 2*n-2-n-2 ; ++i){
        temp *= 4;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (i == 1 || i == n) {
            ans += temp * 3 * 4;
        } else {
            ans += temp * 9 * 4;
        }
    }
    cout << ans << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```
Note: This code assumes that the input and output operations are not a part of the performance optimization requirement as the question asked specifically for optimizing the given code and not the IO operations.
