The code has multiple issues that can be optimized for performance and readability:

1. **Unnecessary Macros and Functions**: The code contains a lot of macros and functions which are not used at all. Removing these will make the code cleaner and slightly faster due to less preprocessing time.

2. **Complex Condition in For Loop**: The for loop's condition is unnecessarily complex. The condition `2 * n - 2 - n + 1` can be simplified to `n+1`.

3. **Repeated Computations**: There are repeated computations that could be stored in a variable for reuse. For example, `(2 * n - 2 - n - 1)` and `(2 * n - 2 - n - 2)` are computed every time in the loop. These can be calculated once and reused.

4. **Repeated Multiplication**: The multiplication inside the while loop can be replaced by a power function, which will be faster.

5. **Inefficient IO**: Using printf and scanf can be faster than using cin and cout in some cases. However, in this case, the IO operations are not a bottleneck, so we can still use cin and cout for readability.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

typedef long long LL;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  LL ans = 0;
  int z1 = 2 * n - 2 - n - 1;
  int z2 = 2 * n - 2 - n - 2;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n+1; i++) {
    if (i == 1 || i == (n+1)) {
      LL temp = pow(4, z1) * 3 * 4;
      ans += temp;
    } else {
      LL temp = pow(4, z2) * 9 * 4;
      ans += temp;
    }
  }
  
  cout << ans << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code is more readable, has less unnecessary computations and functions, and uses more efficient operations.
