The given C++ program has the potential for optimization in a couple of areas:

1. The calculation of 'z' and 'temp' have identical components in each iteration of the loop. This could be optimized by calculating the similar parts before entering the loop.

2. The calculation of 'temp' involves repeated multiplication in a loop which can be replaced by a single pow() function call.

3. The use of 'bits/stdc++.h' is discouraged as it is a heavy header file that includes a lot of unnecessary stuff, which can slow down the compile time. It is better to include only those header files which are actually required.

4. The use of 'using namespace std' is generally discouraged as it can lead to naming conflicts.

5. The macro 'LL' is defined but the keyword 'long long' is used in the program. It is better to use the macro consistently.

6. The program uses 'printf' and 'scanf' for I/O operations, which are slower than their C++ counterparts 'cin' and 'cout'. It would be better to use 'cin' and 'cout' for faster I/O.

Below is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

#define LL long long
#define inf 1000000000
#define mod 1000000000 + 7

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  LL ans = 0;
  LL temp;
  int z = 2 * n - 2 - n - 1;
  int z_inner = 2 * n - 2 - n - 2;
  LL pow1 = pow(4, z);
  LL pow2 = pow(4, z_inner);
  for (int i = 1; i <= 2 * n - 2 - n + 1; i++) {
    if (i == 1 || i == (2 * n - 2 - n + 1)) {
      temp = pow1 * 3 * 4;
      ans += temp;
    } else {
      temp = pow2 * 9 * 4;
      ans += temp;
    }
  }
  std::cout << ans << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
Here, we have replaced 'printf' and 'scanf' with 'cout' and 'cin' respectively, calculated 'z', 'temp' and their powers before the loop, and removed the unnecessary header files for optimization.
