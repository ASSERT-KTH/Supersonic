This program has a few areas that could be optimized:

1. The calculation of the expression `2 * n - 2 - n - 1` and `2 * n - 2 - n - 2` are repeated several times in the program, these can be calculated once and stored in a variable to reduce computation time.

2. The multiplication of the `temp` variable by 4 and the multiplication by 9 or 3 can be optimized. It's more efficient to use bit shifting for multiplication or division by powers of 2.

3. Pre-calculating the powers of 4 could also speed up the loop as it reduces the number of iterations.

4. The I/O operations can be optimized by using `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout`.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define LL long long int

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  LL ans = 0;

  int upperLimit = (2 * n - 2 - n + 1);
  int z1 = (2 * n - 2 - n - 1);
  int z2 = (2 * n - 2 - n - 2);
  
  LL pow4_z1 = 1LL << (2 * z1);
  LL pow4_z2 = 1LL << (2 * z2);

  for (int i = 1; i <= upperLimit; i++) {
    if (i == 1 || i == upperLimit) {
      LL temp = pow4_z1;
      temp <<= 2; // Multiply by 4
      temp *= 3;
      ans += temp;
    } else {
      LL temp = pow4_z2;
      temp <<= 2; // Multiply by 4
      temp *= 9;
      ans += temp;
    }
  }
  printf("%lld\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces the number of calculations and iterations. It also improves I/O operations by using `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout`.
