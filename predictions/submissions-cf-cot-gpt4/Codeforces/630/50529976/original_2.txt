Step 1: Avoid using #include<bits/stdc++.h>. It includes a lot of unnecessary libraries. Instead, include only necessary libraries like #include<iostream> and #include<cmath>.

Step 2: Unused macros and functions can be removed from the code to make it cleaner and easier to understand. Macros like ALL, LB, IO, DCOMP, CHECK, ON, OFF, CNT, RIGHT, I,OUT, O, error and functions like err are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 3: The main calculation inside the for loop can be simplified. The expression 2 * n - 2 - n + 1 simplifies to n - 1 and 2 * n - 2 - n - 1 simplifies to n - 3. Similarly, the expression 2 * n - 2 - n - 2 simplifies to n - 2. So, the expressions inside the for loop can be reduced to simpler forms.

Step 4: Also, we can see that the temp variable is being multiplied with the same value multiple times. This multiplication operation can be replaced with the pow function, which is more efficient.

Now I will generate the optimized code.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#define LL long long int

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  LL ans = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; i++) {
    LL temp = 1;
    if (i == 1 || i == (n - 1)) {
      temp = 3 * 4 * pow(4, n - 3);
      ans += temp;
    } else {
      temp = 9 * 4 * pow(4, n - 2);
      ans += temp;
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized code, the unnecessary macros and functions are removed, and the main calculation is simplified. This code is more efficient in terms of memory and time complexity.
