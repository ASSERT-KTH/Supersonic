This program has several calculations that can be optimized to reduce both running time and memory usage. 

Optimization Steps:

1. Unnecessary inclusions, macros and definitions: The program includes many libraries, macros, and definitions that are not used. Cleaning up these lines will make the program much cleaner and slightly increase the speed, as the preprocessor will have fewer lines to process.

2. Redundant calculations: The program has redundant calculations that are performed in each loop, which can be pre-calculated outside the loop to speed up the code execution.

3. Using pow() function: The pow() function can be used instead of loop for calculating power which will reduce the running time.

4. Simplifying expressions: The expression 2*n - 2 - n can be simplified to n - 2. This simplification can make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

5. Magic numbers: The magic numbers in the code such as 1, 4, 9, etc should be replaced with meaningful constant names to improve the code readability.

Now let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cmath>
#define LL long long int

const int M = 200010;
const int FOUR = 4;
const int NINE = 9;

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  LL ans = 0;
  int loopCount = n - 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= loopCount; i++) {
    LL temp = 1;
    if (i == 1 || i == loopCount) {
      temp = FOUR * pow(FOUR, n - 3) * NINE;
    } else {
      temp = FOUR * pow(FOUR, n - 4) * NINE * NINE;
    }
    ans += temp;
  }
  printf("%lld\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program should execute faster and use less memory compared to the original version. The pow() function is a more efficient way to perform power calculations, and simplifying the calculations also makes the program easier to understand. Removing the unused libraries, macros, and definitions helps to clean up the code and makes it more readable.
