The given program calculates and outputs a value based on an input `n`. It uses a loop to perform computations and finally outputs the result.

One way to optimize the program is to avoid the use of the while loop which is used to calculate power of 4. We can use the pow function from the math library. This will reduce the program's running time. The pow function is efficient to calculate the power of a number.

Another way to optimize the program is to calculate the value of `2 * n - 2 - n + 1` and `2 * n - 2 - n - 2` just once and store it in a variable. Currently, these values are calculated multiple times in the program. By reducing the number of calculations, we can optimize the program for running time.

Here's the optimized program:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

// Removed unused macros and functions

const int M = 200010;
int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  LL ans = 0;
  int loop_limit = 2 * n - 2 - n + 1;
  int z1 = 2 * n - 2 - n - 1;
  int z2 = 2 * n - 2 - n - 2;
  for (int i = 1; i <= loop_limit; i++) {
    if (i == 1 || i == loop_limit) {
      LL temp = pow(4, z1) * 3 * 4;
      ans += temp;
    } else {
      LL temp = pow(4, z2) * 9 * 4;
      ans += temp;
    }
  }
  printf("%I64d\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this optimization assumes that the value of `n` will not be large enough to cause an integer overflow or precision loss in the pow function. If `n` can be very large, then the pow function might not be suitable, and an alternative method for exponentiation would need to be used.
