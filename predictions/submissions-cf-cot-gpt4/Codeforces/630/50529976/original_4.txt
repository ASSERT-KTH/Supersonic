Your program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. In your program, you used some macros and functions which are not required for this program. So, we can remove them.
2. In the main function, you are calculating `2 * n - 2 - n + 1` two times which can be calculated only once and stored in a variable.
3. The `temp` variable is updated in a similar way in both the `if` and `else` blocks. You can factor out the common operations to avoid duplicating code.
4. You can use `pow` function instead of `while` loop to calculate power of 4 in a more efficient way.
5. You are using a macro `O` to print the output to the console which is not necessary. We can use standard `cout` statement to print the output.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

typedef long long LL;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    LL ans = 0;
    int range = 2 * n - 2 - n + 1;

    for (int i = 1; i <= range; i++) {
        LL temp = 1;
        int z;
        if (i == 1 || i == range) {
            z = 2 * n - 2 - n - 1;
            temp *= 3;
        } else {
            z = 2 * n - 2 - n - 2;
            temp *= 9;
        }
        temp *= pow(4,z+2);
        ans += temp;
    }
    cout<<ans<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```
The optimization here is about reducing redundant calculation, reducing code duplication and removing redundant code. By reducing the redundant calculation of `2 * n - 2 - n + 1`, the program becomes more efficient. By factoring out the common operations in the `if` and `else` blocks, the code becomes more concise and maintainable. By using `pow` function instead of `while` loop to calculate power of 4, the program runs faster. By removing unnecessary macros and functions, the program becomes cleaner and easier to understand.
