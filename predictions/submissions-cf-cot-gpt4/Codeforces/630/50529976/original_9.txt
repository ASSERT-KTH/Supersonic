The given program could be optimized in several ways:

1. Simplify Calculations and Redundant Operations: There are several complex operations in the for loop that can be simplified. Also, there are redundant operations that are repeated in each iteration of the for loop which can be evaluated once and stored for later use.

2. IO Operations: The `printf` and `scanf` functions are slower than `cin` and `cout` in C++. Since we are already using C++, we can replace these functions with `cin` and `cout`.

Let's optimize the program accordingly:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

typedef long long int LL;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  LL ans = 0;
  LL base = 1;
  LL fourPow = 1;

  for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n - 2 - n; ++i)
    fourPow *= 4;

  for (int i = 1; i <= 2 * n - 2 - n + 1; i++) {
    if (i == 1 || i == (2 * n - 2 - n + 1)) {
      base = fourPow * 4 * 3 * 4;
    } else {
      base = fourPow * 4 * 9 * 4;
    }
    ans += base;
  }
  
  cout << ans << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, I've calculated the power of 4 outside of the loop so that it doesn't have to be calculated for every iteration of the loop. I have also simplified the operations inside the loop by using a variable `base` to store the common calculation for each iteration. Lastly, I've replaced `printf` and `scanf` with `cout` and `cin` for faster IO operations.
