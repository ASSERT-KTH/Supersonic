This program involves many unnecessary or unused libraries, macros and definitions, which in turn cost memory and runtime. Also, the code readability is not good due to excessive use of macros. 

The following optimizations can be done:

1. Remove Unnecessary Libraries: Libraries such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` are not necessary for the logic of the current program. The `<bits/stdc++.h>` library is very large and including it can significantly slow down the compilation time. The other library `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` is not used in the program at all. Hence, these can be removed.

2. Remove Unused Macros and Definitions: The program defines many macros and types that are not used in the logic of the program. Removing these will improve readability and maintainability of the program.

3. Use Standard Integer Types: The typedefs `int` and `ll` for `long long` can be confusing and are not necessary. It's better to use the standard types directly.

4. Use Standard Constants: The constant `PI` is defined but not used in the program. The constant for `mod` and `hell` are same. We can remove `PI` and keep only one of `mod` or `hell`.

5. Remove Unnecessary Binary Search: The code performs a binary search for each value in a range around `s`. But it's not necessary. Instead, we can create a set from the vector `a`, and then simply check for each value's existence in the set. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n log n) to O(n).

6. Remove global IOS macro: The IOS macro is used for faster I/O operations. But it's globally defined and used only in the main function. It's better to move it to main function.

Let's apply these optimizations to the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const long long mod = 1000000007;

long long solve() {
  long long n, s, k;
  cin >> n >> s >> k;
  vector<long long> a(k);
  for (long long i = 0; i < k; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  long long cnt = INT_MAX;
  set<long long> st(a.begin(), a.end());
  for (long long i = max(1LL, s - 1010); i <= min(n, s + 1010); i++) {
    if (st.find(i) == st.end())
      cnt = min(cnt, abs(s - i));
  }
  cout << cnt;
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  long long t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
    cout << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code is more readable, maintainable, and efficient in terms of memory usage and running time.
