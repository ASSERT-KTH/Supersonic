The given program is a competitive programming type code, hence it has been written in a way to take advantage of certain compiler features and to reduce typing. However, this might not be the most efficient way to write the code. Here are some optimization steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary includes and usings: `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a convenience include which includes almost all standard library headers. This might increase the compile time. Also `using namespace std;` and `using namespace __gnu_pbds;` can create name clashes. It's better to use the specific class names.

2. Limit the scope of variables: The variable `i` is declared as `int` which is actually a `long long` in this case. It is better to limit the scope of the variable to the loop where it is used.

3. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(nullptr)` only if you are mixing `cin/cout` with `scanf/printf`. As you are only using `cin/cout`, you can remove these lines.

4. Use `std::` prefix for stl functions. This can prevent name clashes and make the code clearer.

5. Remove unnecessary macro definitions. Macros like `rep`, `tolower`, `toupper` etc. are not used in the code. Removing them can make the code cleaner.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

typedef long long ll;
typedef std::vector<ll> vi;

const ll mod = 1000000007;

ll solve() {
  ll n, s, k;
  std::cin >> n >> s >> k;
  vi a(k);
  for (ll i = 0; i < k; i++) std::cin >> a[i];
  ll cnt = INT_MAX;
  std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  for (ll i = s - 1010; i <= s + 1010; i++) {
    if (i > 0 and i <= n)
      if (std::binary_search(a.begin(), a.end(), i) == false)
        cnt = std::min(cnt, std::abs(s - i));
  }
  std::cout << cnt;
  return 0;
}

int main() {
#ifdef _DEBUG
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int t = 1;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
    std::cout << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the code is cleaner, more straightforward and more efficient. It should also compile faster and use less memory.
