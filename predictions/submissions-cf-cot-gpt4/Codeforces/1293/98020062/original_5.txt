The given C++ program seems to be quite optimized already. However, there are still a few minor improvements that can be made:

1. It's better to only include the necessary headers. This program includes the entire C++ Standard Template Library (STL) with `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, which can slow down compile time. It's recommended to replace it with only the specific headers needed for the program.

2. The program defines constants `hell` and `mod` with the same value `1000000007`. If they are used for the same purpose, one of them can be removed to reduce redundancy.

3. Instead of calling `binary_search` for each `i` in the range `s-1010` to `s+1010`, a set can be used to store the elements in `a`. This is because `std::set` is implemented as a binary search tree and lookups are performed in `O(log n)` time, while `std::binary_search` performs a binary search every time it's called, taking `O(log n)` time as well.

4. The `tolower` and `toupper` macros are defined but not used. These can be removed.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <cmath>
#include <limits>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define ll long long
#define ld long double
#define pb push_back
#define all(a) (a).begin(), (a).end()
#define F first
#define S second
#define sz(x) (ll) x.size()
#define endl '\n'
#define rep(i, a, b) for (ll i = a; i < b; i++)
#define IOS ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);
#define PI 3.141592653589793238462643
const ll mod = 1000000007;
ll solve() {
  ll n, s, k;
  cin >> n >> s >> k;
  vector<ll> a(k);
  set<ll> a_set;
  rep(i, 0, k) {
    cin >> a[i];
    a_set.insert(a[i]);
  }
  ll cnt = numeric_limits<ll>::max();
  for (int i = max(1ll, s - 1010); i <= min(n, s + 1010); i++) {
    if (a_set.find(i) == a_set.end())
      cnt = min(cnt, abs(s - i));
  }
  cout << cnt;
  return 0;
}
signed main() {
  IOS
#ifdef _DEBUG
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
    cout << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The changes made here should help to improve both the runtime speed and the memory usage of the program, without altering its functionality.
