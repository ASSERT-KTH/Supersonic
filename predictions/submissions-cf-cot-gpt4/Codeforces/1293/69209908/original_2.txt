This program seems to be about calculating distances. To optimize this code, there are a few things we can do:

1. Avoid frequent dynamic memory allocation: The code is using vector's `push_back()` method which may cause frequent dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. We can improve this by reserving memory to the vector if we know the approximate size of it beforehand.

2. Minimize use of expensive functions: Functions like `abs()` and `dist()` are called multiple times. We can minimize this by storing the result of these functions in variables and using them later.

3. Avoid unnecessary calculations: In the for loop, `dist(arr[j], arr[j + 1])` is calculated twice, once before the `if` condition and once inside the `if` block. We can calculate it once, store it in a variable and use it later.

4. Use prefix sum technique: In the for loop, the distance is calculated in a cumulative way. We can use prefix sum technique to store the cumulative distance in another vector which will reduce the number of times the `dist()` function is called.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define FAST ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0); srand(time(NULL));
#define ll long long
#define pb push_back
#define ff first
#define ss second
using namespace std;
ll xx, yy, ax, bx, ay, by, xs, ys, t;
ll dist(pair<ll, ll> a, pair<ll, ll> b) {
  return abs(a.ff - b.ff) + abs(a.ss - b.ss);
}
pair<ll, ll> next(pair<ll, ll> temp) {
  return make_pair(ax * temp.ff + bx, ay * temp.ss + by);
}
int main() {
  FAST;
  cin >> xx >> yy >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by >> xs >> ys >> t;
  pair<ll, ll> temp, tx;
  vector<pair<ll, ll>> arr;
  arr.reserve(100); // reserve memory
  ll vs = 0;
  temp = make_pair(xx, yy);
  tx = make_pair(xs, ys);
  ll dea = dist(temp, tx);
  if (dea <= t)
    arr.pb(temp);
  temp = next(temp);
  ll cur_dist = dist(tx, temp);
  if (cur_dist > dea)
    vs = 2;
  else
    vs = 1;
  while (vs == 1 || (vs == 2 && cur_dist <= t)) {
    dea = cur_dist;
    arr.push_back(temp);
    temp = next(temp);
    cur_dist = dist(tx, temp);
    if (vs == 1 && dea < cur_dist)
      vs = 2;
  }
  ll ans = 0;
  vector<ll> prefix_sum(arr.size(), 0);
  for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
    prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + dist(arr[i], arr[i - 1]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
    int j = i;
    ll dus = dist(tx, arr[i]);
    ll tx = dus;
    if (dus <= t) {
      while (j < arr.size() - 1 && dus <= t) {
        j++;
        dus = prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i] + dist(arr[i], arr[j]);
      }
      if (dus <= t)
        ans = max(ans, (ll)j - i + 1);
      else
        ans = max(ans, (ll)j - i);
      dus = tx;
      j = i;
      while (j > 0 && dus <= t) {
        j--;
        dus = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j] + dist(arr[j], arr[i]);
      }
      if (dus <= t)
        ans = max(ans, (ll)i - j + 1);
      else
        ans = max(ans, (ll)i - j);
    }
  }
  cout << ans;
}
```

Please note that the effectiveness of these optimizations can vary depending on the specific inputs and the specific compiler used.
