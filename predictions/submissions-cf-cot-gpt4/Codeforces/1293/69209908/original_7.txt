Your code is well-structured, but there are some parts that can be optimized for better performance. Here's what we can optimize:

1. Usage of bits/stdc++.h: This header file includes quite a lot of files, and it increases the compilation time. It's better to include only those header files which you are actually using in your program.

2. Usage of Macros: The use of macros like FAST and pb can be replaced with their actual representation to make the code more readable and maintainable.

3. Repeated calculation: In your program, you are calculating dist(tx, temp) multiple times. It can be calculated once and stored in a variable for future use.

4. Avoiding repeated computation: In your program, you are calculating the distance between points multiple times in a loop. This can be avoided by pre-calculating these distances and storing them in an array.

Here is an optimized version of the code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

#define ll long long

using namespace std;

ll dist(pair<ll, ll> a, pair<ll, ll> b) {
  return abs(a.first - b.first) + abs(a.second - b.second);
}

pair<ll, ll> next(pair<ll, ll> temp, ll ax, ll bx, ll ay, ll by) {
  return make_pair(ax * temp.first + bx, ay * temp.second + by);
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0); 

  ll xx, yy, ax, bx, ay, by, xs, ys, t;
  cin >> xx >> yy >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by >> xs >> ys >> t;

  pair<ll, ll> temp, tx;
  vector<pair<ll, ll>> arr;

  temp = make_pair(xx, yy);
  tx = make_pair(xs, ys);

  ll dist_tx_temp = dist(temp, tx);

  if (dist_tx_temp <= t)
    arr.push_back(temp);

  temp = next(temp, ax, bx, ay, by);

  ll vs = (dist(tx, temp) > dist_tx_temp) ? 2 : 1;

  while (vs == 1 || (vs == 2 && dist(tx, temp) <= t)) {
    dist_tx_temp = dist(tx, temp);
    arr.push_back(temp);
    temp = next(temp, ax, bx, ay, by);
    if (vs == 1 && dist_tx_temp < dist(tx, temp))
      vs = 2;
  }

  vector<ll> dist_arr(arr.size());
  for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i)
    dist_arr[i] = dist(tx, arr[i]);

  ll ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
    int j = i;
    ll dus = dist_arr[i];
    ll tx = dus;
    while (j < arr.size() - 1 && dus <= t) {
      j++;
      dus += dist(arr[j], arr[j - 1]);
    }
    ans = max(ans, j - i - (dus <= t ? 0 : 1));
    dus = tx;
    j = i;
    while (j > 0 && dus <= t) {
      j--;
      dus += dist(arr[j], arr[j + 1]);
    }
    ans = max(ans, i - j - (dus <= t ? 0 : 1));
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
