This C++ program is not easy to optimize, as it follows a good coding style and uses standard C++ data structures efficiently. However, there are some minor changes that can be applied to reduce the running time and memory usage.

1. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: `push_back` function in STL vector creates a copy of the passed object and then it inserts the copy into the vector. On the other hand, `emplace_back` constructs a new element in-place at the end of the vector, it's more efficient than `push_back` in terms of speed because it eliminates the need for a temporary object, thus reducing the overhead.

2. Avoid repeatedly calling the `dist` function: The `dist` function is called multiple times with the same arguments. This repetition can be reduced by storing the result in a variable and reusing the variable.

3. Avoid repeatedly calling `arr.size()`: The `size` method of vector `arr` is called multiple times inside a loop. We can store the size in a variable and then use it inside the loop.

4. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment: In a loop, pre-increment can be faster than post-increment because post-increment needs to increment the value and keep a copy of the original value.

Here is the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define FAST ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0); srand(time(NULL));
#define ll long long
#define pb push_back
#define ff first
#define ss second
using namespace std;

ll xx, yy, ax, bx, ay, by, xs, ys, t;
ll dist(pair<ll, ll> a, pair<ll, ll> b) {
  return abs(a.ff - b.ff) + abs(a.ss - b.ss);
}

pair<ll, ll> next(pair<ll, ll> temp) {
  return make_pair(ax * temp.ff + bx, ay * temp.ss + by);
}

int main() {
  FAST;
  cin >> xx >> yy >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by >> xs >> ys >> t;
  pair<ll, ll> temp, tx;
  vector<pair<ll, ll>> arr;
  ll vs = 0;
  temp = make_pair(xx, yy);
  tx = make_pair(xs, ys);
  ll dea = dist(temp, tx);
  if (dea <= t)
    arr.emplace_back(temp);
  temp = next(temp);
  if (dist(tx, temp) > dea)
    vs = 2;
  else
    vs = 1;
  while (vs == 1 || (vs == 2 && dist(tx, temp) <= t)) {
    dea = dist(tx, temp);
    arr.emplace_back(temp);
    temp = next(temp);
    if (vs == 1 && dea < dist(tx, temp))
      vs = 2;
  }
  ll ans = 0;
  int arr_size = arr.size();
  for (int i = 0; i < arr_size; ++i) {
    int j = i;
    ll dus = dist(tx, arr[i]);
    ll tx = dus;
    if (dus <= t) {
      while (j < arr_size - 1 && dus <= t) {
        ++j;
        dus += dist(arr[j], arr[j - 1]);
      }
      if (dus <= t)
        ans = max(ans, (ll)j - i + 1);
      else
        ans = max(ans, (ll)j - i);
      dus = tx;
      j = i;
      while (j > 0 && dus <= t) {
        --j;
        dus += dist(arr[j], arr[j + 1]);
      }
      if (dus <= t)
        ans = max(ans, (ll)i - j + 1);
      else
        ans = max(ans, (ll)i - j);
    }
  }
  cout << ans;
}
```

Please note that the increase in performance will vary based on the compiler and the machine. The changes I suggested are generally good practice for optimizing C++ code.
