This program seems to be already optimized for run time and memory usage. However, there are some small changes that can be made for better performance:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of standard libraries, which increases the compilation time. Include only the libraries you need.

2. Avoid using `#define` for constants: It's better to use `const` keyword to create constants. The `#define` directive does not respect the C++ scope rules and it can lead to bugs which are hard to find.

3. Use `constexpr` for `dist` and `next` functions: This will evaluate the function at compile-time if possible, reducing run-time overhead.

4. Use pre-increment in the loop: Pre-increment (`++i`) is generally faster than post-increment (`i++`), because post-increment involves a copy of `i` before it was incremented.

5. Avoid creating temporary variables: In the `dist` function, `a` and `b` are copied into the function. This can be avoided by passing them as const references.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <ctime>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

using ll = long long;
using pll = pair<ll, ll>;

constexpr ll dist(const pll& a, const pll& b) {
  return abs(a.first - b.first) + abs(a.second - b.second);
}

constexpr pll next(const pll& temp, ll ax, ll bx, ll ay, ll by) {
  return make_pair(ax * temp.first + bx, ay * temp.second + by);
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  srand(time(NULL));

  ll xx, yy, ax, bx, ay, by, xs, ys, t;
  cin >> xx >> yy >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by >> xs >> ys >> t;

  vector<pll> arr;
  ll vs = 0;
  pll temp = make_pair(xx, yy);
  pll tx = make_pair(xs, ys);
  ll dea = dist(temp, tx);
  if (dea <= t)
    arr.push_back(temp);
  temp = next(temp, ax, bx, ay, by);
  if (dist(tx, temp) > dea)
    vs = 2;
  else
    vs = 1;
  while (vs == 1 || (vs == 2 && dist(tx, temp) <= t)) {
    dea = dist(tx, temp);
    arr.push_back(temp);
    temp = next(temp, ax, bx, ay, by);
    if (vs == 1 && dea < dist(tx, temp))
      vs = 2;
  }
  ll ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
    int j = i;
    ll dus = dist(tx, arr[i]);
    ll tx = dus;
    if (dus <= t) {
      while (j < arr.size() - 1 && dus <= t) {
        ++j;
        dus += dist(arr[j], arr[j - 1]);
      }
      if (dus <= t)
        ans = max(ans, (ll)j - i + 1);
      else
        ans = max(ans, (ll)j - i);
      dus = tx;
      j = i;
      while (j > 0 && dus <= t) {
        --j;
        dus += dist(arr[j], arr[j + 1]);
      }
      if (dus <= t)
        ans = max(ans, (ll)i - j + 1);
      else
        ans = max(ans, (ll)i - j);
    }
  }
  cout << ans;
}
```

Keep in mind that these optimizations may not result in noticeable performance gain, as modern compilers are very good at optimizing code.
