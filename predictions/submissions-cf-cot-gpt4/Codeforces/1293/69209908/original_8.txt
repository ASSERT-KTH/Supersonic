Here are some steps to optimize your code:

1. Reduce the number of calls to the `dist` function in the `while` loop. You are calling the `dist` function twice in each iteration: once for the `if` condition and once for the assignment to `dea`. You can eliminate one of these calls by storing the result of the function call in `dea` before the loop and then using `dea` in the `if` condition.

2. Avoid creating temporary `pair` objects. You are creating temporary `pair` objects in the `next` function and in the assignments to `temp` and `tx`. You can avoid creating these temporary objects by directly assigning the results to `temp` and `tx`.

3. Use prefix increment in loops. Prefix increment is generally faster than postfix increment because it does not require a temporary object.

4. Avoid using `push_back` in a loop. Instead, you can reserve memory for the vector before the loop using the `reserve` function.

5. Replace `std::max` with `if`-`else` statements. It will reduce the overhead of function calls.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define FAST ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0);
#define ll long long
#define pb push_back
#define ff first
#define ss second
using namespace std;
ll xx, yy, ax, bx, ay, by, xs, ys, t;

ll dist(pair<ll, ll> a, pair<ll, ll> b) {
  return abs(a.ff - b.ff) + abs(a.ss - b.ss);
}

void next(pair<ll, ll>& temp) {
  temp = make_pair(ax * temp.ff + bx, ay * temp.ss + by);
}

int main() {
  FAST;
  cin >> xx >> yy >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by >> xs >> ys >> t;
  pair<ll, ll> temp, tx;
  vector<pair<ll, ll>> arr;
  arr.reserve(100);
  ll vs = 0;
  temp = make_pair(xx, yy);
  tx = make_pair(xs, ys);
  ll dea = dist(temp, tx);
  if (dea <= t)
    arr.pb(temp);
  next(temp);
  dea = dist(tx, temp);
  vs = dea > dist(tx, temp) ? 2 : 1;

  while (vs == 1 || (vs == 2 && dea <= t)) {
    arr.push_back(temp);
    next(temp);
    ll new_dea = dist(tx, temp);
    if (vs == 1 && dea < new_dea)
      vs = 2;
    dea = new_dea;
  }

  ll ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
    int j = i;
    ll dus = dist(tx, arr[i]);
    ll tx = dus;
    if (dus <= t) {
      while (j < arr.size() - 1 && dus <= t) {
        ++j;
        dus += dist(arr[j], arr[j - 1]);
      }
      ll new_ans = dus <= t ? j - i + 1 : j - i;
      if(new_ans > ans)
        ans = new_ans;
      dus = tx;
      j = i;
      while (j > 0 && dus <= t) {
        --j;
        dus += dist(arr[j], arr[j + 1]);
      }
      new_ans = dus <= t ? i - j + 1 : i - j;
      if(new_ans > ans)
        ans = new_ans;
    }
  }
  cout << ans;
}
```

Note that the optimizations made here are relatively minor and may not result in a significant performance improvement. The performance of this program is largely determined by the size and content of the input data. It's always important to profile your program with realistic data to identify the actual bottlenecks before attempting to optimize it.
