Here are some steps to optimize your given program:

1. **Reduce the use of global variables**: Global variables can slow down the access time, it is better to keep the variables local to a function if they are not required elsewhere.
2. **Use faster IO operations**: cin and cout are slower compared to scanf and printf, so using scanf and printf can speed up the IO operations.
3. **Reuse the calculated values**: In the given program, the values of `s_n` and `s_m` are calculated multiple times. This can be optimized by storing the calculated values and reusing them.

Here's the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  long long N, M, x, t;
  scanf("%lld %lld", &N, &M);
  long long n[N+1] = {0}, m[M+1] = {0}, s_n[N+1] = {0}, s_m[M+1] = {0};
  for (long long i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    scanf("%lld", &t);
    n[i] = t + n[i - 1];
  }
  for (long long j = 1; j <= M; j++) {
    scanf("%lld", &t);
    m[j] = t + m[j - 1];
  }
  scanf("%lld", &x);
  for (long long i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    s_n[i] = 10e10;
    for (int j = i; j <= N; j++) {
      s_n[i] = min(s_n[i], n[j] - n[j - i]);
    }
  }
  for (long long i = 1; i <= M; i++) {
    s_m[i] = 10e10;
    for (int j = i; j <= M; j++) {
      s_m[i] = min(s_m[i], m[j] - m[j - i]);
    }
  }
  long long ans = 0;
  for (int n_i = 1; n_i <= N; n_i++) {
    for (int mid_m = 1; mid_m <= M; mid_m++) {
      if (s_m[mid_m] * s_n[n_i] <= x) {
        ans = max(ans, mid_m * n_i);
      }
    }
  }
  printf("%lld", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we have reduced the use of global variables, replaced cin and cout with scanf and printf for faster IO, and stored the intermediate values of `s_n` and `s_m` to avoid computing them multiple times.
