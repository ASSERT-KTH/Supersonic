The code you provided can be optimized in a few ways:

1. **Redundant calculations in the nested loop**: Inside the loop where `n_i` varies from `1` to `N`, you have loops that calculate `s_n` and `s_m` in each iteration of the `min_m` to `max_m` loop. However, note that `s_n` only depends on `n_i` and does not change within the `min_m` to `max_m` loop. So, we can move the calculation of `s_n` out of the `min_m` to `max_m` loop to avoid redundant calculations. This will save a lot of computation time because you are reducing the time complexity from `O(N^2 * M)` to `O(N * M)`.

2. **Avoid using `std::bits/stdc++.h`**: Including `bits/stdc++.h` is a bad practice because it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which increases the compilation time. Instead, you should only include the necessary headers you are using in your program. In your case, you are only using `iostream` for input and output and `algorithm` for the `min` and `max` functions.

3. **Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`**: This is a minor optimization that can significantly speed up input/output operations in some cases. It simply disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams.

Here's the optimized program after applying the above optimizations:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
long long n[2001], m[2001];
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  long long s_n, s_m, t, N, M, x, min_n = 1, max_n, mid_n, min_m = 1, max_m,
                                  mid_m, ans = 0, col;
  cin >> N >> M;
  max_n = N;
  for (long long i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> t;
    n[i] = t + n[i - 1];
  }
  for (long long j = 1; j <= M; j++) {
    cin >> t;
    m[j] = t + m[j - 1];
  }
  cin >> x;
  for (int n_i = 1; n_i <= N; n_i++) {
    s_n = 10e10;
    for (int i = n_i; i <= N; i++)
      s_n = min(s_n, n[i] - n[i - n_i]);
    min_m = 1;
    max_m = M;
    while (min_m <= max_m) {
      mid_m = (min_m + max_m) / 2;
      s_m = 10e10;
      for (int i = mid_m; i <= M; i++)
        s_m = min(s_m, m[i] - m[i - mid_m]);
      if (s_m * s_n <= x) {
        ans = max(ans, mid_m * n_i);
        min_m = mid_m + 1;
      } else
        max_m = mid_m - 1;
    }
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that depending on the specific values of `N` and `M`, the performance benefit of these optimizations will vary.
