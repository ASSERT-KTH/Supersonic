The given C++ program can be optimized by reducing repeated computations and unnecessary calculations.

Here are the steps we can follow for optimization:

1) We can see that the statement `s_n = min(s_n, n[i] - n[i - n_i])` is computed for each `n_i` within the `min_m <= max_m` loop. However, `s_n` only depends on `n_i` and not `min_m` or `max_m`. Thus, we can move this computation outside of `min_m <= max_m` loop. This will reduce a considerable amount of computations when `max_m - min_m` is large.

2) The program could be optimized further by using the fact that `s_m` is decreasing with increasing `mid_m`. Thus, we can calculate `s_m` only once for each `M`. We can store the results in an array and use them later in the binary search. This would reduce the number of computations and also the running time of the program.

Let's implement these changes in the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
long long n[2001], m[2001], s_m[2001];

int main() {
  long long s_n, t, N, M, x, min_n = 1, max_n, mid_n, min_m = 1, max_m,
                                  mid_m, ans = 0, col;
  cin >> N >> M;
  max_n = N;
  for (long long i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> t;
    n[i] = t + n[i - 1];
  }
  for (long long j = 1; j <= M; j++) {
    cin >> t;
    m[j] = t + m[j - 1];
  }
  cin >> x;
  
  // calculate s_m for each M
  for (int j = 1; j <= M; j++) {
    s_m[j] = 10e10;
    for (int i = j; i <= M; i++)
        s_m[j] = min(s_m[j], m[i] - m[i - j]);
  }

  for (int n_i = 1; n_i <= N; n_i++) {
    min_m = 1;
    max_m = M;
    s_n = 10e10;
    for (int i = n_i; i <= N; i++)
      s_n = min(s_n, n[i] - n[i - n_i]);
    while (min_m <= max_m) {
      mid_m = (min_m + max_m) / 2;
      if (s_m[mid_m] * s_n <= x) {
        ans = max(ans, mid_m * n_i);
        min_m = mid_m + 1;
      } else
        max_m = mid_m - 1;
    }
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code performs the same functionality as the original, but with fewer computations and improved running time.
