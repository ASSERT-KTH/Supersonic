The primary optimization in this code would be to move the innermost two loops, which calculate the minimum values of s_n and s_m, outside the binary search loop. These calculations don't depend on the binary search but are being re-calculated for each iteration. 

Steps:

1. Move the calculation of s_n before the binary search (while loop), as it only depends on n_i and doesn't change during the binary search.

2. For s_m, instead of calculating the minimum for all possible sizes each time, we calculate the minimum for the maximum size once, and then use this information to find the minimum for all smaller sizes.

Now, we'll generate the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
long long n[2001], m[2001], min_n[2001], min_m[2001];

int main() {
  long long t, N, M, x, mid_m, ans = 0, col;
  cin >> N >> M;
  for (long long i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> t;
    n[i] = t + n[i - 1];
    min_n[i] = min(n[i], min_n[i - 1]);
  }
  for (long long j = 1; j <= M; j++) {
    cin >> t;
    m[j] = t + m[j - 1];
    min_m[j] = min(m[j], min_m[j - 1]);
  }
  cin >> x;
  for (int n_i = 1; n_i <= N; n_i++) {
    int min_m = 1, max_m = M;
    long long s_n = min_n[n_i];
    while (min_m <= max_m) {
      mid_m = (min_m + max_m) / 2;
      long long s_m = min_m[mid_m];
      if (s_m * s_n <= x) {
        ans = max(ans, mid_m * n_i);
        min_m = mid_m + 1;
      } else
        max_m = mid_m - 1;
    }
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code calculates `s_m` and `s_n` only once per `n_i`, rather than recalculating them for each binary search iteration. This significantly reduces the time complexity.
