The given C++ program is using a nested loop to calculate the maximum value of `dp[i]` with a complexity of O(n*m). This can be optimized to O(n) by keeping track of the maximum sum within the last `m` elements. 

Here are the steps to optimize the given program:

1. The variable `sum` is used to calculate the sum of the last `m` elements. Instead of recalculating it for every `i` in `dp[i]`, a new array `sums` can be introduced to keep track of the sum of the last `m` elements. `sums[i]` is equal to `sums[i-1]` plus `a[i]` minus `a[i-m]` for `i>m` and `sums[i-1]` plus `a[i]` for `i<=m`.

2. The variable `max_sum` is introduced to keep track of the maximum value of `sums[j] - k` for `j` from `0` to `i-m`. This eliminates the need for the inner loop.

3. `dp[i]` is equal to `max_sum` plus `a[i]` for `i>m` and `a[i]` for `i<=m`. 

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("O3", "unroll-loops")
#pragma GCC target("avx2")
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
ll n, m, k, ans, a[1005000], dp[1005000], sums[1005000];
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cin >> n >> m >> k;
  ll max_sum = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    sums[i] = sums[i - 1] + a[i] - (i > m ? a[i - m] : 0);
    if (i > m) {
        max_sum = max(max_sum, sums[i - m] - k);
    }
    dp[i] = max_sum + a[i];
    ans = max(ans, dp[i]);
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
This program has the same functionality as the original program but with a better time complexity. The space complexity remains the same because the same amount of additional space is used.
