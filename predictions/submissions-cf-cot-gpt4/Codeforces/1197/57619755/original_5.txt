The given code is a dynamic programming solution and the most time-consuming part is the nested for loop. The inner loop starts from 'i - 1' and goes back to 0, which results in a time complexity of O(n^2). The space complexity is O(n) due to the usage of array 'dp' and 'a'. 

We can optimize the time complexity by using prefix sum and a deque data structure. 

Here are the steps:
1. We replace array 'a' with 'prefixSum' array where prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + a[i]. This allows us to calculate the sum of any subarray in O(1) time.
2. For the dynamic programming part, we keep a deque 'dq' to store potential values of 'dp[j] - prefixSum[j]'. The front of the deque is always the largest value, and it's the candidate to update 'dp[i]'.
3. When updating 'dp[i]', we pop the front of the deque if it's out of the range 'm'. After we update 'dp[i]' with the front of the deque, we pop the values from the back of the deque if they are smaller than or equal to 'dp[i] - prefixSum[i]', and then we push 'i' into the deque. This ensures the deque is always in decreasing order and within the range 'm'.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("O3", "unroll-loops")
#pragma GCC target("avx2")
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
ll n, m, k, ans, prefixSum[1005000], dp[1005000];
deque<int> dq;
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cin >> n >> m >> k;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> prefixSum[i];
    prefixSum[i] += prefixSum[i - 1];
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (!dq.empty() && dq.front() < i - m) {
      dq.pop_front();
    }
    if (!dq.empty()) {
      dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[dq.front()] + prefixSum[i] - prefixSum[dq.front()] - k);
    } else {
      dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], prefixSum[i] - k);
    }
    ans = max(ans, dp[i]);
    while (!dq.empty() && dp[dq.back()] - prefixSum[dq.back()] <= dp[i] - prefixSum[i]) {
      dq.pop_back();
    }
    dq.push_back(i);
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) and keeps the space complexity as O(n).
