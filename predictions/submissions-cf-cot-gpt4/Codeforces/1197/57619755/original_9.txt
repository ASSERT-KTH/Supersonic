The program can be optimized by reducing the number of repetitive calculations in the nested loop. In the original program, `sum` is recalculated from scratch for each `j` in the inner loop. We can optimize it by maintaining the `sum` value and subtracting `a[j + 1]` in each iteration of the inner loop.

Furthermore, we can change the type of `j` to `ll` because `j` is used as an index for the `dp` and `a` arrays which are `long long` type.

Here's how you could optimize the program:

```c++
#pragma GCC optimize("O3", "unroll-loops")
#pragma GCC target("avx2")
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
ll n, m, k, ans, a[1005000], dp[1005000];
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cin >> n >> m >> k;
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    ll sum = a[i];
    for (ll j = i - 1; j >= 0 && i - j <= m; j--) {
      dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + sum - k);
      sum += a[j];
      if(j > 0) sum -= a[j + 1];
    }
    ans = max(ans, dp[i]);
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

Also, if we only need to optimize running time, we could consider using a deque to store the sums and indices. This would allow us to avoid unnecessary calculations and reduce the time complexity. However, since you only asked for a small modification, I did not include this optimization.
