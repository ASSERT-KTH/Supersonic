The optimization of this code can be done in a few steps:

1. Use fast I/O operations: The code already uses fast I/O operations (`ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0);`) which is good.

2. Avoid repeated calculations: In the nested loop, the same value of `dp[j]` is getting accessed multiple times. We can avoid this by calculating `dp[i]` once before the inner loop, and then update it inside the loop.

3. Pre-compute the prefix sum: The code calculates the sum of `a[i]` to `a[j]` in each iteration. We can pre-calculate the prefix sum before the loop and use it to get the sum.

4. Use a deque to keep track of the maximum value of `dp[j] - k*j` where `j` is in the range `[i-m, i-1]`. This way, we can get the maximum value in constant time.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("O3", "unroll-loops")
#pragma GCC target("avx2")
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
ll n, m, k, ans, a[1005000], dp[1005000], pre[1005000];
deque<ll> dq;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cin >> n >> m >> k;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    pre[i] = pre[i-1] + a[i];
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    while (!dq.empty() && dq.front() < i - m)
      dq.pop_front();
    if (!dq.empty())
      dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[dq.front()] - pre[dq.front()] + pre[i] - k);
    while (!dq.empty() && dp[i] - pre[i] >= dp[dq.back()] - pre[dq.back()])
      dq.pop_back();
    dq.push_back(i);

    ans = max(ans, dp[i]);
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, the time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is also O(n), which is better than the original code.
