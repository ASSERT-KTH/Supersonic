The given code is an example of a dynamic programming problem, where the value of dp[i] depends on the previous elements. The current implementation is not optimal because it runs in O(n^2) time complexity as it iterates through each pair of elements. We can optimize this code by reducing the number of unnecessary computations.

The inner loop iterates from i-1 to 0 to calculate the maximum sum of the array with length not exceeding m and the cost to remove each element is k. However, we can see that it recalculates the sum every time, which is not necessary. We can compute and store the prefix sums beforehand, and then use this to calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.

Besides, the array `a` starts from index 1, which is not customary in C++. Instead, it would be more memory efficient and idiomatic to start the array from index 0.

Optimization steps:
1. Calculate the prefix sum of the array a in a new array prefix_sum.
2. Replace the sum calculation in the inner loop with prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j] to get the sum of the subarray from j to i.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("O3", "unroll-loops")
#pragma GCC target("avx2")
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
ll n, m, k, ans, a[1005000], dp[1005000], prefix_sum[1005000];
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cin >> n >> m >> k;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    prefix_sum[i] = (i > 0 ? prefix_sum[i-1] : 0) + a[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0 && i - j <= m; j--) {
      ll sum = prefix_sum[i] - (j > 0 ? prefix_sum[j-1] : 0);
      dp[i] = max(dp[i], (j > 0 ? dp[j-1] : 0) + sum - k);
    }
    ans = max(ans, dp[i]);
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the time complexity is still O(n^2) due to the nature of the problem, but the number of operations in each iteration is reduced, resulting in a faster execution time.
