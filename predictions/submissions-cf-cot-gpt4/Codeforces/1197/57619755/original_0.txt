Step 1: Replace `bits/stdc++.h` with only necessary headers. `bits/stdc++.h` is a GCC extension that includes many standard library headers at once, which can slow down the compilation time. Although it doesn't affect the runtime or memory usage, it's a bad practice. 

Step 2: Use `std::vector` instead of C-style arrays. This allows for better memory management and can dynamically adjust the size.

Step 3: Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`. `scanf` and `printf` are faster than `cin` and `cout`.

Step 4: Pre-calculate the sum of array `a` to avoid repeated calculation in nested loop.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("O3", "unroll-loops")
#pragma GCC target("avx2")
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  ll n, m, k, ans = 0, sum = 0;
  scanf("%lld %lld %lld", &n, &m, &k);
  vector<ll> a(n+1), dp(n+1), preSum(n+1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    scanf("%lld", &a[i]);
    preSum[i] = preSum[i-1] + a[i];
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], a[i] - k);
    for (int j = max(0, i - m); j < i; j++) {
      dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + preSum[i] - preSum[j] - k);
    }
    ans = max(ans, dp[i]);
  }
  printf("%lld", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the difference in runtime may not be significant, depending on the input size. However, the above modifications are good practices for C++ programming and can lead to better runtime when dealing with larger inputs. The modification also helps to manage memory more efficiently by using `std::vector` instead of C-style arrays.
