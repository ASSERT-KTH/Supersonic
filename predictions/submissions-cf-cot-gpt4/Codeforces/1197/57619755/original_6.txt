Here are the possible optimizations for this code:

1. Move `sum = a[i]` outside the second loop: The variable `sum` is being reset in every iteration of the second loop. We can avoid this unnecessary computation by moving the statement outside the second loop.

2. Swap `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + sum - k);` and `sum += a[j];`: We are adding `a[j]` to `sum` before updating `dp[i]` but `dp[i]` uses `sum` before the addition. So, `a[j]` is getting added to `sum` unnecessarily for the first time in the second loop. To avoid this, we need to swap these two lines.

3. Use prefix sum: The inner loop is calculating the sum of the `m` elements preceding `a[i]` in every iteration. This is unnecessary and can be optimized by maintaining a prefix sum array and using it to calculate the sum of the `m` elements preceding `a[i]`.

4. Remove `#pragma GCC optimize("O3", "unroll-loops")` and `#pragma GCC target("avx2")`: These directives are forcing the compiler to optimize the code in a way that might not be optimal for the specific problem and the specific machine that the code is running on. It's generally better to leave optimization decisions to the compiler unless you have a very good understanding of both the problem and the target machine.

Here is the optimized version of the program with these modifications:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
ll n, m, k, ans, a[1005000], dp[1005000], prefix[1005000] = {0};
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cin >> n >> m >> k;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + a[i];
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - 1]);
    for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0 && i - j <= m; j--) {
      ll sum = prefix[i] - (j > 0 ? prefix[j - 1] : 0);
      dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + sum - k);
    }
    ans = max(ans, dp[i]);
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this optimized version assumes that the `m` elements preceding `a[i]` does not include `a[i]`. If it does include `a[i]`, you can adjust the calculation of `sum` accordingly.
