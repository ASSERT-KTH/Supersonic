The program is already written with some level of optimization in mind, but there are still a few changes that we can make to improve it:

1. Use a prefix sum approach: The program calculates the sum of the array elements in a sliding window fashion which ends up with repeated calculations. A prefix sum can prevent these repeated calculations and improve the time complexity of the program.

2. Make use of the properties of max function: The dp[i] is calculated by iterating back through the array from i to 0. We can observe that if dp[j] is smaller than dp[j-1], then there's no need to consider dp[j] as it'd never be chosen in the max function.

3. Use efficient IO functions: The cin and cout functions are slower than scanf and printf. Even though ios::sync_with_stdio(false) is used to speed up cin and cout, scanf and printf are still faster.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("O3", "unroll-loops")
#pragma GCC target("avx2")
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
ll n, m, k, ans = 0, prefix_sum[1005000] = {0}, dp[1005000] = {0};
int main() {
  scanf("%lld %lld %lld", &n, &m, &k);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    scanf("%lld", &prefix_sum[i]);
    prefix_sum[i] += prefix_sum[i-1];  // calculate prefix sum
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], prefix_sum[i] - k);  // consider the case without the current element
    if (i > m) {  // if the window size is larger than m
      dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-m] + prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[i-m] - k);  // consider the case with the current element
    }
    ans = max(ans, dp[i]);
  }
  printf("%lld", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version reduces the time complexity from O(n*m) to O(n), and the memory usage is still O(n), which is the same as the original program.
