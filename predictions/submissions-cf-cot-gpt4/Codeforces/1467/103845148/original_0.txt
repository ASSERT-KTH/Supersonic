Let's go step-by-step through the code you posted and identify the possible optimization areas.

1. The function `kitne` is called twice in the loop, which is unnecessary as we can store the first call's result and re-use it. It will reduce time complexity.

2. The `kitne` function actually checks for the same condition for three indexes `(ind-1, ind, ind+1)`. Instead of checking for same condition three times, we can create a function that checks for a single index and call it three times with different indexes. Also, we don't need to check if `i-1 >= 0` and `i+1 < n` inside the loop because we already know that `i >= ind - 1` and `i <= ind + 1`.

3. In the function `hn_bhai`, the same checking condition (whether an element is a peak or a valley) is used twice. Once in the loop that calculates `tot` and then in the `kitne` function. We can calculate this in the same loop where we calculate `tot` and store the result in a boolean vector. Later, we can just refer to this vector instead of calculating it again in `kitne`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define vi vector<int>
#define vb vector<bool>
#define ff first
#define ss second
#define pb push_back
vector<int> a;
vector<bool> isPeakOrValley;

bool check(ll i) {
    return (i > 0 && i < a.size() - 1) &&
           ((a[i] > a[i + 1] && a[i] > a[i - 1]) ||
            (a[i] < a[i - 1] && a[i] < a[i + 1]));
}

int kitne(ll ind) {
    int cnt = 0;
    for (ll i = ind - 1; i <= ind + 1; i++) {
        cnt += isPeakOrValley[i];
    }
    return cnt;
}

void hn_bhai() {
    ll n;
    cin >> n;
    a.resize(n);
    isPeakOrValley.resize(n, false);
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> a[i];
    ll tot = 0;
    for (ll i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
        isPeakOrValley[i] = check(i);
        tot += isPeakOrValley[i];
    }
    int p = 0;
    for (ll i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
        int temp = kitne(i);
        ll val = a[i];
        if (i - 1 >= 0) {
            a[i] = a[i - 1];
            isPeakOrValley[i] = check(i);
        }
        p = max(p, temp - kitne(i));
        if (i + 1 < n) {
            a[i] = a[i + 1];
            isPeakOrValley[i] = check(i);
        }
        p = max(p, temp - kitne(i));
        a[i] = val;
        isPeakOrValley[i] = check(i);
    }
    cout << tot - p << endl;
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--)
        hn_bhai();
}
```
