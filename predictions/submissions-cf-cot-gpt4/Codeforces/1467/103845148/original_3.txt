The given code seems to be a competitive programming solution where it counts the numbers which are either local minimum or local maximum in the list. The optimization can be done in two ways. 

1. Using the array instead of vector: As the size of the vector is known before the input, using an array can be slightly faster than a vector in terms of accessing elements.

2. Reducing function calls: The function `kitne` is being called twice in each iteration of the second for loop in the `hn_bhai` function. Instead, we could store the result from the first call to `kitne` in a variable and use this stored value the second time, thus eliminating the need for a second function call.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define ll long long
#define MAX 300005
using namespace std;

int a[MAX];
ll tot;
int kitne(ll ind, ll n) {
  int cnt = 0;
  for (ll i = ind - 1; i <= ind + 1; i++) {
    if (i - 1 >= 0 && i + 1 < n) {
      if ((a[i] > a[i + 1] && a[i] > a[i - 1]) ||
          (a[i] < a[i - 1] && a[i] < a[i + 1]))
        cnt++;
    }
  }
  return cnt;
}
void hn_bhai() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  tot = 0;
  for (ll i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if ((a[i] > a[i + 1] && a[i] > a[i - 1]) ||
        (a[i] < a[i - 1] && a[i] < a[i + 1]))
      tot++;
  }
  int p = 0;
  for (ll i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int temp = kitne(i,n);
    ll val = a[i];
    if (i - 1 >= 0) {
      a[i] = a[i - 1];
    }
    p = max(p, temp - kitne(i,n));
    a[i] = val;
    if (i + 1 < n)
      a[i] = a[i + 1];
    p = max(p, temp - kitne(i,n));
    a[i] = val;
  }
  cout << tot - p << endl;
}
int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    hn_bhai();
}
```
Please note that the optimization in this case might not drastically improve the performance of the code as the time complexity remains the same. The improvements are more about cleaner and more efficient code.
