Before we optimize the code, let's understand the program. The program takes an array input and calculates the total number of elements that are either a peak (greater than both neighbors) or a valley (less than both neighbors). Then, it tries to reduce the total number of peaks or valleys by replacing certain elements with their neighbors and keeps track of the maximum reduction possible. The final output is the initial total minus the maximum reduction.

Here is how we can optimize this program:

1. Remove unnecessary checks: In the function `kitne()`, the check `(i - 1 >= 0 && i + 1 < n)` is unnecessary because `i` is always between `ind - 1` and `ind + 1` and `ind` is always between 1 and `n - 2` (inclusive).

2. Reduce function calls: The function `kitne()` is called twice with the same argument `i` in the main function. Instead, we can store the result of the first call in a variable and use it in the second call.

3. Reduce variable assignments: The variable `val` is assigned the value `a[i]` and then `a[i]` is assigned back the value `val`. Instead, we can use a temporary variable to store the original value of `a[i]` and use it in the computation.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits\stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define vi vector<int>
#define vb vector<bool>
#define ff first
#define ss second
#define pb push_back
vector<int> a;

int kitne(ll ind) {
  int cnt = 0;
  if ((a[ind] > a[ind + 1] && a[ind] > a[ind - 1]) ||
      (a[ind] < a[ind - 1] && a[ind] < a[ind + 1]))
    cnt++;
  return cnt;
}

void hn_bhai() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  a.resize(n);
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  ll tot = 0;
  for (ll i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if ((a[i] > a[i + 1] && a[i] > a[i - 1]) ||
        (a[i] < a[i - 1] && a[i] < a[i + 1]))
      tot++;
  }
  int p = 0;
  for (ll i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int temp = kitne(i);
    ll original = a[i];
    if (i - 1 >= 0) {
      a[i] = a[i - 1];
      p = max(p, temp - kitne(i));
      a[i] = original;
    }
    if (i + 1 < n) {
      a[i] = a[i + 1];
      p = max(p, temp - kitne(i));
      a[i] = original;
    }
  }
  cout << tot - p << endl;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    hn_bhai();
}
```

These optimizations will reduce the number of unnecessary checks, function calls, and variable assignments, thereby improving the running time and memory usage of the program.
