The given C++ program is a bit inefficient due to the following reasons:

1. The function "kitne" is called multiple times with the same arguments. This is inefficient in terms of time complexity.
2. Inside the "kitne" function, the size of vector "a" is calculated in each call, which is not required as the size of the vector remains unchanged.
3. The function "kitne" is making unnecessary iterations when checking the elements from "ind - 1" to "ind + 1" as it only needs to check for the index "ind".
4. In the function "hn_bhai", the same condition is being checked twice for each index i in two different loops which is unnecessary.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the unnecessary calculation of the size of the vector "a" from the "kitne" function.
2. In the "kitne" function, remove the unnecessary loop and keep only the check for the index "ind".
3. In the function "hn_bhai", remove the repeated condition check for each index "i" by storing the result in a vector.
4. Store the results of the function "kitne" in a vector so it does not need to be calculated multiple times.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits\stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define vi vector<int>
#define vb vector<bool>
#define ff first
#define ss second
#define pb push_back
vector<int> a;
int kitne(ll ind) {
  if (ind - 1 >= 0 && ind + 1 < a.size()) {
    if ((a[ind] > a[ind + 1] && a[ind] > a[ind - 1]) ||
        (a[ind] < a[ind - 1] && a[ind] < a[ind + 1]))
      return 1;
  }
  return 0;
}
void hn_bhai() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  a.resize(n);
  vector<int> calc(n, 0);
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  ll tot = 0;
  for (ll i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    calc[i] = kitne(i);
    tot += calc[i];
  }
  int p = 0;
  for (ll i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int temp = calc[i];
    ll val = a[i];
    if (i - 1 >= 0) {
      a[i] = a[i - 1];
      p = max(p, temp - kitne(i));
    }
    if (i + 1 < n) {
      a[i] = a[i + 1];
      p = max(p, temp - kitne(i));
    }
    a[i] = val;
  }
  cout << tot - p << endl;
}
int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    hn_bhai();
}
```
This optimized version of the program reduces the number of unnecessary function calls and avoids repeated calculation of the same values, which significantly improves the time complexity of the program.
