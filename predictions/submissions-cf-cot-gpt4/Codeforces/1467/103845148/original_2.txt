Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid the usage of `#include<bits\stdc++.h>` because it includes more libraries than necessary which increases the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries.
2. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`. These two lines turn off the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding C standard streams. This makes reading from `cin` and writing to `cout` faster. It is a good practice to add these lines to your code to reduce the time taken.
3. You can improve the function `kitne` by reducing the number of condition checks. There is no need to check `i - 1 >= 0` and `i + 1 < n` in the loop since `i` always lies in the range `[ind - 1, ind + 1]` and `ind` is always in the range `[1, n - 2]`.
4. In the `hn_bhai` function, you are calling the `kitne` function twice which is not necessary. You can call it once, store the result in a variable, and use that variable.

The optimized code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define ll long long
#define vi vector<int>
#define vb vector<bool>
#define ff first
#define ss second
#define pb push_back

vector<int> a;

int kitne(ll ind) {
  int cnt = 0;
  for (ll i = ind - 1; i <= ind + 1; i++) {
    if ((a[i] > a[i + 1] && a[i] > a[i - 1]) ||
        (a[i] < a[i - 1] && a[i] < a[i + 1])){
      cnt++;
    }
  }
  return cnt;
}

void hn_bhai() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  a.resize(n);
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  ll tot = 0;
  for (ll i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if ((a[i] > a[i + 1] && a[i] > a[i - 1]) ||
        (a[i] < a[i - 1] && a[i] < a[i + 1])){
      tot++;
    }
  }
  int p = 0;
  for (ll i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int temp = kitne(i);
    ll val = a[i];
    a[i] = a[i - 1];
    int temp2 = kitne(i);
    p = max(p, temp - temp2);
    a[i] = a[i + 1];
    temp2 = kitne(i);
    p = max(p, temp - temp2);
    a[i] = val;
  }
  cout << tot - p << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    hn_bhai();
}

```
Note that while the optimization steps help to reduce running time and memory usage, the complexity of the code is still O(n).
