This C++ program seems to be performing a heavy duty graph operation. Here are some optimizations you can do:

1. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams.

2. Use `cin.tie(NULL)` to untie `cin` from `cout`. Tied streams ensure that one stream is flushed automatically before each I/O operation on the other stream.

3. Avoid passing large objects by value. Prefer to pass them by reference or const reference to avoid the overhead of copying.

4. Use prefix increment/decrement operators when the value of the operation is not used, as they are generally faster.

5. Avoid declaring variables that are not used.

6. Avoid using `std::endl` in favor of '\n' when you don't need to flush the stream, as `std::endl` causes an unnecessary flush.

The biggest improvement that can be made is in the way the program handles input/output operations. By disabling synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams and untieing `cin` from `cout`, the program will run faster. Additionally, using '\n' instead of `std::endl` will also speed up the program, as unnecessary flushes will be avoided. 

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#define fi first
#define se second
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 200005;
struct node {
  int cnt, par, lev, inp;
  int chn, idx, col, adj;
};
int n, q;
vector<int> g[MAXN];
node a[MAXN];
int bit[2 * MAXN];
int chains = 0, timer = 0, colour = 0;
vector<int> chain[MAXN];
map<int, int> col[MAXN];
map<int, set<int>> pos[MAXN];
int root[MAXN];
void Init() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cin >> n >> q;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    g[u].push_back(v);
    g[v].push_back(u);
  }
  a[n].par = -1;
  a[n].lev = 1;
  a[n].chn = 0;
  a[n].idx = 0;
  root[0] = n;
  colour = n;
}
// rest of the code remains the same
``` 

These small changes will significantly improve the speed of the program.
