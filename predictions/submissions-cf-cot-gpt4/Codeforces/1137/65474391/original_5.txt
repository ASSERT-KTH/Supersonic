In this C/C++ program, there are several areas that can be optimized both in terms of running time and memory usage. Here are the possible optimization steps:

1. **Redundant Variables:** There's a variable, 'colour', that's being incremented every time in the loop and never being decremented. This can cause an 'integer overflow' if the loop count exceeds the maximum limit of the integer. It's better to use a long long int for 'colour' to avoid an integer overflow situation.

2. **Input/Output Stream Optimization:** The cin and cout operations can be made faster by adding 'std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);' at the start of the main function. This disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. Additionally, 'cin.tie(NULL);' and 'cout.tie(NULL);' can be added to untie cin from cout. This means cin doesnâ€™t wait for cout to flush before reading input, which makes the program run a bit faster.

3. **Use of Constants:** Instead of using magic numbers like '2 * MAXN', it's better to define a constant for it. It will not only make the code cleaner, but it can also save memory if the same value is used multiple times.

4. **Avoiding Redundant Calculations:** In the function 'update', the operation 'i & (-i)' is calculated twice. It's better to calculate it once and store it in a variable.

5. **Use of std::endl:** The std::endl not only adds a newline character but also flushes the output buffer each time it is called, which can be a costly operation. Using '\n' instead of std::endl can improve the performance.

Here's the optimized version of the code with the above modifications:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#define fi first
#define se second
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 200005;
const int MAXN_DOUBLE = 2 * MAXN;
struct node {
  int cnt, par, lev, inp;
  int chn, idx, col, adj;
};
int n, q;
vector<int> g[MAXN];
node a[MAXN];
int bit[2 * MAXN];
int chains = 0, timer = 0;
long long int colour = 0;
vector<int> chain[MAXN];
map<int, int> col[MAXN];
map<int, set<int>> pos[MAXN];
int root[MAXN];

void Init() {
  ios ::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  cin >> n >> q;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    g[u].push_back(v);
    g[v].push_back(u);
  }
  a[n].par = -1;
  a[n].lev = 1;
  a[n].chn = 0;
  a[n].idx = 0;
  root[0] = n;
  colour = n;
}

void update(int x, int d) {
  for (int i = x, j = i & (-i); i < MAXN_DOUBLE; i += j) {
    bit[i] += d;
  }
}

// Rest of the code remains the same...

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  Init();
  // Rest of the code remains the same...
  if (s == "when") {
    int u;
    cin >> u;
    cout << when(u) << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations might not have a significant impact on the running time or memory usage for small inputs but can make a noticeable difference for large inputs.
