The given C++ program is an implementation of a complex algorithm. There are several methods to optimize it both in terms of memory and speed. Here are a few steps:

1. Reduce the use of complex data structures: The program uses several complex data structures such as vectors, sets, and maps. These data structures take up a lot of memory and CPU time. If possible, replace them with simpler data structures such as arrays and linked lists. For example, `vector<int> g[MAXN];` can be replaced with a 2D array `int g[MAXN][MAXN];` if the number of elements in `g` for each index is known beforehand.

2. Use bitwise operations: Bitwise operations are faster than arithmetic operations. You are already using bitwise operations in your `query` and `update` functions which is a good practice.

3. Use fast I/O methods: The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output which are slower compared to `scanf` and `printf`.

4. Avoid unnecessary computations: In the `DFS` function, `a[v].cnt` is computed for every `v`. If the value of `a[v].cnt` is not changing frequently, compute it once and store the value.

Here is the optimized code considering the above points:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#define fi first
#define se second
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 200005;
struct node {
  int cnt, par, lev, inp;
  int chn, idx, col, adj;
};
int n, q;
int g[MAXN][MAXN];
node a[MAXN];
int bit[2 * MAXN];
int chains = 0, timer = 0, colour = 0;
int chain[MAXN][MAXN];
map<int, int> col[MAXN];
map<int, set<int>> pos[MAXN];
int root[MAXN];
void Init() {
  ios ::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &q);
  for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    scanf("%d %d", &u, &v);
    g[u][v] = 1;
    g[v][u] = 1;
  }
  a[n].par = -1;
  a[n].lev = 1;
  a[n].chn = 0;
  a[n].idx = 0;
  root[0] = n;
  colour = n;
}
// Rest of the code remains the same...
```

Please note that the optimization I have done may not be feasible if you do not have the constraints of the problem beforehand as these optimizations are done considering a worst case scenario. For example, replacing vector with 2D array may lead to a lot of unused space if the number of elements per index is not constant.
