The program seems to be a complex tree manipulation program that uses Heavy Light Decomposition (HLD) with a lot of dynamic data structures which include vectors, maps and sets causing it to be memory intensive and slow due to frequent dynamic memory allocations and deallocations. 

Here are some optimization steps: 

1. **Avoid Dynamic Memory Allocation/Deallocation:** Frequent dynamic memory allocation and deallocation can cause the program to be slow and consume more memory. Wherever possible, try to use static arrays or vectors with reserved size to avoid dynamic memory allocation.

2. **Avoid Using Slower Data Structures:** Map, set and priority queue operations are usually O(logN), whereas direct array or vector access is O(1). So, try to use arrays or vectors where possible.

3. **Use Fast Input/Output Methods:** The `std::cin` and `std::cout` functions are slow. You can use faster methods like `scanf` and `printf` instead.

4. **Avoid Redundant Checks:** The `is_predecessor` function is called multiple times with the same arguments in the `LCA` function. It can be optimized by calling it only once for each unique pair of arguments.

5. **Inline Functions:** The `inline` keyword is used here to tell the compiler to make a particular function as inline function. Inline function is a function that is expanded in line when it is called. When the inline function is called whole code of the inline function gets inserted or substituted at the point of inline function call. This reduces the overhead of function calls like push and pop operations.

Please note that this is a complex program and these steps may not significantly optimize the program. A complete rewrite of the program might be necessary to make it more efficient and readable.

Here is the partial optimized version of your program, where we have avoided redundant checks in the `LCA` function and used `scanf` and `printf` for faster I/O.

```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#define fi first
#define se second
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 200005;
struct node {
  int cnt, par, lev, inp;
  int chn, idx, col, adj;
};
int n, q;
vector<int> g[MAXN];
node a[MAXN];
int bit[2 * MAXN];
int chains = 0, timer = 0, colour = 0;
vector<int> chain[MAXN];
map<int, int> col[MAXN];
map<int, set<int>> pos[MAXN];
int root[MAXN];
// replace cin and cout with scanf and printf 
void Init() {
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &q);
  for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    scanf("%d %d", &u, &v);
    g[u].push_back(v);
    g[v].push_back(u);
  }
  a[n].par = -1;
  a[n].lev = 1;
  a[n].chn = 0;
  a[n].idx = 0;
  root[0] = n;
  colour = n;
}
// rest of your code
int LCA(int u, int v) {
  if (is_predecessor(u, v))
    return u;
  if (is_predecessor(v, u))
    return v;
  int t = a[u].chn;
  while (!is_predecessor(chain[t][0], v)) {
    t = a[a[chain[t][0]].par].chn;
  }
  int l = 0, r = chain[t].size() - 1, res = 0;
  while (l <= r) {
    int mid = (l + r) / 2;
    bool isPredMidU = is_predecessor(chain[t][mid], u);
    bool isPredMidV = is_predecessor(chain[t][mid], v);
    if (isPredMidU and isPredMidV) {
      res = mid;
      l = mid + 1;
    } else
      r = mid - 1;
  }
  return chain[t][res];
}
// rest of your code
int main() {
  Init();
  // rest of your code
}
```
This way we can optimize the code.
