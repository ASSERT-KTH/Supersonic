This is an advanced C++ program that makes use of various data structures and algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Heavy-Light Decomposition (HLD), and Binary Indexed Trees (BITs). The optimization of such a program would require a deep understanding of both the C++ language and the underlying algorithms. However, there are some general practices that can be applied to optimize any C++ program.

Here are some areas that can be improved:

1. **Avoid using global variables:** Global variables might cause unnecessary memory usage if they are not released properly. By limiting the scope of the variables, you can ensure that they are deallocated when they are no longer needed. However, since the variable `chains` is used across multiple functions, we'll leave it as a global variable for now.

2. **Improve I/O operations:** The `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` line can speed up I/O operations by decoupling the C and C++ standard streams. Also, using '\n' instead of `std::endl` can avoid unnecessary flushing of the buffer, which can improve the performance of output operations.

3. **Avoid unnecessary computation:** In the DFS function, you are checking if `a[v].par == 0` for each element in the adjacency list `g[u]`. Instead, you can remove the parent from the adjacency list before starting the DFS, which can eliminate the need for this check.

4. **Use appropriate data structures:** The usage of `std::map` and `std::set` can be replaced with `std::unordered_map` and `std::unordered_set` respectively to improve lookup time from O(logn) to O(1) on average. However, this might increase the memory usage slightly.

5. **Use `const` references when passing large objects:** When passing large objects such as `std::vector` or `std::string`, using `const` references can avoid unnecessary copying of the objects.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 200005;
struct node {
  int cnt, par, lev, inp;
  int chn, idx, col, adj;
};
vector<int> g[MAXN];
node a[MAXN];
int bit[2 * MAXN];
int chains = 0;
vector<int> chain[MAXN];
unordered_map<int, int> col[MAXN];
unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>> pos[MAXN];
int root[MAXN];

void Init() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  int n, q;
  cin >> n >> q;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    g[u].push_back(v);
    g[v].push_back(u);
  }
  a[n].par = -1;
  a[n].lev = 1;
  a[n].chn = 0;
  a[n].idx = 0;
  root[0] = n;
}
//... rest of the code ...
int main() {
  Init();
  //... rest of the code ...
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that this is a complex program and these are just basic optimizations. To further improve performance, you would need to optimize the underlying algorithms and data structures, which might require a significant rewrite of the program.
