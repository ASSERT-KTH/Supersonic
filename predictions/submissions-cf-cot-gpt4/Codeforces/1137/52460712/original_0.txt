The original program is a complex one, involving graph theory and depth-first search (DFS). And it has already been written quite optimally. However, there are still some minor changes we can make for further optimization and clean code.

1. `gc` function: This function has a loop that retrieves a character until it is either '0' or '1'. We can simplify this function by removing the loop and just returning the character obtained. The function should be called only when the input is known to be either '0' or '1', and this should be handled by the caller, not the function itself.

2. `id` function: This function does a simple calculation and returns the result. It is used multiple times throughout the code. The function call overhead can be avoided by replacing the function calls with the calculation itself.

3. `dfsdp` function: The function checks if a node has been visited before calling itself for the node's children. It can be optimized by checking the visited status of the children inside the loop, before the recursive call.

4. Array `open`: This is a two-dimension array that uses a lot of memory. If it is possible to reduce the dimensions or the size of this array, it would save a lot of memory.

5. Variable `ntmp`: This variable is used as a temporary counter, but it is recalculated every time in the loop. We can keep track of `ntmp` outside the loop and avoid this recalculation.

6. Initialization of `dp` array: The `dp` array is used to store the maximum depth of each node, but it is not initialized. Initializing this array to a very small value would ensure that the maximum operation works correctly for all nodes, even the ones that haven't been visited.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int M = 100000 + 10, N = 50 * M;
inline void dn(int &x, int y) {
  if (y < x)
    x = y;
}
char gc() {
  return getchar();
}
int n, m, d;
bool open[M][50 + 5];
vector<int> e[N], escc[N];
int nscc, idscc[N], dfn[N], lowlink[N], clo;
int stk[N], top;
bool instk[N];
void dfscc(int k) {
  dfn[k] = lowlink[k] = ++clo;
  instk[stk[top++] = k] = true;
  for (int &p : e[k]) {
    if (!dfn[p])
      dfscc(p), dn(lowlink[k], lowlink[p]);
    else if (instk[p])
      dn(lowlink[k], dfn[p]);
  }
  if (lowlink[k] == dfn[k]) {
    ++nscc;
    while (top && stk[top] != k) {
      instk[stk[--top]] = false;
      idscc[stk[top]] = nscc;
    }
  }
}
void getSCC(int n) {
  for (int k = 1; k <= n; ++k)
    if (!dfn[k])
      dfscc(k);
  for (int k = 1; k <= n; ++k) {
    for (int &p : e[k]) {
      if (idscc[k] != idscc[p])
        escc[idscc[k]].push_back(idscc[p]);
    }
  }
}
int ops[N];
int dp[N] = {-1e9}; // initialize to a very small value
bool vis[N];
int dfsdp(int k) {
  if (!vis[k]) {
    for (auto p : escc[k])
      if (!vis[p])
        dp[k] = max(dp[k], dfsdp(p));
    dp[k] += ops[k];
    vis[k] = 1;
  }
  return dp[k];
}
int main() {
  scanf("%d%d%d", &n, &m, &d);
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    scanf("%d%d", &u, &v);
    for (int j = 1; j <= d; ++j)
      e[(u - 1) * d + j].push_back((v - 1) * d + j % d + 1);
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
    for (int j = 1; j <= d; ++j)
      open[i][j] = gc() - '0';
  getSCC(n * d);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    int tmp[50], ntmp = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j <= d; ++j)
      if (open[i][j])
        tmp[ntmp++] = idscc[(i - 1) * d + j];
    sort(tmp, tmp + ntmp);
    for (int j = 0; j < ntmp; ++j)
      ++ops[tmp[j]];
  }
  printf("%d", dfsdp(idscc[(1 - 1) * d + 1]));
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this optimization is based on the assumption that the given input is correct and well-formed. If this assumption cannot be made, some safety checks would need to be added, which might make the program slightly less efficient.
