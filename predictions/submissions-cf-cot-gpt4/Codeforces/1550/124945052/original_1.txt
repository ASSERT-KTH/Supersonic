The core of this program seems to be the `solve()` function where it takes an input `n`, then it generates a sequence of numbers by pushing `lastPush + 2` to `ans` vector, and decrementing `n` by the same amount. This continues until `n` becomes less than `lastPush + 2`, in which case, `n` itself is pushed to `ans` and `n` is set to zero. 

Steps to optimize:
1. The `mark` array and the associated filling loop are not used anywhere in the program. This array uses unnecessary memory and the loop wastes processing time. So, we can safely remove this array and the loop.
2. The `gcd` function and the two sorting functions are also not used in the code, which can be removed.
3. Instead of using the `push_back` function to add elements to the vector `ans`, we can use the `emplace_back` function which is usually faster as it constructs the new element in place, eliminating the need for a copy or move operation.
4. The `ans` vector size is being printed but the actual vector `ans` is not used anywhere else. So, instead of storing the sequence in a vector, we can just increment a counter for each number to be stored.

Optimized program:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#define ll long long int
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  int counter = 1; // count 1 as the first element
  n--;
  int lastPush = 1;
  while (n > 0) {
    if (lastPush + 2 >= n) {
      lastPush += 2;
      n -= n;
    } else {
      lastPush += 2;
      n -= lastPush;
    }
    counter++; // increment the counter instead of pushing to vector
  }
  cout << counter << "\n"; // print the counter
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version of the program will have significantly reduced memory usage as it no longer uses a vector or an array. The running time will also be reduced as it removes unused functions and the loop that initializes the `mark` array.
