Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid the use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as this header file includes too many unnecessary header files, which increases the compilation time. Instead, only include the necessary header files.
2. Remove unused Macros, Constants, Functions, and Template.
3. The array `mark` is initialized but never used, so we can remove it.
4. The `push_back` function is costly. We can avoid it by directly assigning values to the vector at index.
5. Instead of calling `ans.size()` every time to get the size of the vector, we can maintain a counter variable to keep track of the size.
6. Use `ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);` to speed up cin & cout.
7. The condition `lastPush + 2 >= n` in the while loop is checking if the next number to be added is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, then it adds `n` to ans and decreases `n` by `n` (which is just setting `n` to 0). In the else part, it is just adding `lastPush + 2` to `ans` and decreasing `n` by `lastPush`. This can be optimized by just directly adding the remaining `n` to `ans` if `lastPush + 2` is greater than `n`. This way, we can remove the redundancy in the if condition and make it easier to understand.

Here is the optimized code with the above mentioned improvements:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

#define ll long long int
#define vl vector<ll>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    ll n;
    cin >> n;
    vl ans(n);
    ll lastPush = 1;
    ans[0] = 1;
    n--;
    ll size = 1;
    while (n > 0) {
        if (lastPush + 2 > n) {
            ans[size++] = n;
            n = 0;
        } else {
            lastPush += 2;
            ans[size++] = lastPush;
            n -= lastPush;
        }
    }
    cout << size << "\n";
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
  
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t-- > 0) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```
