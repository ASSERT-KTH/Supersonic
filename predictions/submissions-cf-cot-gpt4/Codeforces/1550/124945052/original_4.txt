This program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. The `mark` array is initialized and filled with zeroes, but it is never used anywhere in the program. We can remove this array to save memory.

2. The function `gcd` is defined but not used anywhere in the program. We can remove this function to make the code cleaner.

3. The functions `sortdec` and `sortace` are defined but not used anywhere in the program. We can remove these functions to make the code cleaner.

4. The `lastPush` variable is increased by 2 in every iteration of the while loop, but this information is not used anywhere. We can remove this variable and the corresponding line to make the code cleaner.

5. The check `if (lastPush + 2 >= n)` is unnecessary because we can just push `n` to `ans` directly and subtract `n` from `n`, which is always `0`. We can optimize this part of the code.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long int
#define sz(x) ((int)(x).size())
#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()
#define fi first
#define se second
#define vi vector<int>
#define vl vector<ll>
#define pii pair<int, int>
#define loop(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
const ll mod = 1e9 + 7;
const ll MAX_VALUE = 1e9;
using namespace std;
template <typename T> using minpq = priority_queue<T, vector<T>, greater<T>>;

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vl ans;
  ans.push_back(1);
  n--;
  while (n > 0) {
    ans.push_back(n);
    n -= n;
  }
  cout << ans.size() << "\n";
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
