The primary optimization opportunities in this code are:

1. Avoiding unnecessary use of vectors and its push_back operation to reduce memory usage and improve performance.
2. Avoiding the use of an unnecessary array 'mark' which is declared and initialized, but never utilized.
3. Avoiding the use of an unnecessary if-else construct by simplifying the logic inside the while loop.
4. Avoiding the unnecessary use of template declaration for priority_queue.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define ll long long int
#define loop(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)

using namespace std;

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  int lastPush = 1;
  ll count = 1;
  n--;
  while (n > lastPush + 2) {
    lastPush += 2;
    n -= lastPush;
    count++;
  }
  cout << count + 1 << "\n";
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Optimization steps explained:

1. Replaced the vector 'ans' with a counter variable 'count'. Instead of storing all the values in a vector, we simply increment the counter variable each time we would have pushed a value onto the vector. This reduces memory usage significantly and speeds up the program by avoiding the overhead of managing a dynamic data structure.

2. Removed the 'mark' array as it was declared and initialized but never used anywhere in the code.

3. Simplified the if-else construct inside the while loop. The condition 'lastPush + 2 >= n' was checking if the next value to be pushed would be greater than or equal to 'n'. If it was, the code was pushing 'n' onto the vector, incrementing 'lastPush' by 2 and setting 'n' to 0. This is the equivalent of breaking the loop, so we can simplify this by checking if 'n' is greater than 'lastPush + 2' at the start of the loop.

4. Removed the unused template declaration for priority_queue. There was no need for this template as it was not used in the program. Removing it improves code clarity and reduces memory usage.
