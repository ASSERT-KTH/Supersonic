The given C/C++ program is already pretty optimized but there are a few small things we can do to further increase the speed of the program.

1. Remove Unused Code: The mark array and the gcd function are not used in the program. Removing these would reduce memory usage and declutter the code.

2. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: This header file includes quite a lot of files, which can significantly slow down the compilation process. It's better to include only the necessary header files.

3. Avoid using `std::endl` in place of '\n': `std::endl` is significantly slower than '\n' because it causes a flush of the output buffer in addition to inserting a newline, while '\n' just inserts a newline.

4. Avoid global variables when possible: Global variables may slow down the program because they are stored in the heap rather than the stack.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define ll long long int
#define vi vector<int>
#define vl vector<ll>

const ll mod = 1e9 + 7;
const ll MAX_VALUE = 1e9;

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vl ans;
  ans.push_back(1);
  n--;
  int lastPush = 1;
  while (n > 0) {
    if (lastPush + 2 >= n) {
      ans.push_back(n);
      lastPush += 2;
      n -= n;
    } else {
      ans.push_back(lastPush + 2);
      lastPush += 2;
      n -= lastPush;
    }
  }
  cout << ans.size() << "\n";
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that although these optimizations may improve speed and memory usage, they might not significantly affect the program's performance in reality because the impact of these optimizations is usually minimal. However, these are good practices to follow in general.
