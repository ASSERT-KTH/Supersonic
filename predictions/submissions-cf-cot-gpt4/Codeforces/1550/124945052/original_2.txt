The given C++ code calls a function `solve` for `t` number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a number `n` and generates a vector `ans` such that each next number is the previous number plus two until `n` is exhausted. Ultimately, it prints the size of the `ans` vector. 

There are several ways to optimize this code:

1. Unnecessary usage of `mark` array: The `mark` array is defined and initialized but never used in the code. We can remove it to save memory.

2. Redundant check in the while loop: The check `if (lastPush + 2 >= n)` is redundant because it's equivalent to `if (n <= 3)`. In this case, we can directly push `n` to the vector and break the loop.

3. No need to store all the numbers: We donâ€™t need to store all the numbers in the `ans` vector. We just need to count the numbers. This will reduce memory usage.

4. Use of `ll` for `n` and `lastPush` is unnecessary: `n` and `lastPush` can be of `int` type because it is guaranteed that `n` will be less than or equal to 5000. 

5. Avoid the use of macro: It's better to avoid the use of macro for loop. We can use the traditional for loop which is more readable and less error prone.

6. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of files and using it will increase your program's compile time significantly. It's better to include only those header files which are necessary.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int lastPush = 1;
  int count = 1;
  n--;
  while (n > 0) {
    if (n <= 3) {
      count++;
      break;
    } else {
      lastPush += 2;
      n -= lastPush;
      count++;
    }
  }
  cout << count << "\n";
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  for(int i=0; i<t; i++) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
