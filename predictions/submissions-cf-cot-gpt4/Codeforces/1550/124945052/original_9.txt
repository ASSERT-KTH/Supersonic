This program is already quite optimized. However, there are a few minor changes that can be made to improve memory usage and running time.

1. The "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" statement includes many unnecessary headers, which increases the time to compile the program. It's better to only include the headers that are required for this program.

2. The "mark" array is not used anywhere in the program, so we can remove it to save memory.

3. We can avoid using push_back method in vectors as it might lead to reallocation of the entire vector when the current allocated memory is filled. Instead, we can use the fact that the size of the vector ans is always the same as the input value n.

Let's apply these optimizations:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define ll long long int
#define loop(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
using namespace std;
const ll mod = 1e9 + 7;
const ll MAX_VALUE = 1e9;
void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> ans(n);
  ans[0]=1;
  n--;
  int lastPush = 1;
  int i=1;
  while (n > 0) {
    if (lastPush + 2 >= n) {
      ans[i++] = n;
      lastPush += 2;
      n -= n;
    } else {
      ans[i++] = lastPush + 2;
      lastPush += 2;
      n -= lastPush;
    }
  }
  cout << ans.size() << "\n";
}
int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized version, we only included necessary headers, removed the unused "mark" array, and avoided using push_back method in vectors which might lead to reallocation.
