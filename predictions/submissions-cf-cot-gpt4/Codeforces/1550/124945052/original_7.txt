This program can be optimized in the following ways:

- The `mark` array is being created and initialized but never used, we can remove this to save memory.
- The `gcd` function, `sortdec`, `sortace` functions, and the `minpq` template are defined but not used in the program. We should remove these unused functions and templates to clean up the code.
- The `sz`, `all`, `fi`, `se`, `vi`, `vl`, `pii`, `mod`, and `MAX_VALUE` macros and constants are not used in the code, so we can remove them.
- Instead of using `bits/stdc++.h`, we can only include the necessary libraries to speed up compilation.
- The `lastPush` variable is incremented by 2 in each iteration, but it is not used in the condition of the if statement. So we can remove the incrementation of `lastPush` inside the loop.
- We can optimize the output operation by adding `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` at the beginning of the `main` function.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define loop(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
using namespace std;
typedef long long int ll;

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> ans;
  ans.push_back(1);
  n--;
  while (n > 0) {
    if (2 >= n) {
      ans.push_back(n);
      n -= n;
    } else {
      ans.push_back(2);
      n -= 2;
    }
  }
  cout << ans.size() << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: This optimized program assumes that the input and output of the program are correct and does not optimize for error checking or input validation. Also, the optimizations are made with the assumption that the unused parts of the original program are not required for future modifications or extensions of the code.
