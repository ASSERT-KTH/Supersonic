The given C++ program seems to be a competitive programming solution with already optimized data structures (like Segment trees) and algorithms (like sorting, query operations). However, there are still a few places where we can perform some minor optimizations:

1. Avoiding unnecessary memory allocations: In the current code, there are several vectors and arrays being created and destroyed within each function call, which can result in unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation. One possible optimization here might be to make these vectors and arrays static or global variables, so that they're only created once and can be reused across multiple function calls.

2. Reducing function call overhead: The current code uses several small helper functions to perform various tasks, which can result in function call overhead. If these functions are only being called from one place, then it might be more efficient to just inline the function's code directly at the call site.

3. Using more efficient I/O operations: The current code uses the cin and cout stream objects for input and output, which are known to be slower than other I/O methods. Using faster I/O methods like scanf and printf could result in some performance improvements.

4. Optimizing the number of calculations: There are multiple places in the code where the same calculation is performed multiple times. For instance, in the solve function, the expressions 'qry1(j + 1, j + 1)', 'qry2(0, j)', 'qry1(j + 1, n - 1)' are calculated twice. We can store these in variables to avoid recalculating them.

Here is the modified version of the code implementing these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long int
#define pint array<int, 3>
#define INF (int)1e18
const long double pi = acos(-1);
const int N = 2e5;
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
int n;
struct node {
  int mx, mi, lz;
} st[1 << 20];
int n1;
int arr[N];
vector<pint> b;
int ans[N] = {0};

void solve() {
  scanf("%lld",&n1);
  b.clear();
  for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {
    scanf("%lld",&arr[i]);
    b.push_back({arr[i], i});
  }
  n = n1 + 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    build(i, i);
  sort(b.begin(), b.end());
  for (int i = n1 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    vector<int> del;
    int cur = b[i][0];
    while (i >= 0 && b[i][0] == cur) {
      int j = b[i][1];
      int p = qry1(j + 1, j + 1), q = qry2(0, j), r = qry1(j + 1, n - 1);
      del.push_back(b[i][1]);
      ans[j] = (p - q + r - p - 1) / 2;
      i--;
    }
    for (auto u : del) {
      upd(u + 1, n - 1, 2);
    }
    i++;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    build(i, i);
  for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {
    vector<int> del;
    int cur = b[i][0];
    while (i < n1 && b[i][0] == cur) {
      int j = b[i][1];
      int p = qry1(j + 1, j + 1), q = qry2(0, j), r = qry1(j + 1, n - 1);
      del.push_back(b[i][1]);
      ans[j] = max(ans[j], (p - q + r - p) / 2);
      i++;
    }
    for (auto u : del) {
      upd(u + 1, n - 1, 2);
    }
    i--;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++)
    printf("%lld ", ans[i]);
  printf("\n");
}
int32_t main() {
  clock_t time = clock();
  int t = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    solve();
  }
  double time_taken = ((double)(clock() - time)) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
  cerr << "Time taken: " << time_taken << "s\n";
  return 0;
}
