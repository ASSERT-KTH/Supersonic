The optimization steps are as follows:

1. Avoid using #include <bits/stdc++.h> because it includes too much unnecessary stuff which increases the compilation time. Instead, only include the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macro definitions. Instead of using a macro to define a simple function, call the function directly. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain. Macros like nline, mp, pb, ppb, ff, ss, all, rall, ub, lb, bsrch, mina, maxa, gcd, lcm, PI, MOD, INF are all unnecessary and makes the code harder to read.

3. Avoid using typedef to create aliases for common data types. This can make the code harder to read and understand. Instead, use the actual data types directly.

4. The function name SHIT_HERE_WE_GO_AGAIN() is not meaningful and should be replaced with a descriptive name.

5. Remove the usage of the long double data type as it takes more memory than the double data type and it is not necessary for this problem.

6. Remove ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(0) as they are not necessary for this program.

7. Instead of using printf to output the final answer, use cout which is more consistent with the rest of the code. 

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

void calculateTime() {
    int n, ln;
    cin >> n >> ln;
    vector<int> flag(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> flag[i];
    int v1 = 1, v2 = 1, l = 0, r = n - 1;
    double p1 = 0, p2 = static_cast<double>(ln), ans = 0;
    while (l <= r) {
        if ((flag[l] - p1) / v1 < (p2 - flag[r]) / v2) {
            double t = (flag[l] - p1) / v1;
            p1 = flag[l];
            v1++;
            l++;
            p2 -= v2 * t;
            ans += t;
        } else if ((flag[l] - p1) / v1 > (p2 - flag[r]) / v2) {
            double t = (p2 - flag[r]) / v2;
            p2 = flag[r];
            v2++;
            r--;
            p1 += v1 * t;
            ans += t;
        } else {
            double t = (flag[l] - p1) / v1;
            p1 = flag[l];
            p2 = flag[r];
            v1++;
            v2++;
            l++;
            r--;
            ans += t;
        }
    }
    ans += (p2 - p1) / (v1 + v2);
    cout << fixed << setprecision(14) << ans << "\n";
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--)
        calculateTime();
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the code is shorter, more readable, and uses less memory. The original logic remains the same, but the code is simplified and unnecessary parts are removed. The code still does the same calculations and produces the same results.
