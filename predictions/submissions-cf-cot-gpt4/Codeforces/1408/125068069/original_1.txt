Step 1:
The first optimization is to remove the #include <bits/stdc++.h> directive. This header file includes a large number of standard library headers, many of which are probably unused, which leads to longer compilation time. Instead, we should only include the headers that are actually being used.

Step 2:
Next, we use int64_t instead of int to represent 64-bit integers. This makes it clear what size of integer we're dealing with and can prevent bugs if the size of int is not what we expect on a particular platform.

Step 3:
The macro definitions are used throughout the code, but using macros can lead to hard-to-debug problems, so it's often better to use functions or constants instead. In this case, we can replace the macros with the equivalent code.

Step 4:
The function SHIT_HERE_WE_GO_AGAIN() is not descriptive and does not follow naming conventions. Using a more descriptive name can make the code easier to understand.

Step 5:
The main function contains an unnecessary loop. The value of t is always 1, so there's no need to loop. We can remove the loop.

Step 6:
In the function, we calculate (flag[l] - p1) / v1 and (p2 - flag[r]) / v2 multiple times. We can calculate these once and store the results in variables to avoid unnecessary calculations.

The optimized code is as follows:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdio>

using namespace std;

void calculateTime() {
    int64_t n, ln;
    cin >> n >> ln;
    vector<int64_t> flag(n);
    for (int64_t i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> flag[i];
    int64_t v1{1}, v2{1}, l{0}, r{n - 1};
    long double p1{0}, p2{static_cast<long double>(ln)}, ans{0};
    while (l <= r) {
        long double t1 = (flag[l] - p1) / v1;
        long double t2 = (p2 - flag[r]) / v2;
        if (t1 < t2) {
            p1 = flag[l];
            v1++;
            l++;
            p2 -= v2 * t1;
            ans += t1;
        } else if (t1 > t2) {
            p2 = flag[r];
            v2++;
            r--;
            p1 += v1 * t2;
            ans += t2;
        } else {
            p1 = flag[l];
            p2 = flag[r];
            v1++;
            v2++;
            l++;
            r--;
            ans += t1;
        }
    }
    ans += (p2 - p1) / (v1 + v2);
    printf("%.14Lf\n", ans);
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    calculateTime();
}
```
