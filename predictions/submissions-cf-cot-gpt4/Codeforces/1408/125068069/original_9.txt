Here are the possible optimizations I can find in the given C++ code:

1. Using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is generally discouraged because it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which can increase the compilation time. We should only include the needed libraries.

2. The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0);` statements are used to speed up cin and cout. However, these statements are unnecessary and can be removed because we are using `scanf` and `printf` for input and output.

3. The function name `SHIT_HERE_WE_GO_AGAIN` is not a good practice. We should use a more meaningful name.

4. The `long double` type is used for the variables `p1`, `p2`, `t`, and `ans`, but the code does not require the extra precision of `long double`. We could use `double` instead to save memory.

5. The variables `v1` and `v2` are initialized to `1`. But they can be initialized to `double` type instead of `int` because they are used in floating point arithmetic operations.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
#define int long long

void solve() {
  int n, ln;
  cin >> n >> ln;
  vector<int> flag(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> flag[i];
  double v1 = 1.0, v2 = 1.0, l = 0, r = n - 1;
  double p1 = 0, p2 = (double)ln, ans = 0;
  while (l <= r) {
    if ((flag[l] - p1) / v1 < (p2 - flag[r]) / v2) {
      double t = (flag[l] - p1) / v1;
      p1 = flag[l];
      v1++;
      l++;
      p2 -= v2 * t;
      ans += t;
    } else if ((flag[l] - p1) / v1 > (p2 - flag[r]) / v2) {
      double t = (p2 - flag[r]) / v2;
      p2 = flag[r];
      v2++;
      r--;
      p1 += v1 * t;
      ans += t;
    } else {
      double t = (flag[l] - p1) / v1;
      p1 = flag[l];
      p2 = flag[r];
      v1++;
      v2++;
      l++;
      r--;
      ans += t;
    }
  }
  ans += (p2 - p1) / (v1 + v2);
  printf("%.14f\n", ans);
}

int32_t main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should perform better in terms of both running time and memory usage.
