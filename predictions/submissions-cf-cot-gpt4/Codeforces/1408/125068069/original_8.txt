First, the `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes many libraries, which can lead to increased compilation time. It's better to only include the libraries that you need. In this case, only `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<set>`, and `<utility>` are used.

Second, using `#define` for common syntax such as `push_back` and `pop_back` doesn't really optimize the code, it just makes it harder to read and understand. It's better to use the standard syntax.

Third, using `#define` for mathematical calculations like `gcd` and `lcm` is also not recommended. It's better to create functions for these calculations. 

Fourth, the function name `SHIT_HERE_WE_GO_AGAIN` is not professional and doesn't describe what the function does. It's better to give a meaningful name.

Fifth, using `long double` for `p1`, `p2` and `t` is not necessary because `int` is sufficient for their calculations and usage.

Sixth, using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(0);` is not needed in this case, as the program doesn't mix C and C++ I/O, and the input is not large enough to require these optimizations.

Here is the optimized code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <utility>

void calculateTime() {
  int n, ln;
  std::cin >> n >> ln;
  std::vector<int> flag(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> flag[i];
  int v1 = 1, v2 = 1, l = 0, r = n - 1;
  int p1 = 0, p2 = ln, ans = 0;
  while (l <= r) {
    if ((flag[l] - p1) / v1 < (p2 - flag[r]) / v2) {
      int t = (flag[l] - p1) / v1;
      p1 = flag[l++];
      v1++;
      p2 -= v2 * t;
      ans += t;
    } else if ((flag[l] - p1) / v1 > (p2 - flag[r]) / v2) {
      int t = (p2 - flag[r]) / v2;
      p2 = flag[r--];
      v2++;
      p1 += v1 * t;
      ans += t;
    } else {
      int t = (flag[l] - p1) / v1;
      p1 = flag[l++];
      p2 = flag[r--];
      v1++;
      v2++;
      ans += t;
    }
  }
  ans += (p2 - p1) / (v1 + v2);
  printf("%.14d\n", ans);
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    calculateTime();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
