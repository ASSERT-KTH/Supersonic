The program appears to be well-written but there are some areas where it can be optimized. 

1. Avoid using "bits/stdc++.h" header as it includes all the standard libraries which increases the compile time. Instead, include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros and typedefs that are not used in the code.

3. The "FASTBOI" macro which is used to speed up I/O operations seems unnecessary as it is not used in the code. Hence, it can be removed.

4. Use of constant expressions: In C++, the 'constexpr' keyword can be used to specify that a value or a function will be evaluated at compile time, improving efficiency. For instance, the constants N and M can be declared as 'constexpr'.

5. The global variable 'h' can be moved inside the 'solve' function. This can potentially improve memory usage as it will be allocated and deallocated when the function is executed, rather than being present for the whole execution time of the program.

6. The 'check' function is constantly reallocating memory for the 's' vector inside the loop. This can be optimized by declaring 's' as a static variable or moving it outside the function.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
typedef vector<ll> vl;

constexpr int N = 1e5 + 70;
constexpr ll M = 1e9 + 7;

ll gcd(ll a, ll b) { return !b ? a : gcd(b, a % b); }
ll lcm(ll a, ll b) { return (a / gcd(a, b)) * b; }

bool check(ll x, ll n, ll w, ll m, ll* h, vl& s) {
  ll cur = 0, mm = 0;
  fill(s.begin(), s.end(), 0ll);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (i - w >= 0)
      cur -= s[i - w];
    if (h[i] >= x)
      continue;
    if (h[i] + cur < x) {
      s[i] = x - h[i] - cur;
      cur += s[i];
      mm += s[i];
    }
    if (mm > m)
      return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}

void solve() {
  ll n, m, w, h[N];
  vl s(N, 0ll);
  scanf("%lld%lld%lld", &n, &m, &w);
  ll mn = 1e18;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    scanf("%lld", h + i), mn = min(mn, h[i]);
  ll l = 0, r = mn + m, ans = 0;
  while (l <= r) {
    ll md = l + ((r - l) >> 1);
    if (check(md, n, w, m, h, s)) {
      ans = max(ans, md);
      l = md + 1;
    } else {
      r = md - 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%lld", ans);
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version:
1. I included only necessary headers instead of "bits/stdc++.h".
2. I removed unused macros and typedefs.
3. I declared 'N' and 'M' as constexpr to make them evaluated at compile time.
4. I moved 'h' inside the 'solve' function.
5. I moved 's' outside of the 'check' function and passed it as a reference to avoid reallocations inside the function.
