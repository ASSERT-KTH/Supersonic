The given program is already well optimized, but there are a few things that can be improved.

1. Including "bits/stdc++.h" header: This header file includes a lot of unnecessary headers which can increase the compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Using namespace std: This can sometimes cause name collision problems, it's better to use std:: before each standard library function or object.

3. scanf and printf: Although they are faster than cin and cout, they are less safe as they do not perform type checking. But since we are optimizing for running time, we can keep them.

4. Use of macros: Usage of macros like FASTBOI can hamper readability. It's better to write those lines in main function.

5. Variable Initialization: It's better to initialize variables when they are declared, so that they don't contain any garbage values.

6. The variable 't' is not necessary as it is always 1.

7. The variable 'M' is unused in the program.

Here is the optimized code with the mentioned improvements:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using ll = long long;
const int N = 1e5 + 70;
ll h[N];
bool check(ll x, ll n, ll m, ll w) {
  std::vector<ll> s(n, 0);
  ll cur = 0, mm = 0;
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (i - w >= 0)
      cur -= s[i - w];
    if (h[i] >= x)
      continue;
    if (h[i] + cur < x) {
      s[i] = x - h[i] - cur;
      cur += s[i];
      mm += s[i];
    }
    if (mm > m)
      return false;
  }
  return true;
}
void solve() {
  ll n, m, w;
  scanf("%lld%lld%lld", &n, &m, &w);
  ll mn = 1e18;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    scanf("%lld", h + i), mn = std::min(mn, h[i]);
  ll l = 0, r = mn + m, ans = 0;
  while (l <= r) {
    ll md = l + ((r - l) >> 1);
    if (check(md, n, m, w)) {
      ans = std::max(ans, md);
      l = md + 1;
    } else {
      r = md - 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%lld", ans);
}
int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);
  solve();
  puts("");
  return 0;
}
```

The optimize program has the same functionality as the original one with a slight improvement in readability and maintainability.
