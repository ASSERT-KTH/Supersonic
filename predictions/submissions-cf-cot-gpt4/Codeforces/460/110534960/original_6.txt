This program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Optimizing Memory Usage: The vector `s` in the `check` function is initialized with all zeros. As the vector `s` is only used locally and does not need to preserve any previous state, it could be more efficient to declare it as a static vector. This way, the same memory would be reused across multiple function calls, instead of allocating and de-allocating memory each time the function is called.

2. Optimizing Running Time: The `check` function is called multiple times in a binary search manner. Therefore, memoization can be used to store the results of previous calls to `check` to avoid repeated computation. 

3. Using `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout` for faster I/O.

4. Removing unused typedefs and macros. Unused typedefs and macros can unnecessarily increase the size of the binary and consume memory.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int N = 1e5 + 70;
const ll M = 1e9 + 7;
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) { return !b ? a : gcd(b, a % b); }
ll lcm(ll a, ll b) { return (a / gcd(a, b)) * b; }
ll n, m, w, h[N];
unordered_map<ll, bool> mp;
bool check(ll x) {
  static vector<ll> s(N, 0ll);
  fill(s.begin(), s.begin() + n, 0ll);
  ll cur = 0, mm = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (i - w >= 0)
      cur -= s[i - w];
    if (h[i] >= x)
      continue;
    if (h[i] + cur < x) {
      s[i] = x - h[i] - cur;
      cur += s[i];
      mm += s[i];
    }
    if (mm > m)
      return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}
void solve() {
  scanf("%lld%lld%lld", &n, &m, &w);
  ll mn = 1e18;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    scanf("%lld", h + i), mn = min(mn, h[i]);
  ll l = 0, r = mn + m, ans = 0;
  while (l <= r) {
    ll md = l + ((r - l) >> 1);
    if (mp.count(md) == 0)
      mp[md] = check(md);
    if (mp[md]) {
      ans = max(ans, md);
      l = md + 1;
    } else {
      r = md - 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%lld", ans);
}
int main() {
  int t = 1;
  for (int tt = 1; tt <= t; ++tt) {
    solve();
    puts("");
  }
}
```

Please note that some of the optimizations may not have a significant impact on the performance of the program depending on the specific use case.
