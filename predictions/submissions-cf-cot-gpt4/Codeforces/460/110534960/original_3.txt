This C++ program seems to be well optimized already. However, there are a few optimizations we can make:

1. Remove unused typedefs: There are several typedefs at the top of the program that are not used anywhere. These can be removed to reduce the memory usage and improve the readability of the code.

2. Use scanf and printf instead of cin and cout: scanf and printf are faster than cin and cout for reading and writing data, so we replace these for better performance.

3. Remove unused macro FASTBOI: The macro FASTBOI is defined but not used anywhere. This can also be removed to improve readability.

The rest of the code is already well optimized. The binary search algorithm used in this program is highly efficient, and the recursive gcd function is also optimized. 

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef vector<ll> vl;
const int N = 1e5 + 70;
const ll M = 1e9 + 7;
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) { return !b ? a : gcd(b, a % b); }
ll n, m, w, h[N];
bool check(ll x) {
  vl s(n, 0ll);
  ll cur = 0, mm = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (i - w >= 0)
      cur -= s[i - w];
    if (h[i] >= x)
      continue;
    if (h[i] + cur < x) {
      s[i] = x - h[i] - cur;
      cur += s[i];
      mm += s[i];
    }
    if (mm > m)
      return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}
void solve() {
  scanf("%lld%lld%lld", &n, &m, &w);
  ll mn = 1e18;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    scanf("%lld", h + i), mn = min(mn, h[i]);
  ll l = 0, r = mn + m, ans = 0;
  while (l <= r) {
    ll md = l + ((r - l) >> 1);
    if (check(md)) {
      ans = max(ans, md);
      l = md + 1;
    } else {
      r = md - 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%lld", ans);
}
int main() {
  int t = 1;
  for (int tt = 1; tt <= t; ++tt) {
    solve();
    puts("");
  }
}
```
