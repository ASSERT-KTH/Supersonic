The given code is already optimized in terms of algorithmic complexity. However, there are minor changes that could be applied for slightly better performance. We can focus on reducing unnecessary computation, avoiding unnecessary memory allocations, and using more efficient IO operations.

1. unnecessary computation in check function: `if (h[i] + cur < x)` This computation is done even when `h[i] >= x`. We can avoid this by adding an else statement.

2. unnecessary memory allocation in check function: `vl s(n, 0ll);` is created for each call of the check function. This can be avoided by declaring this vector globally and clearing it in the beginning of the check function.

3. using scanf and printf instead of cin and cout: scanf and printf are faster than cin and cout when we turn off synchronization with C's stdio. We already have `FASTBOI` macro in the code which turns off the synchronization, but we are not using cin and cout. We can simply remove this macro.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef long double ld;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pll;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<ll> vl;
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
const int N = 1e5 + 70;
const ll M = 1e9 + 7;
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) { return !b ? a : gcd(b, a % b); }
ll lcm(ll a, ll b) { return (a / gcd(a, b)) * b; }
ll n, m, w, h[N];
vl s(N, 0ll);
bool check(ll x) {
  s.clear();
  ll cur = 0, mm = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (i - w >= 0)
      cur -= s[i - w];
    if (h[i] >= x)
      continue;
    else if (h[i] + cur < x) {
      s[i] = x - h[i] - cur;
      cur += s[i];
      mm += s[i];
    }
    if (mm > m)
      return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}
void solve() {
  scanf("%lld%lld%lld", &n, &m, &w);
  ll mn = 1e18;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    scanf("%lld", h + i), mn = min(mn, h[i]);
  ll l = 0, r = mn + m, ans = 0;
  while (l <= r) {
    ll md = l + ((r - l) >> 1);
    if (check(md)) {
      ans = max(ans, md);
      l = md + 1;
    } else {
      r = md - 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%lld", ans);
}
int main() {
  int t = 1;
  for (int tt = 1; tt <= t; ++tt) {
    solve();
    puts("");
  }
}
```
