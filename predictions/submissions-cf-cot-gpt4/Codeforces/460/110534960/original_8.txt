The program is already quite optimized, but there are a few areas where we can make some improvements:

1) Avoid using 'bits/stdc++.h': This header file includes quite a large number of standard C++ libraries, which can slow down the compilation time. Instead, include only the libraries that are actually used in your code.

2) Avoid using 'using namespace std': This can also slow down the compile time and can lead to naming conflicts. It is better to use the std:: prefix when necessary.

3) Avoid using typedef: In modern C++, using typedef is often considered bad practice. Instead, use using declarations.

4) Avoid using global variables: Global variables are usually a bad practice as they can make the code hard to understand and debug. It is better to make them local to main or pass them as function arguments.

5) Avoid using macros: Macros can make code hard to debug and understand. In this case, the FASTBOI macro is not necessary and can be removed.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
using std::vector;
using std::min;
using std::max;
using ll = long long;
const int N = 1e5 + 70;
const ll M = 1e9 + 7;
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) { return !b ? a : gcd(b, a % b); }
ll lcm(ll a, ll b) { return (a / gcd(a, b)) * b; }
bool check(ll x, ll n, ll w, ll m, vector<ll>& h, vector<ll>& s) {
  ll cur = 0, mm = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (i - w >= 0)
      cur -= s[i - w];
    if (h[i] >= x)
      continue;
    if (h[i] + cur < x) {
      s[i] = x - h[i] - cur;
      cur += s[i];
      mm += s[i];
    }
    if (mm > m)
      return false;
  }
  return true;
}
void solve() {
  ll n, m, w;
  scanf("%lld%lld%lld", &n, &m, &w);
  vector<ll> h(N);
  vector<ll> s(n, 0ll);
  ll mn = 1e18;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    scanf("%lld", &h[i]), mn = min(mn, h[i]);
  ll l = 0, r = mn + m, ans = 0;
  while (l <= r) {
    ll md = l + ((r - l) >> 1);
    if (check(md, n, w, m, h, s)) {
      ans = max(ans, md);
      l = md + 1;
    } else {
      r = md - 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%lld", ans);
}
int main() {
  solve();
  puts("");
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code should have the same functionality as the original code, but with improved compile time and possibly runtime as well.
