This program seems to be doing some mathematical calculations and uses the STL set to track unique elements in an array. Here are some steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary macros: Macros like #define ll long long are not used in the code, so there's no need to define them.
2. Replace cin and cout with scanf and printf: Although cin and cout are easier to use, scanf and printf are faster in terms of execution time.
3. Replace the set with an unordered_set: Since the order of elements is not important here, using an unordered_set instead of set can speed up the execution because unordered_set has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertions and lookups while set has O(log n).
4. Remove the unnecessary clear and insert at the end of the function: The 'f' set is cleared and then the current element is inserted again. This operation is not necessary because the current element was inserted at the beginning of the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <unordered_set>
#include <cstdio>
#include <ctime>
#define in insert
#define pb push_back
#define fi first
#define se second
#define fast ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL); srand(time(0));
using namespace std;
void fun() {
  int n, r;
  scanf("%d %d",&n,&r);
  unordered_set<int> f;
  int a[n];
  for (auto &i : a)
    scanf("%d", &i);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int k = 1;
    for (int j = 2; j * j <= a[i]; j++) {
      int kk = 0;
      while (a[i] % j == 0)
        a[i] /= j, kk++;
      if (kk & 1)
        k *= j;
    }
    if (a[i] != 1)
      k *= a[i];
    a[i] = k;
  }
  int ans = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (f.find(a[i]) == f.end())
      f.in(a[i]);
    else
      ans++;
  }
  printf("%d\n", ans);
}
int main() {
  int t = 1;
  scanf("%d",&t);
  while (t--) {
    fun();
  }
}
```

Please note that while these optimizations will generally speed up the program, their impact will depend on the specific inputs and context where the program is running.
