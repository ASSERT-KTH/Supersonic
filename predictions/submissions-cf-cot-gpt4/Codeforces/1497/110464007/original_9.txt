The original program executes a few operations that can be optimized for better performance. Here are the optimizations we can make:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which can increase the compilation time. Instead, include only those libraries which are being used in the program.
2. Avoid macro definitions for common operations like `push_back`, `insert`, etc. It’s better to use these operations directly as it enhances code readability.
3. The `while (a[i] % j == 0)` loop can be skipped if `a[i]` is not divisible by `j` at the first place. We can add a check for this condition.
4. We can remove the `f.in(a[i]);` after `f.clear();` because it’s unnecessary. The same statement is executed just before the end of the loop.
5. The array `a` is not initialized dynamically. In C++, the size of the array should be a constant. We can use `std::vector` instead of the array.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <ctime>

using namespace std;

void fun() {
  int n, r;
  cin >> n >> r;
  set<int> f;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (auto &i : a)
    cin >> i;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int k = 1;
    for (int j = 2; j * j <= a[i]; j++) {
      int kk = 0;
      if (a[i] % j == 0) {
        while (a[i] % j == 0)
          a[i] /= j, kk++;
        if (kk & 1)
          k *= j;
      }
    }
    if (a[i] != 1)
      k *= a[i];
    a[i] = k;
  }
  int ans = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (f.find(a[i]) == f.end())
      f.insert(a[i]);
    else {
      ans++;
      f.clear();
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    fun();
  }
}
```

This optimized version includes only necessary libraries, uses more readable code, skips unnecessary operations, and initializes the array dynamically.
