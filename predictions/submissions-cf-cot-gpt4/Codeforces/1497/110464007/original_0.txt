Optimization Steps:

1. The first optimization we can apply is to replace the bits/stdc++.h library with only the necessary libraries. 
   bits/stdc++.h is a GCC-specific library that includes many standard libraries. It's not a standard header file in C++ and it's not supported by other compilers. 
   It also increases the compilation time as it includes all the libraries irrespective of whether we use them or not in the program. We can replace it with iostream, set, and vector.

2. The macro definitions at the start of the program are not used anywhere and can be removed. 

3. The program is using an array to store integers which is not efficient as you need to know the size at compile time and it doesn't provide the flexibility of resizing. We can replace it with a vector which is a dynamic array and can grow in size as needed.

4. The 'srand(time(0));' statement is not needed as there is no random number generation in this program.

5. The 'else' statement in the second for loop is clearing and inserting the element in the set in two steps. We can make it one step by using the insert function which returns a pair. The second element of the pair is false if the element already exists in the set.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void fun() {
  int n, r;
  cin >> n >> r;
  set<int> f;
  vector<int> a(n);
  
  for (auto &i : a)
    cin >> i;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int k = 1;
    for (int j = 2; j * j <= a[i]; j++) {
      int kk = 0;
      while (a[i] % j == 0)
        a[i] /= j, kk++;
      if (kk & 1)
        k *= j;
    }
    if (a[i] != 1)
      k *= a[i];

    a[i] = k;
  }

  int ans = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    auto pair = f.insert(a[i]);
    if (!pair.second) // if the element already exists in the set
      ans++, f.clear(), f.insert(a[i]);
  }

  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    fun();
  }
}
```
The optimized program is efficient in terms of compilation time and memory usage. It uses only the necessary libraries and makes efficient use of dynamic storage with vector instead of array. The 'insert' function of set is also used more efficiently to reduce unnecessary operations.
