This program seems to be a competitive programming problem solution. It appears to be reading a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two numbers, `n` and `r`, and then `n` more numbers. It seems to be performing some factorization on the input numbers and placing them in a set. Let's optimize it step by step:

1. Use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is quite large and includes a lot of unnecessary code. Include only the necessary header files. This can speed up the compile time.

2. The use of `#define` for common functions: This is unnecessary and can make the code harder to understand. It's better to just use the functions directly.

3. Avoid dynamic size array `int a[n];` instead use vector to handle dynamic size.

4. The clear function `f.clear()` is called before `f.in(a[i])` which seems not necessary as `a[i]` is already present in the set.

5. The `a[i]` is inserted twice in the set when `a[i]` is not found in the set.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void fun() {
  int n, r;
  cin >> n >> r;
  set<int> f;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (auto &i : a)
    cin >> i;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int k = 1;
    for (int j = 2; j * j <= a[i]; j++) {
      int kk = 0;
      while (a[i] % j == 0)
        a[i] /= j, kk++;
      if (kk & 1)
        k *= j;
    }
    if (a[i] != 1)
      k *= a[i];
    a[i] = k;
  }
  int ans = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (f.find(a[i]) == f.end())
      f.insert(a[i]);
    else {
      ans++;
      f.clear();
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    fun();
  }
}
```

This optimized code is easier to read and understand, and it avoids some unnecessary operations.
