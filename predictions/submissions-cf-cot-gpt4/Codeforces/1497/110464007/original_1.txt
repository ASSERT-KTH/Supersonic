To optimize the given C/C++ code, we can follow these steps:

1. Avoid unnecessary `#define` statements. For example, `#define in insert` and `#define pb push_back` are not used in this code. Removing these will make the code cleaner and easier to read.

2. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because it includes a lot of libraries which are not needed in this code. This entire header file is loaded into memory even if we don't use all the libraries, which is inefficient. We can instead include only the specific libraries we need, like `<iostream>`, `<set>` and `<time.h>`.

3. The array `a` is being resized at runtime, which is not efficient. It's better to use a vector instead of an array for dynamic size.

4. In the function `fun()`, there are two `f.in(a[i]);` statements which are redundant. We can remove one of them.

5. Also, in the function `fun()`, we are using `f.find(a[i]) == f.end()` to check if an element is in the set. This is not efficient because it takes O(n) time. Instead, we can use `f.count(a[i])` which takes O(1) time.

6. The `srand(time(0));` statement is not necessary in this program. So, we can remove it.

Now, let's modify the code according to these steps:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void fun() {
  int n, r;
  cin >> n >> r;
  set<int> f;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (auto &i : a)
    cin >> i;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int k = 1;
    for (int j = 2; j * j <= a[i]; j++) {
      int kk = 0;
      while (a[i] % j == 0)
        a[i] /= j, kk++;
      if (kk & 1)
        k *= j;
    }
    if (a[i] != 1)
      k *= a[i];
    a[i] = k;
  }
  int ans = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (f.count(a[i]) == 0) {
      f.insert(a[i]);
      ans++;
    } else {
      f.clear();
      f.insert(a[i]);
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    fun();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Remember that, the optimization process depends on the specific requirements of your program. These optimizations will improve the performance of this specific program, but they may not apply to every program.
