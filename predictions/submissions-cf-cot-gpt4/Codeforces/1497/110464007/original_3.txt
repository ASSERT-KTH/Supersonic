The given C++ program does some mathematical calculations and prints the result. There are a few places where the program can be optimized for both execution time and memory usage.

1. The usage of `set` is not optimal. In the loop after the calculations, the program checks if an element is in the set and if not, it inserts it. This is an unnecessary check since `std::set::insert` function returns a pair, where the second element of the pair will be `false` if the element was already in the set, thereby eliminating the need for an explicit check. This will speed up the execution since unnecessary searches are avoided.

2. There's a redundant insertion of the element `a[i]` into the set `f` after clearing the set. This is unnecessary as the element was already inserted before the `else` clause.

3. Instead of using `#define` to create shortcuts for frequently used functions or values, it's better to use `typedef` or `using` for type aliasing, and constants for values. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.

4. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes more libraries than needed, which increases compilation time.

5. Instead of using `using namespace std`, it's better to use specific `std` components. This not only reduces the scope of the `std` namespace but also avoids naming conflicts.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <ctime>

using ll = long long;
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::set;

void fun() {
  int n, r;
  cin >> n >> r;
  set<int> f;
  int a[n];
  for (auto &i : a)
    cin >> i;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int k = 1;
    for (int j = 2; j * j <= a[i]; j++) {
      int kk = 0;
      while (a[i] % j == 0)
        a[i] /= j, kk++;
      if (kk & 1)
        k *= j;
    }
    if (a[i] != 1)
      k *= a[i];
    a[i] = k;
  }
  int ans = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    auto result = f.insert(a[i]);
    if (!result.second)
      ans++, f.clear(), f.insert(a[i]);
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    fun();
  }
}
```

The optimization steps taken here improve the execution time of the program and make the code more readable and maintainable.
