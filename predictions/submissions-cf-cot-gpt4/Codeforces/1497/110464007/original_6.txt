Here are the optimization steps for the given C/C++ program:

1. Instead of using `bits/stdc++.h`, include only the necessary C++ standard libraries. `bits/stdc++.h` is not a standard header file of GNU GCC and it includes quite literally "everything", which increases compilation time. 

2. Remove the macros in the program. Although these macros save typing, they make the code harder to read and debug. 

3. The function `fun()` is not descriptive. Rename it to something meaningful.

4. The code `cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);` is used to untie cin from cout. This is used to optimize the code for competitive programming but in real-world programs, it can cause bugs. It's better to remove it.

5. In function `fun()`, the code is reading an array `a[n]` before declaring its size `n`. This can cause a runtime error. The array size should be declared before reading the array.

6. The use of `auto &i : a` in the first for loop is not optimal. It's better to use the traditional for loop with an index.

7. `set<int> f;` is declared but not used until much later in the code. Declare variables as close as possible to where you use them.

8. There is an unnecessary `f.in(a[i]);` after the `else` statement. This is redundant since `a[i]` is inserted again into `f` after the `if-else` block.

Here is the optimized code based on the steps above:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <ctime>

using namespace std;

void calculateAnswer() {
  int n, r;
  cin >> n >> r;
  int a[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    cin >> a[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int k = 1;
    for (int j = 2; j * j <= a[i]; j++) {
      int kk = 0;
      while (a[i] % j == 0)
        a[i] /= j, kk++;
      if (kk & 1)
        k *= j;
    }
    if (a[i] != 1)
      k *= a[i];
    a[i] = k;
  }
  int ans = 1;
  set<int> f;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (f.find(a[i]) == f.end())
      f.insert(a[i]);
    else {
      ans++; 
      f.clear();
    }
    f.insert(a[i]);
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    calculateAnswer();
  }
}
```
