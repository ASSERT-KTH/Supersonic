This program seems to be a solution for a competitive programming problem. It reads a sequence of numbers, optimizes each number by reducing it to its irreducible form by removing perfect square factors other than 1, and then splits the sequence into segments such that each segment contains distinct numbers. The program prints the number of segments.

Here are some points of optimization:

1. There is no need to check whether the number is in the set before inserting it. We can try to insert it directly and check if the insertion was successful.

2. We don't need to clear the set on each iteration. Instead, we can start a new set for each group.

3. It's not necessary to calculate the square of `j` twice in each iteration of the inner loop.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <utility>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define _rep(i, x, y) for (int i = (int)x; i < (int)y; ++i)
#define PII pair<int, int>
#define eb emplace_back
#define fi first
#define se second
#define PQ priority_queue
#define lb lower_bound
#define ub upper_bound
#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()
#define rall(x) (x).rbegin(), (x).rend()
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef vector<int> VI;
typedef vector<VI> VII;
typedef vector<ll> VL;
typedef vector<vector<ll>> VLL;
constexpr int mod = 1e9 + 7;
constexpr int INF = 0x7f7f7f7f;
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr), cout.tie(nullptr);
  int _;
  cin >> _;
  while (_--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    VI a(n);
    _rep(i, 0, n) {
      cin >> a[i];
      for (int j = 2, jsq = j*j; jsq <= a[i]; j++, jsq = j*j) {
        while (a[i] % jsq == 0)
          a[i] /= jsq;
      }
    }
    vector<set<int>> segments(1);
    _rep(i, 0, n) {
      if (!segments.back().insert(a[i]).second) {
        segments.push_back({a[i]});
      }
    }
    cout << segments.size() << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

First, we have removed the redundant square root calculation in the inner loop. The square of `j` is now being calculated once and stored in `jsq`.

Then, instead of clearing the set whenever there is a duplicate, we start a new set for each group in a new segment. The `segments` vector holds all segments.

Finally, we print the number of segments, which is the size of the `segments` vector.
