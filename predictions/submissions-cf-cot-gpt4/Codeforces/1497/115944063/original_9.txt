This program is relatively optimized, but there are few small changes that can improve the efficiency slightly:

1. `std::set<int>::count()` function: This function checks whether an element exists in the set and takes O(log n) time. It is followed by `std::set<int>::insert()` function which again takes O(log n) time. Instead of using these two operations, we can use `std::set<int>::insert()` directly which returns a pair. The second element of the pair is a boolean indicating whether the insertion was successful or not. This will reduce the number of operations from 2 to 1 for each element.

2. Remove the use of macros: Although this is not an optimization, it is good practice to avoid macros when we can use functions or constants.

3. `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);`: This line is used to decouple C and C++ standard streams, but it can cause problems when you mix input/output from printf/scanf and cin/cout. If you're only using cin/cout in your code, you can remove this line.

4. `cin.tie(nullptr), cout.tie(nullptr);`: This unties cin from cout, which can cause unnecessary flushes. It's better to untie only cin from cout, and not the other way around.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <utility>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef vector<int> VI;
typedef vector<VI> VII;
typedef vector<ll> VL;
typedef vector<vector<ll>> VLL;
constexpr int mod = 1e9 + 7;
constexpr int KINF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
constexpr int INF = 0x7f7f7f7f;
constexpr double eps = 1e-7;
int main() {
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  int _;
  cin >> _;
  while (_--) {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    VI a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> a[i];
      for (int j = 2; j * j <= a[i]; j++) {
        while (a[i] % (j * j) == 0)
          a[i] /= (j * j);
      }
    }
    set<int> s;
    int ans = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      if (!s.insert(a[i]).second) {
        s.clear();
        ans++;
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note, when you are optimizing code, you have to consider the readability and maintainability of the code as well.
