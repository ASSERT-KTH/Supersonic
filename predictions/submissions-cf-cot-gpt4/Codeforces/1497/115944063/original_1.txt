The given program seems to be well optimized in terms of its logic. However, few changes can be made to make it slightly more optimized:

1. Reserve memory: If the size of the vector is known beforehand, it's better to reserve the memory in advance. This avoids reallocation of memory when new elements are added, thus improving performance.

2. Minimize scope of variables: It's better to declare variables where you need them. This keeps the variable's scope small, which can help the compiler optimize the code.

3. Remove unnecessary type casting: The type casting of x and y to int in the macros _rep and _dep are not needed since x and y are already defined as ints.

4. Use '\n' instead of endl: Using '\n' to print a newline character is faster than using endl. This is because endl causes a flush operation, effectively forcing the output to appear immediately rather than being buffered. This can be slow.

With these in mind, here's your optimized version of the code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <utility>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define _rep(i, x, y) for (int i = x; i < y; ++i)
#define PII pair<int, int>
#define eb emplace_back
#define pb push_back
#define fi first
#define se second
#define PQ priority_queue
#define lb lower_bound
#define ub upper_bound
#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()
#define rall(x) (x).rbegin(), (x).rend()
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef vector<int> VI;
typedef vector<VI> VII;
typedef vector<ll> VL;
typedef vector<vector<ll>> VLL;
constexpr int mod = 1e9 + 7;
constexpr int KINF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
constexpr int INF = 0x7f7f7f7f;
constexpr double eps = 1e-7;
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr), cout.tie(nullptr);
  int _;
  cin >> _;
  while (_--) {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    VI a;
    a.reserve(n);
    _rep(i, 0, n) {
      int temp;
      cin >> temp;
      for (int j = 2; j * j <= temp; j++) {
        while (temp % (j * j) == 0)
          temp /= (j * j);
      }
      a.push_back(temp);
    }
    set<int> s;
    int ans = 1;
    _rep(i, 0, n) {
      if (s.count(a[i])) {
        s.clear();
        ans++;
      }
      s.insert(a[i]);
    }
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the code is not significantly different from the original one, but it includes some small optimizations that can lead to a faster runtime and less memory usage.
