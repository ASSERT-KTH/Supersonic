This program is reasonably optimized for time complexity. The main time-consuming operations are character processing and query handling, which all have linear or log-linear time complexity. However, there are still some small modifications we can make for better performance and readability.

1. Change `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` to specific includes
The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a GCC-specific library that includes most C++ standard libraries. It is not efficient because it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can slow down the compilation process. In addition, it is not portable because it's not supported by all compilers. Instead, we should include only the headers we need.

2. Use `std::array` instead of C-style arrays
C++ `std::array` is a container that encapsulates fixed-size arrays. It's a better choice than C-style arrays because it provides bounds checking and other useful functions.

3. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`
This pair of statements turns off the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding C streams. This can significantly speed up the I/O operations.

4. Avoid using `using namespace std;`
This line brings all the symbols in the std namespace into the global scope, which can lead to name clashes.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <array>
#include <string.h>

#define bbn 200005
#define mod 1000000007
typedef long long int LL;
std::array<std::set<int>, 27> se;
char s[bbn];

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  std::cin >> (s + 1);
  int q;
  std::cin >> q;
  int len = strlen(s + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++) {
    se[s[i] - 'a'].insert(i);
  }
  while (q--) {
    int x;
    std::cin >> x;
    if (x == 1) {
      int p;
      char c;
      std::cin >> p >> c;
      se[s[p] - 'a'].erase(p);
      se[c - 'a'].insert(p);
      s[p] = c;
    } else if (x == 2) {
      int l, r, sum = 0;
      std::cin >> l >> r;
      for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        auto p = se[i].lower_bound(l);
        if (p != se[i].end() && *p <= r)
          sum++;
      }
      std::cout << sum << std::endl;
    }
  }
}
```
