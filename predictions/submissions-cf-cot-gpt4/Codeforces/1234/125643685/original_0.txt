The original program seems to be dealing with a string operation problem. It first reads a string and a number of operations. Then, for each operation, if it's of type 1, it changes the character in a certain position, and if it's of type 2, it computes the number of different characters in a certain substring.

Here are the steps to optimize the code:

1. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up the input and output of C++. This will essentially decouple C++'s I/O streams from the C-style streams, resulting in faster I/O operations.

2. Rather than using the `std::set` which has O(logN) operation time complexity, use a `std::vector` of `std::bitset` which has O(1) operation time complexity.

3. Instead of using `cin >> s + 1;` for reading the string, use `cin >> s;` This is because array indices in C++ are 0-based, not 1-based. Therefore, it's better to stick to 0-based indexing for consistency and to avoid off-by-one errors.

4. Avoid substraction 'a' from characters multiple times, instead do it once and store it in variable.

Here's the optimized version:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define bbn 200005
#define mod 1000000007
typedef long long int LL;

using namespace std;

bitset<bbn> se[27];
char s[bbn];

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  cin >> s;
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  int len = strlen(s);
  for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    se[s[i] - 'a'][i] = 1;
  }
  while (q--) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    if (x == 1) {
      int p;
      char c;
      cin >> p >> c;
      p--; // 0-based indexing
      se[s[p] - 'a'][p] = 0;
      se[c - 'a'][p] = 1;
      s[p] = c;
    } else if (x == 2) {
      int l, r, sum = 0;
      cin >> l >> r;
      l--, r--; // 0-based indexing
      for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (se[i].count() && se[i]._Find_next(l-1) <= r)
          sum++;
      }
      cout << sum << '\n';
    }
  }
}
```
Please note that this optimized version assumes that the indices of the operations are 1-based. If they are 0-based, you should remove the `p--;` and `l--, r--;` lines.
