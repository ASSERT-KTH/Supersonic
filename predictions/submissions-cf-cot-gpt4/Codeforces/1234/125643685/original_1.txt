The given program is already quite efficient and well-structured. However, there are a few minor optimizations we can make:

1. Avoid the usage of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is quite large and includes a lot of libraries which may not be used in the program. It is more efficient to include only the specific libraries that you need.

2. Remove the usage of `#define` for constants: It's better to use `const` for defining constants as it provides type safety.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This directive can lead to naming conflicts if the program grows. It is better to use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and objects.

4. Using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` can speed up the I/O operations.

5. Instead of using `strlen` to get the length of the string, you can directly use `std::string::length` or `std::string::size` which is faster and safer.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <string>

const int bbn = 200005;
const int mod = 1000000007;
typedef long long int LL;

std::set<int> se[27];
char s[bbn];

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  
  std::cin >> s + 1;
  int q;
  std::cin >> q;
  int len = std::string(s + 1).size();
  for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++) {
    se[s[i] - 'a'].insert(i);
  }
  while (q--) {
    int x;
    std::cin >> x;
    if (x == 1) {
      int p;
      char c;
      std::cin >> p >> c;
      se[s[p] - 'a'].erase(p);
      se[c - 'a'].insert(p);
      s[p] = c;
    } else if (x == 2) {
      int l, r, sum = 0;
      std::cin >> l >> r;
      for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        auto p = se[i].lower_bound(l);
        if (p != se[i].end() && *p <= r)
          sum++;
      }
      std::cout << sum << std::endl;
    }
  }
}
```

Please note that these are minor, non-functional optimizations. The logic of the program remains the same.
