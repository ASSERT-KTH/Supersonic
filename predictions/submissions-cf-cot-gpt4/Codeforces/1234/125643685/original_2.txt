The given C/C++ program is already quite optimal in terms of time complexity. The use of set data structure and standard algorithms like lower_bound ensures that the program runs in near logarithmic time for most of the operations.

However, there are few small optimizations that can be performed.

1. Use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`
This is quite a common practice among competitive programmers as it includes all standard libraries, but it is not good in terms of compilation time. It's better to include only those libraries which are being used in the program.

2. Use of `using namespace std;`
This line of code is also a common practice but it can lead to naming conflicts in a larger codebase. It's better to use std:: before using the standard library functions.

3. Use of magic numbers
The program uses numbers like 27, 200005, and 1000000007. It's better to define them as constants with meaningful names.

4. Use of `cin` and `cout`
These are much slower compared to scanf and printf. If the input/output size is large, using scanf/printf can decrease the running time.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <cstring>

#define MAX_SIZE 200005
#define MOD 1000000007
typedef long long int LL;

std::set<int> element_set[27];
char s[MAX_SIZE];

int main() {
  std::scanf("%s", s + 1);
  int num_queries;
  std::scanf("%d", &num_queries);
  int len = std::strlen(s + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++) {
    element_set[s[i] - 'a'].insert(i);
  }
  while (num_queries--) {
    int query_type;
    std::scanf("%d", &query_type);
    if (query_type == 1) {
      int position;
      char character;
      std::scanf("%d %c", &position, &character);
      element_set[s[position] - 'a'].erase(position);
      element_set[character - 'a'].insert(position);
      s[position] = character;
    } else if (query_type == 2) {
      int left, right, sum = 0;
      std::scanf("%d %d", &left, &right);
      for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        auto iter = element_set[i].lower_bound(left);
        if (iter != element_set[i].end() && *iter <= right)
          sum++;
      }
      std::printf("%d\n", sum);
    }
  }
}
```

In the optimized version, I have replaced `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with specific libraries, replaced `using namespace std` with `std::`, defined magic numbers as constants, and replaced `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`.
