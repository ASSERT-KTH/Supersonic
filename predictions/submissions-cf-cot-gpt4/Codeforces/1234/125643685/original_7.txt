The first optimization that we can perform is by removing the inclusion of the `bits/stdc++.h` header and instead include only those libraries which are required in the program. This way, we can reduce the compile time of the program.

Secondly, we are using a global variable `s` and reading from the standard input into `s + 1`, leaving the first character unused. Instead, we can read into `s` directly and adjust the indices accordingly, eliminating the need for the unused first character.

Thirdly, the variable `len` is only used once to calculate the length of the string `s`. We can eliminate this variable and directly use the function `strlen()` in the loop.

Lastly, instead of performing the subtraction `s[i] - 'a'` and `c - 'a'` multiple times, we can calculate it once and store it in a variable, reducing the number of operations. 

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <cstring>

#define bbn 200005
#define mod 1000000007
typedef long long int LL;

using namespace std;

set<int> se[27];
char s[bbn];

int main() {
  cin >> s;
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < strlen(s); i++) {
    int index = s[i] - 'a';
    se[index].insert(i+1);
  }

  while (q--) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    if (x == 1) {
      int p;
      char c;
      cin >> p >> c;
      int oldIndex = s[p-1] - 'a';
      int newIndex = c - 'a';
      se[oldIndex].erase(p);
      se[newIndex].insert(p);
      s[p-1] = c;
    } else if (x == 2) {
      int l, r, sum = 0;
      cin >> l >> r;
      for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        auto p = se[i].lower_bound(l);
        if (p != se[i].end() && *p <= r)
          sum++;
      }
      cout << sum << endl;
    }
  }
}
```
The optimizations are relatively minor but can contribute to increased efficiency and readability of the program.
