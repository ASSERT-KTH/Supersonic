Here are some potential steps to optimize the given program:

1. Remove the "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" and include only necessary headers. This header file is quite large and including it increases the compilation time. It also includes many libraries that are not used in this program, which is not efficient.

2. Use "ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);" at the beginning of the main function. This will speed up the I/O operations, which can be a bottleneck in programs that deal with a lot of input and output.

3. If possible, use "reserve" for containers to avoid unnecessary reallocations.

4. Avoid using "endl" with cout, as it flushes the output buffer each time, which is slower than just outputting a newline character ('\n').

5. Consider using "auto" to declare variables when the type is clear from the context. This can make the code cleaner and easier to read.

Here's the optimized code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <cstring>
#define bbn 200005
#define mod 1000000007
typedef long long int LL;
using namespace std;
set<int> se[27];
char s[bbn];

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cin >> (s + 1);
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  int len = strlen(s + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++) {
    se[s[i] - 'a'].insert(i);
  }
  while (q--) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    if (x == 1) {
      int p;
      char c;
      cin >> p >> c;
      se[s[p] - 'a'].erase(p);
      se[c - 'a'].insert(p);
      s[p] = c;
    } else if (x == 2) {
      int l, r, sum = 0;
      cin >> l >> r;
      for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        auto p = se[i].lower_bound(l);
        if (p != se[i].end() && *p <= r)
          sum++;
      }
      cout << sum << '\n';
    }
  }
}
```
In this optimized version, the program will run faster due to the improvements in I/O operations. Also, the code is cleaned up a bit by using the auto keyword. Be aware that using auto can make the code less clear if the type isn't obvious from the context, so it should be used judiciously.
