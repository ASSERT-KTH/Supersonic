This program reads a sequence of colors of socks, divides it into two parts, and calculates the minimum number of operations needed to make each part have the same colors with the same number of times. It uses a lot of dynamic memory allocation with map and unordered_set which could be a bit inefficient.

Following are the steps to optimize this program:

1. Remove the usage of 'using namespace std;'. It's a bad practice to use this statement in C++ programming. It can cause name clashes in the program.

2. Change the data types of 'a' and 'b' from map<int, int> to vector<int>. Since we know that the input 'aux' has a maximum value of N, we can use a vector of size N instead of a map. This will improve the time complexity from O(log N) to O(1) for each access or update operation. 

3. Change 'color' from an unordered_set to a vector<bool>. Again, since we know 'aux' is less than or equal to N, we can use a vector of size N. This will give us O(1) time complexity for each insert and check operation. 

4. Remove the 'readFast' macro and 'read()' function. They are not necessary.

5. Initialize 'a', 'b', and 'color' once outside the while loop and clear them at the end of each test case to ensure they don't carry over data from previous test cases. 

6. Include only necessary headers instead of <bits/stdc++.h> which includes a lot of unnecessary headers and can slow down the compilation time.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

#define ll long long
#define fin std::cin
#define sz(x) (int)(x).size()
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define output(x) ((int)x && std::cout << "YES\n") || std::cout << "NO\n";
#define LSB(x) ((-x) & x)

const int N = 2e5 + 15;
const int MOD = 998244353;
int t;
int n, l, r, aux;
std::vector<int> a(N), b(N);
std::vector<bool> color(N);

int main() {
  fin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    fin >> n >> l >> r;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      fin >> aux;
      if (i <= l) {
        ++a[aux];
      } else {
        ++b[aux];
      }
      color[aux] = true;
    }
    for (int x = 1; x < N; ++x) {
      if (color[x]) {
        int elim = std::min(a[x], b[x]);
        a[x] -= elim;
        l -= elim;
        b[x] -= elim;
        r -= elim;
      }
    }
    if (l < r) {
      std::swap(l, r);
      std::swap(a, b);
    }
    int ans = 0;
    for (int x = 1; x < N; ++x) {
      if (color[x]) {
        int change = std::min(a[x] / 2 * 2, l - r);
        ans += change / 2;
        l -= change;
      }
    }
    ans += (l - r) / 2 + (l + r) / 2;
    std::cout << ans << '\n';
    std::fill(a.begin(), a.end(), 0);
    std::fill(b.begin(), b.end(), 0);
    std::fill(color.begin(), color.end(), false);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version of the code, we used vectors instead of map and unordered_set which improved the time complexity, and we removed some unnecessary features of the code.
