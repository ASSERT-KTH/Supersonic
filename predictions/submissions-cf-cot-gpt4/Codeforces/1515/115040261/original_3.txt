First, let's breakdown the optimizations we can do.

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This includes quite literally the entire standard library. This is generally not recommended as it can greatly increase compile time. It's better to include only the headers you actually need.

2. `#define readFast ....`: This macro is unnecessary. The speedup achieved by using this is negligible and can even be harmful in some cases. 

3. Local Variables: Variables like `n`, `l`, `r`, `aux` should be defined within the `while` loop. This reduces the scope of variables which is generally a good practice. 

4. `color.clear();`: The `clear` function on a set or map will deallocate memory. If you know you're going to use the container again, it's often faster to just remove the elements without deallocating the memory, as this will avoid a likely memory allocation in the future. In most cases, you can use `color.erase(color.begin(), color.end());` instead of `color.clear();`. 

5. `#ifdef LOCAL ... #else ... #endif`: This code block is not necessary and can be removed completely. 

6. Optimizing map usage: Since ordered maps like `std::map` have a time complexity of O(log n) for insertions and access, we can replace it with an unordered map (`std::unordered_map`) that has an average time complexity of O(1) for these operations.

Let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int N = 2e5 + 15;
const int MOD = 998244353;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int t;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int n, l, r, aux;
    cin >> n >> l >> r;

    unordered_map<int, int> a;
    unordered_map<int, int> b;
    unordered_set<int> color;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      cin >> aux;
      if (i <= l) {
        ++a[aux];
      } else {
        ++b[aux];
      }
      color.insert(aux);
    }

    for (int x : color) {
      int elim = min(a[x], b[x]);
      a[x] -= elim;
      l -= elim;
      b[x] -= elim;
      r -= elim;
    }

    if (l < r) {
      swap(l, r);
      swap(a, b);
    }

    int ans = 0;
    for (int x : color) {
      int change = min(a[x] / 2 * 2, l - r);
      ans += change / 2;
      l -= change;
    }

    ans += (l - r) / 2 + (l + r) / 2;
    cout << ans << '\n';

    a.erase(a.begin(), a.end());
    b.erase(b.begin(), b.end());
    color.erase(color.begin(), color.end());
  }

  return 0;
}
```
