Optimization steps:

1. The first change that can be made is to change vector to deque. This is because, in the code, we are always accessing elements from the end of the container. Deque is designed to allow fast access at both the beginning and the end, unlike vector which is optimized for fast access in the middle and end of the container.

2. The second change is changing the sort function. We are always sorting in ascending order and then accessing the elements from the end. Instead, we can sort in descending order and access the elements from the beginning.

3. The third change is to reserve the size of the deque. This will prevent unnecessary reallocations.

4. The fourth change is to remove the unnecessary if-else statements. We can combine the conditions for 'a' and 'b' since the operations are the same.

5. The last change is to remove the while loop. There is no need for this loop since it only runs once.

The optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, a, b;
  cin >> n >> a >> b;
  deque<int> seat;
  seat.reserve(n); // reserve space
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  int z = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (s[i] == '*') {
      if (z != 0) {
        seat.push_back(z);
      }
      z = 0;
    } else {
      z += 1;
    }
  }
  if (z != 0)
    seat.push_back(z);
  sort(seat.begin(), seat.end(), greater<int>()); // sort in descending order
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < seat.size() && (a > 0 || b > 0); i++) { // stop loop if a and b are both 0
    int q = seat[i];
    int x, y;
    if (q & 1) {
      x = q / 2;
      y = x + 1;
    } else {
      x = y = q / 2;
    }
    int* max_val = a > b ? &a : &b;
    int* min_val = a > b ? &b : &a;
    if (*max_val < y) {
      ans += *max_val;
      *max_val = 0;
    } else {
      ans += y;
      *max_val -= y;
    }
    if (*min_val < x) {
      ans += *min_val;
      *min_val = 0;
    } else {
      ans += x;
      *min_val -= x;
    }
  }
  cout << ans << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
The above code optimizes the original program by reducing the runtime and memory usage. It does this by changing the data structure used, adjusting how the data is sorted and accessed, reducing unnecessary looping, and simplifying the condition checks.
