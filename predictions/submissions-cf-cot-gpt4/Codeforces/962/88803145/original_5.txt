Let's go through the optimization step by step:

1. **Using C++ Standard Libraries Over #include<bits/stdc++.h>**: It's not good practice to use #include <bits/stdc++.h> because it includes all the standard libraries, which makes the compilation time longer. Instead, we should only include the libraries that we need.

2. **Avoiding Unnecessary Use of Vector**: It seems that the purpose of the vector 'seat' is to store and sort the counts of continuous '.' in the string 's'. However, we can accomplish this without storing all the counts. Instead, we can maintain the maximum and second maximum counts during the process, which will save memory usage and reduce sorting time.

3. **Avoiding Redundant Code**: The code for the calculation of 'a' and 'b' is quite redundant. We can make it more concise by sorting 'a' and 'b' first and then calculating the result.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, a, b;
  cin >> n >> a >> b;
  if(a < b) swap(a, b);
    
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  int z = 0, max_z = 0, second_max_z = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (s[i] == '*') {
      if (z > max_z) {
        second_max_z = max_z;
        max_z = z;
      } else if (z > second_max_z) {
        second_max_z = z;
      }
      z = 0;
    } else {
      z += 1;
    }
  }
  if (z > max_z) {
    second_max_z = max_z;
    max_z = z;
  } else if (z > second_max_z) {
    second_max_z = z;
  }

  int ans = 0;
  int x = max_z / 2, y = x + (max_z & 1);
  ans += min(a, y);
  a -= min(a, y);
  ans += min(b, x);
  b -= min(b, x);

  x = second_max_z / 2, y = x + (second_max_z & 1);
  ans += min(a, y);
  a -= min(a, y);
  ans += min(b, x);

  cout << ans << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program reduces memory usage by avoiding the use of vector and makes the running time faster by skipping the sorting process. It also uses fewer standard libraries, which makes the compilation time shorter.
