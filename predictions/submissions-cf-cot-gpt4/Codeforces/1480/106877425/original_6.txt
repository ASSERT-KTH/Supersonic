The given program reads different parameters from the input and performs some calculations. The main parts which can be optimized in this program are:

1. Memory Usage: In the program, two large arrays 'attack' and 'health' are used. These can be avoided by directly processing the input data without storing it.

2. Redundant Computations: In the current program, the calculation of variable 'd' and 'res' for index 'k' is done twice (once in the loop and once outside the loop). This can be avoided by only calculating it once.

3. Early Exit: If at any point during the calculation of 'res', the value of 'res' becomes greater than or equal to 'b', there's no point in continuing the loop as the result is already known to be "NO". Hence, we can break the loop and print "NO" and return.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define pb push_back
#define ll long long
void solve() {
  ll a, b, n;
  ll res = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> n;
  int k = 0, mm = 0;
  ll attack, health, d, x, y;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> attack;
    if (mm < attack) {
      k = i;
      mm = attack;
    }
    cin >> health;
    d = (health + a - 1) / a;
    d = d * attack;
    res += d;
    if (res >= b) {
      cout << "NO"
           << "\n";
      return;
    }
  }
  b = b - res;
  x = (b + mm - 1) / mm;
  y = (health + a - 1) / a;
  if (x >= y)
    cout << "YES"
         << "\n";
  else
    cout << "NO"
         << "\n";
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int tt = 1;
  cin >> tt;
  while (tt--)
    solve();
}
```

In the optimized version, we process the input data directly without storing it in arrays, saving memory. We also avoid redundant computations and provide an early exit when the result is known.
