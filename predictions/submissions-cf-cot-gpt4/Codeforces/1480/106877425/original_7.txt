Optimization Explanation:

1. Use of Vector Instead of Array: We are using array to store the 'attack' and 'health'. Instead, we can use vector which is a dynamic array and saves memory. It allocates memory as required, unlike an array which allocates memory at once.

2. Use of pair instead of two arrays: Instead of using two arrays 'attack' and 'health', we can use a pair of vectors to store both 'attack' and 'health'. This would save memory and also make the code cleaner.

3. Remove unnecessary variables: We are using 'k' to keep track of the index of the maximum 'attack'. Instead, we can directly keep track of the maximum 'attack' in a pair of integers (the first one for 'attack' and the second one for 'health').

4. Combine Input and Calculation: We can combine the input and calculation process into one loop, which will save us from iterating over the array twice.

5. Use 'auto' for variable declaration: Instead of explicitly mentioning the type of variable, we can use 'auto' keyword. The compiler automatically determines the data type.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
void solve() {
  ll a, b, n;
  ll res = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> n;
  pair<ll, ll> max_attack = {0, 0};
  vector<pair<ll, ll>> monster(n);
  for (auto &m : monster) {
    cin >> m.first;
    if (max_attack.first < m.first) {
      max_attack = m;
    }
  }
  for (auto &m : monster) {
    cin >> m.second;
    if (m != max_attack) {
      ll d = (m.second + a - 1) / a;
      d = d * m.first;
      res += d;
    }
  }
  if (res >= b) {
    cout << "NO\n";
    return;
  }
  b = b - res;
  ll x = (b + max_attack.first - 1) / max_attack.first;
  ll y = (max_attack.second + a - 1) / a;
  if (x >= y)
    cout << "YES\n";
  else
    cout << "NO\n";
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int tt;
  cin >> tt;
  while (tt--)
    solve();
}
```
Note: I kept the usage of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;` as per the original code, but it's generally not recommended in real-world production code due to the following reasons:
- `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can slow down the compilation time.
- `using namespace std;` can cause name clashes because it brings all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace.
