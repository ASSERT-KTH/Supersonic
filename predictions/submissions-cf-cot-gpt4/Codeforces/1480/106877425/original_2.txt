The given C++ program can be optimized mainly in terms of memory usage and a little bit in terms of running time. Here are the steps for optimization:

1. Use `std::vector` instead of arrays: In C++, using `std::vector` is a more modern approach as compared to arrays. They are dynamic and we don't need to know the size at compile time. This will help us to optimize the memory usage.

2. Combine the input and calculation loops: We are currently using separate loops to read the attack and health values and then perform calculations. We can combine these loops to optimize the running time.

3. Use `std::max_element` to find the maximum attack: Instead of manually finding the maximum attack and its index, we can use `std::max_element` from STL that will do this job in a more efficient way.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define pb push_back
#define ll long long

void solve() {
  ll a, b, n;
  ll res = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> n;

  vector<ll> attack(n), health(n);
  int k = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> attack[i] >> health[i];
    ll d = (health[i] + a - 1) / a;
    d = d * attack[i];
    if (i != k) res += d;
  }
  
  k = max_element(attack.begin(), attack.end()) - attack.begin();
  
  if (res >= b) {
    cout << "NO" << "\n";
    return;
  }

  b = b - res;
  ll x = (b + attack[k] - 1) / attack[k];
  ll y = (health[k] + a - 1) / a;
  if (x >= y)
    cout << "YES" << "\n";
  else
    cout << "NO" << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int tt;
  cin >> tt;
  while (tt--)
    solve();
}
```
The optimized program does the same job as the original one but in a more efficient way.
