The code mostly seems fine but there are some parts that can be optimized. 

1. The "attack" and "health" arrays could be combined into a single 2D array or a vector of pairs. This would decrease memory usage and make the code somewhat more readable.

2. The use of `cin` and `cout` is slower than `scanf` and `printf`. If the input/output operation needs to be faster, we can replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`.

3. We can avoid the use of `#define` for shortening the code. It's generally considered bad practice because it can lead to confusing bugs. Instead, we can use `typedef` or `using` to define a new type.

4. The use of "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" is also usually avoided in production code, because it includes a lot of unnecessary headers and can slow down the compilation process. We can include only the headers that are actually used in the program.

5. You are skipping the maximum attack monster till the end in the hope that your monster can survive the attacks of other monsters and then fight the maximum attack monster at the end. But this is not optimal as the monster with maximum attack may not have the maximum health/attack ratio. So, in the first loop itself we can find the monster which requires minimum attacks to be killed and has the maximum attack among such monsters.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

void solve() {
    ll a, b, n;
    scanf("%lld %lld %lld", &a, &b, &n);
    vector<pair<ll, ll>> monsters(n);
    ll maxAttack = 0;
    ll minAttacks = 0;
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%lld", &monsters[i].first);
        maxAttack = max(maxAttack, monsters[i].first);
    }
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%lld", &monsters[i].second);
        ll attacksNeeded = (monsters[i].second + a - 1) / a;
        if (attacksNeeded * maxAttack < b && (minAttacks == 0 || attacksNeeded < minAttacks)) {
            minAttacks = attacksNeeded;
            maxAttack = monsters[i].first;
        }
    }
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (monsters[i].first == maxAttack) continue;
        ll d = (monsters[i].second + a - 1) / a;
        d = d * monsters[i].first;
        b -= d;
        if (b <= 0) {
            printf("NO\n");
            return;
        }
    }
    if (b > maxAttack) printf("YES\n");
    else printf("NO\n");
}

int main() {
    int tt = 1;
    scanf("%d", &tt);
    while (tt--)
        solve();
}
```
