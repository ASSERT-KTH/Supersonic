This existing code has many places where we can optimize it. Here are the steps we will follow:

1. In C/C++, dynamic memory allocation is slower than static memory allocation due to system calls. So, instead of using dynamic memory allocation for arrays attack[] and health[], we will use static memory allocation with an upper limit.

2. There is no need to find the maximum attack and its index in a separate loop. We can find it while taking the input for the attack array.

3. No need to take the input for the health array in a separate loop. We can take the input for the health and attack array in the same loop.

4. We can optimize the loop where we calculate the res by skipping the iteration where `i == k`. Instead, we can calculate the res for `i == k` after this loop.

5. We will also use "\n" instead of std::endl to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output buffer.

Here is the optimized version of the above code:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define pb push_back
#define ll long long
#define MAXN 100005

void solve() {
  ll a, b, n;
  ll res = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> n;
  ll attack[MAXN], health[MAXN];
  ll max_attack = 0, max_index = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> attack[i] >> health[i];
    if (attack[i] > max_attack) {
      max_attack = attack[i];
      max_index = i;
    }
    if (i != max_index) {
      ll d = (health[i] + a - 1) / a;
      d = d * attack[i];
      res += d;
    }
  }
  ll d = (health[max_index] + a - 1) / a;
  d = d * attack[max_index];
  res += d;
  if (res >= b) {
    cout << "NO\n";
    return;
  }
  b = b - res;
  ll x = (b + attack[max_index] - 1) / attack[max_index];
  ll y = (health[max_index] + a - 1) / a;
  if (x >= y)
    cout << "YES\n";
  else
    cout << "NO\n";
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int tt = 1;
  cin >> tt;
  while (tt--)
    solve();
}
```
Note that the macro `MAXN` is set to 100005 which is assumed to be a safe upper limit. This limit should be set according to the constraints of the problem.
