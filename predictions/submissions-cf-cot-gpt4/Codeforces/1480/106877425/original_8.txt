The main optimization that can be made to this program is to avoid dynamic memory allocation as much as possible. In the original program, two large arrays 'attack' and 'health' are being created for each test case, causing a significant overhead. We can improve it by reusing the same arrays. 

As the maximum size of the arrays is not given, we will just assume a maximum size of 10^5, which is a common value in competitive programming. If the maximum size is given or can be determined, it should be used instead.

The removal of dynamic array creation will optimize the program for both running time (because dynamic memory allocation is slower than static allocation) and memory usage (because the memory for the arrays is only allocated once, not for each test case). 

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define pb push_back
#define ll long long
#define MAXN 100000

void solve() {
  static ll attack[MAXN], health[MAXN];
  ll a, b, n;
  ll res = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> n;
  int k = 0, mm = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> attack[i];
    if (mm < attack[i]) {
      k = i;
      mm = attack[i];
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> health[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i == k)
      continue;
    ll d = (health[i] + a - 1) / a;
    d = d * attack[i];
    res += d;
  }
  if (res >= b) {
    cout << "NO"
         << "\n";
    return;
  }
  b = b - res;
  ll x = (b + attack[k] - 1) / attack[k];
  ll y = (health[k] + a - 1) / a;
  if (x >= y)
    cout << "YES"
         << "\n";
  else
    cout << "NO"
         << "\n";
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int tt = 1;
  cin >> tt;
  while (tt--)
    solve();
}
```
