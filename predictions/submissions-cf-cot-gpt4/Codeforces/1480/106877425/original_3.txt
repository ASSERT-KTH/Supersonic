The given C++ program seems to be performing well in terms of time complexity. However, it has some memory inefficiencies. Here are some steps to optimize it:

- Instead of reading all attacks and health values into arrays and then processing them, we could process them as we read them. This would save memory usage, as we wouldn't need to store all the values in memory at once.

- We are storing the largest attack value and its index which is not required. Instead, we could manipulate the calculation for `res` in such a way that we always have the maximum attack at the end.

- We can use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up I/O operations.

Now, let's implement these improvements:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

void solve() {
  ll a, b, n;
  cin >> a >> b >> n;
  ll res = 0, maxAttack = 0, maxHealth = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ll attack, health;
    cin >> attack;
    cin >> health;
    ll d = ((health + a - 1) / a) * attack;
    if (attack > maxAttack) {
      res += maxAttack * ((maxHealth + a - 1) / a);
      maxAttack = attack;
      maxHealth = health;
    } else {
      res += d;
    }
  }
  if (res >= b) {
    cout << "NO\n";
    return;
  }
  b = b - res;
  ll x = (b + maxAttack - 1) / maxAttack;
  ll y = (maxHealth + a - 1) / a;
  if (x >= y)
    cout << "YES\n";
  else
    cout << "NO\n";
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int tt = 1;
  cin >> tt;
  while (tt--)
    solve();
}
```

Now, the program uses less memory as it doesn't store all attack and health values in arrays. The runtime is also slightly improved because the maximum attack is always processed last, meaning we save a few cycles by not calculating `res` for it in the main loop.
