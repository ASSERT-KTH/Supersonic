This code can be optimized in several ways:

1. Avoid Dynamically Allocated Arrays: It seems like the maximum value for `n` is not given, so using a dynamically allocated array could potentially introduce memory issues.

2. Avoid Redundant Computations: The `health[i]` and `attack[i]` are being read in two separate loops. This means we're going through the arrays twice, which is unnecessary. We can read the values and perform the necessary calculations in a single loop.

3. Reduce Number of Variables: The code uses two variables `k` and `mm` to keep track of the index and the value of the maximum attack. However, we only need to keep track of the maximum attack and its index, we can directly use `attack[k]` instead of `mm`.

4. Use std::vector Instead of C-Style Arrays: C++ vectors are generally safer and more flexible than C-style arrays. They can dynamically resize, and they automatically manage memory for you.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define pb push_back
#define ll long long

void solve() {
  ll a, b, n;
  cin >> a >> b >> n;
  vector<ll> attack(n), health(n);
  ll res = 0;
  int k = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> attack[i] >> health[i];
    if (attack[k] < attack[i]) {
      k = i;
    }
    if (i == k)
      continue;
    ll d = (health[i] + a - 1) / a;
    d = d * attack[i];
    res += d;
  }

  if (res >= b) {
    cout << "NO" << "\n";
    return;
  }

  b = b - res;
  ll x = (b + attack[k] - 1) / attack[k];
  ll y = (health[k] + a - 1) / a;
  if (x >= y)
    cout << "YES" << "\n";
  else
    cout << "NO" << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int tt = 1;
  cin >> tt;
  while (tt--)
    solve();
}
```

This optimized version of the code does the same thing as the original but in a more efficient and safer way. It avoids potential memory issues, reduces unnecessary computations, and simplifies the code by reducing the number of variables.
