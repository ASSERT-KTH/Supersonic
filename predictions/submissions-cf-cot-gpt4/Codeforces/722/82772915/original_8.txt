This code has a lot of macros and functions which are not used in the main program. Removing them would save memory and make the code cleaner. Also, the usage of bits/stdc++.h is discouraged due to its large size and slow compilation time. Instead, we should include only those libraries which are needed. 

Additionally, we can improve code readability by using more meaningful variable names and removing unnecessary code. For example, the 'prec()' function does nothing and can be removed. The 'fk' variable can be renamed to something more meaningful such as 'previous_max'. 

Let's optimize the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int N = 5e5 + 7;
long long ans, a[N], sum[N], previous_max[N], par[N];
bool vis[N];

int root(int v) { 
    return par[v] < 0 ? v : (par[v] = root(par[v])); 
}

void merge(int x, int y) {
  if ((x = root(x)) == (y = root(y)))
    return;
  ans = max(ans, sum[x] + sum[y]);
  if (par[y] < par[x])
    swap(x, y);
  par[x] += par[y];
  par[y] = x;
  sum[x] += sum[y];
}

void run() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  fill(a, a+n+1, 0);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
    sum[i] = a[i];
    par[i] = -1;
  }
  vector<int> q(n+1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
    cin >> q[i];
  for (int i = n; i >= 1; --i) {
    previous_max[i] = ans;
    vis[q[i]] = 1;
    ans = max(ans, a[q[i]]);
    if (vis[q[i] - 1])
      merge(q[i], q[i] - 1);
    if (vis[q[i] + 1])
      merge(q[i], q[i] + 1);
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
    cout << previous_max[i] << endl;
}

int main() {
  cin.sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  int tc = 1;
  while(tc--) run();
  return 0;
}
```

In this version, we removed unused functions and macros. Also, we replaced the use of bits/stdc++.h with only the necessary libraries. The variable 'q' is now a vector, as its size can change. The variable 'fk' was replaced with 'previous_max' for better understanding. The 'run' function is now called inside a while loop in the main function for better readability. The 'prec' function was removed as it was not used.
