This C++ program seems to be well-optimized. However, there are still a few things we can do to make it run more efficiently.

1. Use '\n' instead of std::endl: std::endl is slower than '\n' because it forces a flush operation along with inserting a new line.

2. Avoid using 'using namespace std': Although it's not directly related to performance, it's a good practice to avoid using namespace std in C++. It can lead to name clashes, which may result in unexpected behavior.

3. Avoid using bits/stdc++.h: This header file includes quite a lot of files, which can slow down the compilation process. It's better to include only the files that you need.

4. Use prefix increment (++i) instead of postfix (i++): In C++, prefix increment is faster than the postfix increment. This is because postfix increment needs to create a copy of i before incrementing it, while prefix increment doesn't.

5. Avoid using tuple if not necessary: Tuples are more expensive in terms of memory and time complexity compared to pairs or individual variables. In this case, you can use pair or struct instead of tuple.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cstdio>
#include <utility>

struct SegTree {
  std::vector<int> sand, sor, lazy;
  int n;
  SegTree(int n_) {
    n = n_;
    sand.assign(n * 2, 0);
    sor.assign(n * 2, 0);
    lazy.assign(n * 2, 0);
  }

  // ... rest of the methods remain the same
};

int main() {
  int k, q;
  scanf("%d %d", &k, &q);
  int n = 1 << k, mask = (1 << k) - 1;
  SegTree low(n), hig(n);
  std::vector<std::pair<std::pair<long long, long long>, int>> cons;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    // ... rest of the code remains the same
  }
  // ... rest of the code remains the same
  return 0;
}
```

Please, note that these optimizations will not dramatically improve the performance of your program. The actual improvements depend on the hardware, the compiler, and the data you're working with. It's always a good idea to profile your code to find the bottlenecks and focus on optimizing those.
