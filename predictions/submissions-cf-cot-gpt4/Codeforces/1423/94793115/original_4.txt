The given C++ program is already quite optimized. Here are some small possible improvements:

1. Reduce Usage of std::vector: The program uses std::vector for sand, sor, and lazy arrays in the SegTree struct. If the maximum size of these arrays is known beforehand, using a plain C++ array can be more efficient because std::vector comes with some overhead for dynamic resizing, which is not needed here.

2. Avoid Recalculation: In the main function, there are multiple instances where the program calculates la, lb, ra, and rb. These calculations can be avoided by storing the results in temporary variables.

3. Avoid Excessive Function Calls: In the main function, the program calls the cek function multiple times within a loop. Each function call comes with some overhead. If possible, the content of the function can be directly written in the loop to avoid these calls.

4. Reduce Usage of std::tuple: The program uses std::tuple to store multiple values. Using a struct can be more efficient and clearer.

5. Use Fast I/O Methods: The program uses printf and scanf for I/O operations. These are slower compared to cin and cout. To make cin and cout as fast as scanf and printf, you can include these lines at the beginning of the int main():

```cpp
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
cin.tie(NULL);
```

Here is an optimized version of the program with the changes mentioned above:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct SegTree {
    int sand[200200], sor[200200], lazy[200200];
    int n;
    SegTree(int n_) {
        n = n_;
        memset(sand, 0, sizeof(sand));
        memset(sor, 0, sizeof(sor));
        memset(lazy, 0, sizeof(lazy));
    }
    /*... same as before ...*/
};

struct Query {
    long long l, r;
    int v;
};

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int k, q;
    cin >> k >> q;
    int n = 1 << k, mask = (1 << k) - 1;
    SegTree low(n), hig(n);
    vector<Query> cons;
    for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
        Query query;
        cin >> query.l >> query.r >> query.v;
        cons.push_back(query);
    }
    /*... same as before ...*/
}
```
Note: The changes in the code are minimal, but they might not bring significant performance improvements. The original code is already quite efficient. The most effective optimization methods would require significant changes to the algorithm or data structures used in the code, which is not required in this case.
