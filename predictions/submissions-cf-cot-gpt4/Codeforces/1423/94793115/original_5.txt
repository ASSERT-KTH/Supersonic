This C++ code uses a segment tree data structure to manage a set of queries on a range of numbers. The optimization of this code can be approached from two angles: memory usage and time complexity.

1. Memory usage: The code uses vectors `sand`, `sor`, and `lazy` in the `SegTree` structure. These vectors are twice the size of `n`. These vectors can be optimized by setting their sizes according to the height of the segment tree i.e., `2 * pow(2, ceil(log2(n)))`. This will save memory for large values of `n`.

2. Time complexity: The `update` and `get` functions in the `SegTree` structure are recursive functions that can be optimized by reducing the number of recursive calls. Currently, the code is making extra recursive calls in the `update` and `get` functions when the range `[l,r]` is not completely inside the range `[x,y]`. This can be avoided by performing the operation only when the range `[l,r]` is completely inside the range `[x,y]`.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
struct SegTree {
  vector<int> sand, sor, lazy;
  int n, size;
  SegTree(int n_) {
    n = n_;
    int x = (int)ceil(log2(n_));
    size = 2 * (int)pow(2, x);
    sand.assign(size, 0);
    sor.assign(size, 0);
    lazy.assign(size, 0);
  }
  // same code for upd and push
  void update(int x, int y, int v, int id, int l, int r) {
    if (l>=x && r<=y) {
      upd(id, v);
      return;
    }
    if (l>=y || r<=x)
      return;
    int mid = (l + r) >> 1, il = id + 1, ir = id + 2 * (mid - l);
    push(id, il, ir);
    update(x, y, v, il, l, mid);
    update(x, y, v, ir, mid, r);
    sand[id] = sand[il] & sand[ir];
    sor[id] = sor[il] | sor[ir];
  }
  // same code for rest
};
// same code for main function
```
Note: `pow` and `log2` are functions defined in the `cmath` library. `pow` returns the base to the exponent power, as in pow(base, exponent). `log2` computes the binary (base-2) logarithm of a number.

Please remember that these are just minor optimizations and won't significantly improve the performance for small inputs. Also, these are just possible optimizations, the actual impact always depends on the specific task and data.
