The given program is already quite optimized, but there are still a few potential changes that could improve its speed:

1. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h` as it includes all the libraries in C++, which increases compilation time. Include only those libraries which are actually required.
2. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up cin and cout operations.
3. Using the bitwise operator for division and multiplication can be faster than normal division and multiplication. But the compiler generally optimizes this itself. 
4. Using "printf" and "scanf" for input and output is faster than using "cout" and "cin". The code already uses "printf" and "scanf".
5. Avoid using long long when int can serve the purpose as long long takes more memory than int.

Optimized code:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <tuple>

using namespace std;

struct SegTree {
    vector<int> sand, sor, lazy;
    int n;
    SegTree(int n_) {
        n = n_;
        sand.assign(2 * n, 0);
        sor.assign(2 * n, 0);
        lazy.assign(2 * n, 0);
    }
    // other methods remain the same
};

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    int k, q;
    scanf("%d %d", &k, &q);
    int n = 1 << k, mask = (1 << k) - 1;
    SegTree low(n), hig(n);
    vector<tuple<int, int, int>> cons;
    for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
        int l, r, v;
        scanf("%d %d %d", &l, &r, &v);
        // the rest of the code remains the same
    }
    // the rest of the code remains the same
    return 0;
}
```
Remember that these optimizations may not always improve the performance significantly as modern compilers are usually smart enough to optimize the code on their own.
