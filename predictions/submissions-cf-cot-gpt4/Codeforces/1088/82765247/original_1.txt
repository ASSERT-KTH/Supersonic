The given C++ program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Remove unused `typedefs`, `#define` and macros: This will make the program cleaner and easier to understand. It doesn't affect the running time or memory usage optimization, but it's a good practice to keep the code clean.

2. Use reserve function for vectors: If you know the size of the vector beforehand, it is a good practice to use the reserve function. This will allocate the memory beforehand and prevent reallocations which could slow down the program.

3. Use `++i` instead of `i++` in loop iterations: In C++, `++i` can be more efficient than `i++` because `i++` creates a temporary object which can be avoided by using `++i`. This could potentially optimize the running time.

4. Avoid multiple computations: The expressions `(v[i] - i) % (n + 1)` and `i - v[i]` are computed twice in the loop. They can be stored in a variable and reused to reduce computation time.

5. Use '\n' instead of `endl`: The `endl` manipulator in C++ does two tasks: inserts a newline character and flushes the output buffer. Flushing the output buffer is an expensive operation in terms of time complexity. Therefore, we should use '\n' instead of `endl` for new lines.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int lli;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  lli n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<lli> v(n + 1);
  vector<pair<lli, pair<lli, lli>>> pp;
  pp.reserve(n+2); // reserve memory for n+2 elements
  
  for (lli i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    cin >> v[i];
  }
  
  v[0] = -1;
  for (lli i = n; i >= 1; --i) {
    if (v[i] > i) {
      lli rem = (v[i] - i) % (n + 1);
      pp.push_back({1, {i, n + 1 - rem}});
      for (lli j = 1; j <= i; ++j) {
        v[j] = v[j] + n + 1 - rem;
      }
    } else {
      lli diff = i - v[i];
      pp.push_back({1, {i, diff}});
      for (lli j = 1; j <= i; ++j) {
        v[j] = v[j] + diff;
      }
    }
  }
  
  pp.push_back({2, {n, n + 1}});
  
  cout << pp.size() << "\n";
  for (auto& i : pp) { // use reference to avoid copying
    cout << i.first << " " << i.second.first << " " << i.second.second << "\n";
  }
}
```
The main optimization techniques used here were avoiding multiple computations, reserving memory for vectors, using pre-increment operators, and using '\n' instead of `endl`.
