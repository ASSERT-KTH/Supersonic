Let's go through the code and see what we can optimize:

1. Use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes almost all standard C++ libraries. It's convenient, but it can lead to slow compilation times. It's better to include only the libraries we need.

2. `bsearch` function: This function calculates the middle index `m` before entering the while loop, and then never updates it within the loop. This will cause an infinite loop if the searched key isn't found.

3. `ncr` function: This function calculates the binomial coefficient, but it's not used anywhere in the code.

4. `find` and `join` functions: These are used in disjoint set data structures, but they're not used anywhere in the code.

5. `dfs` function: The `flag` parameter is used to conditionally check and update the same statements. This can be simplified by removing the `flag` and always executing the conditional checks and updates.

6. In the `main` function, the `vis` vector is initialized with `n+1` zeros. It's more efficient to initialize it with `n` zeros and then push back one more zero to the vector after filling it up.

7. Also in the `main` function, we can avoid the use of `ans` vector by incrementing `an` directly in the `dfs` function whenever a leaf node is found.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>

using namespace std;

void dfs(int x, vector<int> ad[], vector<int> &vis, int cat[], int m, int cc, int &an) {
  vis[x] = 1;
  if (cat[x - 1] == 1) {
    cc++;
    m = max(m, cc);
  } else {
    cc = 0;
    m = max(m, cc);
  }
  if (ad[x].size() == 1 && x != 1 && m <= cat[0]) {
    ++an;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < ad[x].size(); i++) {
    if (vis[ad[x][i]] == 0)
      dfs(ad[x][i], ad, vis, cat, m, cc, an);
  }
}

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  int cat[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> cat[i];
  }
  int an = 0;
  if (n == 2) {
    if (cat[1] == 0 || cat[0] + cat[1] <= m)
      an++;
    cout << an << endl;
    return 0;
  }
  vector<int> ad[n + 1];
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    ad[x].push_back(y);
    ad[y].push_back(x);
  }
  vector<int> vis(n, 0);
  vis.push_back(0);
  dfs(1, ad, vis, cat, 0, 0, an);
  cout << an << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
