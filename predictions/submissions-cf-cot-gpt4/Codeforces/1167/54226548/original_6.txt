The given C/C++ program seems to be implementing a Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm on a graph and counting the size of each connected component. For each node, it outputs the size of a connected component that the node belongs to.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. The main optimization would be to avoid repetitive computation. In the current implementation, the DFS algorithm is run for every node. However, once a connected component is found, we can assign the size of the connected component to all nodes in the component. When we come across these nodes again, we can directly output the size without running DFS again. 

2. Use a boolean array instead of a bitset for the 'visited' information. The bitset operation is slower as compared to simple boolean array operation.

3. The vector 'list' is not required. We can increment a counter instead of pushing the node into the vector, and then use the counter to assign the size to the connected component members.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define mp make_pair
#define fi first
#define se second
#define ll long long
#define MOD 1000000007
using namespace std;
int n, m;
vector<int> graph[500001];
int ans[500001];
bool visited[500001] = {false};
int num() {
  int res;
  cin >> res;
  return res;
}
int answer(int i) {
  if (ans[i] > 0)
    return ans[i];
  stack<int> s;
  s.push(i);
  int count = 0;
  while (!s.empty()) {
    int now = s.top();
    s.pop();
    if (!visited[now]) {
      visited[now] = true;
      count++;
      for (int next : graph[now])
        if (!visited[next]) {
          s.push(next);
        }
    }
  }
  for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
    if (visited[j] && ans[j] == 0)
      ans[j] = count;
  }
  return ans[i];
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  n = num();
  m = num();
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int l = num() - 1;
    if (l < 0)
      continue;
    int a = num();
    while (l-- > 0) {
      int b = num();
      graph[a].pb(b);
      graph[b].pb(a);
      a = b;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    cout << answer(i) << " ";
  cout << endl;
}
```

In this optimized version, the DFS algorithm is run only for the nodes that haven't been visited yet, which reduces the time complexity. The space used by the vector 'list' is also saved.
