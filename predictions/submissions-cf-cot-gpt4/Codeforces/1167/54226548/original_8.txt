The given program is written in C++ and it's a graph related problem. It's using depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the graph and storing the size of each connected component in the graph.

Before optimizing this program, we need to understand that the main bottleneck for performance in this kind of problem is usually the traversal of the graph, which includes the DFS and the updating of the visited nodes.

Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);`, `cin.tie(NULL);`, `cout.tie(NULL);` as they disable synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. If not needed, you can remove them to reduce unnecessary overhead.
  
2. Use adjacency list to store the graph. This will decrease the space complexity from O(V^2) to O(V+E) where V is number of vertices and E is number of edges.

3. Use `reserve` function for vector list to avoid resizing and copying of vector contents when elements are added.

4. In the answer function, we're creating a temporary vector list and pushing all nodes in it. Instead of that we can simply increment a counter every time we visit a node. This will save the extra space used by the list vector and also the time taken to push elements in it.

5. In the main function, we're calling answer function for every node from 1 to n. Instead of that, we can call this function only for the nodes which are not visited yet. This will avoid unnecessary function calls and thus save computation time.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int n, m;
vector<int> graph[500001];
int ans[500001];
bitset<500001> visited;

int num() {
  int res;
  cin >> res;
  return res;
}

int answer(int i) {
  if (ans[i] > 0)
    return ans[i];
  
  stack<int> s;
  s.push(i);
  visited.set(i);
  int res = 0;
  
  while (!s.empty()) {
    int now = s.top();
    s.pop();
    res++;
    for (int next : graph[now])
      if (!visited[next]) {
        visited.set(next);
        s.push(next);
      }
  }
  
  for (int next : graph[i])
    ans[next] = res;
  return res;
}

int main() {
  n = num();
  m = num();
  
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int l = num() - 1;
    if (l < 0)
      continue;
    int a = num();
    while (l-- > 0) {
      int b = num();
      graph[a].push_back(b);
      graph[b].push_back(a);
      a = b;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    if (!visited[i])
      cout << answer(i) << " ";
  cout << endl;
}
```
Please note that the efficiency of the program mainly depends on the nature of the input data and the specific requirements of your task.
