This program can be optimized in terms of memory and runtime in the following ways:

1. The function num() being used to take inputs is an unnecessary overhead. The cin can be directly used in the main function to take inputs.
2. The use of 'ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);' is not necessary here as there is no interaction of C and C++ streams, and no alternating between cin/cout and printf/scanf type operations.
3. The bitset bs is used to keep track of visited nodes, but it is re-initialized every time the answer function is called. This is unnecessary as we can simply initialize it once in the main function and pass it as a reference to the answer function.
4. The vector 'list' is being used to keep track of the nodes visited in each DFS traversal, only to find its size at the end. Instead, a counter can be used to keep track of the number of nodes.
5. The use of a stack to perform the DFS traversal can be replaced by recursion which lessens the memory overhead of maintaining a stack.

The optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
#define fi first
#define se second
#define ll long long
#define MOD 1000000007
using namespace std;

int n, m;
vector<int> graph[500001];
int ans[500001];
bitset<500001> bs;

void dfs(int i, int& count) {
  bs.set(i);
  count++;
  for (int next : graph[i])
    if (!bs[next])
      dfs(next, count);
}

int answer(int i) {
  if (ans[i] > 0)
    return ans[i];
  int count = 0;
  dfs(i, count);
  for (int next : graph[i])
    ans[next] = count;
  return count;
}

int main() {
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int l;
    cin >> l;
    l--;
    if (l < 0)
      continue;
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    while (l-- > 0) {
      int b;
      cin >> b;
      graph[a].pb(b);
      graph[b].pb(a);
      a = b;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    cout << answer(i) << " ";
  cout << endl;
}
```
This optimized version of the program reduces function calls, unnecessary variable re-initializations, and replaces stack-based DFS with recursion, making it more efficient in memory and runtime.
