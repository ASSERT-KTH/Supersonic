This program is already quite optimized, it uses DFS (Depth-First Search) to find the size of each connected component.

However, there are a few small changes we can make to slightly improve the performance of the program:

1. Replace the vector `list` with a simple integer counter `counter`. Instead of adding elements to the vector and then getting the size of the vector, we can simply increment the counter each time we would have added an element to the vector.

2. We can reserve the size of the `graph` vector to avoid reallocation. Although the size of the graph is not known beforehand, we can still reserve some memory based on the number of nodes and edges.

3. Instead of using `cin.tie(NULL)` and `cout.tie(NULL)`, we can use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`. This will make C++ standard streams unsynchronized which can make input and output operations faster.

4. Instead of using `cout << endl;`, we can use `cout << "\n";`. `endl` flushes the output buffer each time it's called, which can slow down the program, especially when it's called in a loop.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
#define fi first
#define se second
#define ll long long
#define MOD 1000000007
using namespace std;
int n, m;
vector<int> graph[500001];
int ans[500001];
int num() {
  int res;
  cin >> res;
  return res;
}
int answer(int i) {
  if (ans[i] > 0)
    return ans[i];
  stack<int> s;
  s.push(i);
  int counter = 0;
  bitset<500001> bs;
  bs.set(i);
  while (!s.empty()) {
    int now = s.top();
    s.pop();
    counter++;
    for (int next : graph[now])
      if (!bs[next]) {
        bs.set(next);
        s.push(next);
      }
  }
  for (int next : graph[i])
    ans[next] = counter;
  return counter;
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  n = num();
  m = num();
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int l = num() - 1;
    if (l < 0)
      continue;
    int a = num();
    while (l-- > 0) {
      int b = num();
      graph[a].pb(b);
      graph[b].pb(a);
      a = b;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    cout << answer(i) << " ";
  cout << "\n";
}
```
