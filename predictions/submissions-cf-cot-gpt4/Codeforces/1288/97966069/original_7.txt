The given code is quite optimized already but there are still a few things that can be done to further optimize it. Here are the optimization steps:

1. Instead of using `bits/stdc++.h`, use only the libraries that you need. `bits/stdc++.h` is actually quite heavy because it includes every standard library. In this code, you only use `iostream`, `vector` and `utility`.

2. `#define fastio ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(NULL), cout.tie(NULL);` This line makes the input and output more efficient, but it's only necessary when your program does a lot of input and output operations. In this case, the program does not do enough I/O operations to justify it. Also, it's a good practice to turn it off before returning from your program.

3. You have defined a lot of functions and macros like 'pe', 'ps', 'mp', 'PB', 'pb', 'p', 'ii', 'vii', 'vi' etc. but you aren't using most of them. Removing these unused functions and macros will decrease the memory usage of your program.

4. The for loop in the solve function runs from 1 to n, but it can be optimized to run till sqrt(n). This is because if a solution exists in the range sqrt(n) to n, it would also exist in the range 1 to sqrt(n).

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

void solve() {
  ll n, d;
  cin >> n >> d;
  if (d <= n) {
    cout << "YES" << endl;
    return;
  }
  for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
    ll q = ((d - 1) / (i + 1)) + 1;
    ll t = i + q;
    if (t <= n) {
      cout << "YES" << endl;
      return;
    }
  }
  cout << "NO" << endl;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code performs the same operations as the original code but it's now more efficient in terms of memory usage and running time.
