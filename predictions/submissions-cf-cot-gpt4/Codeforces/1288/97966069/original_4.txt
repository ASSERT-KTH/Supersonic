This C++ program is already quite optimized. However, there are a few small changes we can still make to slightly improve its efficiency:

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes almost all the standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. It's better to include only the headers that are actually used in the program.

2. Unused macros and templates: There are multiple unused macros and template functions in the program. Removing them will make the code cleaner and more readable.

3. The solve function's logic can be improved to reduce the number of iterations. Instead of starting from 1, we can start from the square root of `n`. This is because if the solution exists, it must be less than or equal to the square root of `n`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  long long n, d;
  cin >> n >> d;
  if (d <= n) {
    cout << "YES\n";
    return;
  }
  for (int i = sqrt(n); i > 0; i--) {
    long long q = ((d - 1) / (i + 1)) + 1;
    long long t = i + q;
    if (t <= n) {
      cout << "YES\n";
      return;
    }
  }
  cout << "NO\n";
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
}
```

This code does the same thing as the previous one, but it's slightly faster and uses less memory.
