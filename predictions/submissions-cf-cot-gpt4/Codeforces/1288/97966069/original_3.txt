The main optimization that can be done here is to reduce the range of the loop in the solve function. The loop currently runs from 1 to n, which can be time-consuming if n is large. We can reduce this range by noting that the value of t = i + q is minimized when i equals the square root of d. Therefore, we only need to check values of i from 1 to sqrt(d). 

Here are the steps to optimize the given program:

1. Replace `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)` with `for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt(d); i++)`. This will greatly reduce the number of iterations in the loop and hence optimize the program in terms of running time.
2. Remove unnecessary code: Several template functions in the given code are not being used. Removing these functions will not affect the functionality of the code but will make it cleaner and easier to read.
3. Use only necessary include statements: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` statement includes a lot of unnecessary headers which can increase compilation time. Replace it with the specific include statements that are needed.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  long long n, d;
  cin >> n >> d;
  
  if (d <= n) {
    cout << "YES" << endl;
    return;
  }
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt(d); i++) {
    long long q = ((d - 1) / (i + 1)) + 1;
    long long t = i + q;
    
    if (t <= n) {
      cout << "YES" << endl;
      return;
    }
  }

  cout << "NO" << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  
  while (t--)
    solve();
    
  return 0;
}
```
