The main optimization here can be done in the `solve` function. Currently, it performs a linear search to check if there exists a number `i` for which `i + ((d - 1) / (i + 1)) + 1 <= n`. This can be optimized by using a binary search instead of a linear search, which would improve the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

Here are the steps for optimization:

1. Replace the loop in the `solve` function with a binary search. Start the binary search with `low = 0` and `high = n`.
2. Calculate `mid = (low + high) / 2`. If `mid + ((d - 1) / (mid + 1)) + 1 <= n`, set `high = mid`. Otherwise, set `low = mid + 1`.
3. Continue the binary search until `low < high`.
4. Finally, if `low + ((d - 1) / (low + 1)) + 1 <= n`, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define fastio ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(NULL), cout.tie(NULL);
void pe() { cout << endl; }
template <class T1> void pe(T1 e) { cout << e << endl; }

int t;
void solve() {
  ll n, d;
  cin >> n >> d;
  if (d <= n) {
    pe("YES");
    return;
  }
  ll low = 0, high = n;
  while (low < high) {
    ll mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
    if (mid + ((d - 1) / (mid + 1)) + 1 <= n) {
      high = mid;
    } else {
      low = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  if (low + ((d - 1) / (low + 1)) + 1 <= n) {
    pe("YES");
  } else {
    pe("NO");
  }
}
int main() {
  fastio cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
}
```

I've also removed some unused code to reduce memory usage.
