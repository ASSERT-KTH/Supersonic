Given the complexity of your code, it's somewhat hard to optimize it without knowing the specific problem it's trying to solve. However, there are a few general suggestions we can make based on common best practices in C++ programming:

1. **Avoid using "using namespace std;"**: Although it might seem convenient, using this line can lead to name clashes if you use libraries that have the same function names as the standard library.

2. **Avoid the "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" header**: This header file includes quite a lot of libraries and using it can increase your compilation time significantly. It's better to include only the libraries that you actually use.

3. **Avoid macros when possible**: Macros can make your code harder to debug and understand. For example, instead of using the macro "rep", you could use a normal for loop. This will make your code more clear to other people (and to you when you come back to it later).

4. **Avoid global variables**: In your code, you have defined "P" and "ele" as global variables, which is generally not a good idea. Global variables can lead to unexpected side effects and make your code harder to understand and debug. It's better to define variables in the smallest scope where they are needed.

5. **Use meaningful variable and function names**: It's good practice to use descriptive names for variables and functions to make your code easier to understand. For example, instead of "P" and "ele", use names that indicate what these variables represent.

6. **Avoid redundant definitions**: In your code, both "M" and "MOD" are defined as the same value, which is unnecessary.

Here is your code with some of these optimizations applied:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cassert>

using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::ostream;
using std::istream;
using std::vector;
using std::pair;

const long long MOD = 1000000007;
const long long INF = 1e18;
const int N = 1e6 + 5;

// Removed redundant code and macros here...

struct mod_int {
  int val;
  mod_int(long long v = 0) {
    if (v < 0)
      v = v % MOD + MOD;
    if (v >= MOD)
      v %= MOD;
    val = v;
  }
  // Rest of the code...
};

vector<mod_int> P(N);
vector<mod_int> ele(N);

void solve() {
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  for (int i = 1; i < k + 4; ++i) {
    mod_int j = i;
    P[i] = P[i - 1] + j.pow(k);
  }
  // Rest of the solve function...
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int t = 1;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This is a basic attempt at optimization, the code can still be optimized further depending on the exact problem you're trying to solve.
