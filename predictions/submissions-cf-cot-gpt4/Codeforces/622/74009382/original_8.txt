Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unused macros and definitions: You have defined some macros that are not being used in the code. For instance, M, MM, fr, sc, mem1, mem0, ppc. Similarly, the template functions for += and -= for pairs are also not used. Removing these will make the code cleaner and more readable.

2. Replace #define with const or inline functions: #define does not respect scope and has a global effect. This can cause problems with name clashes. In C++, it's better to use const or inline functions. In this context, the macros pb, ppb, pf, ppf, all, sz can be replaced with proper functions or removed if not used.

3. Avoid using "using namespace std": This can avoid potential name clashes and make it clear where each function or object is coming from.

4. Use proper data types: Use the proper data types that exactly fit your needs. For instance, you used "int long long" for the data type of variables that don't seem to need such a large range. This wastes memory.

5. Avoid using global variables: In your code, P and ele are global arrays. Using global variables can lead to unexpected results because they can be modified from anywhere in the code. It's better to make them local to the functions that use them if possible.

6. Avoid unnecessary computation: In your function pw, you calculate a^b mod p using a recursive function. But if b is even, you calculate t twice. It's better to calculate it once and store the result.

Optimized Code:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 1000000007;
const long long INF = 1e18;
const int N = 1e6 + 5;

inline int mod_inv(int a, int m = MOD) {
    int g = m, r = a, x = 0, y = 1;
    while (r != 0) {
        int q = g / r;
        g %= r;
        std::swap(g, r);
        x -= q * y;
        std::swap(x, y);
    }
    return x < 0 ? x + m : x;
}

int pw(int a, int b = MOD - 2, int p = MOD) {
    if (b == 0)
        return 1;
    int t = pw(a, b / 2, p);
    int res = (1LL * t * t) % p;
    if (b % 2)
        res = (1LL * a * res) % p;
    return res;
}

void solve() {
    std::vector<int> P(N), ele(N);
    int n, k;
    std::cin >> n >> k;
    for (int i = 1; i < k + 4; i++) {
        int j = i;
        P[i] = P[i - 1] + pw(j, k);
    }
    if (n <= k + 2) {
        std::cout << P[n];
        return;
    }
    ele[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < k + 2; i++) {
        ele[1] = (ele[1] * (MOD + n - i - 1)) % MOD;
        ele[1] = (ele[1] * pw(MOD - i)) % MOD;
    }
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i < k + 3; i++) {
        ele[i] = (ele[i - 1] * (MOD - k + i - 3)) % MOD;
        ele[i] = (ele[i] * pw(i - 1)) % MOD;
        ele[i] = (ele[i] * pw(MOD + n - i)) % MOD;
        ele[i] = (ele[i] * (MOD + n - i + 1)) % MOD;
        ans = (ans + ele[i] * P[i]) % MOD;
    }
    std::cout << ans;
}

int main() {
    solve();
    return 0;
}
