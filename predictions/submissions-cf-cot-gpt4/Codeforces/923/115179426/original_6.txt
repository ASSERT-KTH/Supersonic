The code seems to be already optimized for most part. However, we can perform a slight optimization in the "ins" and "qry" lambda functions. Currently, the code is incrementing and decrementing the count at each node in the tree for every bit of the number. This leads to multiple updates and checks on the same values. 

What we could do is to reduce the number of updates and checks for the count by moving them outside the loop. We only need to update the count once when we enter the function and once when we exit the function. This reduces the number of operations inside the loop and should speed up the code a bit.

We can also avoid using lambda functions and make "ins" and "qry" as regular functions as there is no need to capture any variables from the surrounding scope. This makes the code easier to read and understand. 

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const long long mxn = 32 * 3e5;
vector<vector<long long>> tr(mxn, vector<long long>(2));
vector<long long> a, cnt(mxn);
long long tot = 1, n;

void ins(long long x) {
    long long p = 1;
    ++cnt[p];
    for (long long i = 30; i >= 0; --i) {
        long long b = (x >> i) & 1;
        if (!tr[p][b]) {
            tr[p][b] = ++tot;
        }
        p = tr[p][b];
    }
    ++cnt[p];
}

long long qry(long long x) {
    long long p = 1, res = 0;
    --cnt[p];
    for (long long i = 30; i >= 0; --i) {
        long long b = (x >> i) & 1;
        if (cnt[tr[p][b]] > 0) {
            p = tr[p][b];
        } else {
            p = tr[p][!b];
            res += (1 << i);
        }
    }
    --cnt[p];
    return res;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cin >> n;
    a.resize(n);
    for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        long long b;
        cin >> b;
        ins(b);
    }
    for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cout << qry(a[i]) << ' ';
    }
    cout << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
Note: The above optimizations are expected to provide minor improvements in running time and do not change the overall time complexity of the program. The actual benefits will depend on the specific inputs to the program.
