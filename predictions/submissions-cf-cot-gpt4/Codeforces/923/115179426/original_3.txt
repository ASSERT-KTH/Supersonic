The given program seems to be well-written and optimized. However, there are few small adjustments that we could make:

1. Use `reserve` to preallocate memory for vectors: `std::vector` will automatically resize when elements are added, but this resizing operation can be expensive if performed frequently. Since we know the size beforehand, we can use `reserve` to preallocate the memory, which would optimize memory usage.

2. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: This is a GCC specific library which includes a lot of unnecessary headers, causing increased compilation time. We should include only those libraries which are actually used in the program. 

3. Avoid using `std::endl`: `std::endl` causes a flush operation which can be expensive in terms of time. We can replace `std::endl` with `'\n'` to avoid this.

Optimized code:

```cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  const long long mxn = 32 * 3e5;
  vector<vector<long long>> tr;
  tr.reserve(mxn);
  for(long long i = 0; i < mxn; ++i) {
      tr.push_back(vector<long long>(2));
  }
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<long long> a;
  a.reserve(n);
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  vector<long long> cnt;
  cnt.reserve(mxn);
  long long tot = 1;
  auto ins = [&](long long x) {
    long long p = 1;
    ++cnt[p];
    for (long long i = 30; i >= 0; --i) {
      long long b = (x >> i) & 1;
      if (!tr[p][b]) {
        tr[p][b] = ++tot;
      }
      p = tr[p][b];
      ++cnt[p];
    }
    ++cnt[p];
  };
  auto qry = [&](long long x) {
    long long p = 1;
    --cnt[p];
    long long res = 0;
    for (long long i = 30; i >= 0; --i) {
      long long b = (x >> i) & 1;
      if (cnt[tr[p][b]] > 0) {
        p = tr[p][b];
      } else {
        p = tr[p][!b];
        res += (1 << i);
      }
      --cnt[p];
    }
    --cnt[p];
    return res;
  };
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    long long b;
    cin >> b;
    ins(b);
  }
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cout << qry(a[i]) << ' ';
  }
  cout << '\n';
  return 0;
}

```
Note that the performance gain from these changes may not be significant. The major part of the program's running time is likely dominated by the algorithm itself, not by these small details.
