This program is already decently optimized for competitive programming. However, there are a few possible small changes that might make a difference:

1. Avoid `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which can slow down compilation time. Include only the necessary libraries.

2. `ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(0);` are already used to speed up I/O operations, but we can add `cout.tie(0);` to untie `cout` from `cin`, which can slightly increase the program's speed.

3. Use `"\n"` instead of `endl` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output buffer.

4. The vectors `tr` and `cnt` are declared with a size of `mxn`. If `mxn` is significantly larger than `n`, this can waste a lot of memory. However, if the maximum size is necessary for the algorithm to work correctly, this might not be avoidable. But you should always verify if the max size is really necessary or if the vectors could be resized during the program's execution.

5. The `ins` and `qry` lambdas could be turned into regular functions. This is not an optimization, but it might make the code clearer. However, if these functions are only used in this specific context and rely on variables from the outer scope, lambdas might be the more appropriate option.

Let's apply these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

const long long mxn = 32 * 3e5;
vector<vector<long long>> tr(mxn, vector<long long>(2));
vector<long long> cnt(mxn);
long long tot = 1;

void ins(long long x) {
  long long p = 1;
  ++cnt[p];
  for (long long i = 30; i >= 0; --i) {
    long long b = (x >> i) & 1;
    if (!tr[p][b]) {
      tr[p][b] = ++tot;
    }
    p = tr[p][b];
    ++cnt[p];
  }
  ++cnt[p];
}

long long qry(long long x) {
  long long p = 1;
  --cnt[p];
  long long res = 0;
  for (long long i = 30; i >= 0; --i) {
    long long b = (x >> i) & 1;
    if (cnt[tr[p][b]] > 0) {
      p = tr[p][b];
    } else {
      p = tr[p][!b];
      res += (1 << i);
    }
    --cnt[p];
  }
  --cnt[p];
  return res;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<long long> a(n);
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    long long b;
    cin >> b;
    ins(b);
  }
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cout << qry(a[i]) << ' ';
  }
  cout << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations might not make a noticeable difference in the program's performance, as the original program was already quite optimized.
