The given C++ program uses some modern C++ features and practices but there are still possibilities for optimization. 

1. The first optimization can be the removal of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file is actually not a standard header file but a GCC extension which includes all standard C++ header files. Including all standard C++ libraries can slow down the compilation process greatly. Instead of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, we can include only required header files.

2. The `ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(0);` are used to make I/O operations faster but it's not always necessary.

3. The vector `tr` and `cnt` have a size of `mxn` which is a very large size. It would be better to allocate memory dynamically as per the need.

4. The `auto` keyword is used for lambda expressions, which makes the code cleaner but doesn't optimize the program in terms of running time or memory usage. It's just a matter of code style.

5. Instead of loading all the inputs into the vector `a`, we can directly query them. It will save space of vector `a`.

6. Finally, instead of printing the results one by one, we can store them in a vector and print them all together at once. It can reduce the I/O operations and thus makes the program faster.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  const long long mxn = 32 * 3e5;
  vector<vector<long long>> tr(1, vector<long long>(2));
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<long long> cnt(1);
  long long tot = 1;
  auto ins = [&](long long x) {
    long long p = 0;
    ++cnt[p];
    for (long long i = 30; i >= 0; --i) {
      long long b = (x >> i) & 1;
      if (!tr[p][b]) {
        tr[p][b] = tr.size();
        tr.push_back(vector<long long>(2));
        cnt.push_back(0);
      }
      p = tr[p][b];
      ++cnt[p];
    }
  };
  auto qry = [&](long long x) {
    long long p = 0;
    --cnt[p];
    long long res = 0;
    for (long long i = 30; i >= 0; --i) {
      long long b = (x >> i) & 1;
      if (cnt[tr[p][b]] > 0) {
        p = tr[p][b];
      } else {
        p = tr[p][!b];
        res += (1 << i);
      }
      --cnt[p];
    }
    return res;
  };
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    long long b;
    cin >> b;
    ins(b);
  }
  vector<long long> results(n);
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    long long a;
    cin >> a;
    results[i] = qry(a);
  }
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cout << results[i] << ' ';
  }
  cout << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the optimization is very dependent on the specific use case and the size of the input.
