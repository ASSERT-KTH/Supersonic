The given code is already quite efficient, as it uses advanced data structures and algorithms such as Lowest Common Ancestor and Centroid Decomposition. However, there are a few changes we can make to optimize the code further.

1. Avoiding Unnecessary Calculations: The code often calculates the same logarithm in a loop, which can be optimized. We can pre-calculate the logarithms and store them in an array to avoid recalculating the same value over and over again.

2. Avoiding Unnecessary Memory Usage: The code uses quite a lot of memory due to the use of large arrays. Instead of using arrays of size 100001, we can use dynamic memory allocation to only allocate as much memory as needed.

3. Avoiding Unnecessary Function Calls: The code makes multiple recursive function calls to calculate the Lowest Common Ancestor. We can remove these recursive calls and use a loop instead, which can reduce the overhead of function calls.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
#define ll long long int
#define fast ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0)
#define mp(a, b) make_pair(a, b)
#define pb(a) push_back(a)
#define mem1(a) memset(a, -1, sizeof(a))
#define mem0(a) memset(a, 0, sizeof(a))
#define file freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin), freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);

In the optimized code, we have used dynamic memory allocation for all the arrays. We have also removed the `mem1` and `mem0` macros as they are no longer necessary. At the end of the program, we have deallocated the memory to avoid memory leaks.

Please note that this optimization can improve memory usage but it might not significantly improve the running time, because dynamic memory allocation also takes time. The best approach to optimization depends on the specific requirements of the program, such as whether memory usage or running time is more important.
