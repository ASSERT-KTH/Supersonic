The given C/C++ program is already optimized for most parts. However, there are still some minor changes that can be applied to further optimize it. 

1. Unnecessary headers: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a header that includes most of the standard library in C++. This is not recommended for production code as it increases compilation time and it's not standard, so it might not work on all compilers. It's better to include only the headers that are actually used in the program. The `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<ctime>`, `<map>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<string>`, and `<vector>` headers are already included in `<bits/stdc++.h>`, so they are redundant. 

2. Use of `#define FAST`: While this is a common practice in competitive programming to speed up I/O operations, it can lead to unclean code. It's better to write these three lines where they are actually used.

3. Use of `#define pi pair<int, int>`: This line is unnecessary as this type of pair is not used in the program.

4. Use of `#define pb push_back`: This can make the code less readable to people who are not familiar with this abbreviation. It's better to use `push_back` directly.

5. Initialization of `mod`: This variable is declared but not used anywhere in the program. It can be removed.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;

int r[4] = {1, 0, 0, -1};
int c[4] = {0, -1, 1, 0};
char p[4] = {'D', 'L', 'R', 'U'};
int t, n, m;
vector<pair<int, int>> adj[300005];
bool match[300005];
vector<int> matching;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n >> m;
    matching.clear();
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3 * n; i++) {
      adj[i].clear();
    }
    memset(match, 0, sizeof(match));
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
      int x;
      int y;
      cin >> x >> y;
      adj[x].push_back(make_pair(y, i));
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3 * n; i++) {
      vector<pair<int, int>>::iterator it = adj[i].begin();
      if (match[i] == true)
        continue;
      for (; it != adj[i].end(); it++) {
        int nd = (*it).first;
        int ed = (*it).second;
        if (match[nd] == false) {
          matching.push_back(ed);
          match[nd] = true;
          match[i] = true;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    if (matching.size() >= n) {
      cout << "Matching" << '\n';
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << matching[i] << " ";
      }
      cout << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    vector<int> v;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3 * n; i++) {
      if (match[i] == false)
        v.push_back(i);
    }
    if (v.size() >= n) {
      cout << "IndSet" << '\n';
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << v[i] << " ";
      }
    } else
      cout << "Impossible";
    cout << '\n';
    v.clear();
  }
}
```

The optimized program performs the exact same operations as the original one, but it's cleaner and more readable.
