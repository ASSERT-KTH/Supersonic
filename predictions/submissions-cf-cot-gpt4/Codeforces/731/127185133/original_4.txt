The C++ program you posted checks if the sequence of numbers can be altered such that every odd number will be followed by at least one even number by decreasing the following number, otherwise, it prints "NO". 

Optimization steps:

1. Avoid dynamic array: In C++, dynamic arrays (like `int a[n];`) allocated on stack could lead to stack overflow for large inputs. Thus, it's better to use std::vector which is allocated on heap and is safer.

2. Avoid multiple traversals: The code traverses the array twice. Once for reading the input and once for checking the conditions. We can merge these two traversals into one, thus saving time.

3. Avoid accessing out of bound elements: The code checks `a[i+1]` which could potentially access an out-of-bound element. To avoid this, the condition inside the second for loop can be adjusted.

4. Use fast IO operations: `cin` and `cout` are slower compared to scanf and printf. Since we are optimizing, we can use scanf and printf to speed up IO operations.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  vector<int> a(n);
  bool flag = true;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    if (a[i] & 1) {
      if (i == n - 1 || a[i + 1] == 0) {
        flag = false;
        break;
      } else {
        a[i + 1]--;
      }
    }
  }
  printf("%s\n", flag ? "YES" : "NO");
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations are focused on improving the efficiency and safety of the program, and may not necessarily improve the speed or memory usage significantly for small input sizes.
