First, let's go through the optimization steps:

1. Avoid using "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" as it includes more files than required, thus increasing the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries.

2. Do not use "using namespace std;" as it may cause naming conflicts in larger programs. Specify the namespace where needed.

3. The array 'a' is declared with a size 'n' that is input at runtime. This is not recommended as it can lead to unpredictable behavior. Instead, use std::vector, which can adjust its size at runtime.

4. In the second loop, it checks `a[i + 1] == 0` which may cause an out-of-bounds error when i = n - 1. Adjust the loop to run until 'n - 1' to avoid this.

5. The 'flag' variable is set to 0 and the loop is broken out of when a certain condition is met. Instead of using 'flag' and 'break', you can immediately output "NO" and return, saving memory and time.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> a[i];

  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if (a[i] & 1) {
      if (a[i + 1] == 0) {
        std::cout << "NO" << "\n";
        return 0;
      } else
        a[i + 1]--;
    }
  }

  if (a[n - 1] & 1) {
    std::cout << "NO" << "\n";
  } else {
    std::cout << "YES" << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```
Please note that in the optimized code, I've also added a check for `a[n - 1]`, which was missing in the original program, but seems necessary given the logic of the code. If the last element is odd, it should output "NO".
