Here are the optimization steps:

1. The use of `<bits/stdc++.h>` is generally considered bad practice because it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, thus increasing compile time. Use only necessary headers.

2. The variable `i` is declared inside the main function but outside the loops, which is unnecessary. We can use local scope for this variable in each loop.

3. The dynamic array `a[n]` can lead to a stack overflow for large `n`, as it is allocated on the stack. Use `std::vector<int>` instead, which is allocated on the heap.

4. The `if` check `a[i + 1] == 0 or i == n - 1` can result in out-of-bounds access for `i == n - 1`. We can avoid this by adjusting the loop condition.

5. Instead of using `std::endl`, use `"\n"`. `std::endl` causes an unnecessary flush of the output buffer, slowing down the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> a[i];

  bool flag = true;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if (a[i] & 1) {
      if (a[i + 1] == 0) {
        flag = false;
        break;
      } else
        a[i + 1]--;
    }
  }
  // Check last element separately
  if (a[n - 1] & 1)
    flag = false;
  
  std::cout << (flag ? "YES" : "NO") << "\n";
}
```
