Your program seems to be checking if an array of numbers can be made completely even by subtracting one from the next number whenever an odd number is found. Here are some ways to optimize it:

1. Dynamic array allocation: In C++, dynamically allocating array size based on user input isn't a good practice and can lead to memory issues. It's better to use `std::vector<int>` instead of `int a[n]`.

2. Avoiding namespace pollution: Using `using namespace std;` is generally considered bad practice. It's better to prefix `std::` where necessary.

3. Avoiding unnecessary checks: In your second loop, you check `a[i + 1] == 0` before checking `i == n - 1`. It's better to check `i == n - 1` first to avoid an array out-of-bounds error when `i` is at the last index.

4. Reducing use of flag variable: Instead of using a flag variable and breaking the loop, you can return directly from the loop if the condition fails. This will make the code cleaner and easier to understand. Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> a[i];
    
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (a[i] & 1) {
      if (i == n - 1 || a[i + 1] == 0) {
        std::cout << "NO" << "\n";
        return 0;
      } else
        a[i + 1]--;
    }
  }
  std::cout << "YES" << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Note that the logic of the program remains the same. These changes are more about code quality and safety, but they can also improve performance by avoiding unnecessary operations.
