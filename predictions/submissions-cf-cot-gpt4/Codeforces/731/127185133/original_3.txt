The given C/C++ program is trying to check if all the odd numbers in the array have another number following them. If an odd number is found at the end of the array or the next number after an odd number is zero, it sets the flag as 0 and breaks the loop.

Here are some steps to optimize the program:

1. The usage of <bits/stdc++.h> is generally not recommended. It's not a standard library and it includes a lot of files which can cause the program to run slow. So replace it with specific libraries needed for your program.

2. Dynamic allocation of array is not recommended, especially when size of the array is large. It can lead to stack overflow. Instead, use std::vector or std::array if the size is known at compile time.

3. The variable `i` is declared in the global scope of the function. It would be better to declare it in the loop scope as it's not used elsewhere.

4. Avoid using `or` operator, use `||` instead. It's more readable and more standard in C++.

5. Instead of using `cout` for printing the result, we can use `puts`. It's faster because it doesn't need to flush the stream after input or output operations.

6. Instead of using `break` statement when `flag` is set to 0, we can put the condition in the `for` loop itself. This will avoid unnecessary checks after the `flag` is set to 0.

Optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> a(n);
  int flag = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> a[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < n && flag; i++) {
    if (a[i] & 1) {
      if (a[i + 1] == 0 || i == n - 1) {
        flag = 0;
      } else
        a[i + 1]--;
    }
  }
  puts(flag ? "YES" : "NO");
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program should be faster and more memory-efficient than the original one.
