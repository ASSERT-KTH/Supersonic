The current code has two loops. The first loop is used to enter values into the array and the second loop is used to perform operations on the array. This can be optimized by combining these two loops into one. We don't need to store all the elements in an array. Instead, we can perform operations on each element as we read it. This will reduce memory usage as we no longer need to store the array.

The second optimization can be made in terms of the condition checking. The condition 'i == n - 1' is checked in every iteration which is unnecessary. This condition can be checked once after the loop.

Here are the steps:
1. Remove the array declaration and the first loop.
2. In the second loop, read the elements directly and perform operations on them.
3. After the loop, check if the last number is odd. If it is, set flag to 0.

The optimized code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int i, last, flag = 1;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> last;
    if (last & 1 && i != n - 1) {
      cin >> last;
      if (last == 0) {
        flag = 0;
        break;
      } else
        last--;
      i++;
    }
  }
  if (last & 1)
    flag = 0;
  cout << (flag ? "YES" : "NO") << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this optimized code assumes that the sequence of input numbers is correct and doesn't contain invalid data (e.g., a negative number, a number greater than the maximum integer value, etc.).
