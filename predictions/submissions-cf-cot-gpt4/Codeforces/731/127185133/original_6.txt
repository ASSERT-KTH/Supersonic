The given C++ program is checking if it's possible to make all elements of an array even by decrementing adjacent elements. 

Let's go through some steps to optimize the program:

1. Use vector instead of array: In C++, it is not recommended to create an array with a size that is not a constant expression. It would be more appropriate to use a vector, which can have a dynamic size.

2. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: This header file includes quite a lot of files, and it's not good practice to include it when you only need a few. It increases compilation time and memory usage. In this program, we only need `iostream`, `vector`, and `string`.

3. Avoid using `std` namespace globally: It's a bad practice to use `using namespace std;` globally. It can lead to name conflicts.

4. Unnecessary check in loop: In the loop where you are checking for odd numbers, there is an unnecessary check `i == n - 1`. We can avoid this check by just iterating till `n-1`.

5. Remove flag variable: We can remove the flag variable and print the result directly from the loop. This will save a bit of memory.

6. Combine loops: We can read the input and check the conditions in the same loop. This will save some CPU cycles as we don't have to iterate through the array twice.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<int> a(n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> a[i];
        if (i != 0 && a[i-1] & 1) {
            if (a[i] == 0) {
                std::cout << "NO\n";
                return 0;
            } else
                a[i]--;
        }
    }

    if (a[n-1] & 1) {
        std::cout << "NO\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "YES\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This optimized code has better memory usage and runtime efficiency compared to the original code.
