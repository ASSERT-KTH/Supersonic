Optimization Steps:
1. The statement `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is usually discouraged as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers which increases the compile time and memory footprint. Specific headers that are needed should be included instead. In this case, we need `iostream` for input-output operations.

2. The variable array `a[n]` is not recommended in C/C++ as it is not a standard feature. It's better to use dynamic memory allocation or STL containers like vector. Here, we can use vector to automatically manage the memory, which can save memory by deallocating when not in use.

3. Instead of using two loops one for input and another for processing, we can merge them into a single loop to save time.

4. The bit operation `a[i] & 1` can be replaced with `a[i] % 2` which is more understandable and does not significantly impact performance.

5. We are checking `i == n - 1` inside the loop which is unnecessary. We can avoid this by looping until `n-1` and handle the last element outside of the loop. This removes one comparison from each iteration.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    int flag = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
        if (a[i] % 2) {
            if (a[i+1] == 0) {
                flag = 0;
                break;
            } else {
                a[i+1]--;
            }
        }
    }
    cin >> a[n-1];  // input the last element
    if (flag && a[n-1] % 2) {  // check the last element
        flag = 0;
    }
    cout << (flag ? "YES" : "NO") << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```
