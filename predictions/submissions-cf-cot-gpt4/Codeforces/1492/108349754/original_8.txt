The provided C/C++ program is already quite efficient in terms of running time and memory usage. However, there are a few potential minor improvements we could make:

1. **Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`:** This header file is quite large and includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which can slow down the program's compilation time. Instead, we can include only the necessary libraries for our program.

2. **Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up C++ I/O operations:** This will disable synchronization between C and C++ I/O operations and untie `cin` from `cout`, making input and output operations faster.

3. **Preallocate memory for `std::string` objects `s` and `t`:** Since we know the size of the strings beforehand, we can preallocate the memory for them, which can reduce the need for dynamic memory allocation during runtime.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int maxn = 200000 + 5;
int pos[maxn], pos2[maxn];

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    string s, t;
    s.reserve(n);
    t.reserve(m);

    cin >> s >> t;

    int p1 = 0;
    int p2 = 0;
    while(p1 < m) {
        while(p2 < n && s[p2] != t[p1]) p2++;
        pos[p1++] = p2++;
    }

    p1 = m - 1;
    p2 = n - 1;
    while(p1 >= 0) {
        while(p2 >= 0 && s[p2] != t[p1]) p2--;
        pos2[p1--] = p2--;
    }

    int ans = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < m - 1; ++i) {
        ans = max(ans, pos2[i + 1] - pos[i]);
    }

    cout << ans;

    return 0;
}
```
