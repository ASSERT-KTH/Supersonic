This program is already quite optimized, but there are still two small changes we could make to potentially improve performance:

1. Removing the usage of `<bits/stdc++.h>`. This is a non-standard header file used commonly in competitive programming, it includes almost all standard C++ libraries. While this is convenient, it's not efficient as it includes many unnecessary libraries. We can replace it with the specific standard libraries that we are actually using: `<iostream>`, `<string>`, and `<algorithm>`.

2. Changing the usage of `std::endl` to a newline character (`'\n'`). `std::endl` not only inserts a newline character, but also flushes the output buffer, which can slow down your program if used excessively. In this case, we're only outputting once, so this change will have a negligible impact. But in general, it's good practice to use `'\n'` when a flush is not necessary.

Here is how the optimized program would look:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 200000 + 5;
int pos[maxn];
int pos2[maxn];
int main() {
  int n, m;
  string s, t;
  cin >> n >> m >> s >> t;
  int p1 = 0, p2 = 0;
  while (p1 < m) {
    while (p2 < n && s[p2] != t[p1])
      p2++;
    pos[p1++] = p2++;
  }
  p1 = m - 1, p2 = n - 1;
  while (p1 >= 0) {
    while (p2 >= 0 && s[p2] != t[p1])
      p2--;
    pos2[p1--] = p2--;
  }
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; ++i) {
    ans = max(ans, pos2[i + 1] - pos[i]);
  }
  cout << ans << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations may not have a significant impact on performance, especially for smaller inputs. The original code was already quite well-optimized.
