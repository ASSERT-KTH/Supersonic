The given program is a C++ program that finds the maximum gap between corresponding elements in two strings. 

The program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes quite a lot of files, and adds extra compilation time. It is better to include only those header files which are used in the program. In this case, only `iostream`, `string`, `algorithm` are used.

2. The constant `maxn` is not used in the program. We can remove it.

3. The input strings `s` and `t` are not being checked for their length before being processed. If the length of `s` is less than `t`, it could result in accessing elements beyond the length of `s`, which can lead to a segmentation fault. So, we can add a condition to check if the length of `s` is less than `t`, and if it is, we can swap `s` and `t`.

4. The variables `p1` and `p2` are being re-declared. This is not necessary and we can simply reassign the values.

5. The `pos` and `pos2` arrays are being used to store the positions of elements in `s` and `t`. But these arrays are not being freed after their use, which can lead to memory wastage. We can free these arrays after their use.

Now, let's modify the program based on these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  string s, t;
  cin >> n >> m >> s >> t;

  if (s.size() < t.size()) {
    swap(s, t);
  }

  int p1 = 0, p2 = 0;
  int* pos = new int[m];
  int* pos2 = new int[m];

  while (p1 < m) {
    while (p2 < n && s[p2] != t[p1])
      p2++;
    pos[p1++] = p2++;
  }
  p1 = m - 1;
  p2 = n - 1;
  while (p1 >= 0) {
    while (p2 >= 0 && s[p2] != t[p1])
      p2--;
    pos2[p1--] = p2--;
  }
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; i++) {
    ans = max(ans, pos2[i + 1] - pos[i]);
  }
  
  delete [] pos;
  delete [] pos2;

  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
