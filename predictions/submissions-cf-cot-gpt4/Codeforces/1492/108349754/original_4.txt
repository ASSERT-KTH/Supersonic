The given C++ program is fairly optimized, but there are small things that can be improved:

1) The include statement `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is not recommended as it includes more than we need, which results in increased compilation time. We can replace it with only the necessary headers which are `#include <iostream>` and `#include <algorithm>`.

2) The usage of global variables (`pos` and `pos2`) is not recommended unless necessary. Since the size of these arrays depends on constants (maxn), we can declare them inside the main function.

3) The usage of `std::endl` can be avoided as it flushes the output buffer each time, which can be a costly operation if we perform it multiple times. We can use "\n" instead.

4) We can reduce the number of increment and decrement operations inside the while loops by using the post-increment and post-decrement operators directly in the array index.

Here is the optimized version of the given program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int maxn = 200000 + 5;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  string s, t;
  cin >> n >> m >> s >> t;
  
  int pos[maxn];
  int pos2[maxn];
  
  int p1 = 0, p2 = 0;
  
  while (p1 < m && p2 < n) {
    if (s[p2] == t[p1])
      pos[p1++] = p2++;
    else
      p2++;
  }
  
  p1 = m - 1, p2 = n - 1;
  
  while (p1 >= 0 && p2 >= 0) {
    if (s[p2] == t[p1])
      pos2[p1--] = p2--;
    else
      p2--;
  }
  
  int ans = 0;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; ++i) {
    ans = max(ans, pos2[i + 1] - pos[i]);
  }
  
  cout << ans << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized version of the program should have the same functionality as the original one, but with slightly faster execution time and slightly less memory usage.
