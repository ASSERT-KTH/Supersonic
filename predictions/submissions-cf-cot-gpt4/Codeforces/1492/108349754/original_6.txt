This program is already well-written and efficient, with a time complexity of O(n). However, some small modifications can be made to improve the readability and maintainability of the code, which indirectly contributes to optimization.

Optimization Steps:

1. Instead of using "#include <bits/stdc++.h>", we can include only those libraries which are actually being used in the program. This helps in reducing the compilation time.
2. We can avoid the use of global variables by declaring the "pos" and "pos2" arrays locally inside the main function.
3. The size of these arrays can be decided at runtime to conserve memory. They can be declared as vectors with initial size m to utilize only the required memory.
4. The variables p1, p2, n, m can be initialized at their declaration which makes the code cleaner.
5. The keyword `register` can be used for variables used inside loops for a minor efficiency boost since register variables are stored in the CPU registers.
6. We can avoid the use of namespace std. This is because in larger programs, this can cause name clashes.

Optimized Program:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int n = 0, m = 0;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  std::string s, t;
  std::cin >> s >> t;

  std::vector<int> pos(m);
  std::vector<int> pos2(m);

  for (register int p1 = 0, p2 = 0; p1 < m; ) {
    while (p2 < n && s[p2] != t[p1])
      p2++;
    pos[p1++] = p2++;
  }
  
  for (register int p1 = m - 1, p2 = n - 1; p1 >= 0; ) {
    while (p2 >= 0 && s[p2] != t[p1])
      p2--;
    pos2[p1--] = p2--;
  }
  
  int ans = 0;
  for (register int i = 0; i < m - 1; ++i) {
    ans = std::max(ans, pos2[i + 1] - pos[i]);
  }
  
  std::cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
