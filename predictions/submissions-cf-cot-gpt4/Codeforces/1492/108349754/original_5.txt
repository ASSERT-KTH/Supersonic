This program doesn't seem to have significant issues regarding running time or memory usage. However, we can still make few improvements:

1. The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes quite a lot of files, and it can slow down the compile time. It's better to include only the necessary headers.

2. The `using namespace std;` is also generally considered bad practice. It's better to qualify the names with `std::` prefix.

3. The `const int maxn = 200000 + 5;` is not necessary since we can use dynamic allocation for `pos` and `pos2`.

4. The `pos` and `pos2` arrays can be declared inside the main function to limit their scope.

5. `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(NULL);` can be used to speed up the `cin` operations.

Considering these, here is an optimized version of the provided code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);

    int n, m;
    std::string s, t;
    std::cin >> n >> m >> s >> t;

    int* pos = new int[m];
    int* pos2 = new int[m];

    int p1 = 0, p2 = 0;
    while (p1 < m) {
        while (p2 < n && s[p2] != t[p1])
            p2++;
        pos[p1++] = p2++;
    }
    p1 = m - 1, p2 = n - 1;
    while (p1 >= 0) {
        while (p2 >= 0 && s[p2] != t[p1])
            p2--;
        pos2[p1--] = p2--;
    }
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; ++i) {
        ans = std::max(ans, pos2[i + 1] - pos[i]);
    }
    std::cout << ans;

    delete[] pos;
    delete[] pos2;

    return 0;
}
```

Note: `new` and `delete` are used here to dynamically allocate memory for `pos` and `pos2`. This is a trade-off - dynamic allocation can be slower than stack allocation, but it allows us to avoid wasting memory if `m` is much less than `maxn`. In a real-world scenario, you would choose between these approaches based on the expected inputs to the program. If you're sure that `m` will always be close to `maxn`, you can keep using stack allocation.
