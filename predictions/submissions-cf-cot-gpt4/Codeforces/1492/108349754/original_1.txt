This code is already quite efficient with respect to time complexity, but there are a few small optimizations we can make to improve readability, memory usage, and potentially runtime:

1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is not standard and it includes a lot of unnecessary headers that can slow down the compilation time. I will replace it with the necessary headers for this program.

2. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(NULL)`: This can make input and output operations faster in some cases.

3. Limit the scope of variables: Declaring `n`, `m`, `s`, `t` just before they are needed can potentially make the program more memory efficient.

4. Use `std::vector<int>` instead of arrays: The size of the arrays `pos` and `pos2` is fixed at `maxn`, which might be wasteful if `m` is significantly less than `maxn`. By using `std::vector<int>`, we can dynamically adjust the size to exactly what we need (`m`), potentially saving a lot of memory.

Here's the optimized code with these changes applied:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  string s, t;
  cin >> s >> t;

  vector<int> pos(m);
  vector<int> pos2(m);

  int p1 = 0, p2 = 0;
  while (p1 < m) {
    while (p2 < n && s[p2] != t[p1])
      p2++;
    pos[p1++] = p2++;
  }
  p1 = m - 1, p2 = n - 1;
  while (p1 >= 0) {
    while (p2 >= 0 && s[p2] != t[p1])
      p2--;
    pos2[p1--] = p2--;
  }
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; ++i) {
    ans = max(ans, pos2[i + 1] - pos[i]);
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations may not have a significant impact on the runtime of the program, but they can improve memory usage and readability.
