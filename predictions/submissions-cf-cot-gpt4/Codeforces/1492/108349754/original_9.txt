This program seems to be an implementation of an algorithm to find the maximum difference between indices of two strings, 's' and 't'. It seems to be quite efficient already, but there are a few things we can do to optimize it.

Optimization Steps:

1. Instead of using the 'bits/stdc++.h' library, which includes almost all the standard libraries in C++, we can include only the libraries we need. This reduces memory usage and compilation time but won't affect the runtime. In this code, we need only 'iostream', 'string', and 'algorithm' libraries. 

2. We can avoid global variables by moving them inside the main function. This will reduce the memory usage and could potentially speed up the program because access to local variables is usually faster.

3. We can replace the 'cin' and 'cout' with 'scanf' and 'printf' respectively, which are faster. 

4. The 'max' function call in the loop for calculating 'ans' can be replaced with a conditional statement. This could potentially speed up the program as function calls usually have a bit of overhead.

After these optimizations, the optimized code will look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  const int maxn = 200000 + 5;
  int pos[maxn];
  int pos2[maxn];
  
  int n, m;
  string s, t;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  cin >> s >> t;
  
  int p1 = 0, p2 = 0;
  while (p1 < m) {
    while (p2 < n && s[p2] != t[p1])
      p2++;
    pos[p1++] = p2++;
  }
  p1 = m - 1, p2 = n - 1;
  while (p1 >= 0) {
    while (p2 >= 0 && s[p2] != t[p1])
      p2--;
    pos2[p1--] = p2--;
  }
  
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; ++i) {
    int diff = pos2[i + 1] - pos[i];
    if (diff > ans)
      ans = diff;
  }
  
  printf("%d", ans);
  
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the performance gain from these optimizations may not be noticeable for small inputs, but for large inputs, these small optimizations can make a difference.
