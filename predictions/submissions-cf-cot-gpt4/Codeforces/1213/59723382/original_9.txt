Here is how we can optimize the program

1. Make use of precalculated arrays:

   The array `v[][]` is calculated for every query, but the `v[][]` array depends only on `m`, not on `n` or the current query. Hence, we can calculate it once at the start of the program and use it for every query.

2. Avoid recalculating `d = m % 10`:

   In the given program, `d = m % 10` is calculated for every query. But this value depends only on `m`, not on `n` or the current query. Hence, we can store it in an array at the start and use it for every query.

So, here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long base = 31;
const long long mod = 1e9 + 7;
int v[20][20];
int cnt[20];
int d[20];

int main() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
#define TASK "C"
  freopen(TASK ".inp", "r", stdin);
  freopen(TASK ".out", "w", stdout);
#endif
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  // precalculate the array v[][]
  for (int m = 1; m <= 10; ++m) {
    d[m] = m % 10;
    long long _d = (d[m] + d[m]) % 10;
    v[1][m] = d[m];
    cnt[m] = 1;
    while (_d != d[m]) {
      ++cnt[m];
      v[cnt[m]][m] = _d;
      _d = (_d + d[m]) % 10;
    }
  }

  int q;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    long long n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    long long k = n / m;
    long long o = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= cnt[m]; ++i)
      o += v[i][m];
    long long res = (k / cnt[m]) * o;
    for (int i = 1; i <= k % cnt[m]; ++i)
      res += v[i][m];
    cout << res << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program reduces the amount of repeated calculations by storing the results in an array. Such optimization is common in programming. This technique is often referred to as "memoization" or "caching".
