Here are some steps for optimization:

1. `bits/stdc++.h`: This header file includes quite a lot of headers, and it could slow down the compile time. We will replace it with only the necessary headers for this code.

2. The 2D array `v` is initialized every time inside the loop. This is unnecessary as the size is fixed. We can initialize it outside the loop.

3. We're using 'long long' for all variables. However, we're not dealing with such large numbers here. We can change variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `cnt`, `_d`, `o` and `res` to `int`.

4. Instead of using `freopen`, we can use `fstream` for file handling which is more flexible and safer.

5. `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);` These lines are used to synchronize C++ standard streams with C streams. However, in this code, we are not using any C standard streams, so these lines are unnecessary.

6. `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` This preprocessor directive is unnecessary in most cases except when you are actually submitting your code to an online judge like Codechef or Codeforces.

7. The variable `_d` is unnecessary. We can directly use `d` and recalculate its value.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

int v[20][20];

int main() {
  fstream input, output;
  input.open("C.inp", ios::in);
  output.open("C.out", ios::out);
  
  int q;
  input >> q;

  while (q--) {
    int n, m;
    input >> n >> m;
    int k = n / m;
    int d = m % 10;
    int cnt = 1;
    v[1][d] = d;
    while ((d + d) % 10 != d) {
      ++cnt;
      v[cnt][d] = (d + d) % 10;
      d = (d + d) % 10;
    }
    int o = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= cnt; ++i)
      o += v[i][d];
    int res = (k / cnt) * o;
    for (int i = 1; i <= k % cnt; ++i)
      res += v[i][d];
    output << res << '\n';
  }
  input.close();
  output.close();
  return 0;
}
```

Also, it's necessary to mention that the effectiveness of these optimizations can vary depending on the specific C++ compiler and its version.
