This code is already quite optimized, but there are some small changes we can make that might improve performance a little.

Step-by-step optimization:

1. The `v` array is declared as a 20x20 int array, but it's only used to store temporary results during each round of the outer while loop. We can reduce the memory usage by declaring `v` inside the while loop as a 10x10 array instead. This will reduce the memory footprint of the program and might also improve cache performance slightly.

2. The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);` lines are used to optimize C++ I/O operations. However, the `cout.tie(0);` line is unnecessary because the program doesn't mix `cout` and `cin` operations, so we can remove it.

3. The `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` code block is used to redirect standard input and output to file when the code is not running on an online judge. This is not related to performance and can be removed unless you specifically need this functionality.

4. The `long long _d = (d + d) % 10;` line can be optimized by using `long long _d = (d << 1) % 10;`. The bitwise shift operator `<<` moves all bits in `d` one place to the left, effectively multiplying `d` by 2. This is usually faster than using the addition operator.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long base = 31;
const long long mod = 1e9 + 7;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    int v[10][10];
    long long n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    long long k = n / m;
    long long d = m % 10;
    long long cnt = 1;
    long long _d = (d << 1) % 10;
    v[1][d] = d;
    while (_d != d) {
      ++cnt;
      v[cnt][d] = _d;
      _d = (_d + d) % 10;
    }
    long long o = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= cnt; ++i)
      o += v[i][d];
    long long res = (k / cnt) * o;
    for (int i = 1; i <= k % cnt; ++i)
      res += v[i][d];
    cout << res << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
