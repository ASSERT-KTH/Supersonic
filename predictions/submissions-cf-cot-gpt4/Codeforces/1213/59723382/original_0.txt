The given C++ code is already quite optimized but there are few things which we can do to improve it slightly:

1. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` instead of `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0)`. This disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams which can make iostream faster than cstdio.

2. Combine the declaration and initialization of variables. This is more efficient because it avoids creating a variable and then assigning it a value in two separate operations.

3. We can remove the `mod` and `base` constants as they aren't used anywhere in the code.

4. Use prefix increment (`++i`) instead of postfix (`i++`) in the loop. In some cases, prefix can be more efficient than postfix because postfix requires a copy of the object to be made which is then incremented. Although modern compilers usually optimize this, it's still good practice to use prefix where you can.

5. It is better to use `'\n'` than `std::endl` to avoid flush operation.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int v[20][20];
int main() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
#define TASK "C"
  freopen(TASK ".inp", "r", stdin);
  freopen(TASK ".out", "w", stdout);
#endif
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    long long n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    long long k = n / m, d = m % 10, cnt = 1, _d = (d + d) % 10;
    v[1][d] = d;
    while (_d != d) {
      v[++cnt][d] = _d;
      _d = (_d + d) % 10;
    }
    long long o = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= cnt; ++i)
      o += v[i][d];
    long long res = (k / cnt) * o;
    for (int i = 1; i <= k % cnt; ++i)
      res += v[i][d];
    cout << res << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
