Here are the optimizations that can be applied to the program:

1. Use unordered_set instead of set: In C++, unordered_set is an associative container that contains a set of unique objects of type Key. It internally uses a hash table for all operations and has an average time complexity of O(1) for search, insert and delete operations. In comparison, a set in C++ is implemented as a binary search tree and performs all these operations in O(log n) time. So, using unordered_set can speed up your program.

2. Avoid frequent mod operations: Mod operations are costly in terms of computing time. It can be avoided inside the get_hash function by only applying it when the value exceeds the mod.

3. Use Fast I/O: In C++, cin and cout are slower than scanf and printf. You can speed up cin and cout by adding two lines at the beginning of the main function. This will make cin and cout faster, which can be important in problems where input/output is the bottleneck.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations: In the check function, the expression (j - t[i]) * f[t.size() - i - 1] is calculated for each 'a' to 'c' even when j is equal to t[i]. This calculation can be avoided by moving it inside the condition.

Here is the optimized version of the program with the above mentioned changes:
```cpp
#include <bits\stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int base = 257;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
const int N = 1e6;
unordered_set<ll> ust;
ll f[N];
void init() {
  f[0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++)
    f[i] = (f[i - 1] * base) % mod;
}
int get_hash(string s) {
  ll val = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
    val = val * base + s[i];
    if (val >= mod) val %= mod;
  }
  return val;
}
bool check(string t) {
  ll val = get_hash(t);
  for (int i = 0; i < t.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = 'a'; j <= 'c'; j++) {
      if (j != t[i]) {
        ll temp = ((j - t[i]) * f[t.size() - i - 1] + val);
        if (temp >= mod) temp %= mod;
        if (ust.find((temp + mod) % mod) != ust.end())
          return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  init();
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    ust.insert(get_hash(s));
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    string t;
    cin >> t;
    cout << (check(t) ? "YES" : "NO") << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
