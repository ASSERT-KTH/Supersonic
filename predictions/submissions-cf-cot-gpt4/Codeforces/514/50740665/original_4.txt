This program looks like a typical string hashing for some competitive programming problem, and it's already using some efficient techniques like the Rolling Hash. But we can still make some optimizations. The optimization would be more related to micro-optimizations and good practices rather than big algorithmic changes.

1. Include only necessary headers: The line `#include <bits\stdc++.h>` includes a lot of unnecessary headers which can increase the compilation time. We should only include the headers that we use. Based on the code, we need: iostream, string and set.

2. Use std::unordered_set instead of std::set: std::unordered_set has a constant time complexity for searching elements while std::set has a logarithmic time complexity. This can significantly speed up our program.

3. Avoid multiple modulo operations: Modulo operation is computationally expensive. We can avoid it in the check function.

4. Use reserve for string t: If we know that the string t can be large, it's a good practice to reserve space for it before starting to fill it with data.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int base = 257;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
const int N = 1e6;
unordered_set<ll> st;
ll f[N];

void init() {
  f[0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++)
    f[i] = f[i - 1] * base % mod;
}

ll get_hash(const string& s) {
  ll val = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
    val = (val * base + s[i]) % mod;
  }
  return val;
}

bool check(const string& t) {
  ll val = get_hash(t);
  for (int i = 0; i < t.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = 'a'; j <= 'c'; j++) {
      if (j != t[i]) {
        ll new_val = (((j - t[i]) * f[t.size() - i - 1] + val) % mod + mod);
        if (st.find(new_val) != st.end())
          return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  init();
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    st.insert(get_hash(s));
  }
  string t;
  t.reserve(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> t;
    cout << (check(t) ? "YES" : "NO") << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the code should run faster because of the usage of `unordered_set` and fewer modulo operations. Also, it should use less memory because we now use `reserve` for the string `t`, and we don't include unnecessary headers.
