The program you provided is already quite optimized. However, there are a few small changes that can be made to potentially improve performance.

1. Optimize IO operations: The `endl` command in C++ writes a newline character into the output buffer and then flushes the buffer. Flushing the output buffer is an expensive operation because it forces the program to wait until the operating system has written all the output to its destination. In this case, you don't need to flush the output buffer every time, you can simply replace `endl` with `'\n'`.

2. The `return 0;` statement at the end of the `main` function is not necessary. The C++ standard states that the `main` function will return 0 if control reaches the end of the function without encountering a return statement.

Here's the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n, a;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a;
    if (a == 1) {
      cout << "HARD" << '\n';
      return 0;
    }
  }
  cout << "EASY" << '\n';
}
```
Please note that these optimizations might not have a noticeable impact on performance, because your original code is already quite efficient. These are just some small tweaks to make the code slightly more efficient in terms of I/O operations and memory usage.
