The provided C++ program reads an integer from the standard input, then reads that many additional integers from the standard input. If any of these integers are 1, it prints "HARD" and terminates. If none are 1, it prints "EASY" and terminates.

The overall structure of this program is already quite optimized. It is structured to terminate as soon as it encounters a 1, so it doesn't do unnecessary work. The use of `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` also speeds up I/O operations by unsynchronizing C++'s I/O streams from C's.

However, there is one small optimization we could do:

1. We can remove `#include <string>`, because it's not utilized in the code. Including unnecessary headers increases compilation time and also increases the size of the executable file.

The optimized code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n, a;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a;
    if (a == 1) {
      cout << "HARD" << endl;
      return 0;
    }
  }
  cout << "EASY" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimization reduces the compilation time and the size of the executable file, but it doesn't affect the runtime of the program. The original program is already quite optimized for runtime.
