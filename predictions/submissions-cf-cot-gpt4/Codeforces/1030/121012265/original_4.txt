This code is already quite optimized, but there's a small improvement we can make. The code is using `std::endl` to end lines in its output. `std::endl` actually does two things: it outputs a newline, and it flushes the output stream. Flushing the stream can be expensive, and is unnecessary here because the program ends immediately after printing the output. We can replace `std::endl` with `'\n'` to avoid the unnecessary flush.

Here's the optimized code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n, a;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a;
    if (a == 1) {
      cout << "HARD" << '\n';
      return 0;
    }
  }
  cout << "EASY" << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

This optimization is minor and may not result in a noticeable performance improvement, but it's a good practice to avoid unnecessary operations.
