The given code initializes an adjacency list and a map that stores the indices of each color. Then, for each color, it counts the number of different colors that are adjacent to it. Finally, it prints out the color that has the maximum number of different adjacent colors. If there are multiple colors with the same count, it prints the smallest one.

Here are the steps to optimize this code:

1. Remove the C++ macro definitions. They are considered bad practice in modern C++ programming because they do not respect the scoping rules and can lead to bugs and undefined behavior.

2. Remove the unnecessary standard library includes and replace them with the necessary ones.

3. Use `std::vector<int>` instead of plain array `int a[n + 1]`. This reduces the chance of a segmentation fault and allows for more dynamic memory allocation.

4. Reduce the scope of variables whenever possible. For instance, the variables `u` and `v` can be declared within the while loop, reducing their scope and making the code cleaner.

5. Instead of using an unordered_map `mp` to check if a color has already been counted, use a `std::set`. A `std::set` automatically removes duplicates and has a faster lookup time, improving the speed of the algorithm.

6. There's no need to check if `a[neighbour] != a[member]` because we're using a set, which will automatically not insert duplicates.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <set>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  vector<int> a(n + 1);
  unordered_map<int, vector<int>> vk;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    vk[a[i]].push_back(i);
  }
  
  vector<vector<int>> ad(n + 1);
  for (int i=0; i<m; i++) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    ad[u].push_back(v);
    ad[v].push_back(u);
  }
  
  int mx = 0, mxColor = INT_MAX;
  for (auto color : vk) {
    set<int> s;
    for (auto member : color.second) {
      for (auto &neighbour : ad[member]) {
        s.insert(a[neighbour]);
      }
    }
    if (s.size() == mx && color.first < mxColor)
      mxColor = color.first;
    else if (s.size() > mx) {
      mx = s.size();
      mxColor = color.first;
    }
  }
  
  cout << mxColor;
  
  return 0;
}
```
