The original program is designed to solve a problem related to graph theory and colorings. It reads a graph from standard input, where each vertex has a color, and the goal is to find the color that touches the most unique other colors. If there is a tie, the color with the smallest ID wins.

The program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. `std::unordered_map` is a hash table based container that provides O(1) average complexity for search, insert, and delete operations. However, in the worst case (when all keys hash to the same bucket), the complexity becomes O(n). This can be improved by using `std::map` which is a Red-Black Tree based container providing O(log n) complexity for search, insert, and delete in worst case.
   
2. In the color loop, you're creating a new `unordered_map<int,bool>` for every color, which can be expensive. You can reduce memory usage by creating one `unordered_map<int,bool>` before the loop, and clear it within the loop.

3. The `isOdd`, `pow` and `clr` macros are not used, so they can be removed.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define pb push_back
#define sz(x) (int)(x.size())
#define endl "\n"
typedef long long ll;
typedef long double ld;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef vector<int> vi;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  int a[n + 1];
  map<int, vector<int>> vk;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    vk[a[i]].push_back(i);
  }
  vector<vector<int>> ad(n + 1);
  while (m--) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    ad[u].push_back(v);
    ad[v].push_back(u);
  }
  int mx = 0, mxColor = INT_MAX;
  unordered_map<int, bool> mp;
  for (auto color : vk) {
    mp.clear();
    for (auto member : color.second) {
      for (auto &neighbour : ad[member]) {
        if (a[neighbour] != a[member])
          mp[a[neighbour]] = 1;
      }
    }
    if (mp.size() == mx && color.first < mxColor)
      mxColor = color.first;
    else if (mp.size() > mx) {
      mx = mp.size();
      mxColor = color.first;
    }
  }
  cout << mxColor;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that optimization heavily depends on the specific problem and the input data. These optimizations were made based on the assumption that the input data can be large and the number of unique colors is big enough to make a difference.
