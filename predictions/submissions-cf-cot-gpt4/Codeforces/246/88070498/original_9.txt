This C++ program seems to be written for a competitive programming scenario. It does not have any major performance issues, but there are a few areas which can be optimized.

1. Avoid unnecessary use of macros: Macros like 'all', 'pb', 'sz', 'pow' and 'clr' are not used in the program. Removing these will save memory and reduce the complexity of the code.

2. Avoid using unordered_map for boolean values: In the inner loop, an unordered_map is used to store boolean values. Using an unordered_set would be more efficient in terms of memory usage and runtime, since we only care about the presence of a key and not its value.

3. Use reserve for vectors: If we know the size of the vector beforehand, reserving space can speed up the process of adding elements to the vector by avoiding reallocations.

4. Avoid using 'auto' when the type is known: While 'auto' is convenient, it can cause unnecessary CPU cycles to determine the correct type. When the type is known, it's better to use it directly.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef vector<int> vi;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  vi a(n + 1);
  unordered_map<int, vi> vk;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    vk[a[i]].push_back(i);
  }
  vector<vi> ad(n + 1);
  ad.reserve(n+1);
  while (m--) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    ad[u].push_back(v);
    ad[v].push_back(u);
  }
  int mx = 0, mxColor = INT_MAX;
  for (const auto& color : vk) {
    unordered_set<int> mp;
    for (int member : color.second) {
      for (int neighbour : ad[member]) {
        if (a[neighbour] != a[member])
          mp.insert(a[neighbour]);
      }
    }
    if (mp.size() == mx && color.first < mxColor)
      mxColor = color.first;
    else if (mp.size() > mx) {
      mx = mp.size();
      mxColor = color.first;
    }
  }
  cout << mxColor;
  return 0;
}
```
The changes won't drastically improve the performance, but they make the code cleaner and more efficient in terms of memory usage.
