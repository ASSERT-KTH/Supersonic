Firstly, the `bits/stdc++.h` header file is not standard and can include a lot of unnecessary files, leading to increased compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary libraries.

Secondly, `#define` macros can be replaced by inline functions or constexpr variables. This can improve code readability and performance as inline functions are evaluated at compile time. Especially, the `pow(n, m)` macro can be problematic as it hides the `std::pow` function and could lead to unexpected results.

Thirdly, the size of `a` array can be determined at runtime in C++ but it is not good for performance. It's better to use `std::vector` instead.

Fourthly, `unordered_map` isn't always the fastest container for small data sets. If the number of different colors is small, the overhead of hashing could outweigh the benefits of fast lookups. A `vector` or `map` could be faster.

Lastly, we can avoid creating temporary containers by using references in range-based for loops.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;

inline bool isOdd(int n) { return n & 1; }
inline ll powl(int n, int m) { return static_cast<ll>(pow(n, m)); }
constexpr char endl = "\n";

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  vector<int> a(n + 1);
  unordered_map<int, vector<int>> vk;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    vk[a[i]].push_back(i);
  }
  vector<vector<int>> ad(n + 1);
  while (m--) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    ad[u].push_back(v);
    ad[v].push_back(u);
  }
  int mx = 0, mxColor = INT_MAX;
  for (auto &color : vk) {
    unordered_map<int, bool> mp;
    for (auto member : color.second) {
      for (auto &neighbour : ad[member]) {
        if (a[neighbour] != a[member])
          mp[a[neighbour]] = 1;
      }
    }
    if (mp.size() == mx && color.first < mxColor)
      mxColor = color.first;
    else if (mp.size() > mx) {
      mx = mp.size();
      mxColor = color.first;
    }
  }
  cout << mxColor;
  return 0;
}
```
