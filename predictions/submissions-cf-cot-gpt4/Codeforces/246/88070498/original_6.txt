The program given is already fairly optimized, but there are still a few things we can tweak to potentially improve performance:

1. Reduce unnecessary computations: In the nested loop where the program checks each neighbour of a member, it always checks the condition `a[neighbour] != a[member]`. This condition is only true if the neighbour and the member have different colors. We can eliminate this condition by checking if the neighbour's color is in the map before adding it. This will reduce the number of times the condition is checked.

2. Use `reserve()` method: When we know the size of vector beforehand, we can use the `reserve()` method. It reserves the defined amount of memory for the vector in advance. This can improve performance because it reduces the number of memory reallocations when elements are added to the vector. In the given code, we know the size of the `ad` vector after reading `n` and `m`.

3. Directly initialize `mxColor` with `color.first`: Instead of initializing `mxColor` to `INT_MAX`, we can directly initialize it with the first color. This eliminates the need to check if `mp.size() == mx` in every iteration.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define pb push_back
#define sz(x) (int)(x.size())
#define endl "\n"
#define isOdd(n) (n & 1)
#define pow(n, m) (ll) powl(n, m)
#define clr(x, val) memset(x, val, sizeof(x))
typedef long long ll;
typedef long double ld;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef vector<int> vi;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  int a[n + 1];
  unordered_map<int, vector<int>> vk;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    vk[a[i]].push_back(i);
  }
  vector<vector<int>> ad(n + 1);
  ad.reserve(n + 1);
  while (m--) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    ad[u].push_back(v);
    ad[v].push_back(u);
  }
  int mx = 0, mxColor = vk.begin()->first;
  for (auto color : vk) {
    unordered_map<int, bool> mp;
    for (auto member : color.second) {
      for (auto &neighbour : ad[member]) {
        if (mp.find(a[neighbour]) == mp.end())
          mp[a[neighbour]] = 1;
      }
    }
    if (mp.size() > mx) {
      mx = mp.size();
      mxColor = color.first;
    }
  }
  cout << mxColor;
  return 0;
}
```
