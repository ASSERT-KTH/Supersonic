This C++ program finds a color in a graph such that it is connected to the maximum number of other colors. If there are multiple such colors, it picks the smallest one. The graph is represented using adjacency list. The color of each node is saved in an array, and a map is used to store the nodes of each color. Then, for each color, a new map is declared to store its neighbor colors. 

The program can be optimized by reducing the number of redundant operations and data structures:

1. For each color, a new unordered_map is declared to store its neighbor colors. This is quite memory-consuming as it creates a new map for each color, even if it is not needed. We can change the unordered_map to vector which is more memory efficient. We will then need to sort and remove duplicates from the vector, but even with these operations, this approach is more efficient because the number of colors that a color can connect to is often much smaller than the total number of colors.

2. The unordered_map `vk` is used to store the nodes of each color. However, we only need the color information, not the node itself. Therefore, we can replace `vk` with a simple counter array to count the frequency of each color. This is more memory efficient and faster as accessing an element in an array is faster than accessing a value in a map.

3. The `mxColor` is initialized with `INT_MAX` which is quite large. We can initialize it with `n + 1`, which is the maximum possible color.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define pb push_back
#define sz(x) (int)(x.size())
#define endl "\n"
#define isOdd(n) (n & 1)
#define pow(n, m) (ll) powl(n, m)
#define clr(x, val) memset(x, val, sizeof(x))
typedef long long ll;
typedef long double ld;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef vector<int> vi;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  int a[n + 1];
  vector<vector<int>> ad(n + 1);
  vector<int> freq(n + 1, 0);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    freq[a[i]]++;
  }
  while (m--) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    ad[u].push_back(v);
    ad[v].push_back(u);
  }
  int mx = 0, mxColor = n + 1;
  for (int color = 1; color <= n; color++) {
    if (freq[color] == 0) continue;
    vector<int> mp;
    for (int member = 1; member <= n; member++) {
      if (a[member] != color) continue;
      for (auto &neighbour : ad[member]) {
        if (a[neighbour] != color)
          mp.pb(a[neighbour]);
      }
    }
    sort(all(mp));
    mp.erase(unique(all(mp)), mp.end());
    if (mp.size() == mx && color < mxColor)
      mxColor = color;
    else if (mp.size() > mx) {
      mx = mp.size();
      mxColor = color;
    }
  }
  cout << mxColor;
  return 0;
}
```
In the optimized program, we first create an array to store the color of each node and count the frequency of each color. Then we create an adjacency list to store the graph. For each color, we create a vector to store its neighbor colors, sort it, and remove duplicates. Finally, we find the color that has the maximum number of neighbor colors, and if there are multiple such colors, we pick the smallest one.
