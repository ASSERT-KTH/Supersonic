The optimizations that can be done on this program are:

1. **Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`**: This header file includes almost all standard library header files which can slow down the compilation process. Including only the necessary header files will speed up the compilation time.

2. **Avoid using `using namespace std`**: This can cause name collisions, as it brings all names from the std namespace into the global namespace.

3. **Avoid using `memset`**: In modern C++, it is more efficient to use standard library functions or initialization techniques than `memset` which is a C-style function.

4. **Avoid using `long long` as `int`**: This can potentially cause confusion to other developers. It's better to define a new type if a different size of integer is needed.

5. **Avoid excessive use of global variables**: These are stored in the heap and can slow down the program and make it harder to debug and maintain. Local variables are stored on the stack, which is faster.

6. **Avoid using `magic numbers`**: These are hardcoded values that may appear multiple times in the code. It's better to define them as constants or use appropriate variable names.

7. **Avoid using `unordered_set` if ordered iteration is not needed**: `unordered_set` uses more memory than `set` and the time complexity of insertion and deletion is not always O(1).

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>

typedef long long ll;
const ll N = 3e5 + 7, K = 20, X = 42, M = 998244353;
ll cnk[X][X];
ll fact[N], defact[N];
ll dp[1 << K][X];
ll sz[1 << K];
std::vector<ll> op[N], cl[N];
std::pair<ll, ll> lr[N];
std::pair<ll, ll> bad[K];
bool has[N];
bool f[N], f2[N];
...

```

This optimized code should have faster compilation time, better readability and maintainability, and better performance. Note that the changes do not alter the logic of the program. The changes are primarily about coding style and efficient use of language features.
