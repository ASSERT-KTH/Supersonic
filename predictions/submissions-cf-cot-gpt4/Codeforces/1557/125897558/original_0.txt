The given code reads a list of integers and calculates a specific value for each list. The optimizations can be based on the following observations:

1. The variable `min` is used to store the maximum value of the array. Its name can be misleading.
2. The variable `min` is of type double but it can be of type int since it stores elements from the array which are integers.
3. The variable `sum` can also be of type int, as it stores the sum of integers. It can be converted to double only when the average is calculated.
4. In the loop, the sum is calculated and the maximum value is found. We can avoid storing the entire array by reading the number, adding it to the sum, and updating the maximum value in one step.
5. The array is not necessary because we don't use the entire array after reading it - only the sum and the maximum value are used.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int test;
  cin >> test;
  while (test--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int max_val = INT_MIN;
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int num;
      cin >> num;
      if(num > max_val)
        max_val = num;
      sum += num;
    }
    if (n > 1) {
      double ans = double(sum - max_val) / (n - 1) + max_val;
      cout << setprecision(8) << ans << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this code, the array is removed, reducing the memory usage. The variable `min` was renamed to `max_val` for clarity. The variable `sum` is of type int and only converted to double when necessary, reducing the need for implicit type conversions. This code performs the same calculations as the original, but with reduced memory usage and possibly slightly improved running time.
