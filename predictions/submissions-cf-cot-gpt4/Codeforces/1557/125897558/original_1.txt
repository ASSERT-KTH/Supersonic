The given program calculates the sum of an array, finds the maximum element, and then calculates a certain formula. The program is not optimal because it's using an array to store all the elements while it only needs to keep track of the sum and the maximum number. Therefore, the array is unnecessary and can be eliminated to save memory. 

The optimized program will take the input number by number, and instead of storing it in an array, it will directly add it to the `sum` and check if it is greater than `max`. This way, the memory usage of the array can be saved.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int test;
  cin >> test;
  
  while (test--) {
    int n, num;
    cin >> n;
    
    long long int sum = 0;
    double max = numeric_limits<double>::min();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> num;
      if (num > max)
        max = num;
      sum += num;
    }
    
    if (n > 1) {
      double ans = ((sum - max) / static_cast<double>(n - 1)) + max;
      cout.precision(8);
      cout << ans << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The header `<bits/stdc++.h>` is considered bad practice because it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, slowing down the compilation time. It's better to include only what is needed. In this case, `<iostream>` and `<limits>` are enough.

Also, `INT_MIN` is an integer number, but `min` is a double. It's better to use `numeric_limits<double>::min()` instead.

Finally, the name `min` is a bit misleading because it's actually used to store the maximum value. So, I renamed it to `max` for clarity.
