This is a C++ program that reads in a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads in an array of integers. It tries to find the first number that occurs only once in the array and prints its index (1-based). If no such number exists, it prints -1.

Here are some points to optimize this program:

1. Remove the unused function `isPrime(int n)`.
2. Instead of using `map<int, int> m`, use `unordered_map<int, int> m` because unordered_map is usually faster than map in accessing its elements.
3. You don't need to store the input in the array `a`, this reduces memory usage.
4. You can keep track of the index of each number in the map itself, and also keep track of the minimum index that has a count of 1. This way you don't need to loop through the array (or map) to find the first unique number.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  unordered_map<int, pair<int, int>> m;
  int minIndex = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;

    if (m[x].second++ == 0) {
      m[x].first = i;
    } else if (m[x].second == 2 && (minIndex == -1 || m[x].first < m[minIndex].first)) {
      minIndex = x;
    }
  }

  for (auto& it : m) {
    if (it.second.second == 1 && (minIndex == -1 || it.second.first < m[minIndex].first)) {
      minIndex = it.first;
    }
  }

  cout << (minIndex == -1 ? -1 : m[minIndex].first + 1) << endl;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
}
```

Note that in the unordered_map `m`, the key is the number from the input, and the value is a pair<int, int> where the first element is the first index of the number and the second element is the count of the number.
