The given C++ program reads an array of integers, counts the occurrence of each number, and outputs the position of the first number that occurs exactly once. If no such number exists, it outputs -1.

Here are some optimization steps, briefly explained:

1. Avoid the use of `bits/stdc++.h`: It includes a lot more files than necessary which increases the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries.

2. Removal of unused function `isPrime`: The function `isPrime` is defined but not used anywhere in the code. Remove this function to reduce the memory footprint of the program.

3. Avoid using `sqrt` in the loop condition: Calculating the square root is a relatively expensive operation. While this operation is not used in the program, it is still good to note that it should be avoided in loop conditions.

4. Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`: `unordered_map` has an average time complexity of O(1) for search, insert, and delete operations, while `map` has O(log(n)). Here, the order of elements does not matter, so `unordered_map` would be a better choice.

5. Avoid unnecessary input variable `x`: Instead of using a separate variable `x` to read the array elements, read directly into the array.

6. Use a flag to indicate whether a unique element was found: Instead of returning from the function as soon as a unique element is found, set a flag and break from the loop. This avoids the overhead of function call stack unwinding.

Here is the optimized program:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int a[n];
  unordered_map<int, int> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    m[a[i]]++;
  }
  bool found = false;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (m[a[i]] == 1) {
      cout << i + 1 << '\n';
      found = true;
      break;
    }
  }
  if (!found) {
    cout << -1 << '\n';
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` are used to untie C++ and C I/O streams which can potentially speed up I/O operations.
