The given C/C++ program can be further optimized in the following ways:

1. **Remove unused function:** The function `isPrime` is defined but never used in the program. Therefore, removing this function will save memory.

2. **Avoid square root calculation in the loop:** The `for` loop in `isPrime` function (if it were to be used) calculates `sqrt(n)` in each iteration. The square root of a number doesn't change, so it can be calculated once and stored in a variable outside of the loop to avoid unnecessary calculations.

3. **Use vector instead of an array:** The size of the array `a` is determined at runtime, which is not recommended in C++. It's better to use `vector<int> a(n);` instead of `int a[n];`. 

4. **Avoid unnecessary map traversal:** In the `solve` function, the program traverses the entire map `m` to find an element with a count of 1, and then traverses the array `a` to find the index of this element. This is quite inefficient and can be optimized. We can keep track of the indices of the elements while filling the map and then directly access the index of the required element. 

Let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  map<int, pair<int, int>> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    if(m.find(a[i]) == m.end())
        m[a[i]] = make_pair(1, i+1);
    else
        m[a[i]].first++;
  }
  for (auto& it : m) {
    if (it.second.first == 1) {
      cout << it.second.second << endl;
      return;
    }
  }
  cout << -1 << endl;
  return;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
}
```
In this optimized version, the map `m` stores pairs where the first element of the pair is the count of the number and the second element is the index of the number in the array `a`. This way, we avoid the second traversal through the array `a` to find the index of the number, thus optimizing the time complexity.
