The given program checks for duplicate elements within an array and outputs the position of the first non-duplicate element. If there's no non-duplicate element, it outputs -1.

There are several optimizations we can do in the given program.

1. We don't need to use the square root function sqrt() in the isPrime function because it's expensive in terms of time complexity. We can check up to the square root of n by simply comparing i * i to n.

2. The isPrime function is never used in the program, so we can remove it to save memory.

3. We can avoid the use of the array 'a' by directly searching the map for the first non-duplicate element. This will save both time and space complexity because we're avoiding a second iteration over the data.

4. We don't need to declare the iterator 'it' outside of the loop. We can declare it within the loop to limit its scope, which is a good practice.

5. We can use auto keyword instead of explicitly writing map<int, int>::iterator.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  map<int, pair<int, int>> m; // to store element, and its count and first occurrence
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    if(m[x].first == 0){ // if it's the first occurrence
      m[x] = make_pair(1, i);
    } else {
      m[x].first++; // increase the count
    }
  }
  int minIndex = n; // to store the minimum index of non-duplicate element
  for (auto& it : m) {
    if (it.second.first == 1) {
      minIndex = min(minIndex, it.second.second); // update the minimum index
    }
  }
  if(minIndex == n) // if no non-duplicate found
    cout << -1 << endl;
  else
    cout << minIndex + 1 << endl;
  return;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
}
```

This program is more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity than the original one.
