The provided C++ program determines the first number that occurs only once in the given list, and checks if it's prime.

Here are some optimizations that can be made:

1. Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header. It includes virtually all standard libraries, which increases compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries. In this program, we only need `<iostream>`, `<map>`, and `<cmath>`.

2. The `isPrime` function is never used in the code. It should be removed to save memory.

3. The map `m` is used to count the occurrences of each number. However, as soon as we find a number that occurs once, we output its position. We don't need to process the entire array before starting to look for numbers that occur only once. We can create the map and check for numbers that occur once in the same loop. As soon as we find such a number, we output its position and return.

4. In the `solve` function, we don't need to store the numbers in an array. We can process them as they are read. This saves memory.

5. The integer `x` can be declared inside the loop.

6. Instead of using an iterator to go through the map, we can use a range-based loop.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  map<int, int> m;
  int val;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> val;
    m[val]++;
    if (m[val] == 1) {
      cout << i + 1 << endl;
      return;
    }
  }
  cout << -1 << endl;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
}
```

Please note that in the provided code, it seems like we are looking for the first number that occurs only once in the sequence. The function `isPrime` is not used, so the code does not check for a number being prime. The optimized code follows the same logic as the provided code.
