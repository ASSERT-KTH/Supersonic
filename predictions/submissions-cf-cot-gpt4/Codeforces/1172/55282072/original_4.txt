The optimization for this code can be approached in a few steps:

1. **Reserve memory for vectors**: Every time you add an element to a vector without reserving memory beforehand, the vector has to reallocate memory. This can be expensive in terms of time. A simple optimization would be to reserve memory for the vectors using the `reserve()` function. This will be particularly helpful for the vector `new_probability` which is resized in every iteration of a big loop.

2. **Avoid unnecessary computation**: The computation of `like_probability` and `dislike_probability` inside the loop can be optimized. The calculation `mod_int(L + DL + i)` is repeated in each iteration and can be computed once before the loop and stored in a variable.

3. **Minimize use of map**: Map operations like `find()` and `operator[]` can be expensive in terms of time. To optimize this, use a `std::unordered_map` instead of `std::map` for `save` array. `std::unordered_map` has an average time complexity of O(1) for search, insert and delete operations compared to O(log n) for `std::map`.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int MOD = 998244353;
//... rest of the code remains the same ...
unordered_map<int, mod_int> save[2]; // Changed from map to unordered_map

//... rest of the code remains the same ...

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  prepare_factorials(4.1e5);
  cin >> N >> M;
  likes.resize(N);
  weights.resize(N);
  //... rest of the code remains the same ...

  probability.assign(2 * M + 1, 0);
  probability[M] = 1;
  for (int iter = 0; iter < M; iter++) {
    vector<mod_int> new_probability(2 * M + 1, 0);
    new_probability.reserve(2 * M + 1); // Reserve memory for the vector
    //... rest of the code remains the same ...

    for (int i = -M; i <= M; i++) {
      //... rest of the code remains the same ...

      mod_int commonDenominator = mod_int(L + DL + i);
      mod_int like_probability = mod_int(L + up) / commonDenominator;
      mod_int dislike_probability = mod_int(1) - like_probability;
      //... rest of the code remains the same ...
    }
    //... rest of the code remains the same ...
  }
  //... rest of the code remains the same ...
}
```

Please note that the actual performance gain can vary depending on the input and the specific compiler optimizations.
