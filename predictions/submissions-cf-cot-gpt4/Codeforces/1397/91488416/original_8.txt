The given code performs several computations that can be optimized for both time and memory usage.

1. First, avoid `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because it includes more headers than we need, which can increase the compilation time. Instead, include only the headers that are necessary for your program.

2. The variable `ll INF = 1e18;` is declared but not used anywhere in the program, so we can remove it to save memory.

3. In the `testcase()` function, we are using a vector `vec` to store the input. However, this is unnecessary because we are not using the stored values anywhere except for calculating the sum and in a loop where we are just comparing the values. Instead of storing the values in a vector, we can directly use them.

4. The `pow` function in `unsigned int counter = (int)pow(vec[n - 1], 1.0 / (n - 1)) + n;` is computationally expensive. Since we already removed the vector, we don't use this line anymore.

5. Replace `while (counter--)` with `for (unsigned int counter = 0; counter < n; ++counter)`. This is more readable and does not change the counter value inside the loop.

6. The `if (sum - n < count)` and `if (sum < count)` checks can be combined in a single line using the `min` function.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#define pb push_back
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const unsigned int MOD = 1000000007;
void testcase();
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  int t = 1;
  while (t--) {
    testcase();
  }
  return 0;
}
void testcase() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  ll sum = 0;
  ll max_temp = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ll temp;
    cin >> temp;
    sum += temp;
    max_temp = max(max_temp, temp);
  }
  ll c = 1;
  ll newcount = 0;
  ll count = 576460752303423487;
  for (unsigned int counter = 0; counter < n; ++counter) {
    newcount = 0;
    ll xx = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      newcount += abs(xx - max_temp);
      xx *= c;
      if (newcount > count)
        break;
    }
    if (newcount < count)
      count = newcount;
    newcount = 0;
    if (count == 0)
      break;
    c++;
  }
  count = min({count, sum, ll(n)});
  cout << count << endl;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations are based on the code snippet provided. In a larger program, other considerations might be necessary.
