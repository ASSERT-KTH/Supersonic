1. Including `<bits/stdc++.h>` is generally considered bad practice because it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increase the compilation time. Include only the necessary libraries.
2. The `while` loop in the `main` function is unnecessary because it runs only once. Directly call the `testcase` function.
3. The `vector` `vec` is used to store the input and then sort it. However, it seems that the order of the input is not important for the problem. Therefore, we can eliminate the `vector` and the `sort` function, which are costly in terms of time and space. Store the maximum element and the sum while taking the input.
4. The `counter` is calculated but then incremented again. This can be done in one line.
5. The variable `newcount` is set to `0` twice in every loop iteration. Removing the second initialization would save time.
6. Instead of checking whether `sum - n < count` and `sum < count` separately, we can use the `min` function to update `count` in one line.

Here's the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const ll INF = 1e18;
void testcase();
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  testcase();
  return 0;
}
void testcase() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  ll max_num = 0, sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ll temp;
    cin >> temp;
    sum += temp;
    max_num = max(max_num, temp);
  }
  ll c = 1;
  ll newcount = 0;
  ll count = INF;
  unsigned int counter = (unsigned int)pow(max_num, 1.0 / (n - 1)) + n + 1;
  while (counter--) {
    newcount = 0;
    ll xx = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      newcount += abs(xx - vec[i]);
      xx *= c;
      if (newcount > count)
        break;
    }
    if (newcount < count)
      count = newcount;
    if (count == 0)
      break;
    c++;
  }
  count = min({count, sum, (ll)n});
  cout << count << endl;
}
```
Please double check the logic of the program. The optimization is done under the assumption that the previous logic was correct.
