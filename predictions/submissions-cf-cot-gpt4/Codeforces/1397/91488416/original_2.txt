This program contains a few parts that can be optimized:

1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increases the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries.

2. The declaration of `count` can be modified to be `ll count = INF;` instead of using a hardcoded number.

3. The `counter` calculation is done using a mathematical operation which can be simplified and optimized.

4. The check `if (newcount > count)` can be removed from the loop and can be placed outside of the loop to reduce the number of comparisons.

5. The `if` conditions for updating `count` are not optimized. The minimum of `count`, `sum - n`, and `sum` can be calculated in a single line using `min` function.

6. The `newcount` is reset to zero at the end of the loop which is unnecessary as it is reset at the start of the loop.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const ll INF = 1e18;
void testcase();
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  int t = 1;
  while (t--) {
    testcase();
  }
  return 0;
}
void testcase() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> vec(n);
  ll sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> vec[i];
    sum += vec[i];
  }
  sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
  ll c = 1;
  ll newcount = 0;
  ll count = INF;
  unsigned int counter = (int)pow(vec[n - 1], 1.0 / (n - 1)) + n + 1;
  while (counter--) {
    newcount = 0;
    ll xx = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      newcount += abs(xx - vec[i]);
      xx *= c;
    }
    count = min(count, newcount);
    if (count == 0)
      break;
    c++;
  }
  count = min({count, sum - n, sum});
  cout << count << endl;
}
```

In this optimized version, only necessary libraries are included, reducing compilation time. The calculations are simplified and redundant operations are removed, making the program run faster. The memory usage is also reduced as the vector is now created with the correct size from the start.
