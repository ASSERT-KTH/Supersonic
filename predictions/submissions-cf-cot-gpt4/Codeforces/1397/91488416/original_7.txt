Let's make some optimizations on the given code:

1. Removing `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file is quite large and including it increases the compilation time. Instead, include only those libraries that you use in your program. In this case, we only need to include `iostream`, `vector`, `algorithm`, `cmath` and `cstdlib`.

2. Avoid global `using namespace std`: It's generally a good practice to avoid `using namespace std` in the global scope. This can help prevent name clashes with other libraries and user defined types/functions.

3. Avoid use of `#define pb push_back`: Instead of defining macros for such small tasks, it's better to use the function directly. It makes the code more readable and less prone to errors.

4. Reserve size for vector: Since the size of the vector is known in advance (`n`), we can reserve the memory for it. This can avoid unnecessary reallocations as the vector grows.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: In the while loop, you are recalculating `newcount` to zero even after the loop break, which is not necessary.

6. Avoid unnecessary variable: The variable `sum` is calculated but not used effectively. It's only used for comparison at the end of the function, but those conditions can never be true as `count` will always be less than or equal to `sum`.

Here is your optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdlib>

using ll = long long;
const unsigned int MOD = 1000000007;
const ll INF = 1e18;
void testcase();

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);
  int t = 1;
  while (t--) {
    testcase();
  }
  return 0;
}

void testcase() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<ll> vec;
  vec.reserve(n);
  ll count = 576460752303423487;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ll temp;
    std::cin >> temp;
    vec.push_back(temp);
  }
  std::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
  ll c = 1;
  unsigned int counter = (int)pow(vec[n - 1], 1.0 / (n - 1)) + n;
  counter++;
  while (counter--) {
    ll newcount = 0;
    ll xx = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      newcount += abs(xx - vec[i]);
      xx *= c;
      if (newcount > count)
        break;
    }
    if (newcount < count)
      count = newcount;
    if (count == 0)
      break;
    c++;
  }
  std::cout << count << std::endl;
}
```
