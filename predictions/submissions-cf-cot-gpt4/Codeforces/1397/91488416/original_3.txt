Here are some optimization steps to the program:

1. Avoid `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because this header file includes too many libraries which increase the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries.

2. Avoid `using namespace std;` because it might lead to naming conflicts. This isn't directly related to performance, but is a good coding practice.

3. The `while(t--)` loop is unnecessary as `t` is always 1. Remove the loop.

4. The `vector<ll> vec;` can be directly initialized with size `n` to avoid repeated memory allocation.

5. Remove `ll c = 1;` and `ll newcount = 0;` from outside the while loop, they are not needed there and re-initialized inside the loop anyway.

6. The `if (newcount < count)` check can be moved inside the for loop to break the loop immediately if `newcount` is already less than `count`.

7. The `if (count == 0)` check can be moved inside the for loop to break the loop immediately if `count` is already 0.

8. The `if (sum - n < count)` and `if (sum < count)` checks can be combined into one if statement using the `min` function to reduce redundant code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

#define pb push_back
typedef long long ll;
const unsigned int MOD = 1000000007;
const ll INF = 1e18;

void testcase();

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(nullptr);
    testcase();
    return 0;
}

void testcase() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<ll> vec(n);
    ll sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> vec[i];
        sum += vec[i];
    }
    std::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
    ll count = 576460752303423487;
    unsigned int counter = (int)std::pow(vec[n - 1], 1.0 / (n - 1)) + n;
    counter++;
    while (counter--) {
        ll newcount = 0;
        ll xx = 1;
        ll c = counter+1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            newcount += abs(xx - vec[i]);
            if (newcount > count || newcount < count || count == 0)
                break;
            xx *= c;
        }
        count = std::min({count, sum, sum - n, newcount});
    }
    std::cout << count << std::endl;
}
```

This program is optimized for running time and memory usage. The loop and condition checks are minimized and the use of std namespace is avoided. The vector is initialized with size `n` to avoid repeated memory allocation.
