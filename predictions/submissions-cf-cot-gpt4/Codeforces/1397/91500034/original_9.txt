Here are the steps to optimize the above program:

1. Avoid using power function inside the loop: The power function is computationally expensive and it is being used inside a nested loop which makes it even more costly. Since we are calculating the power of the same base 'c', we can simply keep multiplying the previous power by 'c' to get the next power.

2. Breaking the loop early: In the existing program, we are breaking the loop when the current sum is greater than or equal to the current answer. However, we can optimize this by breaking the loop as soon as the current sum is greater than the previous answer. This will reduce unnecessary iterations.

3. Avoid using std::sort: The sort function has a time complexity of O(n log n). We can avoid this by using the nth_element function which has an average time complexity of O(n) and provides the same functionality as needed in this program.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define gcd(a, b) __gcd(a, b)
#define lcm(a, b) a *b / (__gcd(a, b))
#define rep(i, s, e) for (int i = s; i < e; i++)
#define mem(a, n) memset(a, n, sizeof a)
#define IOS                                                                    \
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);                                                     \
  cin.tie(0);                                                                  \
  cout.tie(0);
using namespace std;
const int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const int maxn = 1e5 + 5;
ll n, c, sum, ans = 0, a[maxn];
int main() {
  IOS;
  cin >> n;
  rep(i, 0, n) cin >> a[i], ans += a[i];
  nth_element(a, a + n/2, a + n);
  ll prev_ans = ans;
  for (c = 1; c <= 1000000; c++) {
    sum = 0;
    ll power = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      sum += abs(power - a[i]);
      if (sum >= prev_ans)
        break;
      power *= c;
    }
    ans = min(ans, sum);
    prev_ans = ans;
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program should run faster and consume less memory than the original version.
