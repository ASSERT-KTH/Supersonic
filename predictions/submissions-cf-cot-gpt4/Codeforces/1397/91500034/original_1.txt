The primary optimization here is to minimize the computations within the loops. The current implementation calculates power and absolute value at each step of the inner loop. In this context, we can use a dynamic programming approach to calculate the power.

Another point to note is that the power function is computationally expensive. It's better to calculate the power manually.

The sort operation can be removed since the order of operations does not affect the final result.

Here is the optimized version of the code.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define gcd(a, b) __gcd(a, b)
#define lcm(a, b) a *b / (__gcd(a, b))
#define rep(i, s, e) for (int i = s; i < e; i++)
#define mem(a, n) memset(a, n, sizeof a)
#define IOS ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);
using namespace std;
const int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const int maxn = 1e5 + 5;
ll n, c, sum, ans = 0, a[maxn], pow[maxn];
int main() {
  IOS;
  cin >> n;
  rep(i, 0, n) cin >> a[i], ans += a[i];
  for (c = 1; c <= 1000000; c++) {
    sum = 0;
    pow[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      pow[i] = pow[i - 1] * c;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      sum += abs(pow[i] - a[i]);
      if (sum >= ans)
        break;
    }
    ans = min(ans, sum);
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This code calculates the power of `c` in advance and stores it in an array `pow[]`. This way, instead of calculating `pow(c, i)` at every iteration of the inner loop, we can directly access the pre-calculated value from the array `pow[]`, thus saving computation time.
