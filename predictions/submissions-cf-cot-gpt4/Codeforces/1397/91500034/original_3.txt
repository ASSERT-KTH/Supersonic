The given program appears to be attempting to find the minimum sum of the absolute differences between each element in an array and the corresponding power of a given base, iterating through different bases up to 1,000,000.

Here are the steps to optimize this program:

1. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The power function `pow(c, i)` is called for each element in the array for each value of `c`. It would be more efficient to calculate `c^i` iteratively, multiplying the previous result by `c` for each new `i`.

2. Reduce the scope of the search: The program currently tests all `c` from 1 to 1,000,000, which is very inefficient. A binary search can be used to find the optimal `c`.

Let's apply these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

#define ll long long
#define rep(i, s, e) for (int i = s; i < e; i++)
#define IOS ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 1e5 + 5;
ll n, ans = 0, a[maxn];

ll check(ll c) {
  ll sum = 0, p = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n && sum < ans; i++) {
    sum += abs(p - a[i]);
    p *= c;
  }
  return sum;
}

int main() {
  IOS;
  cin >> n;
  rep(i, 0, n) cin >> a[i], ans += a[i];
  sort(a, a + n);

  ll l = 1, r = 1e6, mid;
  while (r - l > 1) {
    mid = (l + r) / 2;
    if (check(mid) <= check(mid + 1))
      r = mid;
    else
      l = mid;
  }
  ans = min({check(l), check(r), ans});

  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program first sorts the array, then it performs a binary search for the optimal `c`. The function `check(c)` calculates the sum of the absolute differences for a given `c`, stopping early if the sum exceeds the current minimum. The binary search narrows down the possible values for `c`, greatly reducing the number of calculations necessary.
