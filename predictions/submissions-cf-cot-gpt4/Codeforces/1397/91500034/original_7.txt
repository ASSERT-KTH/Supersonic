Optimization steps:

1. Minimize the use of `std::pow` function: This function is computationally expensive and its use inside a loop makes it even worse. We can replace it with simple multiplication.

2. Pre-compute the array `b[i]` for `pow(c, i)`: We can calculate the values for `pow(c, i)` at the beginning of the each iteration of `c` and store these in an array `b[i]`. Then we can use these pre-computed values in the loop instead of calling `pow(c, i)` each time.

3. Early termination of the loop: If `sum` is greater than or equal to `ans`, we break the loop. However, we can also break the loop when `b[i]` becomes greater than `a[n-1]`. This is because if `b[i]` is greater than the maximum element in array `a`, then `sum` will be definitely greater than `ans`.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define rep(i, s, e) for (int i = s; i < e; i++)
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 1e5 + 5;
ll n, c, sum, ans = 0, a[maxn], b[maxn];

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  cin >> n;
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    cin >> a[i]; 
    ans += a[i];
  }
  sort(a, a + n);
  for (c = 1; c <= 1000000; c++) {
    sum = 0;
    b[0] = c;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      b[i] = b[i-1] * c;
      if (b[i] > a[n-1]) break;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n && b[i] <= a[n-1]; i++) {
      sum += abs(b[i] - a[i]);
      if (sum >= ans) break;
    }
    ans = min(ans, sum);
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the major bottleneck in this program is the outer loop which runs for `1e6` times. Any optimization inside this loop will significantly improve the overall performance. But the outer loop's iteration count is fixed and cannot be reduced without changing the program's functionality or output.
