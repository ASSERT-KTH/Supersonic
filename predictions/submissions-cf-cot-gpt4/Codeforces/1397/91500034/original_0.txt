This program calculates an "ans" variable by summing all elements in array "a" and running a loop from 1 to 1,000,000, then for each of these iterations it calculates a "sum" variable by summing the absolute difference between the result of raising "c" to the power of "i" and the "i"th element in array "a". If "sum" becomes greater or equal to "ans", it breaks the loop. Finally, it assigns the minimum value between "ans" and "sum" to "ans" and prints "ans".

Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid using pow(): The pow() function is comparatively slow as it needs to handle floating-point numbers and special cases. Since we're using pow(c, i) in an integer context, we could replace this with an integer multiplication.

2. Avoid unnecessary calculations: When sum becomes greater or equal to ans, we don't update ans and we break the loop. Then in the next iteration, we reset sum to 0 and do the calculations again. A better approach would be to have a flag variable which indicates if we've reached the condition sum >= ans, and if so skip the remaining iterations of the outer loop.

3. Use Fast I/O: Using scanf/printf instead of cin/cout for I/O can slightly speed up the program. 

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define gcd(a, b) __gcd(a, b)
#define lcm(a, b) a *b / (__gcd(a, b))
#define rep(i, s, e) for (int i = s; i < e; i++)
#define mem(a, n) memset(a, n, sizeof a)
using namespace std;
const int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const int maxn = 1e5 + 5;
ll n, c, sum, ans = 0, a[maxn];
int main() {
  scanf("%lld", &n);
  rep(i, 0, n) scanf("%lld", &a[i]), ans += a[i];
  sort(a, a + n);
  bool flag = false;
  for (c = 1; c <= 1000000; c++) {
    if (flag) break;
    sum = 0;
    ll power = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      sum += abs(power - a[i]);
      if (i < n - 1) power *= c; // avoid overflow
      if (sum >= ans) {
        flag = true;
        break;
      }
    }
    ans = min(ans, sum);
  }
  printf("%lld\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

Note that this optimization will not significantly improve the time complexity of the program, which remains O(n*log(n) + n*1e6) due to the sort operation and the two nested loops. Thus, for large inputs, the program could still take a considerable amount of time to run.
