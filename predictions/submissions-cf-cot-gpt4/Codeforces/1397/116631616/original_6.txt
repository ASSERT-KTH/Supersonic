The program provided is a quite large one with many utility functions. However, the main optimization that can be done is in the main() function where the program calculates the power 'i' raised to 'j' many times in a loop. This is quite inefficient and can be improved by storing the value of the previous computation and multiplying it in each iteration.

Here's the step by step optimization:

1. Instead of calculating power in each iteration, just multiply the previous power result by 'i'. This reduces the time complexity of the power calculation from O(n) to O(1).
2. Initialize 'pwr' as 1 and in each iteration of 'j' multiply it by 'i'. This 'pwr' variable will serve as the result of power calculation in each iteration.

Here's the optimized main function:

```cpp
signed main() {
  speedUP();
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }
  sort(all(arr));
  ll ans = 1e18;
  for (int i = 0; i < 1e5; i++) {
    ll sum = 0, pwr = 1, dont = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      if (pwr > 1e18 or sum > 1e18 or pwr < 0 or sum < 0) {
        dont = 1;
        break;
      }
      sum += abs(arr[j] - pwr);
      pwr *= i;
    }
    if (!dont) {
      ans = min(ans, sum);
    }
  }
  print(ans);
}
```

This optimization will not reduce memory usage, but it will significantly improve the running time of the program because the power calculations are now done in constant time.
