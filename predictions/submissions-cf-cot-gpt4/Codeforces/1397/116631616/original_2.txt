The given C++ program tries to find the minimum sum of the absolute difference between each element of the vector and the power of the current index with a base between 0 and 1e5. The main optimization can be done in the for loop inside the main function where it calculates the power for each base and each index of the array. The power function is a heavy function and calling it in each loop is very costly. We can optimize it by calculating the power in each step by multiplying the previous power with the base.

Here is the step-by-step optimization:

1. Instead of using the `pow(i, j)` function, calculate the power manually. Start with `p = 1` (as any number raised to the power of 0 is 1) and for each next index, multiply `p` with `i`.

2. Also, the `abs` function can be avoided as the array is sorted and all elements are positive, the result of `arr[j] - p` is always positive so no need to use `abs`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
#include <random>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
#define fi first
#define se second
#define ld long double
#define pi 3.14159265
#define all(arr) arr.begin(), arr.end()
#define pb push_back
#define ReadInputFile()                                                        \
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);                                            \
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#define speedUP()                                                              \
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);                                            \
  cin.tie(nullptr);
#define print2d(mat, n, m)                                                     \
  {                                                                            \
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {                                              \
      for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {                                            \
        cout << mat[i][j] << " ";                                              \
      }                                                                        \
      cout << endl;                                                            \
    }                                                                          \
  }
const long long int mod = 1e9 + 7;
void __print(int x) { cerr << x; }
void __print(long x) { cerr << x; }
// Other helper functions are omitted for brevity

signed main() {
  speedUP();
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }
  sort(all(arr));
  ll ans = 1e18;
  for (int i = 0; i < 1e5; i++) {
    ll sum = 0, dont = 0, p = 1;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      if ((p > 1e18 or sum > 1e18) or (p < 0 or sum < 0)) {
        dont = 1;
        break;
      }
      sum += arr[j] - p;
      p *= i;
    }
    if (!dont) {
      ans = min(ans, sum);
    }
  }
  print(ans);
}
```

This optimized version of the program should run faster than the original version because it does not use the `pow()` function, which is costly in terms of time complexity. Instead, it calculates the power manually in each iteration, which is faster.
