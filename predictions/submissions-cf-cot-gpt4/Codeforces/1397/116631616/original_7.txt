The program seems to be a competitive programming code with a lot of utility functions and debugging helper functions. The main logic is in the `main()` function.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unused utility functions: There are a lot of utility functions defined in the program which are not used anywhere in the code. The compiler might optimize them out, but to make the code cleaner, we can manually remove them.

2. Avoid using `pow` in a loop: `pow` is a computationally expensive function and it is called inside a nested loop, which makes the program slower. Instead, we can compute the power iteratively. 

3. Avoid unnecessary computation: In the current logic, there is unnecessary computation even when `sum` has exceeded `1e18`. We can break the loop as soon as `sum` exceeds `1e18`.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
#define all(arr) arr.begin(), arr.end()
#define speedUP()                                                              \
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);                                            \
  cin.tie(nullptr);

const long long int mod = 1e9 + 7;

template <typename T> void print(T &&t) { cout << t << '\n'; }

signed main() {
  speedUP();
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }
  sort(all(arr));
  ll ans = 1e18;
  for (int i = 0; i < 1e5; i++) {
    ll sum = 0, dont = 0;
    ll power = 1;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      if (power > 1e18) {
        dont = 1;
        break;
      }
      sum += abs(arr[j] - power);
      if (sum > 1e18) {
        sum = 1e18;
        break;
      }
      power *= i;
    }
    if (!dont) {
      ans = min(ans, sum);
    }
  }
  print(ans);
}
```
Please note that this optimization might not be significant in terms of time complexity, but the code is cleaner and more efficient because of avoiding the expensive `pow` function and unnecessary computation.
