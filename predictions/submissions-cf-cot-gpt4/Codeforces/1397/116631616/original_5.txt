The main performance issues in this code are as follows:
1. `std::pow(i, j)` is called multiple times, which is an expensive operation.
2. The `std::pow(i, j)` operation is not stopped when it exceeds `1e18`, which causes unnecessary calculations.
3. The `std::abs(arr[j] - std::pow(i, j))` operation is not stopped when it exceeds `1e18`, which causes unnecessary calculations.
4. Calling `std::pow(i, j)` and `std::abs(arr[j] - std::pow(i, j))` separately might lead to multiple evaluations of the same expression.
5. The `std::sort(all(arr))` operation is not needed for the current problem.

To optimize the code:

1. We will calculate `std::pow(i, j)` only once and store it in a variable.
2. We will break the loop as soon as `pow_val > 1e18` to avoid unnecessary calculations.
3. We will calculate `abs_diff` and break the loop if `abs_diff > 1e18`.
4. We will calculate `sum` only after checking the conditions to avoid unnecessary calculations.
5. We will remove the `std::sort(all(arr))` operation as it's not needed here.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
signed main() {
  speedUP();
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }
  ll ans = 1e18;
  for (int i = 0; i < 1e5; i++) {
    ll sum = 0, dont = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      ll pow_val = pow(i, j);
      if (pow_val > 1e18 || pow_val < 0) {
        dont = 1;
        break;
      }
      ll abs_diff = abs(arr[j] - pow_val);
      if (abs_diff > 1e18 || abs_diff < 0) {
        dont = 1;
        break;
      }
      sum += abs_diff;
      if (sum > 1e18 || sum < 0) {
        dont = 1;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (!dont) {
      ans = min(ans, sum);
    }
  }
  print(ans);
}
```
Please note that this program still has a time complexity of O(N^2) due to the two nested loops, and if N is very large, the program may still be slow. If further optimization is needed, a different algorithmic approach may be required.
