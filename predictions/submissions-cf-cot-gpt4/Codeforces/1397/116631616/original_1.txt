This program consists of numerous utility functions, but the main function is essentially sorting an array and then iterating through it to find the minimum difference between each element and a power of i.

Here are some steps we can take to optimize this code:

1. Remove unused code: The program contains several unused functions, such as `checkPrime`, `binpow`, `to_int`, `gcd`, `lcm`, `sumofDigits`, `isPalindrome`, `toBinary`, `toDecimal`, `modInverse`, `NcR`, `seive`, `isPowerof2`, `ceil`, `rotateArray`, `kadaneAlgo`. These functions can be removed as they are not used in the program. This will not affect the runtime significantly but will make the code cleaner and easier to manage.

2. Improve power calculation: The program calculates `pow(i, j)` twice in the inner loop of the main function. We can store the result of this calculation in a variable to avoid calculating it twice.

3. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program checks if `pow(i, j) > 1e18 or sum > 1e18` before adding to `sum`. But the `sum` variable starts at 0 and only increases, so we don't need to check `sum > 1e18` every time.

Here is the optimized version of the main function with the above steps implemented:

```cpp
signed main() {
  speedUP();
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }
  sort(all(arr));
  ll ans = 1e18;
  for (int i = 0; i < 1e5; i++) {
    ll sum = 0;
    bool overflow = false;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      ll power = pow(i, j);
      if (power > 1e18 || power < 0) {
        overflow = true;
        break;
      }
      sum += abs(arr[j] - power);
      if (sum > 1e18) {
        overflow = true;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (!overflow) {
      ans = min(ans, sum);
    }
  }
  print(ans);
}
```

Note: This optimization mostly focuses on readability, maintainability and some minor runtime improvements. The overall time complexity of the program remains the same.
