This program appears to be well-optimized, but there are a few areas where we can make minor improvements.

1. The macros defined at the top of the program, such as `all(v)`, `allr(s)`, `RT(s)`, `watch(x)`, `sz(s)`, are not used anywhere in the program. We can remove these to save memory.

2. The array `dy[]` and `dx[]` are defined but not used anywhere in the program. We can remove these to save memory.

3. The `file()` function is used to read from a file in a non-online judge environment. As this functionality may not be needed in all scenarios, we can add a compiler directive to include it only when needed.

4. The `typedef` statements that are not used can be removed.

5. The `fast()` function is only called once, so the `cin.tie(NULL)` statement can be moved into the main function.

6. The `#define EPS 1e-8` is not used anywhere in the program and can be removed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <unordered_map>
#define endl "\n"
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> ii;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<ii> vii;
const int N = 29;
ll k, grid[N][N];
map<ll, int> mp[N][N];
int n, m;
int main() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("in.txt", "r", stdin);
#endif
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cin >> n >> m >> k;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++)
      cin >> grid[i][j];
  ll ans = 0;
  int num = (n + m - 2 + 1) / 2;
  for (int i = 0; i < (1 << num); i++) {
    int row = 1, col = 1;
    ll x = grid[row][col];
    for (int j = 0; j < num; j++) {
      if (i & (1 << j))
        row++;
      else
        col++;
      x ^= grid[row][col];
    }
    mp[row][col][x]++;
  }
  num = n + m - 2 - num;
  for (int i = 0; i < (1 << num); i++) {
    int row = n, col = m;
    ll x = grid[row][col];
    for (int j = 0; j < num; j++) {
      if (i & (1 << j))
        row--;
      else
        col--;
      if (row < 1 || col < 1)
        break;
      x ^= grid[row][col];
    }
    if (row >= 1 && col >= 1) {
      x ^= grid[row][col];
      ans += mp[row][col][x ^ k];
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these changes are relatively minor and may not result in significant improvements in performance. The main logic of the program is already quite optimized.
