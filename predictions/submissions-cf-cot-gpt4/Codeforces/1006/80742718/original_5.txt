Optimization steps:

1. Remove Unnecessary Macros and Includes: The provided C++ program has multiple unnecessary macros and includes. For instance, `#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS` is not needed if you are not using security-enhanced alternatives to functions that can handle CRT library. Also, `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a GCC specific include and includes too many standard library headers at once, which might slow down the compilation process. Instead, you should include only the necessary headers.

2. Use `constexpr` for Constant Expressions: Instead of `#define` for constants like `N`, `PI` and `EPS`, you can use `constexpr`, which is type safe and it can be used in more contexts than `#define`.

3. Avoid Global Variables: It's generally a good practice to limit the scope of variables as much as possible. The global variables `k`, `grid`, `mp`, `n`, and `m` can be localized to the `main` function.

4. Short-circuiting Logical Operators: In the second loop where the `row` and `col` are checked if they are less than 1, it's better to use `&&` operator instead of `||`, which would stop evaluating as soon as it finds a value that is less than 1.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> ii;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<ii> vii;

constexpr int N = 29;

void fast() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(NULL);
}

int main() {
  fast();
  
  ll k;
  int n, m;
  ll grid[N][N];
  map<ll, int> mp[N][N];
  
  cin >> n >> m >> k;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++)
      cin >> grid[i][j];
      
  ll ans = 0;
  int num = (n + m - 2 + 1) / 2;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < (1 << num); i++) {
    int row = 1, col = 1;
    ll x = grid[row][col];
    for (int j = 0; j < num; j++) {
      if (i & (1 << j))
        row++;
      else
        col++;
      x ^= grid[row][col];
    }
    mp[row][col][x]++;
  }
  
  num = n + m - 2 - num;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < (1 << num); i++) {
    int row = n, col = m;
    ll x = grid[row][col];
    for (int j = 0; j < num; j++) {
      if (i & (1 << j))
        row--;
      else
        col--;
      if (row < 1 && col < 1)
        break;
      x ^= grid[row][col];
    }
    if (row >= 1 && col >= 1) {
      x ^= grid[row][col];
      ans += mp[row][col][x ^ k];
    }
  }
  
  cout << ans << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

Note: Depending on the problem requirements, there may be other ways to optimize the code further.
