The given program is a bit complex to understand, but the general idea is that it is solving a problem related to a 2D grid of numbers. It is reading input, performing some bitwise operations on grid elements, and storing the results in a 2D map. Then it performs similar operations from the other direction of the grid and counts the matchings with the previously stored results.

Optimizations that can be made here are:

1. **Avoid using `#define` for functions**: The `#define` preprocessor directive is used for constant definitions. It should not be used for functions, as it does not provide type safety. Instead, inline functions should be used.

2. **Avoid unnecessary headers**: Including unnecessary headers can lead to increased compilation time and memory usage. For example, `<bits/stdc++.h>` includes a wide range of headers, many of which may not be necessary. It's better to include only the required headers. 

3. **Avoid global variables**: The use of global variables can lead to bugs and is generally considered bad practice. The variables `k`, `grid`, `mp`, `n`, and `m` are declared globally but could be local to main.

4. **Avoid macros for constants**: Constants `N`, `PI`, and `EPS` are defined using macros. It's better to define them as `const` variables inside functions, which provides type safety.

5. **Optimize input/output**: The `fast` function is used to optimize input/output, but it's better to use `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(nullptr)`.

Let's apply these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> ii;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<ii> vii;
const int N = 29;
int dy[] = {1, -1, 0, 0, -1, 1, 1, -1};
int dx[] = {0, 0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1};

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  int n, m;
  ll k, grid[N][N];
  map<ll, int> mp[N][N];
  cin >> n >> m >> k;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++)
      cin >> grid[i][j];
  ll ans = 0;
  int num = (n + m - 2 + 1) / 2;
  for (int i = 0; i < (1 << num); i++) {
    int row = 1, col = 1;
    ll x = grid[row][col];
    for (int j = 0; j < num; j++) {
      if (i & (1 << j))
        row++;
      else
        col++;
      x ^= grid[row][col];
    }
    mp[row][col][x]++;
  }
  num = n + m - 2 - num;
  for (int i = 0; i < (1 << num); i++) {
    int row = n, col = m;
    ll x = grid[row][col];
    for (int j = 0; j < num; j++) {
      if (i & (1 << j))
        row--;
      else
        col--;
      if (row < 1 || col < 1)
        break;
      x ^= grid[row][col];
    }
    if (row >= 1 && col >= 1) {
      x ^= grid[row][col];
      ans += mp[row][col][x ^ k];
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This version of the program is more readable and easier to maintain. It also uses less memory, as it doesn't include unnecessary headers, and avoids the use of global variables.
