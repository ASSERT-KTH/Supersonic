In this code, the main optimization that can be done is changing the data structure that we are using to store the values. The 'set' data structure is used here, which keeps the elements in a sorted order and does not allow duplicates. This is helpful when we need to maintain the order of elements or need to perform operations like finding the smallest or the largest element quickly. But in this code, we are only using the 'set' to check how many unique elements are there, so order does not matter. 

By using an 'unordered_set' instead of 'set', we can reduce the time complexity from O(log N) to O(1) for each insertion. An 'unordered_set' does not keep the elements in any particular order and uses a hash table for insertion and lookup operations, which can be done in constant time on average.

Here's how the optimized code looks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll n, x;
    cin >> n;
    unordered_set<ll> a;
    while (n--) {
      cin >> x;
      a.insert(x);
    }
    cout << a.size() << endl;
  }
}
```

This change will significantly reduce the running time of the program when the size of the set (n) is large. The memory usage will also be less as an unordered_set uses a hash table internally, which is more memory-efficient than the self-balancing binary search tree used by a set.
