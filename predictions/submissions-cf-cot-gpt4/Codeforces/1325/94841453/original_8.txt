This program reads a number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a number of elements and inserts them into a `set`. Finally, it outputs the number of unique elements (since a `set` does not allow duplicates). 

The major optimization that can be made here is to avoid using a `set` to count unique elements and instead use a `unordered_set`. The `unordered_set` has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertions and lookups, while a `set` has a time complexity of O(log n). Thus, by using an `unordered_set`, we can potentially make the program faster.

Here is the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll n, x;
    cin >> n;
    unordered_set<ll> a;
    while (n--) {
      cin >> x;
      a.insert(x);
    }
    cout << a.size() << endl;
  }
}
```

In terms of memory optimization, there isn't much we can do without changing the logic of the program. The memory usage is already as low as it can be given the requirements of the task. The `unordered_set` uses a hash table internally, which is quite memory efficient. The only memory used is for the `unordered_set` and a few integer variables, which is minimal.
