This program reads a number of test cases 't'. For each test case, it reads a number 'n' representing the number of elements and then reads 'n' elements, storing them in a set 'a'. At the end, it prints the size of the set 'a'. Since set only stores unique elements, it implicitly removes duplicates. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the operations on the set, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the elements in the set.

Optimizations:

1. Avoid iostream synchronization: By default, the streams cin and cout are synchronized with the C standard streams scanf and printf. This synchronization ensures that you can mix calls to functions that use C standard streams and functions that use C++ streams. However, this synchronization has some performance cost. If you are sure that you will not mix calls to functions that use C standard streams and functions that use C++ streams, you can disable the synchronization and gain some performance.

2. Use fast I/O operations: std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(NULL) are used to speed up the cin and cout operations.

3. Use vector instead of set: Since the program is only interested in the count of unique numbers, we can use a vector instead of a set to store the numbers. After storing the numbers in the vector, sort the vector and count the unique numbers. This will be faster than inserting each element into a set, especially for large inputs.

Here is the optimized program:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll n, x;
    cin >> n;
    vector<ll> a(n);
    for(ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
    }
    sort(a.begin(), a.end());
    a.erase(unique(a.begin(), a.end()), a.end());
    cout << a.size() << "\n";
  }
}
```
