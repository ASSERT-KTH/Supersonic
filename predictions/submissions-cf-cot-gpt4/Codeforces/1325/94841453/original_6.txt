The provided program reads a number of test cases "t", then for each test case, it reads a series of numbers and inserts them into a set. Set in C++ STL has the property of storing unique elements and they are stored in sorted order. Hence, the program finally prints out the number of unique elements read in each test case.

Optimization Steps:
1. The first optimization that we can do is to replace the usage of `std::cin` and `std::cout` with faster I/O methods. C++ I/O operations are slower compared to C I/O operations. So, we can use `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout`.

2. The usage of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is not recommended, because it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which increases the compilation time. We can include specific headers that we need. In this case, we need iostream for input-output operations and set for using the set data structure.

3. `using namespace std;` is a bad practice. It can cause name conflicts, as it includes all the entities in the std namespace. We can use `std::` before standard library functions to specify the namespace explicitly.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <set>

int main() {
  long long t, n, x;
  scanf("%lld", &t);
  while (t--) {
    std::set<long long> a;
    scanf("%lld", &n);
    while (n--) {
      scanf("%lld", &x);
      a.insert(x);
    }
    printf("%lu\n", a.size());
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program will run faster due to faster I/O operations and compile faster due to the inclusion of only necessary headers. It will also avoid potential namespace conflicts. Note that the functionality of the program remains exactly the same.
