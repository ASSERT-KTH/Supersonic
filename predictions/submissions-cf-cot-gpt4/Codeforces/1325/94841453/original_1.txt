This is a C++ program that reads an integer 't' and then for 't' times, it reads another integer 'n' followed by 'n' integers. It stores the 'n' integers in a set and then prints the size of the set. This program is already quite efficient. 

Here are some optimizations we can do:

1. **Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);`:** These two lines of code will make the cin and cout operations faster which can be really useful when we have a lot of I/O operations.

2. **Use `reserve` before inserting into the set:** `reserve` function in C++ is used to reserve memory for a certain number of elements in the container. It reduces the number of memory allocations, and thus the program will run faster.

However, the `reserve` function is not available in the 'set' container in C++. It is only available in the vector container. Since we are using a set here to remove duplicates and then find the size, using `reserve` won't be applicable here.

3. **Avoid using `<bits/stdc++.h>`:** This header file includes quite a lot of files and it increases the compilation time. We should only include the files that we actually need.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>

#define ll long long

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll n, x;
    cin >> n;
    set<ll> a;
    while (n--) {
      cin >> x;
      a.insert(x);
    }
    cout << a.size() << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we have removed `<bits/stdc++.h>` and instead included only `<iostream>` and `<set>`. We have also added `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to make the I/O operations faster. We end the output line with `"\n"` instead of `endl` as it's faster because `endl` causes an unnecessary flush operation.
