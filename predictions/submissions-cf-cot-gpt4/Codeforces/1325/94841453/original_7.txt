The given C++ program is taking input of number of test cases, and for each test case, it is taking input of number of elements and then the elements themselves. It is storing those elements in a set (which stores unique elements only) and then printing the size of the set.

This program is quite optimized. However, we can slightly optimize it by reducing the number of times the insert operation is performed. Instead of inserting elements one by one, we can store them in a vector first and then initialize the set with the vector. This is because the time complexity of vector insertion is less than set insertion. This might save a fraction of time in case of large inputs.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Instead of inserting elements directly into the set, first take the input in a vector.
2. After all inputs for a test case are taken, initialize the set with the vector.
3. Print the size of set as earlier.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll n, x;
    cin >> n;
    vector<ll> a;
    while (n--) {
      cin >> x;
      a.push_back(x);
    }
    set<ll> s(a.begin(), a.end());
    cout << s.size() << endl;
  }
}
```
Please note that this optimization will not cause a significant difference in runtime or memory usage as the complexity of the overall program remains the same. It might save a tiny fraction of time in case of large inputs.
