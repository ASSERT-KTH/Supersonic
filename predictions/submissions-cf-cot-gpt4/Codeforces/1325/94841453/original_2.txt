The program reads a number `t` from the input, and then for each of the `t` test cases, it reads a number `n` and `n` integers. It adds these integers to a `std::set`, which automatically removes duplicates and sorts the elements. Finally, it prints the number of unique elements.

Given the problem description, we can optimize the program in the following ways:

1. **Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`:** This header file includes a lot of unnecessary stuff that slows down the compilation process. We only need `iostream` and `set` for this program.

2. **Avoid using `using namespace std;`:** Although it's not a performance issue, it's generally a good practice to avoid `using namespace std;`. It can lead to name clashes, which can be hard to debug.

3. **Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:** This can significantly increase the speed of `cin` and `cout`. 

4. **Use `unordered_set` instead of `set`:** `unordered_set` has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertions and lookups, compared to `set`'s O(log n). This could improve runtime performance, but `unordered_set` can use more memory because it needs to maintain a hash table.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  
  long long t;
  std::cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    long long n, x;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::unordered_set<long long> a;
    
    while (n--) {
      std::cin >> x;
      a.insert(x);
    }
    
    std::cout << a.size() << "\n";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Keep in mind that these optimizations may not drastically improve the runtime or memory usage for small inputs, but they can make a noticeable difference for larger inputs.
