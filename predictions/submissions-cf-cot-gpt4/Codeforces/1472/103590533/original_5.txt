This is a quite well-written program and is already optimized in many aspects such as using preprocessor directives for reducing typing, using STL for efficient data structures and algorithms, using fast IO operations, and optimizing loops. However, there are still a few areas where we can make small improvements:

1. **Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`:** This header file includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which increases the compilation time. Include only those libraries which are used in the program.

2. **Avoid using `using namespace std;` in global scope:** It can cause name collision problems if the program becomes larger or if it's used in a larger project. It's usually recommended to use `std::` prefix with each STL object or function, but since it's mentioned to make small changes in the program, we can move `using namespace std;` inside the `main` function.

3. **Avoid unnecessary macros:** Macros like `endl`, `all`, `watch`, `pairout` are not used in the code. Removing them will make the code cleaner and easier to read.

4. **Avoid excessive use of macros:** While macros like `REP`, `RREP`, `rep`, `rrep`, `PB` make the code shorter, they also make it less readable. In this case, these macros are not used excessively, but it's good to keep this point in mind.

5. **Avoid Frequent IO operations:** Frequent IO operations can slow down the program. In this case, the result array is printed inside the loop which can be avoided by storing the result in a string and printing the string after the loop.

Now, let's apply these changes to the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
#include <tuple>
#define fastio std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); std::cin.tie(0); std::cout.tie(0);
#define ll long long
#define tll std::tuple<ll, ll, ll>
#define ms(type) std::multiset<type>
#define MT std::make_tuple
#define T(i) std::get<i>
#define rep(i, a, b) for (ll i = a; i < b; i++)
#define fileio() { \
  #ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE \
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin); \
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout); \
  #endif \
}
const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;
#define type tll
void solve() {
  int t, n, x, y;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    std::cin >> n;
    ms(tll) a;
    rep(i, 0, n) {
      std::cin >> x >> y;
      a.insert(MT(std::max(x, y), std::min(x, y), i));
    }
    auto prev = (*a.begin());
    auto best = prev;
    int res[n];
    std::string result;
    for (const auto &person : a) {
      int h, w, i;
      std::tie(h, w, i) = person;
      if (T(0)(prev) == h) {
        if (T(1)(best) < w && T(0)(best) < h)
          res[i] = T(2)(best) + 1;
        else {
          res[i] = -1;
        }
      } else {
        if (T(1)(best) > T(1)(prev))
          best = prev;
        if (T(1)(best) < w && T(0)(best) < h)
          res[i] = T(2)(best) + 1;
        else
          res[i] = -1;
        prev = person;
      }
      result += std::to_string(res[i]) + " ";
    }
    std::cout << result << "\n";
  }
}
int main() {
  fastio;
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
