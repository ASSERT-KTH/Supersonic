This program's primary optimization lies in the use of data structures and the elimination of repeated code. 

1. Eliminate the use of a multiset. 
   We can replace the multiset with a vector and sort the vector after it has been filled. This will reduce the overhead of maintaining a sorted data structure after every insertion.
   
2. Eliminate unnecessary namespace usage.
   The `std` namespace is used in the entire program, which can lead to name clashes. It is a good practice to use it only when necessary.
   
3. Remove the repeated code. 
   We can eliminate the repeated code for calculating `res[i]`. The calculation is the same in both the `if` and `else` conditions inside the loop. We can calculate it once and use it in both conditions.

4. Avoid unnecessary calls to `std::tie`.
   We can directly access the elements of the tuple using `std::get<>()` without having to assign them to temporary variables.

5. Avoid unnecessary usage of macros. 
   Macros make debugging difficult and can cause unexpected results if not used carefully.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <tuple>

using ll = long long;
using tll = std::tuple<ll, ll, ll>;
using std::vector;
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

void solve() {
  int t, n, x, y;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n;
    vector<tll> a;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> x >> y;
      a.emplace_back(std::max(x, y), std::min(x, y), i);
    }
    std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());
    auto prev = (*a.begin());
    auto best = prev;
    vector<int> res(n);
    for (const auto &person : a) {
      if (std::get<0>(prev) == std::get<0>(person)) {
        if (std::get<1>(best) < std::get<1>(person) && std::get<0>(best) < std::get<0>(person))
          res[std::get<2>(person)] = std::get<2>(best) + 1;
        else {
          res[std::get<2>(person)] = -1;
        }
      } else {
        if (std::get<1>(best) > std::get<1>(prev))
          best = prev;
        if (std::get<1>(best) < std::get<1>(person) && std::get<0>(best) < std::get<0>(person))
          res[std::get<2>(person)] = std::get<2>(best) + 1;
        else
          res[std::get<2>(person)] = -1;
        prev = person;
      }
    }
    for (const auto &p : res)
      cout << p << " ";
    cout << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimization is made considering readability, maintainability, and best practices for using C++. Performance-wise, both the original and optimized code should have similar performance, as the complexity is mainly determined by the sorting and the iteration over the vector, which are present in both versions.
