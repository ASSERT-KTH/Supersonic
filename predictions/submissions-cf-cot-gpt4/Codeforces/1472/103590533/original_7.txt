Optimization Steps:

1. Use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This line of code is generally considered bad practice because it includes many unnecessary libraries, which increases the compilation time. Replacing it with necessary headers will be more efficient.

2. Unnecessary use of `#define`: This can lead to confusion and also adds extra preprocessing time. Using the actual functions and operators will make the code more readable and efficient.

3. Use of `cin.tie(0);` and `cout.tie(0);`: This unties cin and cout which can cause unnecessary flushing of the buffers.

4. Use of `freopen`: This is used for redirecting the input and output from stdin and stdout to files. This is not needed in an optimized code and can be removed.

5. Use of `multiset<type>`: Multiset in C++ is not space efficient as it stores multiple instances of a key. Instead, using unordered_map or map will provide a more memory efficient solution.

6. Use of `cin` and `cout`: These are slower as compared to `scanf` and `printf`. So replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <tuple>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pll;
typedef tuple<ll, ll, ll> tll;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<ll> vll;
typedef vector<pll> vpll;
typedef vector<tll> vtll;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int t, n, x, y;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    multiset<tll> a;
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
      a.insert(make_tuple(max(x, y), min(x, y), i));
    }
    auto prev = (*a.begin());
    auto best = prev;
    int res[n];
    for (const auto &person : a) {
      int h, w, i;
      tie(h, w, i) = person;
      if (get<0>(prev) == h) {
        if (get<1>(best) < w && get<0>(best) < h)
          res[i] = get<2>(best) + 1;
        else {
          res[i] = -1;
        }
      } else {
        if (get<1>(best) > get<1>(prev))
          best = prev;
        if (get<1>(best) < w && get<0>(best) < h)
          res[i] = get<2>(best) + 1;
        else
          res[i] = -1;
        prev = person;
      }
    }
    {
      for (auto &p : res)
        printf("%d ", p);
      printf("\n");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that optimization can vary based on requirements and the environment in which the code runs. The above changes are made to improve the performance and efficiency of the given code.
