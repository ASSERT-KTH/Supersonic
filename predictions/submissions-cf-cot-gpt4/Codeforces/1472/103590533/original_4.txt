This C++ program seems to be already highly optimized. The program uses many modern C++ features and optimizations, such as using STL, using lower level APIs for I/O and math operations, using pragma directives for compiler optimizations, and using macros for convenience. However, there is one potential place for optimization.

1. Reduce the number of unnecessary operations in a loop.

In the code, the loop that starts with "for (const auto &person : a)" has some redundant operations. In every iteration, "T(0)(best)" and "T(1)(best)" are computed multiple times. Instead, these values can be computed once and stored in a variable before the loop, and updated only when necessary inside the loop.

Here is the optimized version.

```cpp
void solve() {
  int t, n, x, y;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n;
    ms(tll) a;
    rep(i, 0, n) {
      cin >> x >> y;
      a.insert(MT(max(x, y), min(x, y), i));
    }
    auto prev = (*a.begin());
    auto best = prev;
    int res[n];
    ll best_0 = T(0)(best);
    ll best_1 = T(1)(best);
    for (const auto &person : a) {
      int h, w, i;
      tie(h, w, i) = person;
      if (T(0)(prev) == h) {
        if (best_1 < w && best_0 < h)
          res[i] = T(2)(best) + 1;
        else {
          res[i] = -1;
        }
      } else {
        if (best_1 > T(1)(prev)) {
          best = prev;
          best_0 = T(0)(best);
          best_1 = T(1)(best);
        }
        if (best_1 < w && best_0 < h)
          res[i] = T(2)(best) + 1;
        else
          res[i] = -1;
        prev = person;
      }
    }
    for (auto &p : res)
      cout << p << " ";
    cout << endl;
  }
}
```
This modification will not change the overall time complexity of the program, but it will slightly reduce the number of operations, which can lead to a slight improvement in runtime.
