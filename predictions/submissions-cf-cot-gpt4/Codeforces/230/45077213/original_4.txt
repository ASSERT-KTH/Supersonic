The program performs two main tasks:

1. It computes the prime numbers up to 1000000 and stores them in a boolean array and a vector.
2. It then reads a sequence of numbers from user input, checks whether each number is a perfect square of a prime number and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

The optimization will be done in two parts:

1. The function `Prem` that calculates the prime numbers can be optimized. In the given code, the function uses a vector to store the prime numbers and then uses the stored primes to mark their multiples as non-prime in the `flag` array. This can be done more efficiently by directly using the `flag` array. We iterate from 2 to sqrt(1000000) (approx 1000), and if `flag[i]` is true, we mark the multiples of `i` as false. This is based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for finding primes.

2. The `sqrt` function and the following check for perfect squares can be optimized. Instead of getting the square root and checking if it's an integer, we can directly find the integer square root and square it to check if it equals the original number. This avoids the floating point comparison.

Here is the optimized program:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

bool flag[1000010];

void Prem() {
  for (int i = 2; i*i <= 1000000; i++) {
    if (flag[i]) {
      for (int j = i*i; j <= 1000000; j += i) {
        flag[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);

  for(int i = 0; i <= 1000000; i++) {
    flag[i] = true;
  }
  flag[0] = flag[1] = false;

  Prem();

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  long long a;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a;
    long long temp = sqrt(a);
    if (temp * temp == a && flag[temp]) {
      cout << "YES\n";
    } else {
      cout << "NO\n";
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this version, the `Prem` function is much more efficient, and the code is simpler and easier to understand. Memory usage is also reduced because we no longer use the `vector` to store the prime numbers. The time complexity is also reduced from O(n^2) to O(n log log n) due to the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The `sqrt` function is also optimized.
