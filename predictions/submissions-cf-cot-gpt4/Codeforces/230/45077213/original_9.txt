Let's go through the program to identify areas of potential optimization:

1. The `Prem` function is a Sieve of Eratosthenes implementation to generate all prime numbers up to 1000000. However, it could be optimized, as we are looping through all numbers in the second loop even after marking multiples of a smaller prime number. This could be improved by skipping multiples of prime numbers that have already been accounted for.

2. The `memset` function is used to initialize all elements of the `flag` array. However, it is unnecessary to set all elements to `true` and then set `flag[1]` to `false` in the next line. We could directly initialize the first two elements of the `flag` array to `false`.

3. The `vector<long long> k` is used to store prime numbers. However, it isn't used anywhere else in the code. Hence, it could be removed to save memory.

4. In the `main` function, the `temp` and `b` variables are used to check if `a` is a perfect square. However, we could eliminate the `b` variable by directly assigning the square root of `a` to `temp`.

5. The individual `cout` statements for each input could be combined into a single `cout` statement to reduce I/O operations, which are usually slow.

Let's now implement these optimizations in the code.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool flag[1000010];

void Sieve() {
  int MAX = 1000000;
  flag[0] = flag[1] = false;
  for (int p = 2; p * p <= MAX; p++) {
    if (flag[p] == true) {
      for (int i = p * p; i <= MAX; i += p)
        flag[i] = false;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int n;
  long long a, temp;
  for (int i = 2; i <= 1000000; i++) flag[i] = true;
  Sieve();
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a;
    temp = (long long)sqrt((double)a);
    cout << ((temp * temp == a && flag[temp]) ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
