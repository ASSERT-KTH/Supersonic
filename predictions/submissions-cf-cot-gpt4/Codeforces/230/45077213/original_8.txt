The program generates all prime numbers up to 1,000,000 by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes method and stores them in a boolean array `flag`. Then, for each test case, it checks whether the square root of the given number is a prime number.

To optimize this program, you can do the following:

1. Remove the vector `k` since it is just storing prime numbers, which we already have in the `flag` array. You can use the `flag` array to achieve the same functionality.

2. In the `Prem` function, make the loop run until the square root of the maximum limit (1,000,000) since a larger factor of a number must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been encountered.

3. In the main function, rather than checking `temp != b`, which involves floating point comparison, check whether `temp * temp != a` which is more reliable.

4. Use `puts` instead of `cout` for faster output. 

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
bool flag[1000010];

void Prem() {
  memset(flag, true, sizeof(flag));
  flag[0] = flag[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= 1000000; i++) {
    if (flag[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= 1000000; j += i)
        flag[j] = false;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int n;
  long long a, temp;
  Prem();
  cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> a;
    temp = sqrt(a);
    if (temp * temp != a || !flag[temp])
      puts("NO");
    else
      puts("YES");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The above program produces the same output as the original but it is more efficient in terms of memory usage and running time.
