The program is calculating the primes numbers up to 1000000 and checks whether the square root of the numbers entered by the user are prime or not. The program can be optimized as:

1. The 'x' array is not used anywhere in the code. We can remove it.
2. The 'k' vector is not required as we are not using it outside the function 'Prem'. We can move it inside the function.
3. The 'flag' array size is 1000010, which is larger than required. We only need it to be sqrt(1000000) size because we only need to check numbers up to sqrt(a) to determine if 'a' is prime.
4. We can use 'long' instead of 'double' for 'b' to avoid type casting.
5. We can optimize the 'Prem' function by only checking odd numbers and starting from 3. All even numbers can not be prime except 2.
6. In the 'Prem' function, the check 'if (i % k[j] == 0)' is not required as we already set the flag of all multiples of 'i' to false.

Now let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

bool flag[1001]; // sqrt(1000000) is approximately 1000

void Prem();
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int n;
  long long a, b;
  memset(flag, true, sizeof(flag));
  flag[1] = false;
  Prem();
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a;
    b = sqrt(a);
    if (b * b != a || !flag[b])
      cout << "NO\n";
    else
      cout << "YES\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
void Prem() {
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= 1000000; i++) {
    if (flag[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= 1000; j += i)
        flag[j] = false;
    }
  }
}
```

This optimized code calculates the primes up to sqrt(1000000) and checks whether the square root of the input numbers are prime or not.
