Here is how we optimize the program:

1. Remove the unused array `x`. This saves memory as the array is not used anywhere in the program.

2. Instead of storing prime numbers in the `vector` `k`, directly mark them in the `flag` array. This saves memory as we do not need to store the prime numbers in a separate data structure.

3. Use integer comparison instead of floating-point comparison in the `main` function. This speeds up the program as floating-point operations are slower than integer operations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
bool flag[1000010];
void Prem();
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int n;
  long long a, temp;
  memset(flag, true, sizeof(flag));
  flag[1] = false;
  Prem();
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a;
    temp = sqrt(a);
    if (temp * temp != a)
      cout << "NO\n";
    else if (flag[temp] == false)
      cout << "NO\n";
    else
      cout << "YES\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
void Prem() {
  for (int i = 2; i <= 1000000; i++) {
    if (flag[i])
      for (int j = i; long long(j) * i <= 1000000; j++)
        flag[j * i] = false;
  }
}
```

In the `Prem` function, we iteratively mark the multiples of each found prime number as composite. This way, we ensure that `flag[i] == true` if and only if `i` is a prime number. In the `main` function, we check if `a` is a perfect square and if its root is a prime number. We use the condition `temp * temp != a` to check if `a` is a perfect square. This condition is equivalent to `temp != sqrt(a)`, but it avoids the use of slow floating-point operations.
