The provided code seems to be a program for determining if a number is a perfect square and if the square root of the number is a prime number. 

Here are few optimizations that we could make:

1. Remove unnecessary conversion to double: Currently, to find the square root of the input number, it is converted to a double using `(double)a`, which is then passed to `sqrt`. The `sqrt` function has an overload for long long types, so this conversion is unnecessary.

2. Avoid using `vector::size` inside for loop: The call to `k.size()` is made in each iteration of the loop in the `Prem` function. This could be avoided by calculating the size before the loop and using the result inside the loop.

3. Avoid unnecessary `clear` call for vector: The `k.clear()` function call is unnecessary because `k` is just defined and there is nothing to clear.

4. Remove unnecessary `ios::sync_with_stdio` and `cin.tie`: These lines are used to sync the C++ standard streams with the standard C streams and to untie `cin` from `cout`. This is not necessary in your program because you're not using any C-style input/output.

5. Inline `Prem` function: The `Prem` function is only called once in your program. Inlining this function could lead to a performance improvement because it avoids the overhead of a function call. 

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
long long x[1000010];
bool flag[1000010];

int main() {
  int n;
  long long a, temp;
  vector<long long> k;
  
  memset(flag, true, sizeof(flag));
  flag[1] = false;

  for (int i = 2; i <= 1000000; i++) {
    if (flag[i])
      k.push_back(i);
    int k_size = k.size();
    for (int j = 0; j < k_size; j++) {
      if (i * k[j] > 1000000)
        break;
      flag[i * k[j]] = false;
      if (i % k[j] == 0)
        break;
    }
  }

  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a;
    temp = sqrt(a);
    if (temp * temp != a)
      cout << "NO\n";
    else if (flag[temp] == false)
      cout << "NO\n";
    else
      cout << "YES\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations are relatively minor and might not lead to a significant improvement in performance. The performance of the program also highly depends on the compiler and the underlying hardware.
