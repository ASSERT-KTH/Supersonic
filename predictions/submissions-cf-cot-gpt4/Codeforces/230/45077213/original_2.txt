This C++ program checks if a given number is a perfect square of a prime number or not. The optimization is mainly about reducing unnecessary operations, improving the algorithm efficiency, and reducing memory usage.

Here are the steps for optimization:

1. The use of the `vector<long long> k` is unnecessary. It's only used to store the prime numbers but it doesn't contribute to the logic of the program. So, we can remove it.

2. The `Prem(vector<long long> &k)` function can be simplified by only looping through the square root of 1000000 (i.e., 1000) since any number greater than this won't contribute to the flag array.

3. After the `Prem()` function is called, we only need to check if the square root of the input number is prime or not. We can eliminate the `sqrt((double)a)` operation and the subsequent conditional check.

4. We are using `long long` data type which is 8 bytes, whereas for the given problem, we can use `int` which is 4 bytes and it will suffice the maximum limit. This will reduce the memory usage.

5. The `ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(0);` lines speed up the cin and cout operations, but they can be removed if you're not dealing with large inputs or if input-output speed isn't a significant factor.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
bool isPrime[1000010];
void sieve() {
  memset(isPrime, true, sizeof(isPrime));
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i*i <= 1000000; ++i) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i*i; j <= 1000000; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
}
int main() {
  sieve();
  int n;
  long long a;
  cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> a;
    int temp = sqrt(a);
    if (temp*temp == a && isPrime[temp]) {
      cout << "YES\n";
    } else {
      cout << "NO\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This program is more efficient and uses less memory than the original one. It also has a more readable and maintainable code structure.
