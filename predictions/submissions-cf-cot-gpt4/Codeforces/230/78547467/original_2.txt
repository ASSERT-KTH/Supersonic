The current program is implementing the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find the smallest prime factors of all numbers from 1 to 1000000 (inclusive). Then it reads an integer n and n more numbers. For each number, it checks if the number is a perfect square of a prime number or not. If it is, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

There are a few optimizations that can be performed in this code:

1. The first for loop in the SPF function, which initializes all spf[i] to i, can be removed. This is because the second for loop will eventually set spf[i] to i for all prime numbers.

2. The array ans[n] in the main function is not needed. We can directly print "YES" or "NO" without storing the results.

3. The 'bits/stdc++.h' header file includes more than 100 files and slows down the compile time. It's better to include only the necessary header files.

4. The 'spf' array can be made local to the 'SPF' function, thereby reducing the scope of the array.

5. The use of "\n" in cout is faster than endl because endl causes a flush operation, which can be a costly operation. So replace "endl" with "\n".

6. The use of macro '#define' can be replaced with const variables which are type-safe.

Here's the optimized code after the above mentioned changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

const long long mod = 1000000007;
const string yes = "YES\n";
const string no = "NO\n";

void SPF(int spf[]) {
  spf[0] = spf[1] = -1;
  for (int i = 2; i * i < 1000001; ++i) {
    if (spf[i] == 0) {
      spf[i] = i;
      for (int j = i; j * i < 1000001; ++j)
        spf[i * j] = i;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int spf[1000001] = {0};
  SPF(spf);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  long long int a, cnt = 1, minm;
  for (int t = 0; t < n; ++t) {
    cin >> a;
    long long int root = sqrt(a);
    if (a != 1 && root * root == a && spf[root] == root)
      cout << yes;
    else
      cout << no;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
