This program is used to print "YES" if the input number is a perfect square of a prime number, otherwise it prints "NO". 

Step 1: Optimize the SPF() function 
- The SPF() function is used to generate the smallest prime factor of a number. The outer loop runs from 2 to sqrt(n). The inner loop starts from i and runs while the increment j*i is less than n. This means the inner loop runs n/i times. Therefore, the SPF() function has a time complexity of O(n log(log n)). 

- The first optimization is to reduce the number of iterations in the loop. This can be done by starting the inner loop from i*i instead of i. This ensures that the smallest prime factor for all the multiples of i, less than i*i, would have already been marked.

Step 2: Optimize the main() function
- In the main function, the program reads the input numbers, checks if the numbers are perfect square of a prime number, and stores the result in the ans[] array. Then in another loop it prints the result. 

- The second optimization is to combine these two loops into one. Instead of storing the result in the array and then printing it, we can print the result as soon as we calculate it. This will save extra memory space used by the ans[] array.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define mod 1000000007
#define endl "\n"

int spf[1000001];

void SPF() {
  spf[0] = spf[1] = -1;
  for (int i = 2; i < 1000001; ++i)
    spf[i] = i;
  for (int i = 2; i * i < 1000001; ++i) {
    if (spf[i] == i) {
      for (int j = i * i; j < 1000001; j+=i)
        if (spf[j] == j)
          spf[j] = i;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  SPF();
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  ll a, cnt = 1, minm;
  for (int t = 0; t < n; ++t) {
    cin >> a;
    ll root = sqrt(a);
    if (a != 1 && root * root == a && spf[root] == root)
      cout << "YES" << endl;
    else
      cout << "NO" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;` is generally considered bad practice. It's better to include only the libraries that you are actually using in your code. So, you could replace it with `#include <iostream>` and `#include <math.h>`.
