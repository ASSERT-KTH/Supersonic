This program appears to be checking if the square root of each input number is a prime number. If it is, it outputs "YES", otherwise it outputs "NO". Here's how we can optimize it:

1. <bits/stdc++.h>: This header file includes many other header files, which can slow down compilation time. We should only include the necessary header files.

2. The SPF() function is calculating the smallest prime factor for all numbers up to 1000001. However, the maximum number we need to check is the square root of the largest possible input number. We should only calculate up to this value to reduce memory usage and execution time.

3. We pre-calculate the smallest prime factor for a range of numbers and store it in an array. However, we only use this data to check if the square root of an input number is prime. Instead of storing this information, we could directly calculate it when needed to save memory.

4. The array 'ans' stores the result for each test case. However, we could output the result directly to save memory.

5. We are using the 'long long' data type, which uses more memory than necessary. The 'int' data type would be sufficient for this program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
bool isPrime(int n) {
  if (n <= 1) return false;
  if (n <= 3) return true;
  if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0) return false;
  for (int i = 5; i * i <= n; i += 6)
    if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0)
      return false;
  return true;
}
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int t = 0; t < n; ++t) {
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    int root = sqrt(a);
    if (a != 1 && root * root == a && isPrime(root))
      cout << "YES" << endl;
    else
      cout << "NO" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This program uses less memory and should execute faster for large input numbers.
