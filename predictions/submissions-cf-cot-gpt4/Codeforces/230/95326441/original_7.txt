Step 1:
The first optimization that can be made is to avoid the initialization of the `isPrime` array. The `std::vector` in C++ is initialized with `false` by default. So, we can use a `std::vector<bool>` instead of an array. This will help to save some time during the initialization of the `isPrime` array.

Step 2:
The second optimization can be done in the `power` function. The result `result_power` can be very large and may overflow. To avoid this, we can take the modulo of `result_power` with `MOD` in each iteration. This will ensure that `result_power` never overflows.

Step 3:
The third optimization can be done in the `sieve` function. The inner loop starts with `i*i`. But we can start the loop with `2*i` because all the numbers before `i*i` are already marked by smaller primes.

Step 4:
The fourth optimization can be done in the main function. We are calculating `trex * trex` twice once for `crex` and once for comparison with `a`. We can calculate it once and store it in a variable and use that variable.

Now, let's implement these optimizations in the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define endl "\n"
#define MOD 1000000007
ll power(ll a_power, ll b_power) {
  ll result_power = 1;
  while (b_power > 0) {
    if (b_power & 1) {
      result_power = (result_power * a_power) % MOD;
    }
    a_power = (a_power * a_power) % MOD;
    b_power /= 2;
  }
  return result_power;
}
vector<bool> isPrime(1000001, true);
void sieve(ll maxPrime) {
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= maxPrime; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * 2; j <= maxPrime; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(0);
  ll n, a;
  cin >> n;
  ll trex;
  sieve(1000000);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a;
    trex = sqrt(a);
    ll crex = trex * trex;
    if (a == crex) {
      if (isPrime[trex]) {
        cout << "YES" << endl;
      } else {
        cout << "NO" << endl;
      }
    } else {
      cout << "NO" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the `power` function is not used anywhere in the given code. If it's not being used in the actual program, it's better to remove it to save memory.
