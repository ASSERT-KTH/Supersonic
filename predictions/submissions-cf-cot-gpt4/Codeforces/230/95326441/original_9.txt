This C++ program seems to be optimized quite well. However, there are a few minor improvements that could be made.

1. In the power function, the modulo operation is missing. As the power of a number can be very large, it is better to take the modulo to reduce the size of the number. This can be done by adding "result_power = result_power % MOD;" and "a_power = a_power % MOD;" after the multiplication operation. 

2. The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm can be slightly optimized by starting from i*i instead of 2*i in the inner loop and also checking only for odd numbers after handling 2, as even numbers are not prime. This is a minor improvement but could make a difference for larger inputs.

3. std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);, cin.tie(NULL); and cout.tie(0); are used to speed up cin and cout, but in this program, cin and cout are not used in large numbers, so removing these lines won't affect the performance but will make the code cleaner.

4. The calculation "trex * trex" is repeated twice. This can be avoided by storing the result in a variable.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define endl "\n"
#define MOD 1000000007
ll power(ll a_power, ll b_power) {
  ll result_power = 1;
  while (b_power > 0) {
    if (b_power & 1) {
      result_power *= a_power;
      result_power = result_power % MOD;
    }
    a_power *= a_power;
    a_power = a_power % MOD;
    b_power /= 2;
  }
  return result_power;
}
bool isPrime[1000001];
void sieve(ll maxPrime) {
  memset(isPrime, true, sizeof(isPrime));
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= maxPrime; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= maxPrime; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
}
int main() {
  ll n, a;
  cin >> n;
  ll trex;
  sieve(1000000);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a;
    trex = sqrt(a);
    ll crex = trex * trex;
    if (a == crex) {
      if (isPrime[trex]) {
        cout << "YES" << endl;
      } else {
        cout << "NO" << endl;
      }
    } else {
      cout << "NO" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the use of "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" and "using namespace std;" is considered bad practice because it includes and uses everything in the standard library, which can lead to slower compile times and naming conflicts. However, this is a small change and the original request was to not completely rewrite the program.
