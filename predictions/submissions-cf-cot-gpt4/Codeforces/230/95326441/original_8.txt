The given C++ program finds whether a given number is a perfect square of a prime number or not. The program is already efficient; however, there are few small optimizations that can be done.

Step 1: In the function 'sieve', we initialize 'isPrime' array with 'true'. But this initialization is unnecessary because every global or static array in C++ is automatically initialized with 0 or false.
Step 2: In the 'power' function, we do not need to use the modulo operator, as the code never actually uses this function.
Step 3: We also need to optimize the 'sieve' function by starting the loop from 2, because we know 0 and 1 are not prime.
Step 4: In the 'main' function, the variable 'crex' is declared but never used, so we can remove it.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define endl "\n"
#define MOD 1000000007

bool isPrime[1000001];

void sieve(ll maxPrime) {
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i <= maxPrime; i++) {
    isPrime[i] = true;
  }
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= maxPrime; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= maxPrime; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(0);
  ll n, a;
  cin >> n;
  ll trex;
  sieve(1000000);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a;
    trex = sqrt(a);
    if (a == trex * trex) {
      if (isPrime[trex]) {
        cout << "YES" << endl;
      } else {
        cout << "NO" << endl;
      }
    } else {
      cout << "NO" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Remember, while these optimizations may slightly improve the efficiency of this program, they likely won't lead to dramatic improvements in running time or memory usage.
