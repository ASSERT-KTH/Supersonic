The program is a C++ code that does the following:
1. It calculates the power of a number using a function `power`.
2. It checks if a number is prime using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm implemented in the function `sieve`.
3. In the main function, it reads an integer `n`, then reads `n` integers and for each integer `a`, it checks if the square root of `a` is a perfect square and is also a prime number. If it is, it outputs "YES", otherwise it outputs "NO".

Now, the optimizations that can be done are:

1. The `power` function isn't used in the program. So, we can remove it to reduce the memory footprint.
2. The `sieve` function is running till `maxPrime`, but we can stop it at the square root of `maxPrime` because a larger factor of `n` must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.
3. While checking if a number `a` is a perfect square and is also prime, we are calculating the square of `trex` twice (once for `crex`, which is never used, and once in the if condition). We can calculate it once, store it in a variable and use it in both places, reducing the number of multiplications.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define endl "\n"
#define MOD 1000000007

bool isPrime[1000001];

void sieve(ll maxPrime) {
  for (int i = 0; i <= maxPrime; i++) {
    isPrime[i] = true;
  }
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= maxPrime; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= maxPrime; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(0);
  ll n, a;
  cin >> n;
  ll trex;
  sieve(1000000);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a;
    trex = sqrt(a);
    ll square_trex = trex * trex;
    if (a == square_trex) {
      if (isPrime[trex]) {
        cout << "YES" << endl;
      } else {
        cout << "NO" << endl;
      }
    } else {
      cout << "NO" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
