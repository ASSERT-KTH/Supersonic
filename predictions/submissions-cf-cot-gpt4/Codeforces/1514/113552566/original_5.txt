The given C++ program is already quite optimized in terms of time and space complexity. It implements a Segment Tree, which is a highly efficient data structure for dealing with range queries. The range queries are performed in O(log N) time, which is very optimal.

However, there are some small areas for improvement:

1. Unnecessary `#define` statements: The `FASTIO` and `PRECISION` macros are not necessary and can be removed. Instead, we can directly use the code present in these macros in the main function. This will make the code cleaner.

2. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: While `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a convenient way to include all standard libraries, it also includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increases the compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary libraries.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std`: This can cause name clashes if our program has variables with the same name as the standard library functions or variables.

Let's apply these changes in the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

typedef long long ll;
typedef long double ld;

struct SegTree {
  std::vector<int> tree, arr;
  std::vector<std::vector<int>> store;
  int n;
  SegTree(int n, std::vector<int> _arr) : n(n) {
    tree.resize(4 * n);
    store.resize(n + 1);
    arr = _arr;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      store[arr[i]].push_back(i);
    build(0, n - 1, 0);
  }
  // rest of the code remains unchanged
};

void solve() {
  // rest of the code remains unchanged
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(20);

  int t = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= t; i++) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The changes are minor, but they make the code cleaner and more professional. The time and space complexity remains the same.
