The given C++ program is already quite optimized. However, there are a few things we can still do to make it a bit more efficient.

1. Avoid Using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of libraries which may not be used in the program. This can slow down the compilation time. Therefore, it's better to include only necessary libraries. This won't affect the runtime but will make your program compile faster.
   
2. Avoid Using `using namespace std;`: This can lead to naming conflicts if your program has variables with the same name as standard library functions. It doesn't affect the performance, but it's a good practice.

3. Avoid Global Macro Definitions: The macros `FASTIO` and `PRECISION` are globally defined and may lead to conflicts. Also, `PRECISION` is not used anywhere in the code.

4. Reserve Memory for Vectors: If you know the size of your vectors ahead of time, you can reserve memory for them. This can speed up your program by reducing the number of memory reallocations.

5. Use `'\n'` Instead of `std::endl`: `std::endl` is slower because it causes a flush of the output buffer, which is not necessary here.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

typedef long long ll;
typedef long double ld;

#define FASTIO ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);cin.tie(NULL);cout.tie(NULL);

struct SegTree {
    std::vector<int> tree, arr;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> store;
    int n;
    SegTree(int n, std::vector<int> _arr) : n(n) {
        tree.resize(4 * n);
        store.resize(n + 1);
        arr = _arr;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            store[arr[i]].push_back(i);
        build(0, n - 1, 0);
    }
    // Rest of the code...
};

void solve() {
    int n, q;
    std::cin >> n >> q;
    std::vector<int> arr(n);
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> store(n + 1);
    arr.reserve(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        std::cin >> arr[i], store[arr[i]].push_back(i);
    SegTree tree(n, arr);
    while (q--) {
        int l, r;
        std::cin >> l >> r;
        l--;
        r--;
        int x = tree.query(l, r);
        int mx = upper_bound(store[x].begin(), store[x].end(), r) -
                 lower_bound(store[x].begin(), store[x].end(), l);
        int len = (r - l + 1);
        int extra = len - mx;
        int left = std::max(0, mx - extra - 1);
        std::cout << 1 + left << '\n';
    }
}

int main() {
    FASTIO;
    int t = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= t; i++) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```
