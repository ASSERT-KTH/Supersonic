The code you have provided is already quite optimized due to the use of `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")` directive, which instructs the GCC compiler to perform level 3 optimization.

However, there are a few small modifications we can make:

1) `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes a large number of standard C++ libraries. Including this file can slow down the compilation process because it loads many unnecessary libraries. It's better to include only the specific libraries that are needed.

2) `#define fastio ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0)`: This macro is used to speed up I/O operations, but it's used only once in this code. We can replace the macro with its content at the usage location.

3) `d.max_load_factor(0.1);`: This line sets the maximum load factor of the unordered_map `d` to 0.1. The load factor is a measure of how full the hash table is. A lower value implies more memory usage but less collisions. However, for most cases, the default load factor is sufficient and efficient.

4) `forn(i, n)`: This macro can be replaced with a standard for loop for better readability.

The optimized code after these modifications is:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <random>
#include <chrono>
using namespace std;

using pii = pair<int, int>;
using vi = vector<int>;
using ll = long long;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);                                                
  cin.tie(0);

  mt19937_64 rnd(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i];

  int m = n - n / 2;
  ll res = 0;

  for(int _ = 0; _ < 13; _++) {
    ll x = a[rnd() % n], s, va, vb;
    unordered_map<ll, int> d;

    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      va = x, vb = a[i];
      while (vb != 0)
        s = va, va = vb, vb = s % vb;
      d[va]++;
    }

    for (auto &i : d) {
      int c = 0;
      for (auto &j : d)
        if (j.first % i.first == 0)
          c += j.second;
      if (c >= m && i.first > res)
        res = i.first;
    }
  }

  cout << res << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the above optimizations are minor and they are not likely to significantly improve the performance of your code. The main computation time of your program is likely spent in the nested loops and the modulo and division operations. Those parts of the code might be more difficult to optimize without changing the logic of the program.
