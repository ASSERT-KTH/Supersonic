The given C/C++ code can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Optimize I/O Operations: The `fastio` macro is used to speed up the I/O operations. However, it only works with `cin` and `cout`. If you use other I/O functions, it can lead to a mix of buffered and unbuffered I/O, which can cause issues. If you only use `cin` and `cout`, it's fine, but if you use other I/O functions, it's safer to remove this macro.

2. Use `reserve()` for Vector: The `vector<ll> a(n);` declaration will allocate memory for the vector. Instead of this, we can declare an empty vector and use the `reserve()` function to preallocate memory. This can reduce the number of memory reallocations when elements are added to the vector. 

3. Optimizing the use of Unordered Map: The unordered map `d` is declared inside a loop, and its `max_load_factor` is set to 0.1. This setting is rather low and can lead to frequent rehashing of the map, which is time-consuming. You can increase this number to reduce the frequency of rehashing.

4. Reduce the use of Modulo Operator: The modulo operation `j.fst % i.fst` is computationally expensive. However, since this operation is required, it cannot be removed. We can, however, reduce the number of times it is computed by storing its result in a variable, if it is used multiple times in the same loop. In the given code, it's used only once, so this optimization is not applicable here.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#pragma GCC optimize("O3")
#ifdef LOCAL
#define D(a) cerr << #a << " = " << a << endl
#else
#define D(a)
#define cerr false && cerr
#endif
#define dforsn(i, s, n) for (int i = int(n - 1); i >= int(s); i--)
#define forsn(i, s, n) for (int i = int(s); i < int(n); i++)
#define forn(i, n) forsn(i, 0, n)
#define all(a) a.begin(), a.end()
#define si(a) int((a).size())
#define pb emplace_back
#define mp make_pair
#define snd second
#define fst first
using pii = pair<int, int>;
using vi = vector<int>;
using ll = long long;
int main() {
  mt19937_64 rnd(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> a;
  a.reserve(n);
  forn(i, n) {
    ll temp;
    cin >> temp;
    a.push_back(temp);
  }
  int m = n - n / 2;
  ll res = 0;
  forn(_, 13) {
    ll x = a[rnd() % n], s, va, vb;
    unordered_map<ll, int> d;
    d.max_load_factor(1);
    forn(i, n) {
      va = x, vb = a[i];
      while (vb != 0)
        s = va, va = vb, vb = s % vb;
      d[va]++;
    }
    for (auto &i : d) {
      int c = 0;
      for (auto &j : d)
        if (j.fst % i.fst == 0)
          c += j.snd;
      if (c >= m && i.fst > res)
        res = i.fst;
    }
  }
  cout << res << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the efficiency of code optimization can depend on the compiler and the specific hardware you're using.
