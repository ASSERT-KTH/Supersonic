Sure, let's go over the program to look for possible optimization steps:

1. The `unordered_map` is declared within the loop, which means it will be created and destroyed during each iteration. This could be improved by declaring it outside the loop and then clearing it at the start of each iteration. This would save the overhead of creating and destroying the `unordered_map`.

2. There are nested loops where the outer loop iterates over the `unordered_map` and the inner loop also iterates over the `unordered_map`. This could result in a time complexity of O(n^2). However, in the inner loop, we are just summing up the values (`j.snd`) for which `j.fst` is divisible by `i.fst`. This can be optimized by maintaining a prefix sum. We can create a `vector<pair<ll, int>>` from the `unordered_map` and sort it. Then, we can iterate over the sorted vector in decreasing order and maintain a running sum.

Let's implement these changes:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define fastio ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0)
#define forn(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < int(n); i++)
#define fst first
#define snd second
using ll = long long;
using pii = pair<int, int>;

int main() {
  fastio;
  mt19937_64 rnd(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> a(n);
  forn(i, n) cin >> a[i];
  int m = n - n / 2;
  ll res = 0;
  unordered_map<ll, int> d;
  vector<pair<ll, int>> prefixSum;

  forn(_, 13) {
    ll x = a[rnd() % n], s, va, vb;
    d.clear();
    d.max_load_factor(0.1);
    forn(i, n) {
      va = x, vb = a[i];
      while (vb != 0)
        s = va, va = vb, vb = s % vb;
      d[va]++;
    }

    prefixSum.clear();
    for (auto &i : d) {
      prefixSum.push_back(i);
    }
    sort(prefixSum.rbegin(), prefixSum.rend());

    int runningSum = 0;
    for (auto &i : prefixSum) {
      runningSum += i.snd;
      if (runningSum >= m && i.fst > res)
        res = i.fst;
    }
  }

  cout << res << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
The optimizations applied here should help reduce the running time and memory usage of the code. However, the exact performance gain depends on the specific input and environment.
