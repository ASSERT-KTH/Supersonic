The given program seems to be already well-optimized. The program uses the GCD algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of randomly selected pairs of numbers from an input array, and then it tries to maximize this GCD value. The algorithm complexity is already quite good due to the use of an unordered_map and a vector.

However, there are a few small optimizations that we might consider:

1. Avoid creating unnecessary temporary variables: In the GCD calculation, the `s` variable is used to swap `va` and `vb`. We could use the standard `std::swap` function to make this swap operation clearer and potentially more efficient.

2. Reuse the result of the modulo operation: In the loop that iterates over the keys of the unordered_map, the program calculates `j.fst % i.fst` twice. We can calculate it once and save the result in a variable.

3. Reserve memory for the vector: If the size `n` is known in advance, we can reserve the memory for the vector `a` to avoid reallocations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#pragma GCC optimize("O3")
#define fastio                                                                 \
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);                                                \
  cin.tie(0)
#define forn(i, n) for(int i = 0; i < int(n); i++)
using ll = long long;

int main() {
  fastio;
  mt19937_64 rnd(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> a;
  a.reserve(n); // reserve memory for the vector
  forn(i, n) {
    ll num;
    cin >> num;
    a.push_back(num);
  }
  int m = n - n / 2;
  ll res = 0;
  forn(_, 13) {
    ll x = a[rnd() % n], va, vb;
    unordered_map<ll, int> d;
    d.max_load_factor(0.1);
    forn(i, n) {
      va = x, vb = a[i];
      while (vb != 0)
        swap(va, vb), vb = vb % va;
      d[va]++;
    }
    for (auto &i : d) {
      int c = 0;
      for (auto &j : d) {
        int modResult = j.first % i.first; // save the result of the modulo operation
        if (modResult == 0)
          c += j.second;
      }
      if (c >= m && i.first > res)
        res = i.first;
    }
  }
  cout << res << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations may not have a significant impact on the performance of the program, since the original program is already quite efficient. The performance of the program will largely depend on the input size and data distribution.
