The existing C++ program is already well optimized. However, there are few minor improvements we can make to more efficient.

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This is a GCC specific library, which includes almost all standard libraries in C++. However, it's not a good practice to use it as it includes more than what you need which results in increased compilation time. Instead, you should include only the libraries that you need for your program.

2. `#define int long long`: This line of code is used to define the int as long long for the entire scope. However, it's not a good practice to redefine built-in types. Instead, you can use typedef or using to create an alias for long long.

3. The `IOS;` macro is used to speed up cin and cout. However, this is not a good practice. You should place these three lines of code directly in the main function to make your code more readable. 

4. You are using `s[i] - '0'` multiple times in your functions. You can optimize this by storing the result in a variable and using this variable instead.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const ll Mod = 10000007;

void forward(string &s, int x, int n, vector<int> &count) {
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int s_i = s[i] - '0';
    if (count[x] < n / 3 && s_i > x && count[s_i] > n / 3) {
      count[x]++;
      count[s_i]--;
      s[i] = x + '0';
    }
  }
}

void backward(string &s, int x, int n, vector<int> &count) {
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int s_i = s[i] - '0';
    if (count[x] < n / 3 && s_i < x && count[s_i] > n / 3) {
      count[x]++;
      count[s_i]--;
      s[i] = x + '0';
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  ll n;
  vector<int> count(3, 0);
  string s;
  cin >> n;
  cin >> s;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    count[s[i] - '0']++;
  }
  forward(s, 0, n, count);
  forward(s, 1, n, count);
  backward(s, 2, n, count);
  backward(s, 1, n, count);
  cout << s;
  return 0;
}
```
This code does the same thing as the previous one but in a more efficient and readable way.
