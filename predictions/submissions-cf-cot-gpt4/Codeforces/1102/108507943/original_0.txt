Let's go through the program and identify the points where we can optimize it:

1. The first thing I noticed is that the functions 'forward' and 'backward' are virtually identical, except for the direction in which they iterate through the string 's'. You could combine these two functions into one, and add an extra boolean parameter that determines the direction of iteration. This will reduce the code duplication.

2. The 'x' parameter of functions 'forward' and 'backward' is cast to 'char' in each call of the function. You can optimize this by casting 'x' to 'char' once at the beginning of the function and storing the result in a local variable.

3. The 'count' vector is accessed multiple times in the 'forward' and 'backward' functions. You can reduce the number of accesses by storing the results of 'count[x]' and 'count[s[i] - '0']' in local variables at the beginning of the loop.

4. The '#define int long long' statement at the beginning of the program can be replaced with a typedef. This is not a performance optimization, but a code readability improvement.

5. The '#define IOS' statement is not needed, as it only sets the synchronization of the standard streams, which is not necessary in this program.

After taking these points into consideration, the optimized program will be:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const ll Mod = 10000007;

void traverse(string &s, int x, const ll &n, vector<ll> &count, bool forward = true) {
    char x_char = x + '0';
    ll i = forward ? 0 : n - 1;
    ll end = forward ? n : -1;
    ll step = forward ? 1 : -1;
    ll count_x = count[x];
    while (i != end) {
        char s_i = s[i];
        ll count_s_i = count[s_i - '0'];
        if (count_x < n / 3 && ((forward && s_i > x_char) || (!forward && s_i < x_char)) && count_s_i > n / 3) {
            count_x++;
            count[s_i - '0'] = --count_s_i;
            s[i] = x_char;
        }
        i += step;
    }
}

int main() {
    ll n;
    vector<ll> count(3, 0);
    string s;
    cin >> n;
    cin >> s;
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        count[s[i] - '0']++;
    }
    traverse(s, 0, n, count);
    traverse(s, 1, n, count);
    traverse(s, 2, n, count, false);
    traverse(s, 1, n, count, false);
    cout << s;
}
```
This optimized program performs the same task as the original, but it is more efficient, and arguably easier to read and maintain.
