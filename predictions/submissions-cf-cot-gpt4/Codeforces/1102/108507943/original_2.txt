The given C++ program can be optimized by changing the approach for counting the occurrences of digits 0, 1, and 2.

In the original program, the 'count' vector gets updated in each iteration of the 'forward' and 'backward' functions, which makes the program inefficient. Instead of updating the 'count' vector in every iteration, you can calculate the count of each digit in the string only once and store it in the 'count' vector. This will reduce the number of iterations, thereby optimizing the program for running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void balance(string &s, int x, int n, vector<int> &count, int dir) {
  for (int i = (dir > 0 ? 0 : n - 1); i >= 0 && i < n; i += dir) {
    if (count[x] < n / 3 && abs(s[i] - '0' - x) == 1 && count[s[i] - '0'] > n / 3) {
      count[s[i] - '0']--;
      count[x]++;
      s[i] = x + '0';
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int n;
  vector<int> count(3, 0);
  string s;
  cin >> n;
  cin >> s;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    count[s[i] - '0']++;
  }
  balance(s, 0, n, count, 1);
  balance(s, 1, n, count, 1);
  balance(s, 2, n, count, -1);
  balance(s, 1, n, count, -1);
  cout << s;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The 'forward' and 'backward' functions are combined into a single 'balance' function. This function takes an additional parameter 'dir', which determines the direction of iteration.
2. The 'balance' function iterates over the string in either direction (forward or backward) based on the 'dir' parameter.
3. The condition inside the 'if' statement is updated. Now, this condition checks if the absolute difference between the current character and 'x' is 1. This ensures that only adjacent digits are swapped.
4. The main function is updated to call the 'balance' function with the correct direction parameter.
5. The 'ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0)' statements are moved inside the main function as they are not macros and should be inside a function.
6. The 'int long long' and 'Mod' definitions are removed as they are not used in the program.
7. The 'int32_t main()' is replaced with 'int main()'. The 'return 0' statement is added to indicate successful termination of the program.
