The given C/C++ program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Removing `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This is not a standard library and including it in the code will increase the compilation time as it includes all the standard C++ libraries, which are not used in this program.

2. Removing `#define IOS ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0)` and `#define Mod 10000007`: These macros are not used in the program, so we can remove them to clean up the code.

3. Avoiding string character to integer conversion multiple times: In the forward and backward functions, the same conversion `s[i] - '0'` takes place multiple times. It would be more efficient to store the result in a variable and use that.

4. Avoiding repeated calculation of `n / 3`: This operation is repeated many times and the result can be stored in a variable to avoid repeated calculation.

5. Using pre-increment instead of post-increment: Pre-increment (`++var`) is generally faster than post-increment (`var++`), as post-increment involves a copy operation.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

void forward(string &s, int x, int n, int n_div_3, vector<int> &count) {
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int si = s[i] - '0';
    if (count[x] < n_div_3 && si > x && count[si] > n_div_3) {
      ++count[x];
      --count[si];
      s[i] = x + '0';
    }
  }
}

void backward(string &s, int x, int n, int n_div_3, vector<int> &count) {
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
    int si = s[i] - '0';
    if (count[x] < n_div_3 && si < x && count[si] > n_div_3) {
      ++count[x];
      --count[si];
      s[i] = x + '0';
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  vector<int> count(3, 0);
  string s;
  cin >> n;
  cin >> s;
  int n_div_3 = n / 3;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    ++count[s[i] - '0'];
  }
  forward(s, 0, n, n_div_3, count);
  forward(s, 1, n, n_div_3, count);
  backward(s, 2, n, n_div_3, count);
  backward(s, 1, n, n_div_3, count);
  cout << s;
  return 0;
}
```
