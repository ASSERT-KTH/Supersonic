This program is pretty well written and there is not much room for significant optimization. However, some small changes could be done to make it slightly more efficient. 

1. Remove the use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because it includes most of the standard libraries which can slow down the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries i.e., `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`, `#include <string>`. 

2. The `IOS` macro is used to speed up input/output operations for large amounts of data. But if you are not dealing with huge amount of data, this might be unnecessary.

3. Instead of using `cin >> n; cin >> s;` in two separate lines, they can be combined into one line as `cin >> n >> s;` to reduce the number of input operations.

4. The conversion from char to int `s[i] - '0'` is repeated multiple times. This can be replaced by a variable to reduce the number of operations.

The optimized code is shown below:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

#define int long long
#define Mod 10000007

void forward(string &s, int x, int n, vector<int> &count) {
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int num = s[i] - '0';
    if (count[x] < n / 3 && num > x && count[num] > n / 3) {
      count[x]++;
      count[num]--;
      s[i] = x + '0';
    }
  }
}

void backward(string &s, int x, int n, vector<int> &count) {
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int num = s[i] - '0';
    if (count[x] < n / 3 && num < x && count[num] > n / 3) {
      count[x]++;
      count[num]--;
      s[i] = x + '0';
    }
  }
}

int32_t main() {
  int n;
  vector<int> count(3, 0);
  string s;
  cin >> n >> s;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    count[s[i] - '0']++;
  }
  forward(s, 0, n, count);
  forward(s, 1, n, count);
  backward(s, 2, n, count);
  backward(s, 1, n, count);
  cout << s;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations will not drastically improve the performance, but they will make the code cleaner and slightly more efficient.
