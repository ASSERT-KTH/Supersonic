Here are the steps for optimization:

1. The first optimization would be to replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the specific header files needed for this program. Including `bits/stdc++.h` is a bad practice because it includes all the standard library headers, even those which are not used in this program, slowing down the compilation process.

2. Secondly, `#define int long long` is also not a good practice as it redefines a built-in type and can lead to confusion. Instead, use `typedef long long int ll;`

3. In the functions 'forward' and 'backward', the condition `count[s[i] - '0'] > n / 3` is checked in each iteration of the loop. This condition can be moved out of the loop to avoid unnecessary iterations.

4. The `IOS;` macro can be expanded directly in the `main` function. It's not a complex operation and does not necessarily need to be a macro.

5. The `Mod` constant is not used in this program and can be removed.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

typedef long long int ll;

void forward(string &s, int x, int n, vector<int> &count) {
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int digit = s[i] - '0';
    if (count[digit] > n / 3 && digit > x) {
      count[x]++;
      count[digit]--;
      s[i] = x + '0';
    }
  }
}

void backward(string &s, int x, int n, vector<int> &count) {
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int digit = s[i] - '0';
    if (count[digit] > n / 3 && digit < x) {
      count[x]++;
      count[digit]--;
      s[i] = x + '0';
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);                                                                     
  cout.tie(0);

  ll n;
  vector<int> count(3, 0);
  string s;
  cin >> n;
  cin >> s;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    count[s[i] - '0']++;
  }
  forward(s, 0, n, count);
  forward(s, 1, n, count);
  backward(s, 2, n, count);
  backward(s, 1, n, count);
  cout << s;
  return 0;
}
```
