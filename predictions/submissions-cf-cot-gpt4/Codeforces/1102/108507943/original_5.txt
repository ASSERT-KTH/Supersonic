The main optimization that we can do here is by reducing the unnecessary calculations. 

In the forward and backward functions, we are checking `if (count[x] < n / 3 && count[s[i] - '0'] > n / 3)` in each loop iteration. This is unnecessary as `n / 3` is not changing inside the loop. We can simply calculate it once and use that value inside the loop.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define IOS ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0)
#define int long long

void forward(string &s, int x, int n, vector<int> &count) {
  int n_div_3 = n / 3;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int s_i = s[i] - '0'; // store the value of s[i] - '0' to avoid multiple calculation
    if (count[x] < n_div_3 && s_i > x && count[s_i] > n_div_3) {
      count[x]++;
      count[s_i]--;
      s[i] = x + '0';
    }
  }
}

void backward(string &s, int x, int n, vector<int> &count) {
  int n_div_3 = n / 3;
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int s_i = s[i] - '0'; // store the value of s[i] - '0' to avoid multiple calculation
    if (count[x] < n_div_3 && s_i < x && count[s_i] > n_div_3) {
      count[x]++;
      count[s_i]--;
      s[i] = x + '0';
    }
  }
}

int32_t main() {
  IOS;
  int n;
  vector<int> count(3, 0);
  string s;
  cin >> n;
  cin >> s;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    count[s[i] - '0']++;
  }
  forward(s, 0, n, count);
  forward(s, 1, n, count);
  backward(s, 2, n, count);
  backward(s, 1, n, count);
  cout << s;
}
```

This optimization will reduce the number of division operations from `6n` to `6` and the number of subtraction operations from `6n` to `2n`, which will improve the running time of the program.
