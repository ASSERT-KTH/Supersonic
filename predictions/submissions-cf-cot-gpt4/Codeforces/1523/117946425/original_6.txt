This program is already quite optimized in terms of algorithmic complexity. However, there are a few small changes that could potentially improve performance:

1. Avoiding unnecessary calculations: In the innermost loop, `(1 << j)` and `(1 << one.size()) - 1` are calculated repeatedly. These could be calculated once and stored in variables to avoid repeated calculations.

2. Reducing the number of vector allocations: Currently, a new `vector<int> one` is created and populated for every iteration of the i-loop. Instead, the vector could be declared once before the loop and cleared at the end of each iteration, which would avoid the overhead of allocating and deallocating memory for the vector at each iteration.

3. Using bitwise operators instead of arithmetic operators: In some cases, it might be faster to use bitwise shifts instead of multiplication or division by powers of two.

Below is the optimized version of the program:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// ... (rest of the code unchanged, except for the following part)

int main() {
#ifndef WA_DEBUG
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
#endif

  int n, m, p;
  cin >> n >> m >> p;
  vector<ll> a(n + 1);
  rep(i, 1, n) {
    rep(j, 0, m - 1) {
      char c;
      cin >> c;
      if (c == '1')
        a[i] += (1ll << j);
    }
  }
  vector<int> id(n + 1);
  iota(id.begin(), id.end(), 0);
  shuffle(id.begin() + 1, id.end(), rng);
  long long ans = 0;
  int num = 0;
  vector<int> one;
  one.reserve(m);
  rep(i, 1, min(200, n)) {
    one.clear();
    rep(j, 0, m - 1) {
      if ((a[id[i]] >> j) & 1)
        one.pb(j);
    }
    vector<int> dp(1 << one.size());
    rep(j, 1, n) {
      int tmp = 0;
      rep(k, 0, one.size() - 1) {
        if ((a[j] >> one[k]) & 1)
          tmp += (1 << k);
      }
      dp[tmp]++;
    }
    int size = one.size();
    int maxShift = 1 << size;
    rep(j, 0, size - 1) {
      int shift = 1 << j;
      rep(k, 0, maxShift - 1) {
        if (k & shift)
          dp[k ^ shift] += dp[k];
      }
    }
    rep(k, 0, maxShift - 1) {
      if (dp[k] >= ((n + 1) >> 1) && __builtin_popcount(k) > num) {
        num = __builtin_popcount(k);
        ans = 0;
        rep(j, 0, size - 1) {
          if (k & (1 << j))
            ans += (1ll << one[j]);
        }
      }
    }
  }
  rep(i, 0, m - 1) { cout << ((ans >> i) & 1); }
  cout << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the actual performance gain from these optimizations may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the input and the hardware on which the program is run.
