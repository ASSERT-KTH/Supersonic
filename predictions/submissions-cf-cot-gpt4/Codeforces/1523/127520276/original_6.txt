The code you've provided is quite complex and most of the optimization would require a considerable amount of changes. However, there is one optimization that stands out and can be done without changing the structure of the code too much. 

The function `mintlq` is called in a loop and accesses the `storage` vector many times through the `a` pointer. It is likely that the compiler does not realize that the `storage` vector does not change in between calls to `mintlq`, so it can't optimize those accesses. You can optimize this by moving the `a` pointer initialization outside of the `mintlq` function and pass it as an argument instead.

Optimized code:
```
...

int mintlq(int r, const CTVertex *a) const {
  int res = M;
  int pos = *root;
  while (pos != -1) {
    if (a[pos].x > r) {
      pos = *a[pos].l;
    } else {
      res = a[pos].t;
      pos = *a[pos].r;
    }
  }
  return res;
}

...

int query(int l, int r) {
  int res = M;
  const CTVertex *a = ft[0].storage.data(); // get the pointer only once
  for (int i = N - l; i > N - r; i &= i - 1) {
    res = min(res, ft[i - 1].mintlq(r, a));
  }
  return res;
}

...
```

To explain the change:
In order to optimize the access to `storage` vector in `mintlq`, we moved the initialization of `a` pointer outside of `mintlq` and passed it as an argument. This way, the initialization is done only once, instead of every time `mintlq` is called. This should slightly reduce the running time of the program.
