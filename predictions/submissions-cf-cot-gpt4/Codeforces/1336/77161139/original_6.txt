The given program creates an adjacency list representation of a graph and calculates the depth of each node, the number of nodes below each node, and scores for each node. The score for each node is the difference between its depth and the number of nodes below it.

Here are the optimizations we can do:

1. Use reserve method: When you know how many elements you will put into a vector, it is a better practice to reserve space for them. This eliminates the need for dynamic resizing and reallocation of vector memory, which can be a costly operation.

2. Pass heavy objects like vector by reference: You are already doing this. Passing by reference avoids creating unnecessary copies and saves memory.

3. Use const reference when possible: When you are not modifying the object in the function, use const reference. This prevents accidental modification of the object and can also give some optimization.

4. Combine for loops: If possible, combine multiple for loops to reduce time complexity. In this case, the depth, below and score for the nodes can be calculated in a single pass.

5. Use std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and std::cin.tie(NULL): You are already doing this. These two lines make the execution faster by not synchronizing the C and C++ standard streams and untie cin from cout.

The optimized program looks like this:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <ios>
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void compute_depth_below(int u, int p, const vector<vector<int>> &adj, vector<int> &depth, vector<int> &below, vector<int> &score) {
  for (const int &v : adj[u]) {
    if (v != p) {
      depth[v] = depth[u] + 1;
      compute_depth_below(v, u, adj, depth, below, score);
      below[u] += below[v] + 1;
    }
  }
  score[u] = depth[u] - below[u];
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
  adj.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    --u;
    --v;
    adj[u].push_back(v);
    adj[v].push_back(u);
  }
  vector<int> depth(n), below(n), score(n);
  compute_depth_below(0, -1, adj, depth, below, score);
  sort(score.begin(), score.end(), greater<int>());
  cout << accumulate(score.begin(), score.begin() + k, 0ll) << '\n';
}
```

These are minor tweaks to your program. If you want to further optimize it, you would need to look at the algorithmic complexity of your problem and try to reduce it. For example, using an appropriate data structure, or changing the algorithm itself.
