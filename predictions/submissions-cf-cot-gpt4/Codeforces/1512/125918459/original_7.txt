The original program is a C++ program that performs two main operations:

  1. It calculates the sum of all divisors of numbers from 1 to N and stores them in an array v1.
  2. It then stores the smallest number whose sum of divisors equals to each number from 1 to N in an array mp1.

There are a few ways to optimize this program.

1. Avoid using global variables: Global variables can cause issues with memory management and code maintainability. Instead, declare your variables within the main function where they are needed.

2. Use std::array instead of C-Style Array: std::array are safer and generally more efficient than C-style arrays. They provide bounds-checking, and have more useful member functions.

3. Avoid declaring unnecessary variables: The original program declares an vector mp1 within the main function, which wasn't used in the code. We can remove this to save memory.

4. Use faster IO operations: The std::endl function always causes a flush operation, which can be slow. Instead, just output a newline character '\n'.

5. Use prefix increment: The prefix increment operator (++i) can be faster than the postfix operator (i++) because the postfix operator creates a copy of the variable's original state that is discarded after the operation.

Optimized code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>

int main() {
  const int N = 10000001;
  std::array<long long, N> v1 = {0};
  std::array<long long, N> mp1 = {0};

  for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
    for (int j = i; j < N; j += i) {
      v1[j] += i;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
    if (v1[i] < N && mp1[v1[i]] == 0)
      mp1[v1[i]] = i;
  }
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int c;
    std::cin >> c;
    if (mp1[c])
      std::cout << mp1[c];
    else
      std::cout << -1;
    std::cout << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
