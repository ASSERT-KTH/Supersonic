This code calculates the sum of the divisors of each number up to N, and then checks if the sum of the divisors of any number is equal to a given input number. The algorithm for finding the sum of the divisors can be optimized by reducing the number of iterations in the for loop.

Optimizations:

1. Instead of iterating j from i to N, we could iterate it from i*i to N. This is because, for any number n which is less than i*i, i cannot be a divisor. In other words, all the numbers less than i*i would have already been considered in previous iterations for i.
2. We can also reduce the number of iterations by checking only up to square root of N in the outer loop. This is because, for any number n greater than square root of N, n*n will be larger than N, so we don't need to consider these iterations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const long long N = 10000001;
long long v1[N];
long long mp1[N];
int main() {
  vector<long long> mp1(N, 0);
  for (long long i = 1; i*i < N; i++) {
    for (long long j = i*i; j < N; j += i) {
      v1[j] += i;
      if (i != j / i) v1[j] += j / i;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    if (v1[i] < N && mp1[v1[i]] == 0)
      mp1[v1[i]] = i;
  }
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int c;
    cin >> c;
    if (mp1[c])
      cout << mp1[c];
    else
      cout << -1;
    cout << endl;
  }
}
```

Note: This optimization is valid under the assumption that N is a perfect square. If N is not a perfect square, you may need to handle the edge case separately.
