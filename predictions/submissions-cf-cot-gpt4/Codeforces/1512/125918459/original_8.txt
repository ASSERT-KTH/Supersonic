The given C/C++ program seems to calculate the sum of divisors for each number up to N and stores the result in an array. Then it builds a mapping from sums of divisors back to original numbers. Finally, it takes some test cases and prints the original number corresponding to the given sum of divisors if it exists, or -1 otherwise.

Here are the possible optimizations:

1. Remove Redundant Declaration: The array `mp1` has been declared twice, once globally and once locally in `main()`. We should remove the local declaration in `main()`.

2. Avoid Multiple Console Outputs: Instead of printing the result immediately in each test case, store them in a string stream and print them all at once. This is because console I/O operations are quite slow, and reducing the number of these operations can significantly speed up the program.

3. Use Fast I/O Operations: The `cin` and `cout` operations are slower than `scanf` and `printf`. We can use `scanf` and `printf` to speed up the I/O operations.

Here is the optimized program after applying these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;
const long long N = 10000001;
long long v1[N];
long long mp1[N];
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j < N; j += i) {
      v1[j] += i;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    if (v1[i] < N && mp1[v1[i]] == 0)
      mp1[v1[i]] = i;
  }
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  stringstream ss;
  while (t--) {
    int c;
    scanf("%d", &c);
    if (mp1[c])
      ss << mp1[c];
    else
      ss << -1;
    ss << '\n';
  }
  printf("%s", ss.str().c_str());
}
```
Keep in mind that these optimizations might not make a noticeable difference for small inputs, but they can have significant impact when dealing with larger inputs.
