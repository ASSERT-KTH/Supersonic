The given program computes the sum of all divisors for each number from 1 to N and stores the results in the v1[] array. Then it creates a mapping in an array mp1[], where mp1[i] is the smallest number whose sum of divisors equals i. After this, the program reads a number of test cases t and for each test case a number c. For each c, the program prints the smallest number whose sum of divisors is c, or -1 if no such number exists.

In terms of optimization, there are several things we can do:

1. Remove the unused vector<long long> mp1 in main function. There is an array mp1[] in global scope which is used in the program.

2. The inner loop in the first for loop is redundant. It iterates from 'i' to 'N' with step 'i', and for each 'j' it simply adds 'i' to v1[j]. This is equivalent to adding 'i' times the number of multiples of 'i' in the range [i,N]. The number of multiples of 'i' in this range is simply N/i (integer division). So, we can replace the inner loop with a single statement that multiplies 'i' with N/i and adds the result to v1[i].

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const long long N = 10000001;
long long v1[N] = {0};
long long mp1[N] = {0};

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    v1[i] += i * (N / i);
    if (v1[i] < N && mp1[v1[i]] == 0)
      mp1[v1[i]] = i;
  }
  
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int c;
    cin >> c;
    if (mp1[c])
      cout << mp1[c];
    else
      cout << -1;
    cout << endl;
  }
}
```

This optimized program should execute faster than the original program, because it eliminates a lot of unnecessary iterations in the first for loop. The memory usage of the program is also slightly improved, because the unused vector<long long> mp1 in main function is removed.
