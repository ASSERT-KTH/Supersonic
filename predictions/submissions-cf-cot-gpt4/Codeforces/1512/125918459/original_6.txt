The given C/C++ program seems to be finding the sum of all divisors of every number within the range of N and storing them in v1 array. Then it is storing the index of the first occurrence of every number in the v1 array to the mp1 vector. During this process, it excludes the numbers which are greater than N. It is also taking multiple inputs from the user and printing the first occurrence of those numbers if present, else it is printing -1. 

This program can be optimized by reducing the number of operations performed.

Optimization techniques:

1. Avoid Using Vector: The vector 'mp1' is declared twice, once as a global array and once as a local vector inside the main function. We can remove the vector declaration and use the global array for our operations.

2. Optimized Division: The nested loop with 'j' iterating from 'i' to 'N' in increments of 'i' is actually calculating the sum of all divisors of 'j'. We can optimize this by simply iterating up to sqrt(N) and adding both divisors.

This is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
const long long N = 10000001;
long long v1[N];
long long mp1[N];

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i * i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j * i < N; j++) {
      v1[j*i] += i + j * (i != j);
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    if (v1[i] < N && mp1[v1[i]] == 0)
      mp1[v1[i]] = i;
  }
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int c;
    cin >> c;
    if (mp1[c])
      cout << mp1[c];
    else
      cout << -1;
    cout << endl;
  }
}
```

In the optimized code, we are only considering pairs of divisors (i, j) where i <= sqrt(N) and j >= sqrt(N). We ensure that we add both i and j to the sum unless i == j, in which case we only add i once. This reduces the number of iterations significantly and improves the time complexity of the program.
