This program appears to be a number-theoretic one. It is trying to find out the sum of divisors of a number and storing the first number whose divisor sum is `i` in the `mp1[i]` array. However, there are a few optimization issues in this program:

1. There is a redundant declaration of `mp1` array. It is declared twice in the global scope and in the `main` function.
2. The inner loop in the first pair of nested loops goes up to `N` with a stride of `i`. This is where most of the time is spent. It can be optimized by noting that for each `i`, the sum of divisors of `j` increases by `i` only for `j` that are multiples of `i`. Therefore, we can limit the loop to `i*i` instead of `N`, because for `j > i*i`, there will be smaller `i'` such that `i'*i' = j`.
3. The use of `vector<long long>` for `mp1` is unnecessary since its size is fixed to `N` and does not change. Using a simple array would be more efficient in terms of memory usage.
4. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` before input and output operations to speed up `cin` and `cout`.

Now let's optimize the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
const long long N = 10000001;
long long v1[N];
long long mp1[N];

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
  cin.tie(NULL);
  for (int i = 1; i*i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j < N; j += i) {
      v1[j] += i;
      if(i != j/i) v1[j] += j/i;  // Add the pair divisor
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    if (v1[i] < N && mp1[v1[i]] == 0)
      mp1[v1[i]] = i;
  }
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int c;
    cin >> c;
    if (mp1[c])
      cout << mp1[c] << "\n";
    else
      cout << -1 << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

With these changes, the program will run significantly faster and consume less memory. It is important to note that this optimization is specific to this problem, and may not apply to other problems.
