This program is a complex one and it's not doing a specific task. It's more like a collection of functions that do different things. However, there are still ways to optimize it.

1. **Include only necessary headers**: `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is usually considered bad practice as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which increases compilation time. Include only the headers that you need.

2. **Avoid global variables**: Global variables are usually shared among all functions and can lead to unexpected results due to their uncontrolled access. Instead, pass them as arguments to functions.

3. **Use iterative functions instead of recursive ones**: Recursive functions can lead to high memory usage due to the call stack, especially for large inputs. Functions like `_pow` and `factorial` can be rewritten iteratively to avoid this.

4. **Remove unnecessary macros and typedefs**: This code has a lot of macros and typedefs that are not being used, removing them can make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

5. **Avoid repeated calculations**: In function `sum_of_divisors`, the code repeatedly calculates `1e7`. It's better to calculate this value once and store it in a variable.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <map>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int ll;
#define nl << '\n';
#define Faster ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);
const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int mX = 1e7 + 12;
int a[mX];
ll mp[mX];
void sum_of_divisors() {
  int limit = 1e7;
  for (int i = 1; i <= limit; i++)
    for (int j = i; j <= limit; j += i)
      a[j] += i;
  for (int i = limit; i >= 0; i--)
    if (a[i] <= limit)
      mp[a[i]] = i;
}
void case_i() {
  int c;
  cin >> c;
  if (mp[c])
    cout << mp[c] nl else cout << -1 nl
}
int main() {
  Faster sum_of_divisors();
  ll testCases;
  cin >> testCases;
  while (testCases--)
    case_i();
  return 0;
}
```
