The given code is a template used by competitive coders to solve problems efficiently. It's already optimized for running time and memory usage in most scenarios. However, there are some general practices that could be applied to enhance the code readability, maintainability, and potentially the performance. Here are some of them:

1. Remove unused functions and variables: The code contains several functions and variables that aren't used in the main function or any other functions. Removing them would reduce the code size and improve readability.

2. Avoid using macros: Although macros like `#define` are used for code reuse and convenience, they can make the code harder to read and debug. Replacing them with equivalent C++ features, such as inline functions and constants, would make the code safer and easier to understand.

3. Use `std::vector` instead of raw arrays: Using `std::vector` instead of raw arrays can help avoid many common bugs and make the code more idiomatic. In the given code, `a` and `mp` can be converted to `std::vector`. 

4. Use `constexpr` for constants: The constants `eps`, `INF`, `infLL`, `MOD`, `PI`, and `mX` can be declared as `constexpr` to ensure they're evaluated at compile time.

5. Use standard library functions: The code implements several common functions like `pow_mod`, `mod_inverse`, `factorial`, and `is_prime`. These functions could be replaced with equivalent functions from the standard library or popular third-party libraries.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const int mX = 1e7 + 12;
vector<int> a(mX);
vector<ll> mp(mX);
void sum_of_divisors() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 1e7; i++)
    for (int j = i; j <= 1e7; j += i)
      a[j] += i;
  for (int i = 1e7; i >= 0; i--)
    if (a[i] <= 1e7)
      mp[a[i]] = i;
}

void case_i() {
  int c;
  cin >> c;
  if (mp[c])
    cout << mp[c] << '\n';
  else
    cout << -1 << '\n';
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  sum_of_divisors();
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    case_i();
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimized version assumes the actual problem-solving code is inside `sum_of_divisors` and `case_i` functions. The other deleted functions are assumed not to affect problem-solving. In a real scenario, you would need to understand the specific problem requirements and optimize accordingly.
