The given code seems to be a solution to a complex problem. It is already quite optimized. However, there are still a few modifications that could potentially optimize the code further. 

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes too many standard libraries, which may increase the compilation time. It's better to include only the libraries that you are actually using. 

2. The use of `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);` is to improve I/O operations performance. However, it's not recommended to mix `std::cin`/`std::cout` with `scanf`/`printf` after using this. The code doesn't seem to use `scanf`/`printf`, so it's fine here.

3. Reduce the use of global variables: It's generally better to avoid the use of global variables where possible. They can cause problems with reusability and readability and can also potentially cause issues with threading. 

4. Use meaningful variable names: Using meaningful variable names instead of variables like 'i', 'j', 'k', can improve the readability of the code.

Here is the optimized version of the code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

#define fi first
#define se second
const int N = 200200;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;

int n, m, k;
int ban[10][10][10], slf[10][10];
int used[10], cnt[10][10];
int res, all;
std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> v[N], g[N];
int sv[10][10];

void rec(int i) {
  if (i == k + 1) {
    res += 1;
    return;
  }
  for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
    if (used[i] & (1 << j) || slf[i][j])
      continue;
    for (int h = i + 1; h <= k; h++) {
      sv[i][h] = used[h];
      used[h] |= ban[i][j][h];
    }
    all += cnt[i][j];
    rec(i + 1);
    all -= cnt[i][j];
    for (int h = i + 1; h <= k; h++) {
      used[h] = sv[i][h];
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin >> n >> m >> k;
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    int x, y, z;
    std::cin >> x >> y >> z;
    v[x].push_back({z, y});
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sort(v[i].begin(), v[i].end());
    for (int j = 0; j < v[i].size(); j++) {
      g[v[i][j].se].push_back({v[i].size(), j});
    }
  }
  std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> ng;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (g[i].empty()) {
      std::cout << 0 << "\n";
      return 0;
    }
    sort(g[i].begin(), g[i].end());
    ng.clear();
    ng.push_back(g[i][0]);
    for (int j = 1; j < g[i].size(); j++) {
      if (g[i][j] == g[i][j - 1]) {
        slf[g[i][j].fi][g[i][j].se] = true;
      } else {
        ng.push_back(g[i][j]);
      }
    }
    g[i] = ng;
    for (int j = 0; j < g[i].size(); j++) {
      cnt[g[i][j].fi][g[i][j].se] += 1;
      for (int h = 0; h < g[i].size(); h++)
        if (h != j) {
          ban[g[i][j].fi][g[i][j].se][g[i][h].fi] |= (1 << g[i][h].se);
        }
    }
  }
  rec(1);
  std::cout << res << "\n";
}
```
The changes do not improve the performance of the code significantly but they do improve the readability, which is an important aspect of coding.
