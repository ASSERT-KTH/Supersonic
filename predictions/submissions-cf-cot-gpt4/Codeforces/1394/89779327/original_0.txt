Given that the provided code is a competitive programming problem that has been optimized to some extent, it's somewhat hard to optimize it further without knowing the exact problem statement. However, there are still a few small changes we can apply to optimize the code, mainly related to memory usage:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes nearly all standard libraries, which can slow down the compile time considerably. We can include only the specific libraries needed for the program.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This can cause naming conflicts if the program becomes larger or if it's integrated into another project. It's better to prefix with `std::` when using standard library features.

3. Avoid excessive use of global variables: Global variables can make the code harder to understand and debug. They also occupy memory for the duration of program execution. As such, we should try to minimize their usage.

4. Avoid using `std::vector::push_back` in a loop: `std::vector::push_back` might cause multiple reallocations and copies when the vector grows. If the number of elements is known beforehand, it's better to use `std::vector::reserve` to preallocate enough memory.

5. Use 'endl' carefully: Using 'endl' in place of '\n' can be a potential performance pitfall. The reason is that 'endl' actually does two things: it adds a newline character to the stream and then it flushes the stream. Unless you actually need the stream to be flushed, you should use '\n' instead.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

#define fi first
#define se second
const int N = 200200;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  int n, m, k;
  std::cin >> n >> m >> k;
  
  std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> v[N], g[N], ng;
  int ban[10][10][10], slf[10][10];
  int used[10], cnt[10][10];
  int res = 0, all = 0;
  int sv[10][10];
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    int x, y, z;
    std::cin >> x >> y >> z;
    v[x].push_back({z, y});
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    std::sort(v[i].begin(), v[i].end());
    for (int j = 0; j < v[i].size(); j++) {
      g[v[i][j].se].push_back({v[i].size(), j});
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (g[i].empty()) {
      std::cout << 0 << "\n";
      return 0;
    }
    std::sort(g[i].begin(), g[i].end());
    ng.clear();
    ng.push_back(g[i][0]);
    for (int j = 1; j < g[i].size(); j++) {
      if (g[i][j] == g[i][j - 1]) {
        slf[g[i][j].fi][g[i][j].se] = true;
      } else {
        ng.push_back(g[i][j]);
      }
    }
    g[i] = ng;
    for (int j = 0; j < g[i].size(); j++) {
      cnt[g[i][j].fi][g[i][j].se] += 1;
      for (int h = 0; h < g[i].size(); h++)
        if (h != j) {
          ban[g[i][j].fi][g[i][j].se][g[i][h].fi] |= (1 << g[i][h].se);
        }
    }
  }
  // rec(1); The rec function is not provided in the given code.
  std::cout << res << "\n";
}
```

Please note that the function `rec(1);` is called in the main function but is not provided in the given code. The optimized version of the function is not provided here.
