This C++ program is largely optimized. However, there are still a few areas where we can make minor improvements to optimize running time and memory usage.

1. Unnecessary Macros: The macros defined at the beginning of the program are not all used. Removing unused macros will improve memory usage.

2. Unnecessary Includes: The program includes bits/stdc++.h, which is a large header file that includes almost all standard C++ libraries. Including only the necessary libraries will reduce memory usage and may improve compile time.

3. Input Optimization: The input is being read using cin, which is slower. We can use scanf instead of cin to speed up the input process. Similarly, printf can be used instead of cout.

4. Redundant Absolution: The code is making all the numbers absolute. But it's not necessary because the program works fine with negative numbers. This also improves the running time.

5. Use of #ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE: The use of the #ifndef block is unnecessary unless you are debugging locally and want to read from a file.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

#define ll long long
#define vii vector<int>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  vii arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
  }
  sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
  int l = 0, count = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    while (2 * arr[l] < arr[i])
      l++;
    count += i - l;
  }
  printf("%d", count);
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we have removed the unnecessary macros and includes, and optimized the input and output operations. We also removed the redundant absolution and the #ifndef block.
