The C++ program provided here is already quite optimized, but there are a few things we could do to further enhance it:

1. Instead of using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, include only the headers that are actually used in the program. The `<bits/stdc++.h>` is very heavy because it includes almost all the standard library headers, which increases the compilation time. Also, it is not a standard header, so it will not be found in all compilers.

2. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), std::cin.tie(NULL)` only when you are mixing `printf/scanf` with `cin/cout`, or doing a lot of input/output operations. In this program, there is only one input and one output operation, so you could remove this line to save some time.

3. Remove `#define int long long`. It could confuse the reader. It's better to use `long long` directly when you need it.

4. Use `std::vector::reserve` for vector `arr`. This allows you to tell the vector how much space you plan to use, which can reduce the number of reallocations and copies that might be needed as the vector grows.

5. The function `findbestr` is not used in the program, so it can be removed.

6. Remove `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` conditions if you are not using online judge for testing. It's unnecessary here.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

#define ll long long
#define vii std::vector<int>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ll n, inp;
  cin >> n;
  vii arr;
  arr.reserve(n);
  
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> inp;
    arr.push_back(inp > 0 ? inp : -inp);
  }
  
  sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
  ll l = 0, count = 0;
  
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    while (2 * arr[l] < arr[i])
      l++;
    count += i - l;
  }
  
  cout << count;
}
```
Note: Depending on the compiler and target architecture, the use of `long long` can result in slower code due to the larger size (64 bits vs 32 bits for `int`) and potential for more memory accesses. If the range of `int` is sufficient and performance is a concern, consider using `int` instead of `long long`. However, this depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your program.
