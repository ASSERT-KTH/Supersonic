The program calculates how many pairs of numbers in the array have the property that the second number is not more than twice the first one.

The given program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Avoid using #define preprocessor directives for defining constants and macros. Instead, use const variable for constants and inline functions for macros. 
   
2. The `bits/stdc++.h` header file is quite heavy and includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which can increase the compile time of the program. Include only the necessary libraries to reduce compile time.

3. The usage of `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` is not necessary unless you are specifically coding on an online judge that requires this condition. Removing it will reduce a few lines of code and improve readability.

4. The function `findbestr` is not being used in the program, it can be removed.

5. The `vii arr(n);` and the `for loop` to insert elements into the vector can be combined into a single line using a range-based for loop.

6. Instead of using the ternary operator to change negative inputs to positive, we can use the `abs` function from the cmath library.

7. Lastly, `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(NULL);` is not necessary in this program as we are not mixing C and C++ style input/output in this program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, inp;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int &i : arr) {
    cin >> inp;
    i = abs(inp);
  }
  sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
  int l = 0, count = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    while (2 * arr[l] < arr[i])
      l++;
    count += i - l;
  }
  cout << count;
}
```

In this version of the program, only the necessary headers are included, the unused function and macros are removed, and the `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(NULL);` line is removed as it was not necessary for this program. The input is taken in a more concise way and the `abs` function is used to ensure the input is positive.
