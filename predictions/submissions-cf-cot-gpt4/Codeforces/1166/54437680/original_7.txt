This program is reasonably well optimized already, but there are still a few things we can do to further optimize it:

1. We can avoid unnecessary computation in the loop by moving the multiplication operation outside of the loop.
2. We can replace `2 * arr[l] < arr[i]` with `arr[l] << 1 < arr[i]`. It's because Bitwise shifting is faster than multiplication.
3. We can avoid the use of `all()` macro which is used for `sort(all(arr));` and `arr.begin(), arr.end()` can be used instead. It is because macros can sometimes cause confusion and errors in the code. Removing unnecessary macros would help in better understanding of the code and also makes it cleaner.
4. Code has an unnecessary `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` directive used for local debugging. We should remove that. It's not necessary for the program's functionality and it may confuse others who are reading your code.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define ld long double
#define vll vector<ll>
#define vii vector<int>
#define vvll vector<vll>
#define pll pair<ll, ll>
#define MOD 1000000007
#define rall(v) v.rbegin(), v.rend()
#define fst first
#define mp make_pair
#define pb push_back
#define fast ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(NULL)
#define int long long
#define scd second
#define for1(i, n) for (ll(i) = 1; (i) <= (n); ++(i))
#define forr(i, n) for (ll(i) = (n)-1; (i) >= 0; (i)--)
#define forn(i, n) for (ll(i) = 0; (i) < (n); ++(i))
#define forab(i, a, b, c) for (ll(i) = a; (i) <= (b); (i) += (c))
#define mst(A) memset((A), 0, sizeof(A));
using namespace std;

int findbestr(vii &arr, int i, int n) {
  int elem = arr[i];
  int l = i + 1, r = n, mid;
  while (l <= r) {
    mid = (r - l) / 2 + l;
    if (l == r) {
      break;
    } else if (arr[mid] <= elem << 1) {
      l = mid;
    } else {
      r = mid;
    }
  }
  return mid;
}

signed main() {
  int n, inp;
  cin >> n;
  vii arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> inp;
    arr[i] = inp > 0 ? inp : -inp;
  }
  sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
  int l = 0, count = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    while (arr[l] << 1 < arr[i])
      l++;
    count += i - l;
  }
  cout << count;
}
