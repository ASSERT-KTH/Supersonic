This program is already pretty optimized, but there are small changes that can be made to get tiny improvements in terms of speed and memory usage.

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a non-standard header file that includes almost all C++ standard libraries. It's not recommended for use in production code because it leads to longer compilation times and increased memory usage. You should include only the specific libraries that you need.

2. The `using namespace std;` line is also generally discouraged because it can lead to name clashes if the program is extended or integrated with other code in the future. Instead, you should use the `std::` qualifier before each standard library construct.

3. The `#define` preprocessor directives are C-style and can be replaced by constant variables in C++. This makes the code safer because constants have types, while `#define` does not.

4. The `signed main()` is unnecessary because `main()` is `int` by default. 

5. `arr[i] = inp > 0 ? inp : -inp;` can be replaced with `arr[i] = abs(inp);` which is more readable and does the same thing.

6. The binary search in `findbestr` function can be optimized by changing the condition `arr[mid] <= 2 * elem` to `arr[mid] > 2 * elem` and interchanging the `l = mid;` and `r = mid;` lines. This will make the search more efficient by eliminating unnecessary steps.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

const long long MOD = 1000000007;

int main() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int n, inp;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> inp;
    arr[i] = std::abs(inp);
  }
  std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
  int l = 0, count = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    while (2 * arr[l] < arr[i])
      l++;
    count += i - l;
  }
  std::cout << count;
}
```
Note: The `findbestr` function was not used in the program, so it was removed in the optimized version. If it's necessary for your program, you should reintroduce it with the suggested optimizations.
