This program calculates the count of pairs in an array such that 2*arr[i] >= arr[j] and i < j. It first sorts the array, and then finds the least index for every index i such that the condition holds, then adds the difference of indices to count.

Optimizations:
1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, thus increasing the compilation time. Instead, only include necessary libraries.
2. The macro `int long long` is redundant because `ll` has already been defined as `long long`. Remove the redundant macro.
3. The function `findbestr` is not used in the program. It's better to remove unused functions to decrease the size of the executable file.
4. In the loop where the array is filled, the condition `inp > 0 ? inp : -inp` is used to ensure the array is filled with absolute values. This can be replaced with the `abs(inp)` function which is clearer and more readable.
5. The `freopen` function is used to redirect the input and output streams. However, this is unnecessary if the program is run in a normal environment. In a competitive programming environment, this is useful for testing purposes. But if the program is run in a normal environment, it should be removed to avoid unnecessary file operations.
6. The `mst` macro is defined but not used in the code. It's better to clean up unused macros to keep the code clean and decrease the size of the executable file.

Optimized code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#define ll long long
#define vii vector<int>
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, inp;
  cin >> n;
  vii arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> inp;
    arr[i] = abs(inp);
  }
  sort(all(arr));
  int l = 0, count = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    while (2 * arr[l] < arr[i])
      l++;
    count += i - l;
  }
  cout << count;
}
```
