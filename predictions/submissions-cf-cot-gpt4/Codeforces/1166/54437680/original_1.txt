The given C++ code calculates the number of pairs in an array such that arr[i] is at least twice as large as arr[j], where i > j.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#define` statements. These macros aren't used in the code, so they just take up space.
2. `findbestr` function isn't used in the code, so it can be removed.
3. The preprocessor directives `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` and the corresponding `#endif` can be removed. They're only needed when you're reading from a file and writing to a file, which is usually not the case in production code.
4. No need to check if `inp > 0 ? inp : -inp;` as we are sorting the array and we never use negative numbers. This check is unnecessary and can be removed.
5. We can use `++l` instead of `l++` in the `while` loop as it's faster and more efficient because it avoids unnecessary temporary object creation.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, inp;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> inp;
    arr[i] = inp;
  }
  sort(all(arr));
  int l = 0, count = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    while (2 * arr[l] < arr[i])
      ++l;
    count += i - l;
  }
  cout << count;
}
```
In this optimized version, the code becomes cleaner and more readable. The running time is also slightly improved due to the removed unnecessary checks and operations.
