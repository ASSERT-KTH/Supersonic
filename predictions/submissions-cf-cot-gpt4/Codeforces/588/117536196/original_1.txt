The given code is already quite optimal in terms of time complexity. The time complexity is O(n) because it only contains a single while loop that runs n times. However, there are a few changes we can make to make the code cleaner and more maintainable.

1. Avoid using #include <bits/stdc++.h> because it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can increase the compilation time. Use only the necessary headers. In this case, we only need <iostream>.

2. Avoid using 'using namespace std'. It's a bad practice because it can lead to name clashes. It's better to use the std:: prefix when needed.

3. Instead of using 'cin' and 'cout' for input and output, we can use faster methods like 'scanf' and 'printf'. This can improve the running time slightly for large inputs.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::scanf("%d", &n);
  short a, p, m = 101;
  long int sum = 0;
  while (n--) {
    std::scanf("%hd %hd", &a, &p);
    m = m > p ? p : m;
    sum += a * m;
  }
  std::printf("%ld", sum);
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program accomplishes the same task as the original but is cleaner and potentially faster due to the use of 'scanf' and 'printf' over 'cin' and 'cout'. The algorithmic complexity is still O(n), which is the best we can do for this problem.
