The existing program is quite efficient already, but there are a few slight optimizations we can make. These optimizations include:

1. Avoiding the use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which may increase the compilation time. We will include only the necessary library files.

2. Replacing `using namespace std;` with explicit `std::` prefixes. This is not a performance optimization but a best practice to avoid potential name conflicts.

3. Adding `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` right after the start of the main function to disable the synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams. This can potentially speed up the I/O operations.

4. Replacing `std::endl` with '\n'. `std::endl` causes a flushing of the stream, which can slow down the output if used excessively.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);

    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    short a, p, m = 101;
    long int sum = 0;

    while (n--) {
        std::cin >> a >> p;
        m = m > p ? p : m;
        sum += a * m;
    }

    std::cout << sum << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```
