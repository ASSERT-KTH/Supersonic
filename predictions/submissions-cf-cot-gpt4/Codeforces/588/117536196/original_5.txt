This C/C++ program is already quite efficient, but there are a few minor things we can do to optimize it further.

1. Instead of including the entire "bits/stdc++.h" library, include only the specific libraries that are needed. 

2. The variable 'm' is initialized to a magic number 101. It's better to use a numeric limit from the standard library.

3. Using 'std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)' and 'std::cin.tie(NULL)' can speed up the I/O operations.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);
    
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    short a, p;
    short m = std::numeric_limits<short>::max();
    long int sum = 0;
    while (n--) {
        std::cin >> a >> p;
        m = std::min(m, p);
        sum += a * m;
    }
    std::cout << sum;
    return 0;
}
```
Explanation:

1. The 'bits/stdc++.h' header file is replaced by 'iostream' and 'limits'. This will reduce the compile time as 'iostream' is specifically required for I/O operations and 'limits' is required for numeric limits.

2. 'std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)' is used to untie C++ standard streams and C standard streams. This can speed up I/O operations as the program does not need to keep the C and C++ standard streams in sync.

3. 'std::cin.tie(NULL)' unties 'cin' from 'cout'. This can also speed up I/O operations as 'cout' does not need to be flushed before each I/O operation to 'cin'.

4. 'm' is initialized to 'std::numeric_limits<short>::max()'. This is more portable and clear than using a magic number.

5. 'std::min' is used instead of a ternary operator to find the minimum. This makes the code cleaner and easier to read.

These optimizations may not have a significant impact on the performance of this particular program, but they are good practices to follow in general.
