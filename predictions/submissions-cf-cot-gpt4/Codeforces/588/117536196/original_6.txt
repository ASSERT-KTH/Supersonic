The original program seems to be fairly optimized in terms of its logic, but there are a few potential improvements that can be made.

1. **Use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`**: This is a header file that includes pretty much every standard library. Including this header file can significantly increase the compile time as it includes a lot of unnecessary stuff. It's better to include only those libraries which are used in the program. In this case, we only need `iostream` for input/output operations.

2. **Use of `using namespace std;`**: It's generally considered bad practice to use 'using namespace std;' in your program because it can lead to naming conflicts. It's better to use `std::` before `cin`, `cout`, etc.

3. **Use of `return 0` at the end of main**: It's not necessary to put `return 0` at the end of `main()`. If control reaches the end of main without encountering a return statement, the compiler will automatically insert `return 0`.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  short a, p, m = 101;
  long int sum = 0;
  while (n--) {
    std::cin >> a >> p;
    m = m > p ? p : m;
    sum += a * m;
  }
  std::cout << sum;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations do not change the time complexity or memory usage of the program, but they make the code cleaner and more efficient in terms of compilation.
