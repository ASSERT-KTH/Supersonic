This program is already quite optimized. However, few small tweaks can be made to improve it further:

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This is a shorthand for including a lot of standard libraries at once. This can slow down the compilation time, especially when the program gets larger. It's better to include only the libraries that are actually used.

2. `using namespace std;`: This can sometimes cause naming conflicts. It's better to use std:: in front of every standard library object. 

3. Avoid using ternary operator `? :` for simplicity and readability.

4. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` at the start of the main function to speed up cin and cout.

5. Use '\n' instead of endl. As endl causes an unnecessary flush operation thereby slowing the program.

So the optimized code would look like:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define MAX_PRICE 101

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  short a, p, m = MAX_PRICE;
  long int sum = 0;
  
  while (n--) {
    std::cin >> a >> p;
    if(m > p){
        m = p;
    }
    sum += a * m;
  }
  
  std::cout << sum << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
This code is more readable and optimized for speed and memory usage.
