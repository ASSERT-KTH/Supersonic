This C++ program is generally quite efficient, but there are a few improvements we could make.

1. Do not use `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file includes basically all the standard libraries which can slow down the compile time significantly. Instead, only include the libraries that you need, in this case, `#include <iostream>`.

2. In the comparison part `m = m > p ? p : m;`, you can use the `std::min` function which is simpler and more readable.

3. You may also consider using `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to make `cin` and `cout` faster. This can make a significant difference when you're dealing with a lot of input/output.

4. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl` because `endl` causes the output buffer to flush, which can be slower.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  short a, p, m = 101;
  long int sum = 0;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> a >> p;
    m = min(m, p);
    sum += a * m;
  }
  cout << sum << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
These modifications may not make a significant difference in runtime or memory usage for small inputs, but they can make a big difference when dealing with large inputs or when the program needs to be run many times.
