This program is already quite optimized, but there are a few minor changes that can be made to potentially improve its performance:

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can slow down the compilation time. It would be better to only include the needed headers, which in this case are `iostream`.

2. The usage of `std::endl` can slow down the output because it forces a flush of the output buffer. Instead, we can use "\n" which doesn't cause a flush.

3. The `using namespace std;` can potentially lead to name clashes, which can cause bugs that are hard to track. It's better to use the `std::` prefix before the standard library functions.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  short a, p, m = 101;
  long int sum = 0;
  while (n--) {
    std::cin >> a >> p;
    m = m > p ? p : m;
    sum += a * m;
  }
  std::cout << sum << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
These optimizations have a minor impact on performance, but they do make the code more readable and less error-prone, which is an important aspect of programming.
