This C++ program can be optimized to run faster and consume less memory. Here are some steps to optimize it:

1. **Avoiding unnecessary heap memory allocation**: In this program, `vector<long long int> mx` is created for each test case. Pushing elements to this vector involves heap allocation, which can be slow and consume a lot of memory, especially when the vector grows. Instead, we can calculate the maximum value on-the-fly during the input phase.

2. **Avoiding unnecessary use of pairs and vectors**: The program creates a vector of pairs `v` to store the start and end for each input. This is unnecessary as we can handle these calculations on-the-fly during input, thus reducing the use of memory and improving the speed.

3. **Avoiding repeated calculations**: In the for loop, we're recalculating the `diff` even when it's not necessary. We can optimize this by calculating it once and reusing the result.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  long long int T;
  cin >> T;
  
  while (T--) {
    long long int N;
    cin >> N;
    
    long long int start = 0;
    long long int end = 0;
    
    for (long long int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      long long int M;
      cin >> M;
      
      long long int max_val = -1;
      for (long long int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        long long int x;
        cin >> x;
        max_val = max(max_val, x - j + 1);
      }
      
      long long int new_start = max_val;
      long long int new_end = M + new_start;
      
      if (new_start >= end) {
        long long diff = new_start - end;
        start += diff;
        end = new_end;
      } else {
        long long diff = end - new_start;
        end = new_end + diff;
      }
    }
    cout << start << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version, we've eliminated the use of vectors and pairs, thus reducing the memory footprint of the program. By calculating the maximum value on-the-fly during input and handling start and end calculations immediately, we've also improved the speed of the program.
