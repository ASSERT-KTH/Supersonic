Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid using '#include <bits/stdc++.h>'. This header file includes quite a lot of files, which increases the compilation time. We will replace it with only the necessary header files.

2. Instead of declaring 'mx' vector and then finding the maximum, we can do this on the fly while inputting the elements. So the space complexity will be reduced.

3. The 'start' and 'end' variables do not need to be initialized to 0 before the for loop. We can do that in the first iteration of the loop.

4. Inside the loop, 'diff' is calculated twice in different branches of the 'if' statement. We can calculate it once before the 'if' statement and use it in both branches.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  long long int T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    long long int N;
    cin >> N;
    vector<pair<long long int, long long int>> v(N);
    for (long long int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      long long int M;
      cin >> M;
      long long int mx = LLONG_MIN;
      for (long long int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
        long long int x;
        cin >> x;
        mx = max(mx, x - j + 1);
      }
      v[i] = {mx, mx + M};
    }
    sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    long long int start = v[0].first;
    long long int end = v[0].second;
    for (long long int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
      long long diff = max(0LL, v[i].first - end);
      if (v[i].first >= end) {
        start += diff;
        end = v[i].second;
      } else {
        end = v[i].second + diff;
      }
    }
    cout << start << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized program, we are using less memory by avoiding the unnecessary 'mx' vector and finding the maximum on the fly. We are also avoiding repeated calculations of differences and unnecessary initializations. Instead of '#include <bits/stdc++.h>', we are using only the necessary header files, which should improve the compilation time.
