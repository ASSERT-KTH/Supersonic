Step 1: Remove the usage of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file is quite large and slows down the compilation process. Include only the specific standard libraries that you need. In this case, you need `iostream`, `vector`, `algorithm`.

Step 2: Avoid using `std::endl` as it performs additional flush operation which can slow down the program. Use "\n" instead.

Step 3: Remove the usage of `using namespace std;`. It's generally considered bad practice because it can lead to naming conflicts.

Step 4: Change the way to find the maximum element in the array. Instead of storing all elements in `mx` vector and then finding max, keep track of max while taking input. This will save memory and reduce computation time.

Step 5: Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to make input and output more efficient. These lines turn off synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams and untie `cin` from `cout`. This can speed up `cin` and `cout`.

Here is your optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  
  long long int T;
  std::cin >> T;
  
  while (T--) {
    long long int N;
    std::cin >> N;
    
    std::vector<std::pair<long long int, long long int>> v;
    
    for (long long int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      long long int M;
      std::cin >> M;
      
      long long int start = 0;
      long long int max_val = -1;
      
      for (long long int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        long long int x;
        std::cin >> x;
        max_val = std::max(max_val, x - j + 1);
      }
      
      start = max_val;
      long long int end = M + start;
      v.push_back({start, end});
    }
    
    std::sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    long long int start = 0;
    long long int end = 0;
    
    for (long long int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      if (v[i].first >= end) {
        long long diff = v[i].first - end;
        start = start + diff;
        end = v[i].second;
      } else {
        long long diff = end - v[i].first;
        end = v[i].second + diff;
      }
    }
    
    std::cout << start << "\n";
  }
}
```
The optimized code has a lower memory footprint and potentially faster runtime due to more efficient handling of vectors and I/O operations.
