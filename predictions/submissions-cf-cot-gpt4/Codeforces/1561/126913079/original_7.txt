Here are some steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: It's not a standard C++ library and including it can slow down the compile time because it includes all the standard C++ libraries which are not required in this case.

2. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up the cin/cout operations.

3. Avoid unnecessary use of vectors: In the current program, each input number is added to a vector, and then the maximum element is found. This can be optimized to find the maximum in the same loop where the numbers are read. This will save memory and also reduce the time complexity from O(N) to O(1) for finding the maximum element.

4. Use `reserve()` function for vector: If we know the maximum possible size of a vector in advance, we can use the `reserve()` function to preallocate memory for the vector. This will avoid reallocation and copying of the vector as it grows, thus improving the performance.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
    cin.tie(NULL); 

    long long int T;
    cin >> T;
    while (T--) {
        long long int N;
        cin >> N;
        vector<pair<long long int, long long int>> v;
        v.reserve(N);
        for (long long int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            long long int M;
            cin >> M;
            long long int start = 0;
            long long int j;
            long long int mx = -1;
            for (j = 0; j < M; j++) {
                long long int x;
                cin >> x;
                mx = max(mx, x - j + 1);
            }
            start = mx;
            long long int end = M + start;
            v.push_back({start, end});
        }
        sort(v.begin(), v.end());
        long long int start = 0;
        long long int end = 0;
        for (long long int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (v[i].first >= end) {
                long long diff = v[i].first - end;
                start = start + diff;
                end = v[i].second;
            } else {
                long long diff = end - v[i].first;
                end = v[i].second + diff;
            }
        }
        cout << start << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```
