The optimizations that can be made are:

1. Instead of using std::vector for temporary storage of "mx", we can directly calculate the maximum value and keep updating it in a variable. This will save memory and runtime as we are avoiding the overhead of push_back operations and calculation of max_element.

2. Instead of using std::vector "v" to store all pairs and sorting them, we can keep two variables to track the current range and update them as we go through the inputs. This will save memory and runtime as we are avoiding the overhead of push_back operations and the sort operation.

3. Replace bits/stdc++.h header with the specific headers needed for the program, as including bits/stdc++.h can increase the compile time.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;
int main() {
  long long int T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    long long int N;
    cin >> N;
    long long int start = 0, end = 0;
    for (long long int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      long long int M;
      cin >> M;
      long long int max_elem = 0;
      for (long long int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        long long int x;
        cin >> x;
        max_elem = max(max_elem, x - j + 1);
      }
      long long int new_start = max_elem;
      long long int new_end = M + new_start;
      if (new_start >= end) {
        long long diff = new_start - end;
        start += diff;
        end = new_end;
      } else {
        long long diff = end - new_start;
        end = new_end + diff;
      }
    }
    cout << start << "\n";
  }
}
```

This optimized version uses less memory (no vectors) and should run faster as it avoids unnecessary operations (push_back and sort).
