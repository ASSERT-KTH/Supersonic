This program is already pretty well optimized, however, a few small tweaks can be made to improve its performance.

1. Removal of Unused Libraries: The code has included libraries such as `<algorithm>`, `<array>`, `<fstream>`, `<iomanip>`, `<map>`, `<set>`, `<unordered_set>` that are not used in the code. Removing these libraries will reduce the compilation time and the size of the executable file.

2. Avoiding Global Variables: The use of global variables can often lead to code that is hard to debug and understand. Moreover, it can lead to unwanted side effects. In this code, variables like `b`, `m`, `p`, `cnt`, and `inf` are not used anywhere and can be removed. Only the `int long long` definition is required.

3. Reducing the Scope of Variables: Variables such as 'a' can be declared in the smallest possible scope to avoid unnecessary memory reservation.

4. Optimizing I/O Operations: By replacing `std::endl` with `'\n'`, we can avoid unnecessary flushing of the stream which can improve the I/O performance.

The optimized code is as follows:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define int long long

signed main() {
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> x(n, 0), ans(n, 0);
  vector<pair<int, int>> v(n, {0, 0});
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    cout << "XOR " << 1 << " " << i << '\n';
    cin >> x[i - 1];
    v[i - 1] = {x[i - 1], i - 1};
  }
  sort(v.begin(), v.end());
  bool b = false;
  int index1, index2;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
    if (v[i].first == v[i + 1].first) {
      b = true;
      index1 = v[i].second;
      index2 = v[i + 1].second;
      break;
    }
  if (b) {
    cout << "AND " << index1 + 1 << " " << index2 + 1 << '\n';
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] = a ^ x[index1];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      ans[i] = ans[0] ^ x[i];
    }
    cout << "! ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cout << ans[i] << ' ';
    }
    cout << '\n';
  } else {
    cout << "AND " << 1 << " " << v[1].second + 1 << '\n';
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] = a;
    cout << "AND " << 1 << " " << v[n - 2].second + 1 << '\n';
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] |= a;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      ans[i] = ans[0] ^ x[i];
    }
    cout << "! ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cout << ans[i] << ' ';
    }
    cout << '\n';
  }
}
```
Note: Optimization can often be a trade-off between readability and speed. This code is already quite optimized, and these suggestions are minor improvements. The main performance will come from the algorithm itself, which is already pretty good.
