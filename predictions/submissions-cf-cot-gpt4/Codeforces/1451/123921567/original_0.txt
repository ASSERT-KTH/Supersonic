The code already seems to be optimized in terms of algorithm complexity. However, a few minor changes could be made to improve the efficiency of the code.

1. `std::endl` vs `'\n'`: `std::endl` flushes the output buffer each time it is used. This makes the program slower when dealing with large amounts of data. Replacing `std::endl` with `'\n'` can improve the performance of the program. But it seems the original code does not use `std::endl`, so we don't need to change it.

2. Use `reserve()` for vectors: If you know the size of the vector beforehand, use `reserve()` to avoid reallocation of memory when the vector grows. It seems the original code already does this where it matters, so we don't need to change it.

3. Avoid unnecessary flush: `std::cout.flush();` is used a lot in the code. It's not necessary after every output and removing some of these can improve performance. But in this case, depending on the specific problem this program is trying to solve, those flushes might be necessary.

4. Avoid using `std::endl;`: `std::endl;` not only inserts a newline character, but also flushes the output stream buffer which can often be a costly operation. In this case, the code doesn't use `std::endl;`, so we don't need to change it.

5. Use bitwise XOR operator `^=` for operation `ans[0] = a ^ x[index1];` and `ans[0] |= a;`. It's more efficient because it reduces the number of instructions by performing the operation directly on the lvalue.

      break;
    }
  if (b) {
    cout << "AND " << index1 + 1 << " " << index2 + 1 << "\n";
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] ^= a ^ x[index1];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      ans[i] = ans[0] ^ x[i];
    }
    cout << "! ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cout << ans[i] << ' ';
    }
    cout << '\n';
  } else {
    cout << "AND " << 1 << " " << v[1].second + 1 << "\n";
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] |= a;
    cout << "AND " << 1 << " " << v[n - 2].second + 1 << "\n";
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] |= a;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      ans[i] = ans[0] ^ x[i];
    }
    cout << "! ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cout << ans[i] << ' ';
    }
    cout << '\n';
  }
}
```

It's important to note that these are minor optimizations which may not significantly improve the running time and memory usage of the program. The main improvements would come from optimizing the algorithm or data structures used in the program.
