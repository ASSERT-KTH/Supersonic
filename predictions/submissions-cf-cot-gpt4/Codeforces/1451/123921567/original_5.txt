The provided C/C++ program seems to be pretty optimized already, but there are still a few tweaks that could potentially improve its performance:

1. Remove unused libraries: The program is including several libraries that it doesn't actually use (like `<algorithm>`, `<array>`, `<fstream>`, `<iomanip>`, `<map>`, `<set>`, `<unordered_set>` and `<string>`). By removing these unused libraries, the program's compilation time can be reduced.

2. Use '\n' instead of `endl`: The program uses `endl` which internally uses `'\n'` to make a new line and `flush` to flush the output buffer. However, flushing the output buffer every time can make the program slower. So, it is advisable to use `'\n'` instead of `endl` to improve the performance.

3. Avoid using `std::endl` after `std::flush`: There's no need to use `std::endl` after `std::flush`, because `std::endl` does the same job as `std::flush`. So, to improve the performance, you can simply remove `std::endl` after `std::flush`.

4. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` at the beginning of the main function: By doing this, you are detaching C++'s standard streams from their corresponding C streams. This can lead to faster input/output operations.

5. Avoid unnecessary variable initialization: In the code, there are several variables which are initialized but never used. This consumes extra memory. So, avoid unnecessary variable initialization.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
vector<bool> b;
int m, p;
int cnt = 0;

signed main() {
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  ios::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> x(n, 0), ans(n, 0);
  vector<pair<int, int>> v(n, {0, 0});
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    cout << "XOR " << 1 << " " << i << "\n";
    cin >> x[i - 1];
    v[i - 1] = {x[i - 1], i - 1};
  }
  sort(v.begin(), v.end());
  bool b = false;
  int index1, index2;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
    if (v[i].first == v[i + 1].first) {
      b = true;
      index1 = v[i].second;
      index2 = v[i + 1].second;
      break;
    }
  if (b) {
    cout << "AND " << index1 + 1 << " " << index2 + 1 << "\n";
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] = a ^ x[index1];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      ans[i] = ans[0] ^ x[i];
    }
    cout << "! ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cout << ans[i] << ' ';
    }
    cout << '\n';
  } else {
    cout << "AND " << 1 << " " << v[1].second + 1 << "\n";
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] = a;
    cout << "AND " << 1 << " " << v[n - 2].second + 1 << "\n";
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] |= a;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      ans[i] = ans[0] ^ x[i];
    }
    cout << "! ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cout << ans[i] << ' ';
    }
    cout << '\n';
  }
}
