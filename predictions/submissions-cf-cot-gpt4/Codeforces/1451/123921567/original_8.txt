Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unused libraries: The first part of the optimization is removing unused libraries. The libraries `<algorithm>`, `<array>`, `<fstream>`, `<iomanip>`, `<map>`, `<set>`, `<string>`, `<unordered_set>` and `<vector>` are not used in this program and can be removed.

2. Remove unused variables: The next step is to remove unused variables. In the code, the variables `b`, `m`, `p` and `cnt` are declared but not used anywhere in the program. These can be safely removed.

3. Reduce calls to `cout.flush()`: The `cout.flush()` function is used to clear the buffer and output any remaining data. It is called frequently in this code but it is not always necessary. The `endl` manipulator can be used instead of `\n` which automatically flushes the buffer, thus reducing the need for explicit calls to `cout.flush()`.

4. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`: In other places where you don't need to flush the buffer, use `'\n'` instead of `endl`. This is because `endl` not only inserts a newline, but it also flushes the output, which can be a costly operation if you don't actually need it.

5. Avoid using `long long` when `int` will suffice: `long long` takes more memory than `int`. If you are sure that your number will not exceed the limit of `int`, use `int` instead of `long long`.

6. Avoid global variables: Global variables consume memory for their entire lifetime of the program, so it's better to limit their scope as much as possible. In your code, `inf` is a global variable, but it can be made local to the function where it's used.

7. Use `reserve()` for vectors: If you know the size of the vector in advance, use the `reserve()` function to avoid unnecessary reallocations.

8. Reduce usage of `std::pair`: The usage of `std::pair` makes the code less readable and it also uses more memory. You can directly use two int vectors instead of a vector of pairs.

Here is the optimized code after applying above optimization techniques:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<int> x(n, 0), ans(n, 0), index(n, 0), v(n, 0);

  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    cout << "XOR 1 " << i << "\n";
    cin >> x[i - 1];
    v[i - 1] = x[i - 1];
    index[i - 1] = i - 1;
  }

  auto b = false;
  int index1, index2;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
    if (v[i] == v[i + 1]) {
      b = true;
      index1 = index[i];
      index2 = index[i + 1];
      break;
    }

  if (b) {
    cout << "AND " << index1 + 1 << " " << index2 + 1 << "\n";
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] = a ^ x[index1];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      ans[i] = ans[0] ^ x[i];
    }
    cout << "! ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cout << ans[i] << ' ';
    }
    cout << '\n';
  } else {
    cout << "AND 1 " << index[1] + 1 << "\n";
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] = a;
    cout << "AND 1 " << index[n - 2] + 1 << "\n";
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] |= a;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      ans[i] = ans[0] ^ x[i];
    }
    cout << "! ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cout << ans[i] << ' ';
    }
    cout << '\n';
  }
}
```
