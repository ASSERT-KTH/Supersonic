This program is already pretty optimized. However, there are few points that could be improved:

1. Remove unused includes: The program includes a lot of standard libraries, but it doesn't seem to use all of them. The unused ones can be removed to decrease compilation time.

2. Reduce unnecessary `flush`: The `cout.flush();` is used to force the buffer to be printed to the console, but it's not necessary after every output. You should only use it when you need to make sure that the output is displayed immediately.

3. Avoid unnecessary vector initialization: The vectors, `x` and `ans`, are initialized with `0`, and then their values are changed later in the program. This is unnecessary and can be avoided.

4. Combine consecutive `cout` calls: There are many instances where the program performs multiple consecutive `cout` calls. These can be combined into a single call, which would reduce the function call overhead.

5. Eliminate global variables: The global variables `b`, `m` and `p` are declared but not used anywhere in the program. They can be eliminated.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define int long long

signed main() {
  ios::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<int> x(n), ans(n);
  vector<pair<int, int>> v(n);

  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    cout << "XOR 1 " << i << "\n";
    cin >> x[i - 1];
    v[i - 1] = {x[i - 1], i - 1};
  }

  sort(v.begin(), v.end());

  bool b = false;
  int index1, index2;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
    if (v[i].first == v[i + 1].first) {
      b = true;
      index1 = v[i].second;
      index2 = v[i + 1].second;
      break;
    }

  if (b) {
    int a;
    cout << "AND " << index1 + 1 << " " << index2 + 1 << "\n";
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] = a ^ x[index1];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      ans[i] = ans[0] ^ x[i];
    }
    cout << "! ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cout << ans[i] << ' ';
    }
    cout << '\n';
  } else {
    int a;
    cout << "AND 1 " << v[1].second + 1 << "\n";
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] = a;
    cout << "AND 1 " << v[n - 2].second + 1 << "\n";
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] |= a;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      ans[i] = ans[0] ^ x[i];
    }
    cout << "! ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cout << ans[i] << ' ';
    }
    cout << '\n';
  }
}
```
The changes include removing unused includes, reducing unnecessary `flush`, avoiding unnecessary vector initialization, combining consecutive `cout` calls and eliminating unused global variables.
