This program seems to be already quite well optimized in terms of logic and data structure usage. However, there are a few small improvements we can make:

1. There are a lot of unnecessary flushing of the output buffer. This is done by calling `cout.flush()` and using `endl`. Flushing the buffer frequently can slow down the program. If the output is not immediately needed to be visible, we can remove these.

2. The variable `b` is not necessary. We can move the code inside the `if (b)` block to right after we set `index1` and `index2`.

3. The `define` at the top for `int` as `long long` can be removed and `long long` can be used directly. `define` can lead to confusion and bugs.

4. Similarly, `inf` is not used at all, it can be removed.

5. Use of `exit(0)` in `check` function. It can be replaced with a return statement and handle the return value in the calling function.

6. Use of `vector<pair<int, int>> v(n, {0, 0});` is not efficient in terms of memory. The pair is not necessary, we can use two separate vectors.

As per your instructions, I kept the modifications to the minimum. Here is the improved code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <fstream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
vector<bool> b;
long long m, p;
long long cnt = 0;
bool check(long long x) {
  cout << x << '\n';
  cin >> x;
  if (x == 0)
    return false;
  return (x == -1) ^ b[(cnt++) % p];
}
int main() {
  cin.tie(0);
  ios::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<long long> x(n, 0), ans(n, 0), v(n, 0), idx(n, 0);
  for (long long i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    cout << "XOR " << 1 << " " << i << "\n";
    cin >> x[i - 1];
    v[i - 1] = x[i - 1];
    idx[i - 1] = i - 1;
  }
  sort(v.begin(), v.end());
  bool found = false;
  long long index1, index2;
  for (long long i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
    if (v[i] == v[i + 1]) {
      found = true;
      index1 = idx[i];
      index2 = idx[i + 1];
      break;
    }
  if (found) {
    cout << "AND " << index1 + 1 << " " << index2 + 1 << "\n";
    long long a;
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] = a ^ x[index1];
    for (long long i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      ans[i] = ans[0] ^ x[i];
    }
  } else {
    cout << "AND " << 1 << " " << idx[1] + 1 << "\n";
    long long a;
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] = a;
    cout << "AND " << 1 << " " << idx[n - 2] + 1 << "\n";
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] |= a;
    for (long long i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      ans[i] = ans[0] ^ x[i];
    }
  }
  cout << "! ";
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << ans[i] << ' ';
  }
}
```

Please note that the optimization effect may not be significant because the original code is already quite optimized. Significant optimization would possibly involve more substantial changes to the logic and algorithms used in the program.
