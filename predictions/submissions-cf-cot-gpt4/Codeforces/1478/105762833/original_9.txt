The program is already optimized in terms of time and memory, but there are some areas where we could make small modifications to further optimize the program.

1. Unnecessary use of the #define directive: The #define directives "forn" and "all" are not necessary and only make the program harder to understand. Using the traditional for loop would increase readability without affecting performance.

2. Use of std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(nullptr): This is used to untie the cin and cout streams and make IO operations faster. However, in this particular code, there are no mixed inputs and outputs, so this might not be necessary.

3. Excessive use of templates: While templates can make your code more flexible, they can also make it harder to read and debug. Particularly, the 'log_c' function is not used anywhere in the code and could be removed.

4. Use of the bits/stdc++.h header: This header includes a lot of unnecessary headers which increase the compilation time. We will include only necessary headers.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;
using pii = pair<int, int>;

void solve() {
  int n, d;
  cin >> n >> d;
  vector<bool> tab(10 * d + d);
  for(int k = 0; k < tab.size(); ++k) { tab[k] = k % 10 == d || (k / 10) == d; }
  for(int k = 0; k < tab.size(); ++k) if (tab[k]) {
    for(int j = 0; j < tab.size(); ++j) if (tab[j]) {
      for(int l = 0; l < tab.size(); ++l) if (k + j * l < tab.size()) { tab[k + j * l] = true; }
    }
  }
  for(int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
    int ak;
    cin >> ak;
    cout << (ak >= tab.size() || tab[ak] ? "YES" : "NO") << "\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  int test_sample_count;
  cin >> test_sample_count;
  while (test_sample_count--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized version of the code, we have removed the unnecessary directives and templates, and we have replaced the bits/stdc++.h header with only the necessary headers. We also replaced the macro 'forn' with traditional for loops for better readability.
