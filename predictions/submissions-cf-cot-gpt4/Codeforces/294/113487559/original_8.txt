The code is already quite optimized. However, there are a few minor improvements that could be made:

1. The use of `std::cin` and `std::cout` can be slower compared to `scanf` and `printf`. If performance is a critical factor, switching to `scanf` and `printf` may give a slight boost.

2. In the power function, the condition `if (x == 0) return 0` is unnecessary. Because if `x` is zero, the while loop won't execute and the function will return `res` which is initialized as 1. So, no need to check `x==0`.

3. The use of `#define` for `fastIO` and `w(t)` is not recommended as it can lead to harder to debug code. Inline functions could be used instead.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define MOD 1000000007
#define M 1001
#define fastIO ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);
using namespace std;

int dx[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
int dy[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
ll a[M], pows[M], c[M][M];

ll power(ll x, ll y) {
  ll res = 1;
  x = x % MOD;
  while (y > 0) {
    if (y % 2 == 1) {
      res = (res * x) % MOD;
    }
    y /= 2;
    x = (x * x) % MOD;
  }
  return res;
}

int main() {
  fastIO;
  pows[0] = 1;
  pows[1] = 1;
  for (ll i = 2; i <= 1000; i++) {
    pows[i] = (pows[i - 1] * 2) % MOD;
  }
  c[0][0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
    c[i][0] = 1;
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
      c[i][j] = (c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD;
    }
  }
  {
    ll m, n;
    scanf("%lld %lld", &n, &m);
    for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      scanf("%lld", &a[i]);
    }
    sort(a + 1, a + m + 1);
    ll sum = 1;
    ll d = n - m;
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
      sum = (sum * c[d][a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1]) % MOD;
      d -= a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i <= m; i++) {
      sum = (sum * pows[a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1]) % MOD;
    }
    printf("%lld\n", sum);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations are very minor and the overall performance gain would be very minimal.
