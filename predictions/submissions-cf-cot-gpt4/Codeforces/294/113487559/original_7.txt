The given C/C++ program is already optimized in terms of its algorithm. The calculations for power and combination are done using modular arithmetic to prevent overflow and are stored in an array for fast access, which is a common method for dynamic programming. The given array is also sorted, which is necessary for the calculations. However, there are a few areas of the code that can be improved for better performance and code quality.

1. The main function is too large and does several things. To improve code readability and maintainability, it can be split into smaller functions. For instance, the initialization of `pows` and `c` can be moved to separate functions.

2. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a non-standard header file and it includes many unnecessary standard libraries, which might increase the compile time. It's better to include only the libraries that are actually used in the program.

3. Using `#define` for constants is not recommended in C++, as constants declared with `const` or `constexpr` are type safe and can be better optimized by the compiler. 

4. `fastIO` is a macro that sets some flags for faster I/O. Its name does not follow the naming conventions for macros. Macros should be named with all uppercase letters.

5. The `using namespace std;` statement is generally considered bad practice because it can lead to name conflicts if the program is expanded or combined with other code. You should use the `std::` prefix where necessary.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

const long long MOD = 1000000007;
const int M = 1001;

long long a[M], pows[M], c[M][M];

long long power(long long x, long long y) {
  long long res = 1;
  x = x % MOD;
  if (x == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  while (y > 0) {
    if (y % 2 == 1) {
      res = (res * x) % MOD;
    }
    y /= 2;
    x = (x * x) % MOD;
  }
  return res;
}

void initializePows() {
  pows[0] = 1;
  pows[1] = 1;
  for (long long i = 2; i <= 1000; i++) {
    pows[i] = (pows[i - 1] * 2) % MOD;
  }
}

void initializeC() {
  c[0][0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
    c[i][0] = 1;
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
      c[i][j] = (c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  
  initializePows();
  initializeC();
  
  long long m, n;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  std::sort(a + 1, a + m + 1);
  long long sum = 1;
  long long d = n - m;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    sum = (sum * c[d][a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1]) % MOD;
    d -= a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1;
  }
  for (int i = 2; i <= m; i++) {
    sum = (sum * pows[a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1]) % MOD;
  }
  
  std::cout << sum << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code has better code quality while still maintaining its performance.
