The given C++ program doesn't have any explicit inefficiencies that would cause a significant slow-down or excess memory usage. However, there are several minor improvements that can be made to further optimize the code. 

1. Avoid Using Bits/stdc++.h: The header file bits/stdc++.h is not a standard library and it includes quite a lot of files which can slow down the compilation process. Therefore, it is better to include only those libraries that are needed.

2. Avoid Using #define: It's better to use constant variables instead of defining macros for constants if you're using C++. This is because macros are processed by preprocessor, and don't have any scope, which can lead to unexpected results.

3. Avoid Global Variables: In C++, it's better to avoid global variables when possible. They can make the program harder to understand and debug because they can be changed by any part of the program.

4. Use std::array or std::vector Instead of C-style Arrays: std::array and std::vector are safer and more convenient.

Here's the optimized version of the program, with the changes explained above:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<algorithm>
#include<array>

const long long MOD = 1000000007;
const int M = 1001;

using namespace std;

array<long long, M> a, pows;
array<array<long long, M>, M> c;

long long power(long long x, long long y) {
  long long res = 1;
  x = x % MOD;
  if (x == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  while (y > 0) {
    if (y % 2 == 1) {
      res = (res * x) % MOD;
    }
    y /= 2;
    x = (x * x) % MOD;
  }
  return res;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  pows[0] = 1;
  pows[1] = 1;
  for (long long i = 2; i <= 1000; i++) {
    pows[i] = (pows[i - 1] * 2) % MOD;
  }
  c[0][0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
    c[i][0] = 1;
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
      c[i][j] = (c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD;
    }
  }
  long long m, n;
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  sort(a.begin() + 1, a.begin() + m + 1);
  long long sum = 1;
  long long d = n - m;
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    sum = (sum * c[d][a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1]) % MOD;
    d -= a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1;
  }
  for (int i = 2; i <= m; i++) {
    sum = (sum * pows[a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1]) % MOD;
  }
  cout << sum << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```
Remember that these optimizations are quite minor and might not lead to noticeable performance improvements. If the program is still slow, the issue might be with the algorithmic complexity of the code, not the specific language features used.
