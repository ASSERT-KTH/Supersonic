The given C/C++ program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Avoiding unnecessary computation: The program contains a power function which is used to calculate powers of a number. This can be replaced with bit manipulation for powers of 2. In terms of running time, bit manipulation is faster than multiplication or division.

2. Removing unnecessary macros: The `fastIO` and `w(t)` macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Optimizing array access: Local variables can be used to store the frequently accessed array elements, reducing the total number of array accesses. This can help improve cache efficiency, as accessing memory is slower than accessing CPU registers.

4. Optimizing the sums: The sums can be calculated only once at the end, instead of at every iteration of the loop.

Here's the optimized version of the given program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define MOD 1000000007
#define M 1001
using namespace std;

int dx[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
int dy[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
ll a[M], pows[M], c[M][M];

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  pows[0] = 1;
  pows[1] = 1;
  for (ll i = 2; i <= 1000; i++) {
    pows[i] = (pows[i - 1] << 1) % MOD; // using bit manipulation
  }

  c[0][0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
    c[i][0] = 1;
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
      c[i][j] = (c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD;
    }
  }

  ll m, n;
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }

  sort(a + 1, a + m + 1);

  ll sum = 1, d = n - m, temp;
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    temp = a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1;
    sum = (sum * c[d][temp]) % MOD;
    d -= temp;
  }

  for (int i = 2; i <= m; i++) {
    temp = a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1;
    sum = (sum * pows[temp]) % MOD;
  }

  cout << sum << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The provided C/C++ code seems to be part of a solution for a competitive programming problem, which deals with modular arithmetic and combinatorics. The optimization suggestions provided above are under the assumption that the logic of the program is correct and only the performance needs to be improved.
