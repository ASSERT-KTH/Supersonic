This program is already quite optimized, but there are a few minor adjustments that could be made:

1. The power function can be optimized using built-in power function with modulus in C++. This built-in function is faster and more optimized than the custom function written here.

2. The two for loops in the main function use 'int' as the iterator. Since 'm' is of type 'll' (long long), it's better to use the same type for the loop iterator to avoid potential type conversion overhead.

3. The input and output operations (cin, cout) can be optimized by disabling synchronization with the C standard library. This makes cin and cout faster, though it should only be used when cin and cout are exclusively used for I/O.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define MOD 1000000007
#define M 1001
#define fastIO std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(NULL); std::cout.tie(NULL);
using namespace std;
ll a[M], pows[M], c[M][M];

int main() {
  fastIO;
  pows[0] = 1;
  pows[1] = 1;
  for (ll i = 2; i <= 1000; i++) {
    pows[i] = (pows[i - 1] * 2) % MOD;
  }
  c[0][0] = 1;
  for (ll i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
    c[i][0] = 1;
    for (ll j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
      c[i][j] = (c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD;
    }
  }
  {
    ll m, n;
    cin >> n >> m;
    for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
    }
    sort(a + 1, a + m + 1);
    ll sum = 1;
    ll d = n - m;
    for (ll i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
      sum = (sum * c[d][a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1]) % MOD;
      d -= a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1;
    }
    for (ll i = 2; i <= m; i++) {
      sum = (sum * pows[a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1]) % MOD;
    }
    cout << sum << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
