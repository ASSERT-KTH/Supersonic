Optimization Steps:

1. The macro "fastIO" is used to speed up input/output operations by not syncing the C++'s standard streams with the standard C streams, and by untying cin from cout (which means that cin does not need to flush cout before every I/O operation). However, this can lead to unexpected results when mixing C and C++ style I/O or when using multi-threading, so it's generally considered better practice to explicitly call "ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)" and "cin.tie(NULL)" when needed, rather than using a macro.

2. The array 'a' is unnecessarily large, being always sized to 1001 regardless of the value of 'n'. This causes unnecessary memory use. We can declare it dynamically after reading the value of 'n' to save memory.

3. The 'pows' array is filled with powers of 2 modulo MOD. This can be done more efficiently using bitwise shift. Shifting a number to the left by 1 bit is equivalent to multiplying it by 2.

4. The 'c' array is filled with binomial coefficients modulo MOD. The binomial coefficient C(n, k) is equal to C(n, k-1) * (n-k+1) / k, which can be computed in a more memory efficient way using a single variable for the current coefficient, and updating it in each step.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define MOD 1000000007
#define M 1001
using namespace std;
int dx[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
int dy[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
ll pows[M], c[M][M];

ll power(ll x, ll y) {
  ll res = 1;
  x = x % MOD;
  if (x == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  while (y > 0) {
    if (y & 1) {
      res = (res * x) % MOD;
    }
    y >>= 1;
    x = (x * x) % MOD;
  }
  return res;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  pows[0] = pows[1] = 1;
  for (ll i = 2; i <= 1000; i++) {
    pows[i] = (pows[i - 1] << 1) % MOD;
  }
  ll m, n;
  cin >> n >> m;
  ll *a = new ll[n+1];
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  sort(a + 1, a + m + 1);
  ll sum = 1, d = n - m;
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    ll c = 1;
    for (int j = 1; j <= a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1; j++) {
      c = (c * ((d - j + 1) % MOD) / j) % MOD;
    }
    sum = (sum * c) % MOD;
    d -= a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1;
  }
  for (int i = 2; i <= m; i++) {
    sum = (sum * pows[a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1]) % MOD;
  }
  cout << sum << "\n";
  delete[] a;
  return 0;
}
```
Note: In the optimized program, the array 'a' is dynamically allocated, so it's important to remember to delete it to avoid memory leaks.
