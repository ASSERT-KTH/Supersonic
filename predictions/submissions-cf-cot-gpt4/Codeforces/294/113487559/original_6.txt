The given code already seems to be well optimized for running time and memory usage as per the constraints provided. However, there are still a few minor optimizations that can be made to improve the code readability and potentially improve performance slightly.

1) Avoid using #define for constants and macros. In C++, it's better to use constant variables and inline functions as they are type safe.

2) Avoid using "bits/stdc++.h" library as it includes all the standard libraries which can increase the compilation time. Include only the necessary libraries.

3) It's unnecessary to use "fastIO" macro. It's better to place it directly in the main function.

4) Use "std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(NULL);" only if you are mixing cin/cout with scanf/printf in your code. If you are only using cin/cout, you don't need to use these.

5) Use prefix increment/decrement operator over postfix wherever possible, as it can be more efficient in some cases.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

const long long MOD = 1000000007;
const int M = 1001;
long long a[M], pows[M], c[M][M];

long long power(long long x, long long y) {
  long long res = 1;
  x = x % MOD;
  if (x == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  while (y > 0) {
    if (y % 2 == 1) {
      res = (res * x) % MOD;
    }
    y /= 2;
    x = (x * x) % MOD;
  }
  return res;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  
  pows[0] = 1;
  pows[1] = 1;
  for (int i = 2; i <= 1000; ++i) {
    pows[i] = (pows[i - 1] * 2) % MOD;
  }
  c[0][0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; ++i) {
    c[i][0] = 1;
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; ++j) {
      c[i][j] = (c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD;
    }
  }

  long long m, n;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }
  std::sort(a + 1, a + m + 1);
  long long sum = 1;
  long long d = n - m;
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
    sum = (sum * c[d][a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1]) % MOD;
    d -= a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1;
  }
  for (int i = 2; i <= m; ++i) {
    sum = (sum * pows[a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1]) % MOD;
  }
  std::cout << sum << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```
