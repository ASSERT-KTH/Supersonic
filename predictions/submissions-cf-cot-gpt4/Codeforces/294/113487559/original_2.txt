This program is fairly optimized but there are few small changes can be made to further optimize the program:

1) Calculation of `pows` array: `pows` array is being calculated for 1000 elements irrespective of the input, which is inefficient when only a small number of elements are needed. Hence, we should calculate `pows` array dynamically based on the input.

2) Calculation of `c` array: Similar to the `pows` array, `c` array is also being calculated irrespective of the input. This should also be done dynamically based on the input.

3) Avoiding redundant calculations: We are calculating `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1` multiple times. We can store this in a variable and reuse it, avoiding redundant calculations.

4) Unnecessary usage of `fastIO`: This macro is used to speed up input/output operations, but in this case, the number of such operations is quite small, so this macro might actually slow down the program due to overhead costs. It can be removed.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define MOD 1000000007
#define M 1001
using namespace std;

ll a[M], pows[M], c[M][M];

ll power(ll x, ll y) {
  ll res = 1;
  x = x % MOD;
  if (x == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  while (y > 0) {
    if (y % 2 == 1) {
      res = (res * x) % MOD;
    }
    y /= 2;
    x = (x * x) % MOD;
  }
  return res;
}

int main() {
  ll m, n;
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  sort(a + 1, a + m + 1);
  
  pows[0] = 1;
  pows[1] = 1;
  for (ll i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    pows[i] = (pows[i - 1] * 2) % MOD;
  }
  
  c[0][0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    c[i][0] = 1;
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
      c[i][j] = (c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD;
    }
  }
  
  ll sum = 1;
  ll d = n - m;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    ll diff = a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1;
    sum = (sum * c[d][diff]) % MOD;
    d -= diff;
  }
  
  for (int i = 2; i <= m; i++) {
    ll diff = a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1;
    sum = (sum * pows[diff]) % MOD;
  }
  
  cout << sum << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}
