Before we start optimizing, it's important to note that the given code is already optimized with GCC compiler optimization flags. However, it can still be optimized in terms of memory and running time. Here are the optimizations we can apply:

1. **Avoid Global Variables:** The program uses a lot of global variables, which can lead to increased memory usage and potential problems with thread safety in a multi-threaded environment. We can minimize the use of global variables by passing them as parameters or encapsulating them inside classes or structures.

2. **Avoid Unnecessary Calculations:** We can see some calculations like `MST.insert({1, v})` and `dsu.merge(dsu.find(1), dsu.find(v))` are repeated multiple times. We can avoid these by storing the result in a variable and using it later.

3. **Avoid Unnecessary Memory Allocations:** The vector `edge` is used only for storing pairs of integers, which are later used in a for loop to perform some operations, and then it is not used anymore. We can avoid this by performing the operations directly inside the while loop where the pairs are generated.

4. **Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`:** These two lines of code make the program faster by untieing `cin` from `cout` and turning off synchronization with the C standard IO. 

The optimized version of the program would look something like this:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <cassert>
#include <chrono>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <random>
#include <set>
#include <stack>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
//...rest of the code is the same until Ares_KN() function...
int Ares_KN() {
  //...code is the same until while loop...
  while (m--) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    //...perform operations here directly...
  }
  //...rest of the code is the same until the end of the function...
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  Ares_KN();
  cerr << "\nTime elapsed: " << 1000 * clock() / CLOCKS_PER_SEC << "ms\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these are few optimizations that can be done without altering the logic of the program. The actual running time and memory usage of the program would depend on the specific inputs and the environment in which the program is run.
