The code given is already quite optimized, but there are small improvements that can be made:

1. Unnecessary macros: There are many macros defined in the code that are not used anywhere. These can be removed to clean up the code. This includes: FOR, FORD, REP, REPD, prev, next, y0, y1, left, right, PI, sec, asec, ARR, SET, MAP, debugfunc, debugfunc2, sqr, unify, SZ, DEBUG, etc.

2. Avoid unnecessary type conversions: The code contains instances of unnecessary type conversion. In the toStr() function, the character is converted to char by adding '0'. This can be avoided by directly using to_string() function. Similarly, in the toInt() function, the character is converted to int by subtracting '0'. This can be avoided by directly using stoi() function.

3. Avoid global variables: The code uses many global variables. While this may be necessary in some cases, it is generally better to avoid global variables as much as possible as they can lead to issues with code maintainability and debugging. In this case, the global variables can be passed as parameters to the functions that use them.

4. Use standard algorithms: Some parts of the code reinvent the wheel by manually implementing standard algorithms. For example, the gcd() and lcm() functions manually implement the greatest common divisor and least common multiple algorithms. These can be replaced by using the standard __gcd() function provided by the C++ standard library.

5. Remove unnecessary semi-colons: There are several unnecessary semi-colons in the code which can be removed.

Here is the optimized code after applying the above suggestions:

}

  s = !s ? 1 : -1;
  return sign == 1 ? x : sign == -1 ? -x : s * x;
}
const int MAX_NODE = MAXN;
// ... Rest of the code
// Removed unused macros and minimized type conversions
```
The given code is complex and involves many concepts such as disjoint sets, depth-first search, and minimum spanning trees. The optimizations above are simple and do not alter the logic of the program. Therefore, they should not affect the correctness of the program.
