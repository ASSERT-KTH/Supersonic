This C++ program reads in a number `n` and a series of `n` numbers from the user, adds a large number to the end of the list, sorts the list, and then calculates the maximum count of numbers that are within 5 of the previous number.

The key point to optimize here is to reduce the use of dynamic memory allocation and to make the computation more efficient. 

Here is the step-by-step optimization:

1. Use `std::vector` instead of dynamic array: In C++, dynamic arrays (like `ull a[n + 1];`) are not recommended because they are not safe. Also, they can lead to memory leaks if not handled properly. Instead, we should use `std::vector` which is safer and more flexible.

2. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` to speed up I/O operations: This line will disable the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. It can make I/O operations faster, but it may cause problems if you mix C and C++ style I/O in the same program. In this case, we are only using C++ style I/O, so it is safe to use.

3. Avoid using `pow` for a constant value: `pow(10, 9) + 10` is a constant value. We can replace it with its result to avoid unnecessary computations.

4. Use prefix increment instead of postfix where applicable: In some cases, prefix increment (`++i`) is more efficient than postfix (`i++`) because postfix need to create a copy of the original value.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
using ull = unsigned long long;

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  ull n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ull> a(n + 1);
  for (ull i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  a[n] = 1000000010ULL; // 10^9 + 10
  std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  ull last = 0;
  ull max_count = 1;
  for (ull i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
    if (a[i] - a[last] > 5) {
      max_count = std::max(max_count, i - last);
      ++last;
    }
  }
  cout << max_count << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Note: If the value of `n` can be very large, it's better to use `std::vector` with a suitable data type to avoid overflow and ensure enough memory space.
