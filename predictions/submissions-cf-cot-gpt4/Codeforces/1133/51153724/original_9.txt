This program can be optimized in several ways:

1. Use of vectors instead of arrays: Vectors in C++ are more flexible than arrays. They can be resized dynamically and provide several functions to handle the data efficiently.

2. No need to initialize the extra element in the array. Instead, we can directly push the extra element into the vector after taking the input.

3. The usage of pow(10,9) + 10 is inefficient and could potentially cause overflow issues. It's better to use a constant value.

4. Use of 'auto' keyword: It is a good practice to use the 'auto' keyword in C++ for loop iteration. This is because it automatically deduces the type of the variable from the context.

5. Use of 'emplace_back' instead of 'push_back': 'emplace_back' constructs the object in-place and avoids the extra copy operation that 'push_back' does.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
using ull = unsigned long long;
const ull max_value = 1000000010;
int main() {
  ull n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ull> a;
  a.reserve(n+1);
  for (ull i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    ull temp;
    cin >> temp;
    a.emplace_back(temp);
  }
  a.emplace_back(max_value);
  std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  ull last = 0;
  ull max_count = 1;
  for (auto i = 0; i < n + 1; ++i) {
    if (a[i] - a[last] > 5) {
      max_count = std::max(max_count, i - last);
      last += 1;
    }
  }
  std::cout << max_count << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
