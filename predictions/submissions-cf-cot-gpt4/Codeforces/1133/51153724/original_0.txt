This program reads a list of integers from the user, sorts them, and then finds the longest subsequence of numbers such that the difference between the smallest and largest number in the subsequence is not more than 5. It then prints out the length of this longest subsequence.

Let's start with optimizing the program for running time and memory usage.

The first thing to note is that this program is using a Variable Length Array (VLA) to store the input numbers. While VLAs can be handy, they are not a part of the C++ standard and their use is generally discouraged. It's better to use std::vector instead, which is a part of the C++ standard library and provides dynamic arrays with efficient operations.

Next, the 'pow' function is used to calculate a constant value. Calling 'pow' at runtime is unnecessary and inefficient, the constant value can be calculated once and hardcoded.

Lastly, the loop that calculates the longest subsequence can be optimized. When a number is found that is more than 5 greater than the first number in the current subsequence, the program currently only advances the start of the subsequence by one, even though it may need to be advanced by more than one to find a valid subsequence. We can change the 'last += 1' to 'last = i' to fix this.

Now here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
using ull = unsigned long long;

int main() {
  ull n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ull> a(n + 1);
  for (ull i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  a[n] = 1000000010;  // 10^9 + 10
  std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  ull last = 0;
  ull max_count = 1;
  for (ull i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
    if (a[i] - a[last] > 5) {
      max_count = std::max(max_count, i - last);
      last = i;
    }
  }
  std::cout << max_count << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program still accomplishes the same task as the original, but it does so in a way that is more efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage.
