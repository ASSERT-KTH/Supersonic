Step by Step Optimizations:

1. Use `vector` instead of dynamic array: In C++, it is typically safer and more efficient to use a `std::vector` instead of a dynamic array. This is because a vector automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation, whereas with a dynamic array you would need to manually deallocate the memory to avoid a memory leak. Also, dynamic allocation is generally slower than using a vector.

2. Avoid use of `pow`: The `pow` function is slower than direct multiplication or assignment. In this case, `pow(10, 9) + 10` can be replaced with `1e9 + 10`.

3. Avoid repetitive calculations: The condition `a[i] - a[last]` is calculated twice per iteration of the loop. It's better to calculate it once and store it in a temporary variable.

4. Use pre-increment: It's better to use pre-increment instead of post-increment when the old value is not used because post-increment requires a copy of the old value which can be slower.

5. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This can speed up the I/O operations.

6. Use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl`: `std::endl` flushes the output buffer while `'\n'` doesn't. In most cases, flushing the buffer is not necessary and can slow down the output.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
using ull = unsigned long long;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  ull n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ull> a(n + 1);
  for (ull &ai : a) {
    cin >> ai;
  }
  a[n] = 1e9 + 10;
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  ull last = 0;
  ull max_count = 1;
  for (ull i = 0; i < n + 1; ++i) {
    ull diff = a[i] - a[last];
    if (diff > 5) {
      max_count = max(max_count, i - last);
      ++last;
    }
  }
  cout << max_count << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
