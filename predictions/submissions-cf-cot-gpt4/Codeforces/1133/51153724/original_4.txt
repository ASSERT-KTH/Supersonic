Here are some optimization steps:

1. We can replace the array with a vector, which is safer and more flexible. 

2. There is no need to add a large number `pow(10, 9) + 10` to the array before sorting. This requires extra memory and increases the sorting time. 

3. In the last loop, if `a[i] - a[last] > 5`, we can directly assign `last = i` instead of `last += 1`. This is because we are looking for a new gap that is greater than 5.

4. We can use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up the cin and cout. 

5. We donâ€™t actually need to initialize `last = 0;` before the loop as it's initialized in the loop. 

Now let's generate the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
using ull = unsigned long long;
int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  ull n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ull> a(n);
  for (ull &i : a) {
    cin >> i;
  }
  std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  ull max_count = 1;
  for (ull i = 0, last = 0; i < n + 1; ++i) {
    if (a[i] - a[last] > 5) {
      max_count = std::max(max_count, i - last);
      last = i;
    }
  }
  std::cout << max_count << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
In this program, we are using less memory and the program runs faster. We are also using more C++-style code with `std::vector` and range-based for loop.
