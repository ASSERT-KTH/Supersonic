The given C++ program reads an array of unsigned long long integers from the input, sorts it, and then computes the maximum count of numbers that are not more than 5 units apart. 

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Avoid using variable-length arrays: In C++, variable-length arrays are not part of the standard language. They are supported as a compiler extension in some compilers, but using them can lead to non-portable code. Instead, use `std::vector` to have a dynamic array.

2. Avoid using `pow()`: The `pow()` function is computationally expensive. Since we are just using it to assign a large value to `a[n]`, we can assign this value directly.

3. Avoid unnecessary increments: In the for loop, the `last` variable is incremented by one each time a number more than 5 units apart from the last one is found. However, this does not take into account the possibility of having multiple numbers in a row that are more than 5 units apart from the last one. To optimize this, we can set `last` to `i` instead of incrementing it by one.

4. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The `std::max()` function is called in every iteration of the loop, even when `i - last` is not greater than `max_count`. We can avoid this by only calling `std::max()` when `i - last` is greater than `max_count`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
using ull = unsigned long long;
int main() {
  ull n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ull> a(n + 1);
  for (ull i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  a[n] = 1000000010ull;
  std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  ull last = 0;
  ull max_count = 1;
  for (ull i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
    if (a[i] - a[last] > 5) {
      if(i - last > max_count){
        max_count = i - last;
      }
      last = i;
    }
  }
  std::cout << max_count << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
