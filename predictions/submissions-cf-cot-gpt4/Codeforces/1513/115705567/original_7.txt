Before going to the optimizations, let's understand what the code is doing. It is basically pre-calculating some values and storing them in the dp array. Then it's reading a number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates an answer based on the pre-calculated values and the input.

Here are some possible optimizations:

1. We can reduce the size of dp array. The second dimension of dp array is always accessed with index [j-1]. So we only need to keep the current and previous calculations. This will reduce the memory footprint of the program.

2. The inner loop in the dp calculation can be unrolled because there's a condition on the loop variable that splits the loop into two: one for i=0..8 and one for i=9.

3. We can use fast input/output methods to increase the speed of cin and cout.

4. We can reserve memory for the string 's' in advance to avoid dynamic memory allocations during runtime.

Here's the code after applying these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
ll dp[2][10];

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  for (ll i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
    dp[0][i] = 1;
  }

  for (ll j = 1; j <= 200005; j++) {
    for (ll i = 0; i <= 8; i++) {
      dp[j%2][i] = dp[(j-1)%2][i + 1];
    }
    dp[j%2][9] = (dp[(j-1)%2][0] + dp[(j-1)%2][1]) % MOD;
  }

  ll t;
  cin >> t;

  string s;
  s.reserve(200005);

  while (t--) {
    ll m;
    cin >> s >> m;

    ll ans = 0;
    for (ll i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      ans = (ans + dp[m%2][s[i] - '0']) % MOD;
    }

    cout << ans << '\n';
    s.clear();
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This program should run faster and use less memory than the original program.
