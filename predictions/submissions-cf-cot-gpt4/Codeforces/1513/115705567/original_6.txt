Here are some steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` because it includes a lot of unnecessary headers which increase compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary headers.
2. Avoid global variables as much as possible. In this case, `dp` is a global variable. We can declare it inside the `main` function.
3. Initialize `dp` with zero at the time of declaration. Then we can remove the initial loop that sets all `dp[i][0]` to 1, because `dp[i][0]` will be 1 only when `i` is 0, for all other `i`, `dp[i][0]` will be 0.
4. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl` for printing new line. `endl` causes an unnecessary flush of the output buffer which slows down the program.
5. Use prefix sums to optimize the calculation of `dp[i][j] = (dp[0][j - 1] + dp[1][j - 1]) % MOD;` for `i == 9`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;
#define ll long long
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int N = 2 * 1e5 + 10;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  vector<vector<ll>> dp(11, vector<ll>(N, 0));
  dp[0][0] = 1;

  vector<ll> prefix(N);
  prefix[0] = 1;

  for (ll j = 1; j <= 200005; j++) {
    for (ll i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
      if (i != 9) {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1];
      } else {
        dp[i][j] = prefix[j - 1];
      }
      prefix[j] = (prefix[j] + dp[i][j]) % MOD;
    }
  }

  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    string s;
    ll m;
    cin >> s >> m;
    ll ans = 0;
    for (ll i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      ans = (ans + dp[s[i] - '0'][m]) % MOD;
    }
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
Note: The prefix sum optimization is only applicable if it's guaranteed that the sum of dp[0][j - 1] to dp[9][j - 1] can be computed faster than the individual elements. This depends on the specific problem and the constraints. If this is not the case, this optimization should not be used.
