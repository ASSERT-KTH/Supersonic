The optimization steps are as follows:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which increases compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary headers.
2. `ll dp[11][N];` is a large 2D array that is using a lot of memory. Since we only use `dp[i][j]` to compute `dp[i][j+1]`, we can reduce this 2D array to a 1D array.
3. In the nested loop, the outer loop is iterating over `j`. It will be more cache friendly if we iterate over `i` in the outer loop and `j` in the inner loop.
4. `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` are used to make cin and cout faster, but you are not doing heavy IO in this program, so these lines are not necessary. Moreover, they can cause unexpected behavior when mixing cin/cout and scanf/printf. So we can remove these lines.
5. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output buffer.

Below is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

#define ll long long

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int N = 2 * 1e5 + 10;
ll dp[10];

int main() {
  for (ll i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
    dp[i] = 1;
  }
  for (ll j = 1; j <= 200005; j++) {
    ll prev_dp[10];
    for (ll i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
      prev_dp[i] = dp[i];
    }
    for (ll i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
      if (i != 9)
        dp[i] = prev_dp[i + 1];
      else
        dp[i] = (prev_dp[0] + prev_dp[1]) % MOD;
    }
  }
  ll t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    std::string s;
    ll m;
    std::cin >> s >> m;
    ll ans = 0;
    for (ll i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      ans = (ans + dp[s[i] - '0']) % MOD;
    }
    std::cout << ans << '\n';
  }
}
```
