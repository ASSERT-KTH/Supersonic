The original program includes all the headers in the standard library by using "#include <bits/stdc++.h>". This might cause longer compilation time. Besides, the program uses two for loops to fill the dynamic programming (dp) table, which consumes a lot of memory and CPU time. 

Step by step optimization:

1. Include only necessary headers instead of all of them. The headers we need are: iostream, string and vector.

2. The "ll" macro is used for long long int, but it would be clearer and more standard to use "long long" directly.

3. The dp array is declared with a constant size of 2 * 10^5. This array is too large and its size is fixed, which could cause memory waste if the actual data is much less than 2 * 10^5. Moreover, in some cases where the data is more than 2 * 10^5, it could lead to out-of-bounds access. To solve this, we can use a 2D vector to replace the dp array, which can ensure the size of the dp table is flexible according to the actual data.

4. We can calculate 'dp' values only for those that will be used in the calculations. This can be done by limiting the outer loop to 't' and the inner loop to the length of the individual strings.

5. We can combine the two for loops into one to reduce the loop overheads.

6. Use "\n" instead of endl for output, because endl always causes a flush operation, which may affect performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  long long t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    string s;
    long long m;
    cin >> s >> m;
    vector<vector<long long>> dp(10, vector<long long>(m + 1, 0));
    for (long long i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
      dp[i][0] = 1;
    }
    for (long long j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
      for (long long i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
        if (i != 9)
          dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1];
        else
          dp[i][j] = (dp[0][j - 1] + dp[1][j - 1]) % MOD;
      }
    }
    long long ans = 0;
    for (long long i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      ans = (ans + dp[s[i] - '0'][m]) % MOD;
    }
    cout << ans << "\n";
  }
}
```
