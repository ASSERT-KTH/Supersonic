Optimization Steps:

1. Use a fixed size array for dp: The size of dp can be reduced to 10*200005 which will save memory as you are not using the entire 2D array.

2. Avoid multiple calculations: The current program is calculating the same sub-problem multiple times. Use a bottom-up approach to solve the sub-problems once and use the results to solve bigger problems.

3. Use faster I/O: C++ I/O functions (cin and cout) are slower than scanf and printf. Use scanf and printf to get faster I/O.

4. Use bitwise operator for modulus operation: If the modulus value is a power of 2, you can use bitwise operator to get faster performance. In your case, MOD is 1e9 + 7 which is not a power of 2, so this optimization can't be applied.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define ll long long
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int N = 200005;
ll dp[10][N];
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  for (ll i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
    dp[i][0] = 1;
  }
  for (ll j = 1; j < N; j++) {
    for (ll i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
      if (i != 9)
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1];
      else
        dp[i][j] = (dp[0][j - 1] + dp[1][j - 1]) % MOD;
    }
  }
  ll t;
  scanf("%lld", &t);
  while (t--) {
    char s[N];
    ll m;
    scanf("%s %lld", s, &m);
    ll ans = 0;
    for (ll i = 0; s[i]!='\0'; i++) {
      ans = (ans + dp[s[i] - '0'][m]) % MOD;
    }
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: Use of "bits/stdc++.h" and "using namespace std;" are not recommended as they include too many unnecessary libraries and using namespace std can cause naming conflicts.
