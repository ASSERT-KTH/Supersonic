Here are the steps to optimize this program:

1. Don't use `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file includes all standard library headers, which can slow down the compiling process. Instead, include only those headers which are needed in your program.

2. The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);` are used to speed up cin/cout, but in this code, we are not doing a lot of input/output operations. So, we can remove these lines.

3. Pre-calculating the length of the string `s` in a separate variable can save the repeated calls to `s.length()` inside the loop.

4. Instead of declaring the dp array of size 11 x N, we can declare it of size 10 x N, because the index 10 is never used in the dp array.

Here is the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#define ll long long
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int N = 2 * 1e5 + 10;
ll dp[10][N];

int main() {
  for (ll i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
    dp[i][0] = 1;
  }
  for (ll j = 1; j <= 200005; j++) {
    for (ll i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
      if (i != 9)
        dp[i][j] = (dp[i + 1][j - 1]);
      else
        dp[i][j] = (dp[0][j - 1] + dp[1][j - 1]) % MOD;
    }
  }
  ll t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    std::string s;
    ll m;
    std::cin >> s >> m;
    ll ans = 0;
    ll len = s.length();
    for (ll i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      ans = (ans + dp[s[i] - '0'][m]) % MOD;
    }
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  }
}
```
