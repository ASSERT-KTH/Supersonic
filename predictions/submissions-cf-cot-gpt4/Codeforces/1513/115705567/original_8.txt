Before proceeding with the optimization, let's understand the program. The program is a dynamic programming solution for a problem where we have a range of digits [0-9] and for each digit, we calculate the possible number of ways it can be represented using the digits in the range [0-9]. This process continues for each successive digit. In the end, for a given string, we calculate the sum of all possible ways of representing each digit in the string.

Here are some steps for optimization:

1. Pre-computed values: Since the range is fixed for i (0 - 9) and j (0 - 200005), we can pre-compute these values and store them in a table (dp[][]). This would significantly reduce the computation time during runtime.

2. Use of std::vector instead of array: We are using C++ and it's more idiomatic to use std::vector instead of raw arrays. It also has added benefits like automatic management of memory, bounds checking, etc.

3. Optimization of input and output operations: Since we're dealing with a large amount of data, the cin and cout operations can become a bottleneck. To mitigate this, we can disable the synchronization of C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams.

Here's how the optimized code would look like:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int N = 2 * 1e5 + 10;
vector<vector<ll>> dp(10,vector<ll>(N));

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
    cin.tie(NULL); 
    cout.tie(NULL);
    for (ll i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = 1;
    }
    for (ll j = 1; j < N; j++) {
        for (ll i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
            dp[i][j] = (i == 9) ? (dp[0][j - 1] + dp[1][j - 1]) % MOD : dp[i + 1][j - 1];
        }
    }
    ll t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        string s;
        ll m;
        cin >> s >> m;
        ll ans = 0;
        for (char c : s) {
            ans = (ans + dp[c - '0'][m]) % MOD;
        }
        cout << ans << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Note: The `#include<bits/stdc++.h>` is not recommended for production code as it includes all the standard library headers and can increase the compile time significantly. It is generally used in competitive programming for convenience. It is better to include only those headers which are needed.
