This program is already optimized in terms of running time and memory usage. The main part of the program is focused on dynamic programming, which is a commonly used method for optimizing time complexity. The time complexity is basically linear, which is quite efficient in the context of dynamic programming. 

However, there is a small modification that can be done to slightly optimize the memory usage. The dp array currently has an unnecessarily large size (11xN), where N is 2 * 1e5 + 10. Since the first dimension of the array only ranges from 0 to 9, we can limit the size of the first dimension to 10.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int N = 2 * 1e5 + 10;
ll dp[10][N];
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  for (ll i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
    dp[i][0] = 1;
  }
  for (ll j = 1; j <= 200005; j++) {
    for (ll i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
      if (i != 9)
        dp[i][j] = (dp[i + 1][j - 1]);
      else
        dp[i][j] = (dp[0][j - 1] + dp[1][j - 1]) % MOD;
    }
  }
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    string s;
    ll m;
    cin >> s >> m;
    ll ans = 0;
    for (ll i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      ans = (ans + dp[s[i] - '0'][m]) % MOD;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

Please note that this small change may not have a significant impact on the overall performance of the program, but it slightly optimizes the memory usage.
