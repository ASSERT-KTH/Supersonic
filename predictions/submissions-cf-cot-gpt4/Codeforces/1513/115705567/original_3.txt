The program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which slows down the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary libraries such as `#include <iostream>` and `#include <string>`.

2. Use `constexpr` for `MOD` and `N`: This informs the compiler that the value of MOD and N will not change after compilation, which can help the compiler optimize the program.

3. Optimize I/O operations: The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output, which are slower than printf and scanf. In a competitive programming scenario, the time saved by using faster I/O can be crucial.

4. Reduce the size of the dp array: The dp array is declared of size [11][N], but the program only uses dp[i][j] where i is from 0 to 9. So, reducing the size of the first dimension to 10 can save memory.

5. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`: `endl` causes a flush operation, which can be slower than simply printing a newline character.

The optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
constexpr int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
constexpr int N = 2 * 1e5 + 10;
ll dp[10][N];

int main() {
  for (ll i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
    dp[i][0] = 1;
  }
  for (ll j = 1; j <= 200005; j++) {
    for (ll i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
      if (i != 9)
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1];
      else
        dp[i][j] = (dp[0][j - 1] + dp[1][j - 1]) % MOD;
    }
  }
  ll t;
  scanf("%lld", &t);
  while (t--) {
    string s;
    ll m;
    cin >> s >> m;
    ll ans = 0;
    for (ll i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      ans = (ans + dp[s[i] - '0'][m]) % MOD;
    }
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
  }
}
```

Note: In some cases, the I/O optimizations might not have a noticeable impact on the performance, so the decision of using them depends on the specific requirements and constraints.
