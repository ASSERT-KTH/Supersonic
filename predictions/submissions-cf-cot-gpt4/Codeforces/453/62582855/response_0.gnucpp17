This program appears to be an implementation of a dynamic programming problem, likely from a competitive programming contest. The optimization here is not straightforward due to the complexity of the program. Here are some general steps to optimize a program:

1. Use Fast I/O: The first optimization that can be done is to use fast I/O. The program already uses `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);` to boost C++ I/O speed.

2. Avoid Unnecessary Copying of Data: Avoid copying large amounts of data, pass them by reference instead. The program already does this with the use of `auto&` in range-based for loops.

3. Minimize Memory Usage: The program already does this by only storing the minimum necessary information in memory. The dynamic programming state, `dp`, only stores the minimum cost to get to that state and the value that was used to reach it.

4. Avoid Recalculating Results: The program already does this by using dynamic programming to store intermediate results and avoid recalculating them.

5. Use Efficient Data Structures: The program uses vectors and pairs, which are efficient for this particular problem.

6. Use Built-in Functions and Libraries: The program uses `std::min_element` from the STL, which is optimized for performance.

Here's a minor optimization that can be done:

1. Avoid Using `std::endl`: Replace `cout << endl;` with `cout << '\n';` because `std::endl` causes an unnecessary flush of the output stream. However, in this program it seems `ps()` is used instead of `std::endl`.
