The given code is quite complex and already well optimized, but there are few areas we could consider for optimization. 

1. **Avoiding unnecessary calculations**: The 'mask' vector's purpose is to keep track of the prime factors of numbers. It's recalculated for every number from 1 to MAXV in the loop. But since we know the prime factors of a number will not change, we can calculate this once at the beginning of the program and reuse it. This could save computational time. 

2. **Reserving memory space in vectors**: Reserving memory space for vectors with known size in advance can save memory reallocation time. In this program, the sizes of vectors 'a', 'b', 'pri', and 'mask' are known in advance.

3. **Avoiding expensive operations**: The min_element function is used to find the minimal element in the dp.back() vector. This is a costly operation. In the given context, we can replace it with a loop which tracks the minimum value and its index. This can save time.

Let's make these optimizations in the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout << fixed << setprecision(15);

  const int MAXV = 61;
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  
  vector<int> a(N);
  for(int i=0; i<N; ++i) cin >> a[i];

  vector<int> pri;
  pri.reserve(MAXV);
  for(int v=2; v<MAXV; ++v) {
    bool ok = true;
    for(auto p: pri) if(v%p == 0) ok = false;
    if(ok) pri.push_back(v);
  }
  
  vector<int> mask(MAXV);
  for(int v=1; v<MAXV; ++v) 
    for(int i=0; i<pri.size(); ++i) 
      if(v%pri[i] == 0) mask[v] |= 1<<i;
  
  vector<vector<pair<int,int>>> dp(N+1, vector<pair<int,int>>(1<<pri.size(), {INT_MAX, -1}));
  dp[0][0].f = -1;

  for(int i=0; i<N; ++i) 
    for(int m=0; m<(1<<pri.size()); ++m) 
      if(dp[i][m].f < INT_MAX) 
        for(int v=1; v<MAXV; ++v) 
          if(!(mask[v] & m)) 
            dp[i+1][m^mask[v]] = min(dp[i+1][m^mask[v]], make_pair(dp[i][m].f + abs(v - a[i]), v));
  
  vector<int> b(N);
  b.reserve(N);
  int m = 0, min_val = INT_MAX;
  for(int i=0; i<dp.back().size(); ++i)
    if(dp.back()[i].f < min_val) min_val = dp.back()[i].f, m = i;
  for(int i=N-1; i>=0; --i) {
    b[i] = dp[i+1][m].s;
    m ^= mask[b[i]];
  }
  for(auto val: b) cout << val << " ";
  cout << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```
Note: The code optimization not only depends on the code itself but also on the compiler, the architecture, and the specific machine. This optimized code aims for general improvements but might not always result in the best possible optimization.
