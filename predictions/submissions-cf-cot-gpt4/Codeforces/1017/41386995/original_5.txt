This program appears to be quite complex and already quite optimized, but there are still some improvements that we can make to its performance.

1. **Avoid unnecessary type casting:** In the code, there are a few places where numbers are cast to `(ll)` or `(unsigned int)`. If the numbers already meet these types, then these type casts are unnecessary and can be removed. This can avoid temporary variable creation and save computation time.

2. **Optimize the function `f(unsigned int x)`:** The function `f(unsigned int x)` calculates a cubic polynomial, which can be optimized by using Horner's method to reduce the number of multiplications.

3. **Avoid repeated calculations:** In the two for loops, the condition `(!(p[(x = qwq(i)) >> 5] & ((unsigned int)1 << (x & xx))))` is repeated. We can calculate it once and store it in a variable to avoid repeated calculations.

4. **Reduce function call overhead:** The function `read()` is called multiple times to read input. We can use a more efficient input method to reduce function call overhead and improve the program's speed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;

unsigned int n, A, B, C, D;
unsigned int ans;
unsigned int p[2500000 + 2];
unsigned int P[1992], l;

inline unsigned int f(unsigned int x) {
  return (((A * x + B) * x + C) * x + D);
}

unsigned int qwq(int x) {
  return (unsigned int)(x - x / 2 - x / 3 - x / 5 + x / 6 + x / 10 + x / 15 -
                        x / 30);
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  ans = 0;
  unsigned int i, j, x, F1;
  bool flag = false;
  cin >> n >> A >> B >> C >> D;
  int xx = (1 << 6) - 1;
  for (i = 2; i * 2 <= n; i++) {
    bool condition = (i & 1) && i % 3 != 0 && i % 5 != 0 && !(p[(x = qwq(i)) >> 5] & ((unsigned int)1 << (x & xx)));
    if (i == 2 || i == 3 || i == 5 || condition) {
      if (!flag) {
        ++l;
        P[l] = i;
      }
      j = i;
      F1 = f(i);
      while (j <= n) {
        ans += (n / j) * F1;
        if (j * (ll)i > n)
          break;
        j *= i;
      }
    }
    if (P[l] * (ll)i > n) {
      flag = true;
    }
    while (P[l] * (ll)i > n)
      l--;
    for (j = 1; j <= l && P[j] * (ll)i <= n; j++) {
      x = P[j] * i;
      if ((x & 1) && x % 3 != 0 && x % 5 != 0) {
        x = qwq(x);
        p[x >> 5] |= (unsigned int)1 << (x & xx);
      }
      if (i % P[j] == 0)
        break;
    }
  }
  for (; i <= n; i++) {
    bool condition = (i & 1) && i % 3 != 0 && i % 5 != 0 && !(p[(x = qwq(i)) >> 5] & ((unsigned int)1 << (x & xx)));
    if (i == 2 || i == 3 || i == 5 || condition) {
      j = i;
      F1 = f(i);
      while (j <= n) {
        ans += (n / j) * F1;
        if (j * (ll)i > n)
          break;
        j *= i;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}

Please note that optimization can be very contextual and what works well in one scenario may not work in another. The above suggestions are general points which usually help to optimize a program. There might be other specific ways to optimize this program depending upon the input data and the exact requirements.
