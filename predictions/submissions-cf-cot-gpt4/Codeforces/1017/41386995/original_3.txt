This code seems to be already optimized for a specific problem statement. It is using bitwise operations, dynamic programming and the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. But there are small improvements that we can make:

1. Instead of using `std::cout`, we can use `printf` function. `printf` is faster than `std::cout` in C++ as `std::cout` involves overhead due to OOPs.

2. The formula `f(x)` is called multiple times with the same `x` and it seems from the code that `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` are constants. Hence, we can use a map to store the values of `f(x)` to avoid redundant calculations.

3. The value of `f(i)` is calculated multiple times in a loop. It would be more efficient to calculate it once and store it in a variable.

4. `bits/stdc++.h` is a header file in GCC, but it is not a standard library and is quite large. It would be more efficient to only include the libraries that are needed.

5. In `qwq` function, to avoid the floating-point division and multiplication, we can use bitwise shift operators. For example, `x/2` can be replaced with `x>>1`, `x/3` with `x/3` and so on. Note that this is an approximate optimization and may not always provide accurate results.

6. In the `main` function, the same block of code is repeated twice. This is not efficient and can be put in a function and called.

The optimized code would look like this:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <map>
#define ll long long

inline ll read() {
  char s;
  ll k = 0, base = 1;
  while ((s = getchar()) != '-' && s != EOF && !(isdigit(s)))
    ;
  if (s == EOF)
    exit(0);
  if (s == '-')
    base = -1, s = getchar();
  while (isdigit(s)) {
    k = k * 10 + (s ^ '0');
    s = getchar();
  }
  return k * base;
}

std::map<int, unsigned int> f_values;

unsigned int f(unsigned int x) {
  if (f_values.count(x))
    return f_values[x];
  else {
    unsigned int val = A * x * x * x + B * x * x + C * x + D;
    f_values[x] = val;
    return val;
  }
}

unsigned int qwq(int x) {
  return (unsigned int)(x - (x >> 1) - (x / 3) - (x / 5) + (x / 6) + (x / 10) + (x / 15) - (x / 30));
}

void calculate_ans(unsigned int i, unsigned int &ans, unsigned int n) {
  unsigned int j = i;
  unsigned int F1 = f(i);
  while (j <= n) {
    ans += (n / j) * F1;
    if ((ll)j * i > n)
      break;
    j *= i;
  }
}

int main() {
  unsigned int ans = 0;
  unsigned int i, j, x, F1;
  bool flag = false;
  unsigned int n = read();
  unsigned int A = read(), B = read(), C = read(), D = read();
  int xx = (1 << 6) - 1;
  for (i = 2; i * 2 <= n; i++) {
    if (i == 2 || i == 3 || i == 5 ||
        ((i & 1) && i % 3 != 0 && i % 5 != 0 &&
         !(p[(x = qwq(i)) >> 5] & ((unsigned int)1 << (x & xx))))) {
      if (!flag) {
        ++l;
        P[l] = i;
      }
      calculate_ans(i, ans, n);
    }
    // rest of the code
  }
  for (; i <= n; i++) {
    if (i == 2 || i == 3 || i == 5 ||
        ((i & 1) && i % 3 != 0 && i % 5 != 0 &&
         !(p[(x = qwq(i)) >> 5] & ((unsigned int)1 << (x & xx))))) {
      calculate_ans(i, ans, n);
    }
  }
  printf("%u", ans);
  return 0;
}
```
