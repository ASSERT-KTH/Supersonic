This program seems to be a number theory related problem solver that performs mathematical operations on numbers up to 'n'. Let's go step-by-step to understand and optimize the code.

1. The first optimization we can make is to avoid using `<bits/stdc++.h>`. It's not a standard library and includes a lot of unnecessary headers which increase the compilation time.

2. The function `read()` seems to parse a long long int from the standard input. It's better to use `std::cin` with `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(NULL);` to speed up the input process.

3. The `qwq` function could be optimized by precomputing the values instead of computing them on each call.

4. The bitwise operations and manipulations make the code harder to read and debug. It seems that these operations are used to keep track of prime numbers. We can use a `std::vector<bool>` to keep track of the primes up to `n`.

5. The code has lots of repeated pieces which can be extracted into a separate function.

6. The condition `if (i == 2 || i == 3 || i == 5 || ((i & 1) && i % 3 != 0 && i % 5 != 0 && !(p[(x = qwq(i)) >> 5] & ((unsigned int)1 << (x & xx)))))` is repeated twice, it can be extracted into a function.

7. Multiplication by powers of 2 can be replaced with left shift operations which are faster.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

#define ll long long

using namespace std;

unsigned int n, A, B, C, D;
unsigned int ans;
unsigned int F;
vector<bool> primes;

unsigned int f(unsigned int x) {
  return A * x * x * x + B * x * x + C * x + D;
}

bool isPrime(unsigned int x) {
  if (x == 2 || x == 3 || x == 5)
    return true;
  if ((x & 1) && x % 3 != 0 && x % 5 != 0)
    return !primes[x];
  return false;
}

void process(unsigned int i) {
  unsigned int j = i;
  unsigned int F1 = f(i);
  while (j <= n) {
    ans += (n / j) * F1;
    if ((ll)j * i > n)
      break;
    j *= i;
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  cin >> n >> A >> B >> C >> D;

  primes.resize(n + 1, true);
  primes[0] = primes[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++)
    if (primes[i])
      for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i)
        primes[j] = false;

  for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
    if (isPrime(i))
      process(i);
  
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
In this version, the `isPrime` function checks if a number is prime by directly accessing the `primes` vector. The `process` function includes the repeated piece of code from the original program. The prime numbers up to `n` are precalculated at the beginning of the main function.
