There are several ways we can optimize this program:

1. **Avoid repeatedly including headers:** The first line of the program `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a header file that includes most of the standard library headers. This is generally not recommended in production code, as it increases compilation time and is not portable across different compilers. Instead, we should only include the headers that are actually needed by the program.

2. **Avoid using namespace std:** It's generally considered bad practice to have `using namespace std;` at the top of your program, because it can lead to name clashes if your program has a function or variable with the same name as a standard library function or variable.

3. **Avoid complex macros:** Macros like `bug` and `_print` are making the program unnecessarily complex. They are not used in the code and should be removed.

4. **Simplify the `g` function:** The `g` function is intended to calculate the number of digits in a number, but the current implementation is complex and inefficient. It can be simplified by converting the integer to a string and returning its length.

5. **Avoid unnecessary calculations in `solve` function:** In the `solve` function, we are calculating `g(x)` in every iteration of the loop. This is not necessary and can be avoided by calculating it once and storing the result in a variable.

6. **Avoid unnecessary variables:** Variables like `ans1` and `ans2` are not necessary and can be eliminated.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

int g(int n) {
  return std::to_string(n).length();
}

void solve() {
  int a, b, c;
  std::cin >> a >> b >> c;
  int x = 1;
  int g_x = g(x);
  while (g_x != c) {
    x *= 2;
    g_x = g(x);
  }
  int i = x;
  int j = x;
  while (g(i) != a) {
    i *= 2;
  }
  while (g(j) != b) {
    j *= 5;
  }
  std::cout << i << " " << j << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program should run faster and use less memory than the original version.
