The optimization in this case is not a direct one. There are a few things that can be done to make the code more efficient. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`**: This header file includes quite a lot of files, which can slow down the compilation process. Include only the necessary libraries.

2. **Avoid `using namespace std;`**: This can lead to name clashes. It's better to use the `std::` prefix when necessary.

3. **Remove unused macros**: This program has a lot of macros that are not used, removing them will make the code cleaner and slightly faster.

4. **Avoid unnecessary functions**: The `g` function seems to be calculating the number of digits in a number, but it does this in a very inefficient way. A simple logarithmic operation can do this in a much more efficient way.

5. **Avoid unnecessary operations**: The `solve` function calculates `ans1` and `ans2` separately, even when they could be calculated at the same time.

Now, let's implement the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int calculate_digits(int n) {
  return floor(log10(n) + 1);
}

void solve() {
  int a, b, c;
  std::cin >> a >> b >> c;
  int x = 1;
  while (calculate_digits(x) != c) {
    x *= 2;
  }
  int ans1 = x, ans2 = x;
  while (calculate_digits(ans1) != a) {
    ans1 *= 2;
  }
  while (calculate_digits(ans2) != b) {
    ans2 *= 5;
  }
  std::cout << ans1 << " " << ans2 << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimization mainly focuses on code clarity and some minor performance improvements. As the original algorithm is not very efficient, a more significant boost in performance would require a different approach to the problem, which is beyond the scope of this question.
