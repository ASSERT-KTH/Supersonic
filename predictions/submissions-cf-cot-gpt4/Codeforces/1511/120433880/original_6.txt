The code provided is a typical competitive programming code. It seems to solve a problem where it takes the number of test cases and three integers per test case, and calculates two numbers each having a, b and c number of digits respectively. The code, however, is not efficient. Here are some optimization steps:

1. Instead of using `cin` and `cout`, we can use `scanf` and `printf` which are faster for input/output operations.
2. The function `g()` which counts the number of digits in a number is inefficient. It uses a while loop to continuously divide the number by 10 until it becomes 0, which has a worst-case time complexity of O(log(n)). A number's number of digits can be calculated in constant time using log base 10.
3. The `solve()` function uses a brute force approach to find `ans1` and `ans2` which have `a` and `b` number of digits respectively. This approach is inefficient and can be optimized using mathematics.
4. The use of `#define fast` to speed up I/O operations doesn't have a noticeable effect on the performance of the code. We can remove it.

Let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int g(int n) {
  return floor(log10(n)) + 1;
}

void solve() {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
  int x = pow(10, c-1);
  int ans1 = pow(10, a-1);
  int ans2 = pow(5, b-1)*pow(2, max(0, c-b));
  printf("%d %d\n", ans1, ans2);
}

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should run faster and use less memory than the original code.
