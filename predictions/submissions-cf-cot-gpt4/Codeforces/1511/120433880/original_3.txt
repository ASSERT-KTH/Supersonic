The above program is a competitive programming style code, not a production code. It is written to be executed in a programming contest environment. The program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Removing unused Macros: There are a number of macros defined at the top of the program that are not being used, such as `INF`, `pb`, `pob`, `ff`, `ss`, `PI`, `setbits`, `sz`, `all`. Removing these will reduce clutter and make the program easier to understand.

2. Avoiding `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes almost all Standard Library headers, which can slow down the compile time. So it's better to include only those header files which are actually needed.

3. Avoiding 'fast' macro: The 'fast' macro is used to speed up the I/O operations. While it does speed up I/O operations, it can lead to other problems, such as being unable to interactively debug the program.

4. Removing debugging code: There are a number of functions and macros in the program that are used for debugging purposes (`bug`, `_print`). These are not needed for the final version of the program, and can be removed to simplify the code.

5. Optimizing the function `g`: This function is used to count the number of digits in an integer. This function can be optimized by using logarithms to calculate the number of digits.

6. Optimizing the `solve` function: Rather than using a loop to calculate the required powers of 2 and 5, we can calculate them directly. This will significantly speed up the program.

Here is the optimized code based on the above suggestions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int g(int n) {
    return floor(log10(n) + 1);
}

void solve() {
    int a, b, c;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;
    int x = pow(10, c - 1);
    int ans1 = x * pow(2, max(0, a - c));
    int ans2 = x * pow(5, max(0, b - c));
    cout << ans1 << " " << ans2 << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    cout.tie(nullptr);
    int t = 1;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Note: These optimizations are done considering the code is used in a production environment. In a competitive coding environment, some of these practices (like using `bits/stdc++.h` and certain macros) are commonly used to increase coding speed.
