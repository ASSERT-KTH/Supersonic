This code is very complex and not well-optimized. There are a lot of unused macros and functions that can be removed to improve the memory usage. The main issue with this code is that it's using a brute force method in the `solve` function to find numbers with a certain number of digits. This is inefficient and can be improved.

Here are the steps to optimize the code:

1. Remove unused macros and functions: The code contains a large number of unused macros and functions. These can be removed because they are simply consuming memory without providing any benefit.

2. Simplify the `solve` function: The `solve` function is currently using a brute force method to find numbers with a certain number of digits. This can be simplified by using logarithms to calculate the number of digits directly.

3. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. This can lead to significant speedup of I/O operations.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int g(int n) {
    int cnt = 0;
    while (n--) {
        cnt++;
        n /= 10;
    }
    return cnt;
}

void solve() {
    int a, b, c;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;
    int x = pow(10, c-1);
    int ans1 = pow(10, a-1);
    int ans2 = pow(10, b-1);
    if(a!=c){
        ans1 *= 3;
    }
    if(b!=c){
        ans2 *= 5;
    }
    cout << ans1 << " " << ans2 << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    int t = 1;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the function `solve` calculates the numbers with a, b, and c digits by using the formula `pow(10, x-1)`. This is much faster and simpler than the original brute force method. If a or b is not equal to c, we multiply the result by 3 or 5 to ensure the GCD remains 1.
