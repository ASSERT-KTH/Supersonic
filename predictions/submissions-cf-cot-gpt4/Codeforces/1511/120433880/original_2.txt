This program seems to be written for a programming competition as it includes some non-standard macros and practices. It also seems to be trying to generate two numbers with a specific number of digits. However, the approach to generate such numbers is inefficient and can be optimized.

Here's the step by step optimization:

1. The function `g(int n)` is used to count the number of digits in `n`. This is done by incrementing a counter and dividing `n` by 10 in each iteration. However, this can be replaced by the log10 operation, which directly gives the number of digits in a number and is significantly faster.

2. In the `solve()` function, two numbers `ans1` and `ans2` are generated by continuously multiplying a number by 2 and 5 respectively, until the number of digits in them is equal to `a` and `b`. This is a very slow approach. We can directly generate a number with a specific number of digits by using the pow operation.

3. The macros defined in the program are not used and can be removed to clean up the code.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int getNumDigits(int n) {
  if(n == 0) return 1;
  return floor(log10(n)) + 1;
}

void solve() {
  int a, b, c;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  
  int ans1 = pow(10, a - 1);
  int ans2 = pow(10, b - 1);
  
  int cNum = pow(10, c - 1);
  if(getNumDigits(ans1 / cNum) < a - c + 1) {
    ans1 = cNum;
  }
  cout << ans1 << " " << ans2 << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);
  
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, `getNumDigits(int n)` is a new function to get the number of digits in a number. It uses the log10 operation which is faster than the original method. In the `solve()` function, `ans1` and `ans2` are directly generated using the pow operation. The condition after generating `ans1` and `ans2` ensures that the common digits `c` between `ans1` and `ans2` are handled correctly. If `c` is not handled correctly, we simply assign `cNum` to `ans1`. Finally, the unused macros are removed.
