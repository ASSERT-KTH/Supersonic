The provided program seems to be a problem-solving code from a competitive programming context. The 'solve()' function computes the minimum numbers of 'a' and 'b' digits that have 'c' common digits. The logic used in this program is correct but inefficient because it uses brute force by multiplying the numbers until they have the desired number of digits. This results in a high time complexity.

However, we can optimize this program by using mathematical calculations instead of a brute force approach. Here's how:

1. For a number to have 'c' digits, we can simply use the power function, i.e., pow(10, c-1). This will give us a number with 'c' digits.
2. For 'a' and 'b' digits, we can simply multiply the calculated number with 2 or 5 respectively. This will not change the number of digits but will give us two co-prime numbers (numbers whose GCD is 1) as required by the problem.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    int a, b, c;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;
    int x = pow(10, c - 1);
    int ans1 = x * pow(10, a - c);
    int ans2 = x * pow(10, b - c);
    if (b > c)
        ans2 *= 5;
    cout << ans1 << " " << ans2 << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that in competitive programming, it is a good practice to include only those libraries that you are using in your program. This will reduce the compilation time and make your code more readable. Thus, instead of including 'bits/stdc++.h', we are including only 'iostream' and 'cmath'.
