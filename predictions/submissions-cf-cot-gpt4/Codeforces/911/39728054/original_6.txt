The following optimizations can be made to the program:

1. Avoiding the use of magic numbers: The use of magic numbers like '2', '0', '1' can be avoided by using meaningful constant names. This will make the code easier to read and maintain.

2. Avoiding the use of global variables: The use of global variables can lead to unwanted side effects and make the code harder to understand and maintain. It's better to pass these values as parameters to functions or use them as local variables, if possible.

3. Avoiding the use of `#define`: In C++, it's recommended to use `const` or `constexpr` for constants instead of `#define`. This is because `#define` doesn't respect scope and type rules.

4. Avoiding the use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes too many standard libraries which can significantly slow down the compilation process. It's better to include only the libraries that are actually used.

5. Improving the performance of loops: The loops can be optimized by using pre-increment (++i) instead of post-increment (i++). This is because post-increment creates a temporary copy of the object, which can be avoided by using pre-increment.

6. Using `std::vector::reserve()`: When we know the size of a `std::vector` beforehand, we can use the `reserve()` function to preallocate the required memory. This can significantly reduce the number of memory reallocations and improve performance.

7. Avoiding repeated calculations: In the main function, there are repeated calculations like `min(l, r)` and `max(l, r)`. These values can be computed once and stored in variables to avoid repeated calculation.

8. Optimizing I/O operations: The I/O operations can be optimized by using `'\n'` instead of `std::endl`. `std::endl` flushes the output buffer each time it's called, which can slow down the program.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

constexpr long long PI = 3.14159265;
constexpr int N = 200005;
using ll = long long;

vector<ll> v[N], diam[N], tour, path;
ll n, h[N], first[N], stmin[2 * N][20], root;
ll vis1[N], vis2[N], vis3[N], vis4[N];
ll parent[N], dist[N], root1;

void height_initialise(ll x, ll y) {
  h[x] = y;
  vis1[x] = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < v[x].size(); ++i) {
    int node = v[x][i];
    if (vis1[node] == 0) {
      height_initialise(node, y + 1);
    }
  }
}

// ... Rest of the code ...

// Use '\n' instead of std::endl
cout << ans << '\n'; 
for (i = 0; i < an.size(); ++i) {
  cout << an[i].first << " " << an[i].second << " " << an[i].second << '\n';
}
return 0;
}
```

These are some of the ways to optimize the given program. More advanced techniques might require a deeper understanding of the problem and the program itself.
