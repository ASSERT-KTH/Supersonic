This C/C++ program has been written in a way that maintains a good level of efficiency. However, there are some areas where we can make minor optimizations.

1. Using scanf and printf instead of cin and cout: In C++, scanf and printf are faster for I/O operations than cin and cout. However, this code is already using scanf and printf, so it's already optimized in this regard.

2. Avoiding division and modulus operations: Division and modulus operations are costly. The program uses modulus in the gcd function and division in the binary search. However, these operations are necessary for the correctness of the program, so they can't be removed.

3. Reducing function call overhead: The gcd function and the get function are called multiple times. Each function call has some overhead. We can inline these functions to remove this overhead. Inlining a function suggests to the compiler to replace the function call with the function code itself, thus eliminating the need for a function call.

4. Using bitwise operations: Bitwise operations are faster than arithmetic operations. The program uses a bitwise shift to calculate powers of 2, which is a good optimization.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;
int n;
int q;
map<int, long long> ans;
int a[100100];
int st[100100][20];
int get_log[200100];

inline int gcd(int a, int b) {
  while(b) {
    a %= b;
    swap(a, b);
  }
  return a;
}

inline int get(int l, int r) {
  int sz = get_log[r - l];
  return gcd(st[l][sz], st[r - (1LL << sz)][sz]);
}

signed main() {
  get_log[1] = 0;
  for (int i = 2; i < 200000; i++) {
    get_log[i] = get_log[i - 1];
    while ((1 << get_log[i]) <= i)
      get_log[i]++;
    get_log[i]--;
  }
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    st[i][0] = a[i];
  }
  for (int nowP = 1; nowP < 20; nowP++) {
    for (int i = 0; i + (1LL << nowP) <= n; i++) {
      st[i][nowP] = gcd(st[i][nowP - 1], st[i + (1LL << (nowP - 1))][nowP - 1]);
    }
  }
  for (int L = 0; L < n; L++) {
    int prev_ind = L;
    int now_ind = L;
    while (now_ind < n) {
      int now_gcd = get(L, now_ind + 1);
      int l = now_ind;
      int r = n;
      while (r - l > 1) {
        int m = (l + r) / 2;
        int x = get(L, m + 1);
        if (x < now_gcd)
          r = m;
        else
          l = m;
      }
      ans[now_gcd] += r - prev_ind;
      now_ind = r;
      prev_ind = r;
    }
  }
  scanf("%d", &q);
  while (q--) {
    int x;
    scanf("%d", &x);
    printf("%I64d\n", ans[x]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
