This is a complex program. It's essentially finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of different subsets of an array and storing the results in a map. The program is optimized in a way that it's hard to find quick optimizations that don't involve changing the logic of the program. However, there are still a few things that can be done to further optimize it:

1. Reduce the size of `get_log` array: This array is used to store precomputed values of base-2 logarithms. The maximum index accessed in this array is `n` (the size of the input array), but the array is declared with a size of 200100. We can optimize the memory usage by declaring this array with a size of `n`.

2. Use `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout`: `scanf` and `printf` are faster than `cin` and `cout` in C++. Since this program involves a lot of input/output operations, this can lead to a noticeable improvement in running time.

3. Use bitwise operations instead of power of 2: Bitwise operations are faster than arithmetic operations. In this program, power of 2 is used in several places, which can be replaced by bitwise operations.

4. Use an `unordered_map` instead of `map`: `unordered_map` has an average time complexity of O(1) for insert and access operations, while `map` has a time complexity of O(log(n)). However, please note that this could potentially increase the memory usage.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int gcd(int a, int b) {
  if (b == 0) {
    return a;
  }
  return gcd(b, a % b);
}

int n;
int q;
unordered_map<int, long long> ans;
int a[100100];
int st[100100][20];
int get_log[100100];

int get(int l, int r) {
  int sz = get_log[r - l];
  return gcd(st[l][sz], st[r - (1 << sz)][sz]);
}

signed main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);

  get_log[1] = 0;
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    get_log[i] = get_log[i - 1];
    if ((1 << get_log[i]) <= i)
      get_log[i]++;
    get_log[i]--;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    st[i][0] = a[i];
  }

  for (int nowP = 1; nowP < 20; nowP++) {
    for (int i = 0; i + (1 << nowP) <= n; i++) {
      st[i][nowP] = gcd(st[i][nowP - 1], st[i + (1 << (nowP - 1))][nowP - 1]);
    }
  }

  for (int L = 0; L < n; L++) {
    int prev_ind = L;
    int now_ind = L;
    while (now_ind < n) {
      int now_gcd = get(L, now_ind + 1);
      int l = now_ind;
      int r = n;
      while (r - l > 1) {
        int m = (l + r) / 2;
        int x = get(L, m + 1);
        if (x < now_gcd)
          r = m;
        else
          l = m;
      }
      ans[now_gcd] += r - prev_ind;
      now_ind = r;
      prev_ind = r;
    }
  }

  scanf("%d", &q);
  while (q--) {
    int x;
    scanf("%d", &x);
    printf("%lld\n", ans[x]);
  }

  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the effect of these optimizations will be more noticeable on large inputs.
