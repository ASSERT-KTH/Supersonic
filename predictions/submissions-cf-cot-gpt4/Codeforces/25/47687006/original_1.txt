This program seems to be implementing a version of the union-find data structure with path compression and uses it to find and output 'useless' roads in an input set of roads (possibly in a graph). The program could be optimized in a few ways:

1. Avoid using `<bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes practically all standard library headers, which increases compile time. It's better to only include what you need.

2. Avoid global variables: Global variables can make it harder to understand the program's flow. They also occupy memory for the entire duration of the program.

3. Avoid using `std::pair`: Instead of using `std::pair`, you could create a struct with more descriptive field names. This can make the program easier to understand.

4. Use `reserve()` for vectors: If you know the size of the vector beforehand, you can use `reserve()` to allocate memory in advance. This can potentially save time on reallocations.

5. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`: The synchronization of all the C++ standard streams with their corresponding C standard streams if it is called before the program performs its first input or output operation. Adding `std::cin.tie(NULL)` and `std::cout.tie(NULL)` can also stop unnecessary flushes for `cin` and `cout`, further increasing speed.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

struct Road {
    int start;
    int end;
};

int find_set(int ii, std::vector<int>& parent) {
  if (ii == parent[ii])
    return ii;
  return parent[ii] = find_set(parent[ii], parent);
}

void union_sets(int a, int b, std::vector<int>& parent, std::vector<Road>& uselessRoads) {
  int aa = find_set(a, parent);
  int bb = find_set(b, parent);
  if (aa != bb)
    parent[bb] = aa;
  else
    uselessRoads.push_back({a, b});
}

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::vector<int> parent(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    parent[i] = i;

  std::vector<Road> uselessRoads;
  uselessRoads.reserve(n-1);

  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    int rd1, rd2;
    std::cin >> rd1 >> rd2;
    union_sets(rd1 - 1, rd2 - 1, parent, uselessRoads);
  }
  
  std::cout << uselessRoads.size() << '\n';
  
  int hb = -1, currURoad = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    if (parent[i] == i)
      if (hb == -1)
        hb = i;
      else {
        std::cout << uselessRoads[currURoad].start + 1 << ' '
             << uselessRoads[currURoad].end + 1 << ' ' << hb + 1 << ' '
             << i + 1 << '\n';
        currURoad++;
      }
}
```

This version of the program includes only the necessary headers, avoids using global variables, uses a struct instead of `std::pair` for readability, reserves space for vectors beforehand to avoid unnecessary reallocations, and disables synchronization of standard streams for speed.
