The given code essentially performs a disjoint-set union operation to check for redundant roads in a graph and replaces them to ensure connectivity. The code is already quite efficient, but there are a few things that we can do to further optimize it.

1. **Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`**: This header includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can lead to increased compilation time. We will include only the necessary headers.

2. **Avoid using `using namespace std`**: This can cause conflicts in the namespace if there are other libraries or user-defined types with the same names as those in the standard library.

3. **Use Fast I/O**: Instead of sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0), and cout.tie(0), we can use a single line `ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(nullptr);` which is more concise and does the same thing.

4. **Avoiding unnecessary recalculation in union_sets function**: When the parent set of both elements is the same, we are pushing that pair in the uselessRoads vector. Instead of finding the parent again while pushing, we can use the already found parents.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::vector;
using std::pair;
vector<int> parent;
vector<pair<int, int>> uselessRoads;
int n, hb, currURoad;
int find_set(int ii) {
  if (ii == parent[ii])
    return ii;
  return parent[ii] = find_set(parent[ii]);
}
void union_sets(int a, int b) {
  int aa = find_set(a);
  int bb = find_set(b);
  if (aa != bb)
    parent[bb] = aa;
  else
    uselessRoads.push_back({aa, bb});
}
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
#ifdef fileIO
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  cin >> n;
  parent.resize(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    parent[i] = i;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    int rd1, rd2;
    cin >> rd1 >> rd2;
    union_sets(rd1 - 1, rd2 - 1);
  }
  cout << uselessRoads.size() << '\n';
  hb = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    if (parent[i] == i)
      if (hb == -1)
        hb = i;
      else {
        cout << uselessRoads[currURoad].first + 1 << ' '
             << uselessRoads[currURoad].second + 1 << ' ' << hb + 1 << ' '
             << i + 1 << '\n';
        currURoad++;
      }
}
```
Please note that the code optimization depends on the specific use case and program behavior. The above suggestions are made based on common best practices and may not lead to significant improvements in this specific code.
