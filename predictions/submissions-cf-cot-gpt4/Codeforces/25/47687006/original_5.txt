The above C/C++ program has already been written in an optimized way and has used efficient data structures. The program uses Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure for storing the parent of each node and vector for storing the useless roads. The parent array is initialized in O(n) time and the find_set function efficiently finds the parent of a node in nearly O(1) time due to path compression in DSU.

However, there are a few small improvements that can be made:

Optimization 1: Using reserve() method in vector
The reserve() method in vector pre-allocates a specified amount of memory, which can reduce the memory reallocations that might occur when the vector size grows which in turn can speed up the program.

Optimization 2: Avoiding unnecessary use of std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
This function is used to unsync the C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams. However, in this program, we are not mixing C and C++ style I/O, and hence, this line can be removed.

Optimization 3: Avoiding unnecessary use of cin.tie(0) and cout.tie(0);
These functions are used to untie cin and cout, which means they no longer flush the cout buffer before each input operation. However, in this program, we are not intermixing input and output operations, and hence, these lines can be removed.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
vector<int> parent;
vector<pair<int, int>> uselessRoads;
int n, hb, currURoad;
int find_set(int ii) {
  if (ii == parent[ii])
    return ii;
  return parent[ii] = find_set(parent[ii]);
}
void union_sets(int a, int b) {
  int aa = find_set(a);
  int bb = find_set(b);
  if (aa != bb)
    parent[bb] = aa;
  else
    uselessRoads.push_back({a, b});
}
int main() {
#ifdef fileIO
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  cin >> n;
  parent.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    parent[i] = i;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    int rd1, rd2;
    cin >> rd1 >> rd2;
    union_sets(rd1 - 1, rd2 - 1);
  }
  cout << uselessRoads.size() << '\n';
  hb = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    if (parent[i] == i)
      if (hb == -1)
        hb = i;
      else {
        cout << uselessRoads[currURoad].first + 1 << ' '
             << uselessRoads[currURoad].second + 1 << ' ' << hb + 1 << ' '
             << i + 1 << '\n';
        currURoad++;
      }
}
```
Please note that the optimizations made here are very minor and you may not see a significant difference in performance.
