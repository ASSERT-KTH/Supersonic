The given C++ program seems to solve a problem of graph theory, finding and removing the useless roads in a map and connecting all the disconnected components. This is done using a Union-Find data structure.

Here are some optimizations that can be done:

1. **Avoid using '#include <bits/stdc++.h>':** This header file includes quite literally most of the standard library. This increases the compilation time significantly as it drags in a huge amount of code to be compiled. Instead of this, include only the necessary libraries.

2. **Initialize 'parent' vector during declaration:** You can initialize 'parent' vector with iota function during declaration. This avoids the loop used for initializing each element to its index, thus saving some time.

3. **Avoid using 'iostream' with 'std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);':** If you're using printf/scanf, there's no need to use these lines, as they serve to sync C++'s std::cin and std::cout with C's stdin and stdout.

4. **Remove 'hb' variable:** It seems like 'hb' is used to keep track of the first parent node found. We can use a boolean flag to indicate whether we have found the first parent node or not and use 'currURoad' itself to store the index of the first parent.

5. **Use printf/scanf instead of cin/cout for better I/O performance:** It is a well-known fact that printf/scanf functions provide faster I/O compared to cin/cout in C++.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the code.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>

std::vector<int> parent(100000);
std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> uselessRoads;
int n, currURoad;

int find_set(int ii) {
  if (ii == parent[ii])
    return ii;
  return parent[ii] = find_set(parent[ii]);
}

void union_sets(int a, int b) {
  int aa = find_set(a);
  int bb = find_set(b);
  if (aa != bb)
    parent[bb] = aa;
  else
    uselessRoads.push_back({a, b});
}

int main() {
#ifdef fileIO
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif

  scanf("%d", &n);
  std::iota(parent.begin(), parent.begin() + n, 0);

  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    int rd1, rd2;
    scanf("%d %d", &rd1, &rd2);
    union_sets(rd1 - 1, rd2 - 1);
  }

  printf("%d\n", uselessRoads.size());

  bool firstParentFound = false;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (parent[i] == i) {
      if (!firstParentFound) {
        currURoad = i;
        firstParentFound = true;
      }
      else {
        printf("%d %d %d %d\n", uselessRoads[currURoad].first + 1, uselessRoads[currURoad].second + 1, currURoad + 1, i + 1);
        currURoad++;
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
