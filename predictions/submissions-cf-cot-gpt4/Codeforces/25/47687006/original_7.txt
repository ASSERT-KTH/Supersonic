The original code is a disjoint-set union (DSU) algorithm with path compression and union by rank. For optimization, we can make some changes:

1. Memory Optimization: We're using a vector of pairs to store useless roads. But we're only using the first useless road. So, we don't need to store all of them. Instead of pushing back all useless roads into a vector, we can just store the first one.

2. Running Time Optimization: The find_set function is already optimized using path compression. But we can make the union_sets function slightly faster by using union by rank. This will balance the tree and reduce the time complexity of the find_set function.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
vector<int> parent, rank;
pair<int, int> firstUselessRoad;
bool uselessRoadFound = false;
int n;

int find_set(int ii) {
  if (ii != parent[ii])
    parent[ii] = find_set(parent[ii]);
  return parent[ii];
}

void union_sets(int a, int b) {
  int aa = find_set(a);
  int bb = find_set(b);
  if (aa != bb) {
    if (rank[aa] < rank[bb])
      swap(aa, bb);
    parent[bb] = aa;
    if (rank[aa] == rank[bb])
      rank[aa]++;
  } else if (!uselessRoadFound) {
    firstUselessRoad = {a, b};
    uselessRoadFound = true;
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
#ifdef fileIO
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  cin >> n;
  parent.resize(n);
  rank.resize(n, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    parent[i] = i;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    int rd1, rd2;
    cin >> rd1 >> rd2;
    union_sets(rd1 - 1, rd2 - 1);
  }
  int hb = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    if (parent[i] == i)
      if (hb == -1)
        hb = i;
      else {
        cout << firstUselessRoad.first + 1 << ' '
             << firstUselessRoad.second + 1 << ' ' << hb + 1 << ' '
             << i + 1 << '\n';
        break;
      }
}
```

This optimized code saves memory by not storing all useless roads and speeds up the algorithm by using union by rank. It also breaks the loop as soon as it finds the second hub, reducing unnecessary iterations.
