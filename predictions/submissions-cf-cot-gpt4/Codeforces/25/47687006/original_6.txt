The given C++ program uses Union-Find data structure to find useless roads in a graph. It does not have any egregious issues in terms of time complexity or space complexity. However, there are several minor optimizations we can do to make it run faster:

1. Use `reserve()` for vector `uselessRoads`: The `push_back()` operation on vectors can be expensive because it may cause dynamic memory allocations. By using `reserve()` function, we can allocate memory for the vector beforehand to reduce the number of dynamic memory allocations.

2. Remove unnecessary variables: The variable `hb` is used to store the head of the first connected component we find. It is not necessary to store this information in a variable because we can directly print it out. Similarly, the variable `currURoad` is used to iterate through `uselessRoads`. We can replace it with an iterator.

3. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`: Using `endl` will cause a flush operation (which can be quite expensive), whereas `'\n'` won't.

4. Use pre-increment rather than post-increment for loop counters: Pre-increment (`++i`) can be faster than post-increment (`i++`) in C++ due to how post-increment needs to create a temporary copy of the object.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
vector<int> parent;
vector<pair<int, int>> uselessRoads;
int n;
int find_set(int ii) {
  if (ii == parent[ii])
    return ii;
  return parent[ii] = find_set(parent[ii]);
}
void union_sets(int a, int b) {
  int aa = find_set(a);
  int bb = find_set(b);
  if (aa != bb)
    parent[bb] = aa;
  else
    uselessRoads.push_back({a, b});
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
#ifdef fileIO
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  cin >> n;
  parent.resize(n);
  uselessRoads.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    parent[i] = i;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    int rd1, rd2;
    cin >> rd1 >> rd2;
    union_sets(rd1 - 1, rd2 - 1);
  }
  cout << uselessRoads.size() << '\n';
  auto it = uselessRoads.begin();
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    if (parent[i] == i) {
      if (it != uselessRoads.end()) {
        cout << it->first + 1 << ' ' << it->second + 1 << ' ' << i + 1 << '\n';
        ++it;
      }
    }
}
```
