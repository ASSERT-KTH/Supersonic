The given code seems to be already optimized in terms of algorithmic complexity. However, there are a few things that could be optimized or best practices that could be followed for better performance and code readability:

1. The use of "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" is discouraged as it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, adding to the compilation time. We should include only the necessary libraries.

2. The use of "#define int long long int" can lead to confusion and bugs, especially when mixing signed and unsigned integers or when doing operations that depend on the integer size. It would be better to use a typedef or using directive.

3. In the build_tree function, we are calculating the mid-point using "(strt_i + end_i) / 2". If strt_i and end_i are very large, this could cause an integer overflow. A safer way to calculate the mid-point would be "strt_i + (end_i - strt_i) / 2".

4. Using global variables is generally not a good practice as it can lead to bugs and makes the code harder to understand and maintain. It would be better to encapsulate the seg_tree and a arrays inside a class or pass them as function arguments. However, this would be more than a small change to the program.

Given these points, here's the optimized version of the code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const ll mod = 1e9 + 7;
const ll INF = 1e18;
const ll N = 4e5 + 5;
vector<ll> seg_tree(4 * N + 5, 0);
ll a[N];
void build_tree(int tree_index, int strt_i, int end_i) {
  if (strt_i == end_i) {
    seg_tree[tree_index] = a[strt_i];
    return;
  }
  int mid = strt_i + (end_i - strt_i) / 2;
  build_tree(tree_index * 2, strt_i, mid);
  build_tree(tree_index * 2 + 1, mid + 1, end_i);
  seg_tree[tree_index] =
      __gcd(seg_tree[tree_index * 2], seg_tree[tree_index * 2 + 1]);
}
ll query(int tree_index, int strt_i, int end_i, int q_strt, int q_end) {
  if (strt_i > q_end || end_i < q_strt)
    return 0;
  if (q_strt <= strt_i && q_end >= end_i)
    return seg_tree[tree_index];
  int mid = strt_i + (end_i - strt_i) / 2;
  ll l = query(2 * tree_index, strt_i, mid, q_strt, q_end);
  ll r = query(2 * tree_index + 1, mid + 1, end_i, q_strt, q_end);
  return __gcd(l, r);
}
void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  for(ll i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) cin >> a[i], a[i + n] = a[i];
  build_tree(1, 1, 2 * n);
  ll ans = 0, g = 0;
  for(ll i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) g = __gcd(g, a[i]);
  for(ll i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
    ll r = 2 * n, l = i + 1, temp = INF, cnt = 0;
    if (a[i] == g)
      continue;
    while (l <= r) {
      ll mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
      ll x = query(1, 1, 2 * n, l, mid);
      ll y = __gcd(x, a[i]);
      if (y == g)
        temp = min(temp, mid - l + 1 + cnt), r = mid - 1;
      else
        a[i] = __gcd(a[i], x), cnt += mid - l + 1, l = mid + 1;
    }
    ans = max(ans, temp);
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return;
}
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  ll t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  for(ll i = 1; i < t + 1; i++) { solve(); }
  return 0;
}
```

The runtime of this program is still O(n log n) due to the segment tree and binary search operations. The memory usage is also O(n) due to the arrays and vectors used. These complexities are optimal for this problem, so further optimization would require a different approach to the problem.
