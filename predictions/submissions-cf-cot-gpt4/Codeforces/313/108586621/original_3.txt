The main optimizations of this program are:

1. Reducing the usage of macros: Macros are processed by the preprocessor and can slow down the compilation time. We can replace the macros with their actual definitions in the code.
2. Reducing the usage of STL containers: The queue is being used here, which increases the memory usage. We can optimize it by using simple variables and loops.
3. Avoid using `ios::sync_with_stdio(0)`, `cin.tie(0)`, and `cout.tie(0)`: They are used to sync the C++ standard streams with the standard C streams and to untie cin and cout from each other. This program doesn't require such functionality, so it's better to remove them.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```C++
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> a(n + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  int root = n - 1;
  ll sum = 0;
  int top = n;
  while (true) {
    sum += a[top];
    if (top == 1)
      break;
    top = top;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
      top = root--;
    }
  }
  cout << sum;
}
```
In this optimized code, we reduced the usage of macros and removed the queue. Instead, we used a simple variable `top` and updated its value in the loop. The `sort`, `cin >>`, and `cout <<` operations are directly used without the `all` macro and `ios::sync_with_stdio(0)`, `cin.tie(0)`, and `cout.tie(0)`.
