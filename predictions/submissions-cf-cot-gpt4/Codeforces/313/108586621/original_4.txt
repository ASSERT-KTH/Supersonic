This C++ program is trying to solve a problem by reading a number "n" from the input, creating a vector of "n" elements, sorting the vector, and then adding up the elements of the vector in a specific order. The main optimization opportunities here are to avoid unnecessary operations and to use more memory-efficient data structures.

1. Reduce unnecessary operations: The loop that pushes elements to the queue seems to push the same element multiple times. This is unnecessary and can be avoided.

2. Use more memory-efficient data structures: Instead of using a queue to store the indices of the elements, we can directly store the elements themselves. This will reduce the memory overhead of storing indices and also make the code simpler.

3. Unnecessary use of macros: The program uses several macros (sz, all, rall, dbg) that are not necessary and only complicate the code. Removing these macros will make the code simpler and easier to understand.

4. Reduce the use of global variables: The program uses a global variable (dp) that is not necessary. Removing this variable will reduce the memory footprint of the program.

5. Unnecessary use of types: The program uses typedef to create new types (ll, ull) that are not necessary. Removing these types will make the code simpler and easier to understand.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
const int N = 2e6 + 6;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<long long> a(n + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  long long sum = 0;
  int root = n;
  while (root > 0) {
    sum += a[root];
    root -= 3;
  }
  cout << sum;
}
```

In the optimized version, we directly add the elements of the vector "a" to the sum, starting from the end of the vector and skipping 3 elements at a time. This provides the same result as the original program but is simpler and more efficient.
