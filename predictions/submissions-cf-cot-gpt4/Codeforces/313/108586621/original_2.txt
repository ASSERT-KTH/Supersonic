There are several potential areas for optimization in the given code:

1. Inclusion of header files: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is not recommended for production code as it includes many unnecessary header files that can slow down the compile time. 

2. Use of #define macros: The use of #define macros `sz`, `all`, `rall` and `dbg` can be removed to improve readability of the code. Instead, use the equivalent functions and methods directly.

3. The use of a `queue` to hold elements is unnecessary because the code is simply adding the elements in the vector to the sum. This extra step of pushing and popping elements from the queue can be avoided. 

4. The `root` variable is redundant. We can use the size of the vector a to determine the current top of the queue. 

5. The code pushes the top element back into the queue which is not needed. We can simply add the top 3 elements directly to the sum and then remove them from the vector.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ios ::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> a(n + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  ll sum = 0;
  while (a.size() > 1) {
    sum += a.back();
    a.pop_back();
    for (int i = 0; i < 3 && !a.empty(); i++) {
      a.pop_back();
    }
  }
  cout << sum;
}
```

In this optimized version, we directly use the functions and methods instead of the defined macros. We also remove the unnecessary use of queue and directly add the elements to the sum and remove them from the vector. This improves both the runtime and memory efficiency of the code.
