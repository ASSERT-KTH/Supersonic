The given code reads in a series of numbers, sorts them and then does some calculations on them. The calculation involves using a queue to add up numbers in a certain order. The main issue with this code is that it uses a lot of memory to store the numbers and the queue.

The optimization strategy here would be to:

1. Remove the unnecessary use of the queue. The queue is used to store the indexes of the array that need to be added to the sum. This can be replaced with a simple for loop that iterates over the array in the necessary order.

2. Remove the unnecessary use of the vector. The vector is used to store the numbers read in from the input. This can be replaced with a simple array.

3. Remove the use of macros. Macros are replaced by the pre-processor before the code is even compiled. This can lead to unexpected results and makes the code harder to read and debug. Instead, use functions or inline functions if necessary.

4. Use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout for faster input/output.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <algorithm>
typedef long long ll;
const int N = 2e6 + 6;
ll a[N];

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    scanf("%lld", &a[i]);
  }
  std::sort(a+1, a+n+1);
  int root = n - 1;
  ll sum = 0;
  for (int i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
    sum += a[i];
    for (int j = 1; j <= 3 && root >= 1; j++) {
      sum += a[root--];
    }
  }
  printf("%lld", sum);
  return 0;
}
```

This code does exactly the same as the original code but uses less memory and is faster due to the use of scanf/printf and the removal of the queue.
