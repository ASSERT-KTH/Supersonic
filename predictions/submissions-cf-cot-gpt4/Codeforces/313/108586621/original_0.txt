The given program reads a number 'n' and then reads 'n' numbers into a vector. It then sorts the vector in ascending order. After that, it adds the greatest number to a sum and pushes the next three greatest numbers into a queue. This process is repeated until all numbers have been added to the sum.

Optimization Steps:
1. The queue is unnecessary in this case. Instead of using a queue to store the indices, we can use a simple counter. This avoids the overhead of push and pop operations on the queue, which reduces the time complexity.

2. The sort function sorts the array in ascending order. But in this case, we want the greatest numbers first. So, we can sort the array in descending order, which saves us from decrementing the root in each iteration.

3. The 'root' variable is unnecessary after the changes above. We can use just the counter.

4. The 'ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);' lines are not required for this problem. These lines are usually used to speed up cin and cout operations, but in this case, there are only a few such operations, so these lines can be removed to save memory.

5. Several macros are defined at the beginning of the program that are not used, such as 'rall' and 'dbg'. These can be removed to clean up the code.

6. The 'dp' array is declared but never used. This can be removed to save memory.

Here is the optimized code following these steps:

```C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int N = 2e6 + 6;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> a(n + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  sort(a.begin()+1, a.end(), greater<ll>());
  
  ll sum = 0;
  int cnt = n;
  while (cnt >= 1) {
    sum += a[cnt];
    cnt -= 4;
  }
  
  cout << sum;
}
```
