Ok, here are the steps to optimize the provided C/C++ program:

1. Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and include only the necessary libraries. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which can increase the compilation time.

2. We can remove the macros `sz(param)`, `all(param)`, `rall(param)`, and `dbg(param)`. They are not used in this program and removing them will save memory.

3. The `typedef` declarations for `ll` and `ull` are unnecessary and can be replaced with their actual types `long long` and `unsigned long long`, respectively.

4. We notice that the `queue<int> q` is used to store the indices of the elements in the sorted array `a` and `q.push(top);` is called in every iteration of the while loop. We can avoid these operations by using an integer variable instead.

5. Instead of using `queue<int> q` and doing `q.push()` and `q.pop()` operations, we can use a simple integer variable to keep track of the current index. This will save memory and time.

6. `ios::sync_with_stdio(0);`, `cin.tie(0);`, and `cout.tie(0);` are used to speed up cin and cout, but in this program, only one cin and one cout are used. Therefore, these lines are not necessary and can be removed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int N = 2e6 + 6;
int dp[N];

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<long long> a(n + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  int currentIndex = n;
  long long sum = 0;
  while (currentIndex) {
    sum += a[currentIndex];
    if (currentIndex == 1)
      break;
    currentIndex--;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
      if (currentIndex > 0) {
        currentIndex--;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << sum;
}
```
