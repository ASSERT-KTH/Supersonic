This program reads a sequence of numbers, sorts them, and then adds them to the sum starting from the largest one. Each time it adds a number to the sum, it adds the next three smallest numbers to the queue.

The main optimization that can be done here is to avoid using a queue. The queue is used to determine the next element to add to the sum, but we can calculate this directly. This will save both time (since we don't have to manipulate the queue) and memory (since we don't have to store the queue).

Here is the step by step optimization:

1. We can calculate the next number to add to the sum directly. We start from the largest number and every time we add a number to the sum, we move to the next smallest number. For every number we add, we also add the next three smallest numbers. So, if we have added `m` numbers to the sum, the next number to add is the `mth` smallest number (i.e., the number at position `n-m` in the sorted array).

2. We don't need to check if `top == 1`. Since we calculate the next index directly, we will never go out of bounds.

3. We don't need to push `top` back to the queue. The next index is calculated directly and doesn't depend on the previous index.

Here is the optimized program:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define sz(param) (int)(param.size())
#define all(param) param.begin(), param.end()
#define rall(param) param.rbegin(), param.rend()
#define dbg(param)                                                             \
  cout << "\nLine " << __LINE__ << " debug [" << #param << ": " << param       \
       << "]\n";
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
const int N = 2e6 + 6;
int dp[N];
int main() {
  ios ::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> a(n + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  sort(all(a));
  ll sum = 0;
  for (int added = 0; added < n; added++) {
    int top = n - added;
    sum += a[top];
    added += min(3, top - 1);
  }
  cout << sum;
}
```
