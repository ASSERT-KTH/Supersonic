This C++ code seems to be calculating some kind of sum from the sorted elements of a vector. The code is not well optimized for time and space complexity. 

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the unused `dp` array which is taking up unnecessary space. This would reduce the memory footprint.

2. Remove the unnecessary `#define` macros, which are not used in the program. This would reduce the size of the program.

3. Remove the unused `typedef` declarations, which are not used in the program.

4. The `root` variable is not required to be initialized early in the program. It can be initialized just before the loop where it is used.

5. The `queue` data structure is not required in this case. The queue is being used to store the indices of the elements to be summed up. We can directly loop over the array in reverse order to achieve the same result.

6. The check `if (top == 1) break;` is not required, as the loop condition will automatically break the loop when all elements are processed.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> a(n + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());

  ll sum = 0;
  for (int i = n; i > 0; i -= 4) {
    sum += a[i];
    if (i > 1) sum += a[i - 1];
  }

  cout << sum;

  return 0;
}
```

This program will run faster and use less memory than the original program. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sort operation, and the space complexity is O(n) due to the vector `a`.
