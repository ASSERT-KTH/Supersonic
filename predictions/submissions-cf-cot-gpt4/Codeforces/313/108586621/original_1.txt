This program reads a sequence of integers, sorts them and calculates a sum with a specific logic. The logic is to add the largest number in the sequence to the sum, then add the next three largest numbers to the queue. This repeats until the smallest number is reached.

The main optimization points are as follows:

1. Using `deque` instead of `queue`: We are pushing elements to the queue and popping them from the front. We can use a `deque` which has `O(1)` complexity for both pushing and popping at both ends.

2. Avoiding `push` and `pop` operations: We are pushing the same element to the queue again and again, and then popping it. Instead, we can use a simple loop from `n` to `1` to achieve the same thing.

3. Avoiding unnecessary queue operations: We are pushing `root` to the queue three times. Instead, we can directly add the values to `sum`.

4. Removing unnecessary macros: Macros like `sz`, `all`, `rall` and `dbg` are not used in the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

const int N = 2e6 + 6;
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  vector<ll> a(n + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }

  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  int root = n - 1;
  ll sum = 0;

  for (int top = n; top >= 1; top--) {
    sum += a[top];
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3 && root >= 1; i++) {
      sum += a[root--];
    }
  }

  cout << sum;
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized program will run faster and use less memory.
