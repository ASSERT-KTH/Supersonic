Here are some potential optimizations for this C/C++ program:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of libraries which can slow down the compilation process because the compiler needs to parse all of them. You should only include what you need, like `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`, `#include <queue>`, `#include <algorithm>`.

2. Remove unused macros: In this case, `rall(param)` and `dbg(param)` are not used anywhere in the program, so they should be removed.

3. Avoid using `sz(param)`: This macro is used to get the size of the queue, but you can directly use `q.size()` instead which is clearer and more direct.

4. Avoid using `all(param)`: This macro is used to pass the start and end iterators of the vector to the sort function, but you can directly pass `a.begin(), a.end()` instead.

5. Avoid using `typedef`: You can use `using` keyword to define type alias in C++, it is more flexible and consistent with other language features.

6. Avoid large global arrays: The array `dp` is declared but not used anywhere in the program. Remove it to save memory.

7. Avoid unnecessary `ios::sync_with_stdio(0);`, `cin.tie(0);` and `cout.tie(0);` unless you are doing competitive programming.

Here is the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> a(n + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  int root = n - 1;
  ll sum = 0;
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(n);
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int top = q.front();
    q.pop();
    sum += a[top];
    if (top == 1)
      break;
    q.push(top);
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
      q.push(root--);
    }
  }
  cout << sum;
}
```

In this optimized version, the code is more concise and easier to read. Also, it should have a faster compilation time and use less memory.
