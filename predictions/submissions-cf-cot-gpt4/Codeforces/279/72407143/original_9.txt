The program is essentially calculating and storing the lengths of increasing and decreasing sequences, then using this information to answer queries about ranges in the array. There are a few small changes we can make to improve the efficiency of the program:

1. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` to unlink C and C++ standard streams which can result in faster input/output operations. This is already used in the original program.
2. Use `std::cin.tie(NULL);` to untie `cin` from `cout`. This is also already used in the original program.
3. Avoid using `std::endl` in output operations because it forces a flush operation, which can be inefficient. Instead, use `'\n'`.
4. The optimization of the code does not involve any change in the data structures or the algorithm used. The changes are only related to the way the input and output operations are performed.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define mod 1000000007
#define csl ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL)
#define pb push_back
#define pii pair<int, int>
#define mp make_pair
#define fr(n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define fr1(x, n) for (int j = x; j < n; j++)
#define fr2(j, x, n) for (int j = x; j < n; j++)
#define vi vector<int>
signed main() {
  csl;
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  int a[n + 1], si[n + 1], sd[n + 1];
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    si[i] = sd[i] = 1;
  }
  for (int j = n - 1; j >= 1; j--) {
    if (a[j + 1] >= a[j])
      si[j] += si[j + 1];
    if (a[j] >= a[j + 1])
      sd[j] += sd[j + 1];
  }
  string s1 = "Yes", s2 = "No";
  fr(m) {
    int l, r;
    cin >> l >> r;
    if (r - l <= 1)
      cout << s1 << '\n';
    else {
      int x = l + si[l] - 1;
      x += sd[x] - l;
      if (x >= r - l + 1)
        cout << s1 << '\n';
      else
        cout << s2 << '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: Avoiding flushing the output buffer after every query might result in the output appearing in a different order than expected if the program crashes or is interrupted. This is typically not a problem for competitive programming problems, but it can cause issues in other situations.
