The given code is already quite efficient, but there are a few small changes that can be made to potentially increase the performance.

1. **Remove unnecessary includes:** There are multiple includes in the code which are not being used. Reducing these can slightly decrease compilation time and can make the program more readable.

2. **Avoid defining macros:** Defining macros like `#define fr(n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)` can decrease readability and can potentially lead to bugs. Writing out the for loop in full each time makes it clear what is happening.

3. **Avoid string creation for "Yes" and "No":** There is no need to create strings for "Yes" and "No". They can be printed directly which may lead to a slight performance gain.

4. **Avoid unnecessary operations:** The line `x += sd[x] - l;` can be replaced with `x = sd[x];` because the `- l` part is unnecessary and doesn't change the result.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define mod 1000000007
#define csl ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL)
signed main() {
  csl;
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  int a[n + 1], si[n + 1], sd[n + 1];
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    si[i] = sd[i] = 1;
  }
  for (int j = n - 1; j >= 1; j--) {
    if (a[j + 1] >= a[j])
      si[j] += si[j + 1];
    if (a[j] >= a[j + 1])
      sd[j] += sd[j + 1];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int l, r;
    cin >> l >> r;
    if (r - l <= 1)
      cout << "Yes" << endl;
    else {
      int x = l + si[l] - 1;
      x = sd[x];
      if (x >= r - l + 1)
        cout << "Yes" << endl;
      else
        cout << "No" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note: Please be aware that the `#define int long long` is a macro that replaces all instances of `int` with `long long` in the code. This might not be the intended behaviour in all cases. Consider using `typedef long long int` if you want to create a new name for `long long`.
