Here are some optimizations we could make:

1. Instead of using std::string for "Yes" and "No", we could use const char* which can save some memory.
2. The macros fr, fr1, and fr2 are not called anywhere in the code and can be removed.
3. The macros pb, mp, and pii, are also not used in the code and can be removed.
4. The libraries <algorithm>, <cctype>, <climits>, <cmath>, <cstring>, <map>, <numeric>, <queue>, <set>, <sstream>, <stack>, <unordered_map>, <unordered_set> are not used and can be removed.
5. The macro vi is not used in the code and can be removed.
6. The macro csl is not used and can be removed.
7. The macro mod is not used and can be removed.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#define int long long

signed main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  int a[n + 1], si[n + 1], sd[n + 1];
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    si[i] = sd[i] = 1;
  }
  for (int j = n - 1; j >= 1; j--) {
    if (a[j + 1] >= a[j])
      si[j] += si[j + 1];
    if (a[j] >= a[j + 1])
      sd[j] += sd[j + 1];
  }
  const char* s1 = "Yes";
  const char* s2 = "No";
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int l, r;
    cin >> l >> r;
    if (r - l <= 1)
      cout << s1 << "\n";
    else {
      int x = l + si[l] - 1;
      x += sd[x] - l;
      if (x >= r - l + 1)
        cout << s1 << "\n";
      else
        cout << s2 << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This code is optimized for both running time and memory usage. It only includes the libraries that are actually used, and uses `const char*` instead of `std::string` to store the "Yes" and "No" responses, which saves memory. It also removes the unused macros, which makes the code cleaner and easier to read.
