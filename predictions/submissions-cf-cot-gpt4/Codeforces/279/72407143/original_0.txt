This program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Instead of defining the macro `fr`, `fr1`, and `fr2` for simple loops, we can use normal loop syntax. This makes the code easier to read and understand.
2. The `string` variables `s1` and `s2` can be replaced with direct string literals. This reduces the amount of memory used.
3. The `mod` macro is not used in the code and can be removed.
4. The `pb`, `pii`, `mp`, `vi` macros are not used in the code and can be removed.
5. Unnecessary headers can be removed. It improves the compile time.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define csl ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL)
#define int long long

signed main() {
  csl;
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  int a[n + 1], si[n + 1], sd[n + 1];
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    si[i] = sd[i] = 1;
  }
  
  for (int j = n - 1; j >= 1; j--) {
    if (a[j + 1] >= a[j])
      si[j] += si[j + 1];
    if (a[j] >= a[j + 1])
      sd[j] += sd[j + 1];
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int l, r;
    cin >> l >> r;
    if (r - l <= 1)
      cout << "Yes" << endl;
    else {
      int x = l + si[l] - 1;
      x += sd[x] - l;
      if (x >= r - l + 1)
        cout << "Yes" << endl;
      else
        cout << "No" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized program is now more readable and uses less memory. The unnecessary headers and macros have been removed. The macro `fr` has been replaced with the regular for loop syntax. The `string` variables `s1` and `s2` have been replaced with direct string literals.
