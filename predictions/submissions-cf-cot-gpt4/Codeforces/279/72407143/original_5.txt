This program seems to be solving a competitive programming problem. It's hard to tell without context, but it appears to be checking if a sequence of numbers is sorted (either non-decreasing or non-increasing) in certain intervals. 

There are a few ways we can optimize this program:

1. Avoiding unnecessary string assignments: The strings "Yes" and "No" are used for output, but they are assigned every time in the loop. We can declare them as constant strings outside the loop to avoid unnecessary assignments.

2. Reducing the use of macros: Although macros like '#define' can make the code more readable, they also add an overhead because they are processed by the preprocessor before the actual compilation. In this case, 'fr' and 'fr1' macros are not used, so they can be removed. 

3. Reducing array size: This program uses arrays 'si' and 'sd' of size 'n+1', but 'si[0]' and 'sd[0]' are never used. Thus, we can just declare them of size 'n' and adjust indices accordingly.

4. Avoiding repeated calculations: Inside the loop, 'r-l' is calculated twice. We can calculate it once and store in a variable.

5. Using 'endl': 'endl' not only inserts a newline, but also flushes the output buffer, which can be inefficient. We can use "\n" instead.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cctype>
#include <climits>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <math.h>
#include <numeric>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <sstream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define mod 1000000007
#define csl ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL)
#define pb push_back
#define pii pair<int, int>
#define mp make_pair
#define fr2(j, x, n) for (int j = x; j < n; j++)
#define vi vector<int>

signed main() {
  csl;
  const string s1 = "Yes", s2 = "No";
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  int a[n], si[n], sd[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    si[i] = sd[i] = 1;
  }
  for (int j = n - 2; j >= 0; j--) {
    if (a[j + 1] >= a[j])
      si[j] += si[j + 1];
    if (a[j] >= a[j + 1])
      sd[j] += sd[j + 1];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int l, r;
    cin >> l >> r;
    l--; r--;
    if (r - l <= 1)
      cout << s1 << "\n";
    else {
      int diff = r - l;
      int x = l + si[l] - 1;
      x += sd[x] - l;
      if (x >= diff + 1)
        cout << s1 << "\n";
      else
        cout << s2 << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Remember to test the optimized program thoroughly to ensure correctness.
