Here are some potential optimization steps:

1. Minimize header inclusion: Many headers are included but not used, which will increase compile time. Some headers are included more than once (like `<cmath>` and `<math.h>`), which is redundant.

2. Use of vector instead of arrays: C++ std::vector is safer and more flexible to use than an array, and it provides dynamic size handling.

3. Use of `'\n'` instead of `endl`: `endl` causes a flush operation, which can be slower than using `'\n'` to produce a new line.

4. Use of prefix increment operator: Prefix increment operator is often faster than postfix increment operator in C++ because the latter involves a copy operation.

5. Avoid string creation in each loop iteration: The strings "Yes" and "No" are created in each loop iteration which is inefficient. It's better to define them once outside the loop.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define int long long
#define pb push_back
#define pii pair<int, int>
#define mp make_pair
#define vi vector<int>

signed main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  vi a(n + 1), si(n + 1, 1), sd(n + 1, 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  for (int j = n - 1; j >= 1; --j) {
    if (a[j + 1] >= a[j])
      ++si[j] += si[j + 1];
    if (a[j] >= a[j + 1])
      ++sd[j] += sd[j + 1];
  }
  string s1 = "Yes", s2 = "No";
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    int l, r;
    cin >> l >> r;
    if (r - l <= 1)
      cout << s1 << '\n';
    else {
      int x = l + si[l] - 1;
      x += sd[x] - l;
      if (x >= r - l + 1)
        cout << s1 << '\n';
      else
        cout << s2 << '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
