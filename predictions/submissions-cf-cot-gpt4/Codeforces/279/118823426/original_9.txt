The original code is already fairly optimized, using efficient algorithms and data structures. However, there are still a few minor improvements we can make:

1. Avoid repeated calculations: In the loop where the program calculates the maximum length, the calculation `b[i - 1] + t` is always the same. We can calculate it once and store it in a variable, avoiding repeated calculations.

2. Use `std::array` instead of C-style array: `std::array` is a safer, more modern alternative to C-style arrays. It provides the same functionality but adds bounds checking and other useful features.

3. Avoid unnecessary use of `auto`: While `auto` can be useful in certain situations, in this case, it just obscures the type of `it` and doesn't add any benefits. We can specify the type explicitly for better readability.

4. Avoid unnecessary use of `typedef`: `typedef` is a keyword in C++ programming language to assign alternative names to existing types. However, in this code, it is used but not necessary. We can remove it to make the code cleaner.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define fastIO() ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(nullptr)
#define rep(i, a, n) for (ll i = a; i < n; i++)

using namespace std;
using ll = long long int;

ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  if (a < 0)
    a = -a;
  if (b < 0)
    b = -b;
  if (a < b)
    swap(a, b);
  if (b == 0)
    return a;
  if (a % b == 0)
    return b;
  return gcd(b, a % b);
}

ll lcm(ll a, ll b) {
  ll c = gcd(a, b);
  return a * b / c;
}

int main() {
  fastIO();
    ll n, t;
    cin >> n >> t;
    array<ll, 10000> a;
    rep(i, 0, n) cin >> a[i];
    array<ll, 10001> b = {0};
    ll sum = 0;
    rep(i, 0, n) {
      sum += a[i];
      b[i + 1] = sum;
    }
    int maxlen = 0;
    rep(i, 1, n + 1) {
      ll to = b[i - 1] + t;
      ll* it = upper_bound(b.begin(), b.end(), to);
      int len = (it - &b[0]) - i;
      maxlen = max(maxlen, len);
    }
    cout << maxlen << " ";
}
```
Note: This code assumes that the maximum size of the array 'a' is 10000. If it's different, you should adjust the size accordingly.
