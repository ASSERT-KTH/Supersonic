This code can be optimized by reducing the number of calculations performed inside the loop. 

In the given code, the `upper_bound` function is used inside a loop which makes the overall complexity of the code O(n log n). 

We can avoid this by using two pointers instead of the `upper_bound` function. We will set two pointers at the start of the array. The first pointer will be incremented in each iteration of the loop. The second pointer will be incremented until the sum of the subarray from the first pointer to the second pointer is less than or equal to 't'. The length of the subarray from the first pointer to the second pointer will be the maximum length of the subarray whose sum is less than or equal to 't'. 

This optimization will reduce the time complexity of the code to O(n) because each element of the array will be processed exactly twice, once by the first pointer and once by the second pointer.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int ll;
#define fastIO() ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(nullptr)
#define rep(i, a, n) for (ll i = a; i < n; i++)

int main() {
  fastIO();
  ll n, t;
  cin >> n >> t;
  ll a[n];
  rep(i, 0, n) cin >> a[i];
  ll sum = 0;
  int maxlen = 0;
  for(int start = 0, end = 0; end < n; end++) {
    sum += a[end];
    while(sum > t && start <= end) {
      sum -= a[start];
      start++;
    }
    maxlen = max(maxlen, end - start + 1);
  }
  cout << maxlen << " ";
}
```
In the optimized code, I also removed the unused functions, typedefs, and macros to reduce the memory usage.
