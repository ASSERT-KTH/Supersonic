Firstly, the use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` should be avoided. It includes almost all standard library headers, which can lead to slower compile times. Instead, we should include only those headers that are actually needed. 

Next, 'fastIO()' macro is used to speed up I/O operations. This is unnecessary in the modern C++ compiler.

Also, 'using namespace std' is generally considered bad practice. It can lead to name clashes, as it includes all the identifiers in the 'std' namespace in the global namespace.

In the 'gcd()' function, a simpler and more efficient implementation is possible using the Euclidean algorithm. 

In the 'pow()' function, the use of the bitwise operator is a good approach but also the 'ret' variable should be updated within the while loop.

In the 'modexp()' function, the use of the bitwise operator is a good approach but we can directly adjust the 'ret' variable within the while loop.

In the 'popcount()' function, it is more efficient to use the built-in '__builtin_popcountll()' function for 'long long' types.

Finally, a static array 'b' is declared in the 'main()' function. This array will be on the stack, which has limited size. If 'n' is large, this could lead to a stack overflow. So, better to declare it dynamically. 

Now, here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::vector;
using std::upper_bound;

typedef long long ll;

ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  while (b != 0) {
    a %= b;
    std::swap(a, b);
  }
  return a;
}

ll lcm(ll a, ll b) {
  ll c = gcd(a, b);
  return a / c * b;
}

ll pow(ll n, ll k) {
  ll ret = 1;
  while (k > 0) {
    if (k & 1)
      ret *= n;
    n *= n;
    k >>= 1;
  }
  return ret;
}

ll modexp(ll n, ll k, ll md) {
  ll ret = 1;
  n %= md;
  while (k > 0) {
    if (k & 1) ret = (ret * n) % md;
    n = (n * n) % md;
    k >>= 1;
  }
  return ret;
}

ll popcount(ll n) {
  return __builtin_popcountll(n);
}

int main() {
  ll n, t;
  cin >> n >> t;
  vector<ll> a(n);
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i];
  vector<ll> b(n + 1, 0);
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) b[i + 1] = b[i] + a[i];
  int maxlen = 0;
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    ll to = b[i - 1] + t;
    auto it = upper_bound(b.begin(), b.end(), to);
    int len = (it - b.begin()) - i;
    maxlen = std::max(maxlen, len);
  }
  cout << maxlen << " ";
  return 0;
}
```
