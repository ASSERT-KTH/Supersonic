Here are the steps that can be used to optimize the given C++ program:

1. Avoid `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes lots of unnecessary functionality which increases the compile time. Include only the libraries that you need.

2. Avoid `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(nullptr)`: This is used to sync the C++ standard streams with the standard C streams and to untie `cin` and `cout`. These lines can be useful when the program does lots of alternating between input and output. However, in your case, you don't need it.

3. Use `const` qualifier for variables which are not modified. This can potentially improve performance since the compiler can make certain assumptions about the value of the variable.

4. Avoid `typedef` if possible, use `using` instead. It is more versatile and considered a better practice in modern C++.

5. The `gcd` function can be optimized by using the ternary operator instead of `if` statements for simplicity and reduced lines of code.

6. The `pow` function can be optimized by using the bitwise operators instead of division and modulus operators.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
using VI = vector<int>;
using ll = long long int;
using VLL = vector<ll>;
using PII = pair<int, int>;
using PLL = pair<ll, ll>;
using db = double;
using maxheap = priority_queue<ll>;
using minheap = priority_queue<ll, vector<ll>, greater<ll>>;
#define MOD 1000000007
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, n) for (ll i = a; i < n; i++)
#define per(i, a, n) for (ll i = n - 1; i >= a; i--)
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  a = abs(a);
  b = abs(b);
  return (b == 0) ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}
ll lcm(ll a, ll b) {
  return a * b / gcd(a, b);
}
ll pow(ll n, ll k) {
  ll ret = 1, now = n;
  while (k > 0) {
    if (k & 1)
      ret *= now;
    now *= now;
    k >>= 1;
  }
  return ret;
}
ll modexp(ll n, ll k, const ll md = MOD) {
  ll ret = 1, now = n % md;
  while (k > 0) {
    if (k & 1) {
      ret *= now;
      ret %= md;
    }
    now *= now;
    now %= md;
    k >>= 1;
  }
  return ret;
}
ll popcount(ll n) {
  ll ret = 0;
  while (n > 0) {
    ret += n & 1;
    n >>= 1;
  }
  return ret;
}
int main() {
  ll n, t;
  cin >> n >> t;
  VLL a(n), b(n + 1, 0);
  ll sum = 0;
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    cin >> a[i];
    sum += a[i];
    b[i + 1] = sum;
  }
  int maxlen = 0;
  rep(i, 1, n + 1) {
    ll to = b[i - 1] + t;
    auto it = upper_bound(all(b), to);
    int len = (it - b.begin()) - i;
    maxlen = max(maxlen, len);
  }
  cout << maxlen;
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that although these changes may improve the performance, the improvements might not be noticeable for small inputs.
