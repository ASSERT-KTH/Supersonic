Step 1: Keep only the necessary #include statements:
The first line of code "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" is a header file in g++ that includes every standard library. This is bad practice as it increases compilation time and uses more memory. We should only include what we need.

Step 2: Avoid using "using namespace std"
It is a bad practice to use "using namespace std" in a global scope. This can lead to name clashes in larger projects and problems in code understanding and maintenance. We will use the std:: prefix where needed.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary typedef
The typedef keyword is used to give an alternative name to a type. Here, some of them like VI, VLL, PII, PLL, minheap, maxheap are not being used, so we can remove them.

Step 4: Use constexpr for constants
Using the keyword constexpr tells the compiler that the value of the variable will not change and the value is evaluated at compile time. Here, MOD can be declared as constexpr.

Step 5: Avoid Macros
Macros are preprocessed which means that the compiler does not see them. They just replace the code before the compilation which can lead to many issues. For example, we can replace macros "fastIO", "DOTEST", "TEST", "all", "rep", "per" with equivalent C++ code. 

Step 6: Optimize gcd function
The gcd function can be optimized by using the standard C++ function `std::gcd`.

Step 7: Avoid unused functions
Remove lcm, pow, modexp, popcount as they are not used anywhere in the code.

Step 8: Use std::vector instead of C-style array
std::vector is a dynamic array that can grow and shrink in size. It also provides a lot of built-in functions that make it easy to work with.

Step 9: Use std::upper_bound correctly
std::upper_bound performs binary search in O(log N) time complexity. To use it correctly, we need to pass range [first, last) where 'last' is not included in the search.

The optimized program is:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

constexpr int MOD = 1000000007;

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);
  
  long long n, t;
  std::cin >> n >> t;
  std::vector<long long> a(n), b(n + 1, 0);
  
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  long long sum = 0;
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    sum += a[i];
    b[i + 1] = sum;
  }
  
  int maxlen = 0;
  for (long long i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    long long to = b[i - 1] + t;
    auto it = std::upper_bound(b.begin(), b.begin() + n + 1, to);
    int len = it - (b.begin() + i);
    maxlen = std::max(maxlen, len);
  }
  
  std::cout << maxlen << " ";
}
```
