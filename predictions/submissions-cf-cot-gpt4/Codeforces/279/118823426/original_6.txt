The given C/C++ program is already quite optimized for running time and memory usage. However, there are still a few small changes that can be made to further optimize this program.

1. **Avoiding the use of namespace std**: It's considered a bad practice to use the entire namespace std, as it includes a lot of functions, classes, etc., and can lead to name clashes. Instead, you can specify which functions you are using from the namespace.

2. **Avoiding use of redundant macros**: The program includes several macros that are not used, such as `VI`, `VLL`, `PII`, `PLL`, `db`, `maxheap`, `minheap`, `MOD`, `pb`, `mp`, `DOTEST`, `TEST`, and `per`. Removing these will reduce memory usage.

3. **Use of STL** : The given program uses `upper_bound` function from STL which is a binary search operation and has a time complexity of O(log n). This is optimal for this use case and cannot be further optimized.

4. **Use of static array**: The given program uses static array `a` and `b`. Since the size of array 'n' is read at runtime, use of dynamic array or vector would be a better practice. However, as per the constraints of the problem statement, we are limited to making small changes and cannot completely rewrite the program.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::ios_base;
using std::upper_bound;

#define fastIO() ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(nullptr)
#define rep(i, a, n) for (long long int i = a; i < n; i++)

int main() {
  fastIO();
  {
    long long int n, t;
    cin >> n >> t;
    long long int a[n];
    rep(i, 0, n) cin >> a[i];
    long long int b[n + 1] = {0};
    long long int sum = 0;
    rep(i, 0, n) {
      sum += a[i];
      b[i + 1] = sum;
    }
    int maxlen = 0;
    rep(i, 1, n + 1) {
      long long int to = b[i - 1] + t;
      auto it = upper_bound(b, b + n + 1, to);
      int len = (it - b) - i;
      maxlen = std::max(maxlen, len);
    }
    cout << maxlen << " ";
  }
}
```

In this optimized code, I have removed unnecessary macros and avoided the use of the entire namespace std. Moreover, the use of STL function `upper_bound` and static array are retained as per the problem constraints. The given code is already optimized for time complexity with the use of binary search function in STL, hence no changes are made in this respect.
