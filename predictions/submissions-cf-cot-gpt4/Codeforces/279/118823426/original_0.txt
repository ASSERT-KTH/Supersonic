Here are the optimizations that can be applied to this code:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of files, which increases compilation time. It's better to include only those files which are really needed.

2. Avoid `using namespace std`: This can cause name clashes because it imports all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace.

3. The code is using `typedef` which is a C-style convention. In C++, using the `using` keyword is a more modern and preferred way to create type aliases.

4. Do not use macros if not necessary. For example, `fastIO()` and `DOTEST(t)` are not necessary and can be replaced with regular function calls.

5. The pow() function can be replaced by the standard library function std::pow().

6. The popcount() function can be replaced by the standard library function std::bitset::count().

7. If C++17 is supported, you can use std::gcd() and std::lcm() instead of defining your own.

8. Use `std::vector` instead of C-style arrays.

9. The initialization of array `b` can be moved out of the loop to save time and improve readability.

10. Instead of using `auto`, specify the type clearly for better readability.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using VI = std::vector<int>;
using ll = long long int;
using VLL = std::vector<ll>;
using PII = std::pair<int, int>;
using PLL = std::pair<ll, ll>;
using db = double;
using maxheap = std::priority_queue<ll>;
using minheap = std::priority_queue<ll, std::vector<ll>, std::greater<ll>>;
constexpr ll MOD = 1000000007;

#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);
  
  ll n, t;
  std::cin >> n >> t;
  VLL a(n);
  for(auto &ele : a) std::cin >> ele;

  VLL b(n + 1 , 0);
  ll sum = 0;
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum += a[i];
    b[i + 1] = sum;
  }
  
  int maxlen = 0;
  for(ll i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
    ll to = b[i - 1] + t;
    VLL::iterator it = std::upper_bound(b.begin(), b.end(), to);
    int len = (it - b.begin()) - i;
    maxlen = std::max(maxlen, len);
  }
  std::cout << maxlen << " ";
}
```

Note: The optimization of the code is dependent on the C++ standard being used. For C++17 and onwards, the gcd, lcm, pow, and popcount optimizations apply.
