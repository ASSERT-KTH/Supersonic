Here are the steps to optimize the code:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, increasing the compilation time. Include only necessary libraries.

2. Remove `typedef` definitions if they are not used anywhere in the code. It will save memory.

3. Avoid using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(nullptr);` as these are not used anywhere in the code.

4. In some places, you've used loop to perform mathematical operations, like in `pow` and `popcount` functions. It's better to use standard library functions.

5. In the `gcd` function, the edge case of `a % b == 0` is not needed. The recursive call will handle this case when `b == 0`.

6. Remove `TEST` macro as it's not used anywhere in the code.

7. Remove the extra curly brackets in `main` function.

8. Use `std::vector` instead of C-style arrays. They are safer and provide more functionality.

9. Use `std::partial_sum` instead of the loop to calculate the prefix sum array.

10. Remove `ll b[n + 1] = {0};` and `ll sum = 0;` since we are using `std::partial_sum`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>

using ll = long long int;

ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  if (a < 0)
    a = -a;
  if (b < 0)
    b = -b;
  if (a < b)
    std::swap(a, b);
  if (b == 0)
    return a;
  return gcd(b, a % b);
}

ll lcm(ll a, ll b) {
  ll c = gcd(a, b);
  return a * b / c;
}

ll modexp(ll n, ll k, ll md) {
  ll ret = 1;
  ll now = n;
  now %= md;
  while (k > 0) {
    if (k % 2 == 1) {
      ret *= now;
      ret %= md;
    }
    now *= now;
    now %= md;
    k /= 2;
  }
  return ret;
}

ll popcount(ll n) {
  return __builtin_popcountll(n);
}

int main() {
  ll n, t;
  std::cin >> n >> t;
  std::vector<ll> a(n);
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) std::cin >> a[i];
  std::vector<ll> b(n + 1);
  std::partial_sum(a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin() + 1);
  int maxlen = 0;
  for (ll i = 1; i < n + 1; ++i) {
    ll to = b[i - 1] + t;
    auto it = std::upper_bound(b.begin(), b.end(), to);
    int len = it - b.begin() - i;
    maxlen = std::max(maxlen, len);
  }
  std::cout << maxlen << " ";
}
```
The code is now optimized for both running time and memory usage.
