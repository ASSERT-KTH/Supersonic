The given C++ program is already optimized for memory usage and running time. However, there are some small optimizations and good practices that can be applied:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes quite a lot of standard library files and thus increases compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary header files.

2. Avoid defining macros for common C++ keywords or operations (`#define I inline`, `#define reg register int`, `#define R register`, `#define cr const reg &`): These macros may make the code harder to read and understand, and they don't provide any optimization. Modern compilers are smart enough to decide when to inline a function or use a register for a variable. Also, the use of `register` keyword is deprecated in C++17.

3. There's no need to define the constant `nl` for the newline character and it's not used in the code. 

4. The `divisors` array can be made constant as it's not being modified. 

5. Always remember to close any files you open if you're using file operations.

Here's the optimized version of the code with the above points taken into consideration:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int divisors[] = {4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444, 447, 474, 477, 744, 747, 774, 777};

void solve() {
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < 14; i++) {
    if (n % divisors[i] == 0) {
      cout << "YES\n";
      return;
    }
  }
  cout << "NO\n";
}

int main() {
#ifdef APAN
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  solve();
#ifdef APAN
  fclose(stdin);
  fclose(stdout);
#endif
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The `APAN` flag and the related file operations seem to be for debugging or testing purposes. If this is not required, you can remove these parts for further optimization.
