First of all, we can see that the program is a C++ program and is designed to check if a given number is divisible by any of the numbers in the array `divisors[]`.

Here are possible optimization steps that can be done for this code:
1. The `divisors[]` array can be declared as a constant since it doesn't change throughout the program. By making it constant, it can further optimize memory.
2. The macro `For` is defined to run a loop from a given starting point to the end. We can use the standard `for` loop in C++ instead, which would make the code easier to understand and maintain.
3. The `#define I inline` and `#define R register` are not needed as modern compilers automatically inline functions and manage register usage. Removing them can simplify the code.
4. The `#define reg register int` and `#define cr const reg &` are also not needed as modern compilers manage register usage and `const int&` is more readable and standard. 
5. The `#define mp make_pair` and `#define pb push_back` are not used in the code and can be removed. 
6. The `#define fio ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` can be moved into the `main()` function to improve readability.
7. The `#define ll long long` and `#define ld long double` can be replaced with using `long long` and `long double` directly for better readability. 
8. The `#ifdef APAN` condition is not needed for the general case and can be removed.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const char nl = '\n';
const int divisors[] = {4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444, 447, 474, 477, 744, 747, 774, 777};

inline int _min(const int& x, const int& y) { return x < y ? x : y; }
inline int _max(const int& x, const int& y) { return x > y ? x : y; }

void solve() {
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < 14; i++) {
    if (n % divisors[i] == 0) {
      cout << "YES\n";
      return;
    }
  }
  cout << "NO\n";
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations are minor and may not produce a significant improvement in performance or memory usage. The main improvements are in code readability and maintenance.
