The given C++ program is already pretty optimized, but there are still few possible improvements:

1. Using `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `std::cin.tie(NULL);` can make I/O operations faster, but they are not always necessary, especially for small programs. In this case, the program is small and these two lines can be removed.

2. `vector<int>` and `pair<int, int>` are not used in the code, so the corresponding definitions (`#define vi vector<int>` and `#define pi pair<int, int>`) can be removed.

3. `#define I inline` and `#define R register` are not used in the code, so these definitions can be removed.

4. The `divisors` array can be made a constant, because it does not change throughout the program.

5. Functions `_min` and `_max` are not used in the code, so these can be removed.

6. In the `solve()` function, the `for` loop can be replaced with a range-based `for` loop, which is easier to read and reduces the chance of off-by-one errors.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define For(i, a, b) for (ll i = a; i < b; i++)
const char nl = '\n';
const int divisors[] = {4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444, 447, 474, 477, 744, 747, 774, 777};
void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  for(const auto &div : divisors) {
    if (n % div == 0) {
      cout << "YES\n";
      return;
    }
  }
  cout << "NO\n";
}
int main() {
#ifdef APAN
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
