Optimization Steps:

1. Remove the unused macros and definitions which are not used in the program to reduce memory usage. 
2. The `fio` macro is not required in C++. It's generally used to sync C++'s stdio with C's stdio. In your case, you're not mixing any C and C++, so you can remove it.
3. Using `register` keyword with variables doesn't guarantee that the variable will be stored in the register. It's a hint given to the compiler. Modern compilers are smart enough to optimize the code, so we can remove them.
4. The `divisors` array can be made constant since we're not modifying it anywhere in the program. This will allow the compiler to make further optimizations. 
5. The `_min` and `_max` functions are not used in this program, so we can remove them.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long

const ll divisors[] = {4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444, 447, 474, 477, 744, 747, 774, 777};

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  for(int i = 0; i < 14; i++) {
    if (n % divisors[i] == 0) {
      cout << "YES\n";
      return;
    }
  }
  cout << "NO\n";
}

int main() {
#ifdef APAN
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the `APAN` macro is not defined in this program. If it's defined somewhere else in your project, you can leave the `freopen` calls. If not, you can remove these lines as well.
