Here are the optimizations we can make:

1. Reduce the number of global variables, as they consume memory throughout the life cycle of the program. Here, we can move the 'divisors' array and 'nl' constant into the 'solve' function, as they are only used there.

2. We can remove unused macros like 'ld', 'vi', 'pi', 'mp', 'pb', and 'R'. Removing these macros will not affect the functionality of the program, but it reduces the complexity of the code.

3. There is no need to define '_min' and '_max' functions as inline functions, because they are not used in the code. It's better to remove them.

4. The 'freopen' function calls for reading from 'input.txt' and writing to 'output.txt' are placed directly in the main function. It would be better to move them into the 'solve' function and only call them when the 'APAN' symbol is defined. This would avoid unnecessary function calls and IO operations when 'APAN' is not defined.

5. Remove 'fio' macro and write 'ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);' directly in the 'main' function to reduce code complexity.

The optimized code looks like this:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define For(i, a, b) for (ll i = a; i < b; i++)
#define reg register int
#define cr const reg &

void solve() {
  const char nl = '\n';
  int divisors[] = {4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444, 447, 474, 477, 744, 747, 774, 777};
  
#ifdef APAN
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif

  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  For(i, 0, 14) {
    if (n % divisors[i] == 0) {
      cout << "YES\n";
      return;
    }
  }
  cout << "NO\n";
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
