The given C/C++ program is already quite optimized, but there are still some small modifications that can be made to improve efficiency. Here are the steps for optimization:

1. The `divisors` array is only used in the `solve` function, so it's better to declare it inside the function rather than globally. This way, the memory for the array will be released once the function finishes execution, reducing memory usage.
2. The use of `#define` for simple loops like `For` can be replaced with the regular `for` loop. This is more of a practice optimization, as it improves readability and maintainability of the code.
3. The use of `#define` for `mp` and `pb` can be avoided as they are not used in the code. Removing these unnecessary definitions can make the code cleaner and more readable.
4. The use of `#define` for creating aliases for long keywords like `long long` can be avoided as they are not used multiple times in the code. Using the original types makes the code more understandable.
5. Function calls like `_min` and `_max` are not used in the code, so they can be removed to make the code cleaner and more efficient.
6. The use of `#define` for `cin.tie(NULL);` could be avoided and can be directly used in the `main` function. 
   
Here's the optimized code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int divisors[] = {4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444, 447, 474, 477, 744, 747, 774, 777};
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < 14; i++) {
    if (n % divisors[i] == 0) {
      cout << "YES\n";
      return;
    }
  }
  cout << "NO\n";
}

int main() {
#ifdef APAN
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations are minor and may not considerably impact the execution time or memory usage, but they do improve the code's readability and maintainability.
