Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes unnecessary header files, increasing the compilation time. Instead, only include the necessary header files.

2. The use of macros can hinder readability, it's better to use functions or constants directly instead of defining macros.

3. Manual inlining of the function `_max` and `_min` is not necessary. The compiler will automatically inline functions when it deems necessary.

4. Avoid using `freopen` for redirecting input and output. This function uses more memory and time compared to command line redirection.

5. Avoid using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);`. These lines disable synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams, which might cause unpredictable outcomes if you are using C functions.

6. In the `solve` function, we can break the loop when `n` is less than `divisors[i]`, because `n` can't be divided by `divisors[i]`.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const char nl = '\n';
const long long divisors[] = {4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444, 447, 474, 477, 744, 747, 774, 777};

void solve() {
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  for(int i = 0; i < 14; i++) {
    if (n < divisors[i]) break;
    if (n % divisors[i] == 0) {
      cout << "YES\n";
      return;
    }
  }
  cout << "NO\n";
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
This program does the same thing as the original one, but it's more efficient and readable.
