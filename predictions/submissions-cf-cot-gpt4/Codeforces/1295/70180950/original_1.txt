This program is already well optimized in terms of data structure usage and algorithmic complexity. However, we can still make some small modifications to it in terms of code readability and usage of unnecessary variables which will indirectly optimize the memory usage.

Here are the steps for optimization:

1. Remove the 'using namespace std'. It's a bad practice to use this statement as it introduces the entire std namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to name clashes.

2. The function `f(ll x, ll y)` is just returning the minimum of two values. We can replace this function with `std::min` which is a built-in function in C++ and it makes the code more readable.

3. The `inf` constant is declared as a long long int, but it is used to compare with the result of a function that returns a long long. We can change its type to long long, to avoid unnecessary casting.

4. Some variables like `pll` and `pb` are declared but never used in the program. We can remove these unused variables to clean up the code and reduce memory usage.

5. The `struct node` can be defined inside the main function if it is not used anywhere else in the code. This can help to encapsulate the code better and make it easier to understand.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
typedef long long ll;
typedef long double ld;
const ll maxn = ll(2e5) + 11;
const ll inf = ll(1e15) + 12;
const ll mod = ll(1e9) + 7;
ll n;
ll a[maxn], ps[maxn], p[maxn], pref[maxn];

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio();
  
  struct node {
    ll l, mid, r, val, add;
    node *left, *right;
    node(ll l, ll r) : l(l), r(r) {
      add = 0;
      mid = (l + r) / 2;
      val = 0;
      left = right = nullptr;
    }
  };

  cin >> n;
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ll cur;
    cin >> cur;
    p[i] = cur;
    ps[cur - 1] = i;
  }
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ll cur;
    cin >> cur;
    a[i] = cur;
    if (i == 0) {
      pref[i] = cur;
    } else
      pref[i] = pref[i - 1] + cur;
  }
  node *root = new node(0, n);
  build(root);
  ll ans = std::min(a[0], a[n - 1]);
  ll mus = 0;
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    add_val(root, ps[i], n, -2 * a[ps[i]]);
    mus += a[ps[i]];
    ll cur = get_min(root, 0, n) + mus;
    ans = std::min(ans, cur);
  }
  cout << ans << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Make sure to define the functions `build`, `push`, `add_val`, and `get_min` before calling them in the main function.
