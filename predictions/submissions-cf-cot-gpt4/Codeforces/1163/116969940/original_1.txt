1. The first optimization can be made in the way the array `mp[]` is filled with zeros. Instead of using `memset(mp, 0, sizeof(mp))`, we can take advantage of the fact that global and static variables in C++ are automatically initialized to zero. So we can just declare `mp[]` as a global variable and remove the `memset` line.

2. The second optimization is in the way the `multiset` and `set` are used. The `set` `cst` is used just to keep track of unique elements in the input. Instead of using a `set`, we can use a simple integer variable to keep track of the count of unique elements. Whenever a new element is encountered in the input, we increment this variable. This saves memory as an integer variable uses less memory than a `set`.

3. The third optimization is in the way the `multiset` `st` is used. Instead of inserting and erasing elements from `st` for each input number, we can maintain two variables `f` and `s`, and update their values directly. This will save time as insertion and deletion in a `multiset` takes O(log n) time complexity, while updating a variable takes O(1) time complexity.

4. The fourth optimization is in the use of the `map` `cnt`. Instead of using a `map`, we can use an array to keep track of the count of each number. This will save memory as an array uses less memory than a `map`, and also time as accessing an element in an array takes O(1) time complexity, while accessing an element in a `map` takes O(log n) time complexity.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define pb push_back
#define ld long double
#define ll long long
#define lld long double
#define print(x) cerr << "[" << #x << ": " << x << "]";
#define println(x) cerr << "[" << #x << ": " << x << "]\n";
#define show(v) for (int i = 0; i < (int)v.size(); ++i) cout << v[i] << (i == (int)v.size() - 1 ? "\n" : " ");
#define debug(v) for (int i = 0; i < (int)v.size() - 1; ++i) { print(i); cout << "   "; println(v[i]) }
using namespace std;
clock_t time_p = clock();
void Time() {
  time_p = clock() - time_p;
  cerr << "Time Taken : " << (float)(time_p) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC << "\n";
}

Please note that the optimization of the program highly depends on the specific problem and constraints of the problem, and the optimized program may not always produce the correct result for all possible inputs. So please test the optimized program with various test cases to make sure it works correctly.
