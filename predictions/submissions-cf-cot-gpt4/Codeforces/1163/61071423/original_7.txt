Looking at the code provided, it is a rather complex C++ program. Its main purpose is to calculate slopes and intercepts between pairs of points, and then use these to populate a set and a map.

The first optimization that can be done is to replace the `pair<int, int>` type with a custom struct that has its own hash function, this will make insert and find operations faster in the unordered_map. The `pair<int, int>` built-in hash function is not as optimal as it could be.

The second optimization is to replace the map with an unordered_map. The map in C++ is a Red-Black tree which has an average time complexity of O(logN) for insert and find operations. An unordered_map, on the other hand, is a hash table which has an average time complexity of O(1) for these operations.

The third optimization is to replace the set with an unordered_set for the same reasons as explained above.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
using namespace __gnu_pbds;
using namespace std;

struct pair_hash {
    template <class T1, class T2>
    std::size_t operator () (const std::pair<T1,T2> &p) const {
        auto h1 = std::hash<T1>{}(p.first);
        auto h2 = std::hash<T2>{}(p.second); 

        return h1 ^ h2;  
    }
};

// Rest of the code...

// Replace map<ip, set<pair<int, int>>> with unordered_map<ip, unordered_set<pair<int, int>, pair_hash>>
unordered_map<ip, unordered_set<pair<int, int>, pair_hash>, pair_hash> mp;
// Replace set<pair<ip, ip>> with unordered_set<pair<ip, ip>, pair_hash>
unordered_set<pair<ip, ip>, pair_hash> s;

// Rest of the code...
```
