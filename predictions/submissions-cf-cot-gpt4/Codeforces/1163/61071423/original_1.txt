The provided code is a C++ program that appears to solve a computational geometry problem. It reads a set of point coordinates, then calculates and stores the slopes and intercepts of the lines formed by each pair of points. The output of the program is calculated from the size of the sets of unique slopes and intercepts.

Here are possible ways to optimize the given program:

1. Memory Optimization:
    - The array 'a' is declared with a variable size, which is technically not allowed in C++ (although some compilers allow it). Instead, we should use a vector, which is a dynamic array that can change its size.
    - We're storing a lot of pairs and sets in memory. We can reduce memory usage by calculating and adding up the values we need on the fly, rather than storing all of them and calculating later.

2. Time Optimization:
    - We can eliminate the need to calculate the slope and intercept every time by calculating it once and storing it in a map. This will significantly reduce the number of calculations needed.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

typedef pair<int, int> ip;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0);
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<ip> a(n);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i].first >> a[i].second;
    map<ip, set<ip>> lines;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for(int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            int dx = a[i].first - a[j].first;
            int dy = a[i].second - a[j].second;
            int g = __gcd(dx, dy);
            ip slope = {dy / g, dx / g};
            if(slope.first < 0 || (slope.first == 0 && slope.second < 0)) {
                slope.first *= -1;
                slope.second *= -1;
            }
            int c = a[i].second - slope.first * a[i].first;
            lines[slope].insert({c / g, 1});
        }
    }
    long long x = 0;
    for(auto &p : lines) {
        int si = p.second.size();
        x += 1LL * si * (si - 1) / 2;
    }
    long long si = lines.size();
    cout << si * (si - 1) / 2 - x;
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we calculate the slope and intercept (cept) directly in the loops, and we store them in a map where the key is the slope and the value is a set of intercepts. We then calculate the output directly from the size of the map and the sets.
