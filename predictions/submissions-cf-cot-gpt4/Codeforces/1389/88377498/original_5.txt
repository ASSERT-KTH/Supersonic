This code seems already optimized for the most part, but there are some potential areas where we can improve:

1. Remove unused variables and functions: There are several arrays, variables and functions that are defined but not used anywhere in the program. Removing these will help to reduce the memory footprint of the program.

2. Reduce the scope of variables: Variables like `cr_h`, `a` and `koita` etc. are currently defined at the function scope, but they are only used inside the inner loop. By reducing their scope to just the loop where they are used, we can potentially allow the compiler to optimize memory usage better.

3. Avoid unnecessary calculations: In the innermost loop, the expression `i + j - ekhn_ache` is calculated on every iteration, but the result is only used when `s[p] - '0' == ekhn_ache`. By moving this calculation inside the if-statement, we can avoid doing unnecessary work.

4. Use bitwise operations: In the condition `if (koita & 1)`, a bitwise AND operation is used to check if `koita` is odd. This can be replaced with the modulo operation `if (koita % 2 != 0)`, which is more readable and potentially faster.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long v99;

void solve() {
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  v99 cr_h = 0;
  v99 a[12] = {0};
  for (v99 i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) a[s[i] - '0']++;
  for (v99 i = 0; i < 10; i++) cr_h = max(cr_h, a[i]);
  for (v99 i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    for (v99 j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
      v99 koita = 0;
      v99 ekhn_ache = i;
      for (v99 p = 0; p < s.size(); p++) {
        if (s[p] - '0' == ekhn_ache) {
          koita++;
          ekhn_ache = i + j - ekhn_ache;
        }
      }
      if (koita % 2 != 0) --koita;
      cr_h = max(cr_h, koita);
    }
  }
  cout << s.size() - cr_h << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  long long t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) solve();
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these optimizations are minor and may not result in a noticeable speedup in practice, but they generally make the code cleaner and easier to read, which is always beneficial.
