Let's optimize this program step by step:

1. Remove unused header files: The first line in the program is `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes almost all the standard C++ libraries. However, not all of these libraries are used in this program, which unnecessarily increases the compilation time. We can replace this line with only the necessary libraries to speed up the compilation time.

2. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` instead of `ios::sync_with_stdio(0);` and get rid of the `cout.tie(0)` and `cin.tie(0)`. The reason for this is that `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` makes C++ standard streams unsynchronized, which means they can have their own independent buffers, which can potentially increase performance. 

3. Remove unused macros and typedefs: There are many defined macros and typedefs in this program that are not used. Removing them will decrease the size of the source code, making it more readable.

4. Unnecessary function templates: The code contains templates for gcd, lcm and bigmod functions, but these templates are not used anywhere in the code. Removing them will decrease the size of the source code.

5. Using size_t for string size: In the solve function, `s.size()` is used for loop iteration, it returns `size_t` but it is compared with `v99 (long long)`. It would be better to use auto or size_t for iteration over string size.

6. Initializing array 'a': The array 'a' in the solve function can be initialized using the initializer list `{}` which will automatically set all its elements to zero.

Here's the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#define ses "\n"
typedef long long v99;
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  v99 cr_h = 0, a[12]{};
  for (auto i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) a[s[i] - '0']++;
  for (auto i = 0; i < 10; i++) cr_h = max(cr_h, a[i]);
  for (auto i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    for (auto j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
      v99 koita = 0;
      v99 ekhn_ache = i;
      for (auto p = 0; p < s.size(); p++) {
        if (s[p] - '0' == ekhn_ache) {
          koita++;
          ekhn_ache = i + j - ekhn_ache;
        }
      }
      if (koita & 1)
        --koita;
      cr_h = max(cr_h, koita);
    }
  }
  cout << s.size() - cr_h << ses;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  long long t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimized program will have the same output as the original one. The optimizations are meant to improve the program's performance, not its functionality.
