This C++ program seems to be a competitive programming problem's solution. Here are some steps we can take to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a header file that includes most of the standard library in one go. However, this program does not use all of the standard library. Including this file can slow down compile times, so we should only include the headers that are actually used.

2. Remove unused macros: The program has a number of macros (`#define`) that are not used in the code. These should be removed to make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

3. Avoid using `std::endl`: `std::endl` both adds a newline and flushes the buffer. In this case, just adding a newline with `"\n"` is enough and more efficient.

4. Use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This can speed up I/O operations by not synchronizing C and C++ I/O. However, this means `printf` and `scanf` should not be used after this line, which is not a problem because they are not used here.

5. Avoid calling `std::string::size()` in loops: Every call to `size()` takes time, and in a loop, this time can add up. Instead, save the size to a variable before the loop and use that.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cstring>
#include <algorithm>
#define ses "\n"
#define mxi 200003
typedef long long v99;
using namespace std;

v99 pw(v99 a, v99 b) {
  v99 ans = 1;
  for (v99 i = 1; i <= b; ++i)
    ans = (ans * a);
  return ans;
}

void solve() {
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  v99 cr_h = 0, a[12];
  memset(a, 0, sizeof(a));
  v99 size = s.size();
  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) a[s[i] - '0']++;
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) cr_h = max(cr_h, a[i]);
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
      v99 koita = 0;
      v99 ekhn_ache = i;
      for (int p = 0; p < size; p++) {
        if (s[p] - '0' == ekhn_ache) {
          koita++;
          ekhn_ache = i + j - ekhn_ache;
        }
      }
      if (koita & 1)
        --koita;
      cr_h = max(cr_h, koita);
    }
  }
  cout << size - cr_h << ses;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  long long t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) solve();
  return 0;
}
```
