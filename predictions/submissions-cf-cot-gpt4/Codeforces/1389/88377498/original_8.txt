Here are some optimization steps that can be taken for the given C++ program:

1. Remove unnecessary #include. The program uses #include <bits/stdc++.h> which includes almost all C++ libraries. This increases the compile time and is not recommended in competitive programming. The program should only include the headers that it uses.

2. Avoid using global variables. The program uses global variables such as fx, fy, ox8, oy8. Using global variables is generally considered bad practice because it allows for variables to be changed from anywhere in the program, making it harder to debug and understand.

3. Use builtin functions when possible. The program includes a gcd function, but the standard library already provides a gcd function in the algorithm header.

4. Use standard typedefs. The program uses typedef long long v99; typedef unsigned long long ull; which is a bit confusing. It's better to use the standard names for these types, long long and unsigned long long.

5. Use standard idiom for loops. The program uses non-standard idioms for loops such as rep0, rep1, rep0in, rep1in, repv. It's better to use standard for and range-based for loops.

6. Use vectors instead of arrays. The program uses a fixed size array a[12]. It's better to use a vector which is dynamically resizable.

7. Avoid using macros for constants. The program defines a number of constants using macros. It's better to use constant variables, which have types and are safer.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
const int maxn = 200003;
const int inf = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const double pi = acos(-1);

inline ll bigmod(ll n, ll p, ll m) {
  if (p == 0)
    return 1;
  else if (p % 2 == 0) {
    ll val = bigmod(n, p / 2, m);
    return (val * val) % m;
  } else
    return ((n * bigmod(n, p - 1, m)) % m);
}

void solve() {
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  ll cr_h = 0;
  vector<ll> a(12, 0);
  for (char c : s) a[c - '0']++;
  for (ll i = 0; i < 10; i++) cr_h = max(cr_h, a[i]);
  for (ll i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    for (ll j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
      ll koita = 0;
      ll ekhn_ache = i;
      for (char c : s) {
        if (c - '0' == ekhn_ache) {
          koita++;
          ekhn_ache = i + j - ekhn_ache;
        }
      }
      if (koita & 1)
        --koita;
      cr_h = max(cr_h, koita);
    }
  }
  cout << s.size() - cr_h << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) solve();
  return 0;
}
