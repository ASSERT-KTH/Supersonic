This program appears to be solving a dynamic programming problem. It is well-structured and it is not immediately clear where there could be performance issues. However, there are a few improvements that can be made.

1. Avoid Global Variables: The `lef` variable is used as a global variable, which is generally not a good practice. We can eliminate its use completely by modifying the logic in the function `f()`. We can make it so that the `lef` variable is not needed by using `z > 0` as the condition to check whether we can move left or not.

2. Avoid Repeated Calculation: The function `f()` calculates `arr[i] + max(left, right)` twice. This is unnecessary and we can store the result in a variable to avoid calculating it twice.

3. Use `std::vector` Instead of C-style Array: The dynamic array `arr` is created for each test case. We can use `std::vector` instead of C-style arrays, as `std::vector` is safer and generally more efficient.

4. Avoid `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: It's not good practice to include `<bits/stdc++.h>`, as it includes many unnecessary headers, increasing compilation time. Include only the required libraries.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>
#include <algorithm>

#define ll long long
#define N 100005
#define mod 1000000007
#define dd double
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define REP(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < b; i++)
#define rep1(i, b) for (int i = 1; i <= b; i++)
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
#define F first
#define S second

long long int dp[100001][6];

long long int f(int i, int k, int z, std::vector<int>& arr) {
  if (k == 0 || i < 0)
    return 0;
  long long int left = 0;
  long long int right = 0;
  if (dp[i][z])
    return dp[i][z];
  if (z > 0) {
    left = f(i - 1, k - 1, z - 1, arr);
  }
  right = f(i + 1, k - 1, z, arr);
  long long int result = arr[i] + std::max(left, right);
  dp[i][z] = result;
  return result;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k, z;
    std::cin >> n >> k >> z;
    long long int ans = 0;
    std::vector<int> arr(n);
    rep(i, n) { std::cin >> arr[i]; }
    ans = arr[0] + f(1, k, z, arr);
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
    std::memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
  }
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  std::cout << "\nTime Elapsed: " << 1.0 * clock() / CLOCKS_PER_SEC << " sec\n";
#endif
  return 0;
}
```
