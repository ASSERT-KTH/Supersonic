The given program has time complexity of O(n). It is already optimized in terms of time complexity. However, there are some unnecessary parts of the code that we can improve to make it more efficient.

Optimization Steps:

1. The "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" directive is generally considered bad practice because it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, increasing the compilation time. We can replace it with the specific libraries we need.

2. "using namespace std;" is also considered bad practice, because it can lead to name clashes. We can remove it and specify the namespace for each standard library object.

3. Instead of using "ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(nullptr);", we can use "std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(NULL);". The NULL is more standard and portable.

4. We can remove the unused typedef "using ll = long long;"

5. The "leng" variable seems to be used to keep track of the unique elements in the array. This seems unnecessary because we can use the size of the "cnt" array to get the number of unique elements.

6. We are currently using a vector<int> to store the input, but it seems that an array would be more appropriate since the size of the input is fixed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int N = 1200300;
int cnt[N];

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, k;
  std::cin >> n >> k;
  int a[N];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> a[i];
  
  int idx1 = -1, idx2 = -1;
  int j = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (; j < n; j++) {
      if (++cnt[a[j]] == 1 && cnt[a[j]] > k) {
        --cnt[a[j]];
        break;
      }
    }
    if (j - i > idx2 - idx1) {
      idx1 = i;
      idx2 = j;
    }
    --cnt[a[i]];
  }
  std::cout << idx1 + 1 << ' ' << idx2 << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
