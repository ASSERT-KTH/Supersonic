Optimization Steps:

1) One of the main things we can optimize in this code is the use of "#include <bits/stdc++.h>". This header file includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which slows down the compilation time. We can replace it with the specific libraries needed.

2) We can also optimize the way we are dealing with the cin and cout operations. By using scanf and printf instead of cin and cout, we can make the program run faster.

3) The size of the cnt array is quite large (1200300). If the maximum value of 'n' is small, we can reduce the size of the array, which will save memory. But, as the problem constraints are not given, we can't be sure about this optimization.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define MOD 1000000007
typedef long long ll;
const int N = 1200300;
int cnt[N];
int main() {
  int n, k;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);
  std::vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
  }
  int idx1 = -1, idx2 = -1, leng = 0;
  int j = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (; j < n; j++) {
      if (++cnt[a[j]] == 1)
        leng++;
      if (leng > k) {
        if (--cnt[a[j]] == 0)
          leng--;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (j - i > idx2 - idx1) {
      idx1 = i;
      idx2 = j;
    }
    if (--cnt[a[i]] == 0)
      leng--;
  }
  printf("%d %d\n", idx1 + 1, idx2);
  return 0;
}
```
Note: It's important to note that the replacement of cin/cout with scanf/printf for speed is compiler-dependent. In some modern compilers, cin/cout perform just as well when ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) is used. However, in this case, we're assuming that scanf/printf are faster.
