This program is a sliding window algorithm used to find the longest subsequence with at most k distinct items. 

The optimization can be divided into 2 main parts:

1. **Memory Optimization**: The `cnt` array is large and not all of it is used. We can replace it with a `std::unordered_map`, which uses a hash table internally and can be more memory efficient for sparse data. The unordered_map allows O(1) average complexity for search, insert, and delete operations just like an array, so it won't affect the runtime.

2. **Runtime Optimization**: The program uses a nested loop structure, the outer loop `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)` and the inner loop `for (; j < n; j++)`. In the inner loop, `j` is not reset to `i` every time, so each element in the array is processed exactly once by the inner loop. This makes the overall runtime complexity O(n). So, there is not much room for runtime optimization here as the complexity is already linear.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
using ll = long long;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(nullptr);
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (auto &it : a)
    cin >> it;
  int idx1 = -1, idx2 = -1, leng = 0;
  int j = 0;
  unordered_map<int, int> cnt;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (; j < n; j++) {
      if (++cnt[a[j]] == 1)
        leng++;
      if (leng > k) {
        if (--cnt[a[j]] == 0)
          leng--;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (j - i > idx2 - idx1) {
      idx1 = i;
      idx2 = j;
    }
    if (--cnt[a[i]] == 0)
      leng--;
  }
  cout << idx1 + 1 << ' ' << idx2 << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` should be avoided in C++ programming as it includes all standard library headers which can lead to slower compilation times. It's better to include only those headers which are used in the program.
