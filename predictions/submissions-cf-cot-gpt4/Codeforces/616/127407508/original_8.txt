The program you provided is already quite optimized. However, there are a few small changes that could be made to make it more efficient.

1. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: `bits/stdc++.h` is a GCC-specific library that includes several Standard Library headers. It is a convenience for competitive programming, but it is not portable and slows down the compilation process because it includes a lot of unnecessary headers. It's better to include only those headers that are actually used in your program.

2. Avoid using `endl`: `endl` not only inserts a newline, but it also flushes the output buffer, which can slow down your program if you're doing a lot of output. It's better to use `"\n"` when you just want to insert a newline.

3. Use prefix increment/decrement instead of postfix: The prefix version (`++i`/`--i`) avoids unnecessary temporary object creation and is generally more efficient. Although modern compilers usually optimize this automatically, it's still a good habit to get into.

Here's the optimized version of your program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
using ll = long long;
const int N = 1200300;
int cnt[N];

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (auto &it : a)
    cin >> it;
  int idx1 = -1, idx2 = -1, leng = 0;
  int j = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (; j < n; j++) {
      if (++cnt[a[j]] == 1)
        ++leng;
      if (leng > k) {
        if (--cnt[a[j]] == 0)
          --leng;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (j - i > idx2 - idx1) {
      idx1 = i;
      idx2 = j;
    }
    if (--cnt[a[i]] == 0)
      --leng;
  }
  cout << idx1 + 1 << ' ' << idx2 << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that these are micro-optimizations and in most cases, they won't significantly affect your program's performance. Always make sure your algorithm is as efficient as possible before worrying about these kinds of optimizations.
