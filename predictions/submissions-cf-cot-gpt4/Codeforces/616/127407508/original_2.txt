The given program is a C++ program which uses the two pointers technique to find the maximum length of a subarray with at most K distinct integers.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Reduce the usage of std::vector. Although std::vector provides dynamic size, in this case, we know the size of the array beforehand. Hence, we can use a simple array.

2. We can remove the usage of std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(nullptr). These are used to speed up the cin and cout operations by decoupling them from C's stdin and stdout. But in this program, we are not performing a large number of input and output operations. Hence, removing these lines will not have a significant impact on performance.

3. We are using a large size integer array 'cnt' of size N = 1200300. We can reduce its size to the maximum possible number 'n' that can be provided in the input.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
int const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
using ll = long long;
const int N = 100000;
int cnt[N];
int a[N];
int main() {
  int n, k;
  std::cin >> n >> k;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> a[i];
  int idx1 = -1, idx2 = -1, leng = 0;
  int j = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (; j < n; j++) {
      if (++cnt[a[j]] == 1)
        leng++;
      if (leng > k) {
        if (--cnt[a[j]] == 0)
          leng--;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (j - i > idx2 - idx1) {
      idx1 = i;
      idx2 = j;
    }
    if (--cnt[a[i]] == 0)
      leng--;
  }
  std::cout << idx1 + 1 << ' ' << idx2 << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized program now uses less memory and should run faster, especially for larger inputs.
