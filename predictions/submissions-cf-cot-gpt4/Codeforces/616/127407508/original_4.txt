The given C++ program has a few areas that can be optimized for both memory usage and running time:

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This is not a standard header file. It is actually GCC specific and includes almost all necessary standard libraries, which can slow down the compile time. It's better to include only the necessary libraries.

2. `using namespace std;` is generally considered bad practice in C++. It's better to use std:: wherever necessary.

3. `using ll = long long;` is declared but not used, which can be removed to clean up the code.

4. `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(nullptr);` is used to speed up cin and cout, but in the given code only one cin and cout operation is performed. This line can be removed without affecting performance.

5. `vector<int> a(n);` and `for (auto &it : a) cin >> it;` can be combined into one line to reduce memory usage and improve running time.

6. `cnt[N];` can be defined inside the main function to avoid global scope and improve memory usage.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
  const int N = 1200300;
  int cnt[N] = {0};

  int n, k;
  std::cin >> n >> k;

  std::vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> a[i];

  int idx1 = -1, idx2 = -1, leng = 0;
  int j = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (; j < n; j++) {
      if (++cnt[a[j]] == 1)
        leng++;
      if (leng > k) {
        if (--cnt[a[j]] == 0)
          leng--;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (j - i > idx2 - idx1) {
      idx1 = i;
      idx2 = j;
    }
    if (--cnt[a[i]] == 0)
      leng--;
  }
  std::cout << idx1 + 1 << ' ' << idx2 << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
I have removed all the unnecessary parts and cleaned up the code for better performance and readability.
