This program seems to be already optimized in terms of time complexity. It's using a two-pointer approach (also known as sliding window), which runs in O(n) time complexity. 

However, there are a few minor changes that can be made in terms of code readability and slight performance improvement:

1. **Avoid using global variables**: Global variables are usually a bad practice. They can lead to unexpected behavior due to their global scope. They can be replaced by local variables or function parameters.

2. **Use cin and cout instead of scanf and printf**: cin and cout are more type-safe and easier to use than scanf and printf.

3. **Initialize variables where they are declared**: This makes the code cleaner and easier to read. 

4. **Use std::vector instead of raw array**: Vectors are safer and easier to use than raw arrays. They also provide dynamic sizing, which can help to reduce memory usage if the size of the array is not known beforehand.

5. **Use ++r and ++l instead of r++ and l++**: This can lead to a slight performance increase because post-increment (i.e. r++) needs to create a copy of the object to hold its initial state, while pre-increment (++r) does not.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;

    vector<int> x(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> x[i];

    vector<int> freq(1000000, 0);
    int l = 0, r = 0, c = 0, mx = -1, lf, rf;
    
    while (r < n) {
        freq[x[r]]++;
        if (freq[x[r]] == 1) {
            c++;
        }

        if (c <= k) {
            if (r - l + 1 > mx) {
                rf = r;
                lf = l;
            }
            mx = max(mx, r - l + 1);
        }

        while (c > k) {
            if (freq[x[l]] == 1)
                c--;
            freq[x[l]]--;
            ++l;
        }
        ++r;
    }
    cout << lf + 1 << " " << rf + 1;
    return 0;
}
```
