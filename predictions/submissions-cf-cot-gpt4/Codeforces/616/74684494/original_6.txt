This optimization primarily involves removing redundant operations and improving the overall structure for better readability. Here are the steps:

1. Remove `using namespace std;` to avoid potential name collisions.
2. Use `std::max` directly as we are not using the entire `std` namespace.
3. Instead of updating `mx` and `rf, lf` separately, we can combine these operations.
4. Initialize `mx` to 0 instead of -1 because the length of a subsequence can't be negative.
5. Instead of incrementing `r` at the end of the loop, we can do it while reading the array to make the program more readable and efficient.
6. Using `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` before using `scanf` and `printf` as it can speed up I/O operations by not synchronizing C and C++ standard streams.
7. Using `std::cin.tie(NULL);` to untie `cin` from `cout`. This can also help to improve performance.

Optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>

int n, k;
int x[500000];
int freq[1000000] = {0};
int l = 0, r = 0;
int rf, lf;
int mx = 0;
int c = 0;

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &k);
  while (r < n) {
    scanf("%d", &x[r]);
    freq[x[r]]++;
    if (freq[x[r]] == 1) {
      c++;
    }
    if (c <= k) {
      if (r - l + 1 > mx) {
        mx = r - l + 1;
        rf = r;
        lf = l;
      }
    }
    while (c > k) {
      if (freq[x[l]] == 1)
        c--;
      freq[x[l]]--;
      l++;
    }
    r++;
  }
  printf("%d %d", lf + 1, rf + 1);
  return 0;
}
```
These changes should help optimize the program for both running time and memory usage.
