This program in C/C++ is already optimized and efficient in terms of time complexity. It's using a sliding window technique combined with a frequency counter to solve the problem. However, there are a few minor things that can be improved:

1. Unnecessary 'using namespace std;' declaration: It's not recommended to use this declaration because it can lead to name clashes in larger projects which can be very hard to debug. We should remove this line since it's not being used.

2. Usage of 'scanf' and 'printf' with 'iostream' included: Since we've already included 'iostream', we can use 'cin' and 'cout' instead of 'scanf' and 'printf' for better consistency and readability. This also removes the need for including 'stdio.h'.

3. Instead of incrementing 'r' at the end of the while loop, we can increment it in the loop condition itself. This reduces one line of code and can slightly improve the speed of execution.

Here, you can find the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
int n, k;
int x[500000];
int freq[1000000] = {0};
int l, r = 0;
int rf, lf;
int mx = -1;
int c = 0;
int main() {
  std::cin >> n >> k;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> x[i];
  while (r++ < n) {
    freq[x[r]]++;
    if (freq[x[r]] == 1) {
      c++;
    }
    if (c <= k) {
      if (r - l + 1 > mx) {
        rf = r;
        lf = l;
      }
      mx = std::max(mx, r - l + 1);
    }
    while (c > k) {
      if (freq[x[l]] == 1)
        c--;
      freq[x[l]]--;
      l++;
    }
  }
  std::cout << lf + 1 << " " << rf + 1;
}
```
This program is already quite optimized and these changes should not significantly affect its performance. They are mostly for improving the readability and consistency of the code.
