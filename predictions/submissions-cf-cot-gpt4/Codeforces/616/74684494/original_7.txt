The given code is a sliding window problem where you need to find the maximum subarray with k distinct elements. This code is already efficient in terms of both time and memory complexity, as it uses a linear time complexity O(n) and linear space complexity O(n).

However, there's a slight improvement we can make in terms of code readability and maintainability. The variables are currently globally defined, and it's generally better to keep the scope of variables as limited as possible to prevent unintended side effects. Therefore, we can move the variables inside the `main` function. This won't have a significant impact on runtime or memory usage, but it improves the code structure.

Here's the optimized code:

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, k;
  int x[500000];
  int freq[1000000] = {0};
  int l = 0, r = 0;
  int rf, lf;
  int mx = -1;
  int c = 0;
  
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &k);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &x[i]);
  while (r < n) {
    freq[x[r]]++;
    if (freq[x[r]] == 1) {
      c++;
    }
    if (c <= k) {
      if (r - l + 1 > mx) {
        rf = r;
        lf = l;
      }
      mx = max(mx, r - l + 1);
    }
    while (c > k) {
      if (freq[x[l]] == 1)
        c--;
      freq[x[l]]--;
      l++;
    }
    r++;
  }
  printf("%d %d", lf + 1, rf + 1);
}
```

Please note that the array sizes `x` and `freq` are hard-coded, which might not be ideal in a real-world scenario. If the program needs to handle larger data, you may need to consider dynamic memory allocation or using a standard container like `std::vector`. However, such changes would be considered a significant rewrite of the program and are beyond the scope of this question.
