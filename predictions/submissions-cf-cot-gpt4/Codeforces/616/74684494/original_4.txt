The program is already quite efficient. The main optimization that can be done here is to reduce the number of redundant computations and assignments.

Optimization Steps:

1. The condition `if (r - l + 1 > mx)` is checked every time in the loop but the assignment `mx = max(mx, r - l + 1);` is done regardless of the condition. So, we can safely remove the condition check and the program will still behave the same.

2. Also, the calculation `r - l + 1` is done twice in the same iteration which is unnecessary. We can calculate it once and store it in a variable to use it in the two places.

3. Use prefix increment (++i) instead of postfix increment (i++) in the for loop. Prefix increment could be faster in some situations because it doesn't need to make a copy of the value before it increments it.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;
int n, k;
int x[500000];
int freq[1000000] = {0};
int l, r = 0;
int rf, lf;
int mx = -1;
int c = 0;
int main() {
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &k);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    scanf("%d", &x[i]);
  while (r < n) {
    freq[x[r]]++;
    if (freq[x[r]] == 1) {
      c++;
    }
    int len = r - l + 1;
    if (c <= k) {
      if (len > mx) {
        rf = r;
        lf = l;
        mx = len;
      }
    }
    while (c > k) {
      if (freq[x[l]] == 1)
        c--;
      freq[x[l]]--;
      l++;
    }
    r++;
  }
  printf("%d %d", lf + 1, rf + 1);
}
```
