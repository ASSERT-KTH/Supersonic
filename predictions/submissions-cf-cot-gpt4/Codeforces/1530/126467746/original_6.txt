Here are the optimizations I would apply to this program:

1. Pass the vector "a" by reference to the function "solve". This will prevent the program from creating a copy of the vector, saving both time and memory. 

2. Pass the vector "ans" by reference to the function "print". This will prevent the program from creating a copy of the vector, saving both time and memory. 

3. Instead of using a map "k", use the already defined map "m". This will prevent the program from creating a duplicate map, saving both time and memory. 

4. Remove the redundant initialization of the map "m" in the "main" function. This map is already initialized in the "solve" function. 

5. Use "reserve" before "push_back" to vector "k". This is because it is known that in the worst case, "n" elements will be pushed, so it is better to allocate memory once at the beginning.

Here is the optimized program according to the above steps:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int solve(int n, vector<int> &ans, vector<int> &a, map<int, int> &m) {
  vector<bool> check(2e5 + 12, 0);
  int c = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (!check[a[i]]) {
      ans[i] = a[i];
      m[a[i]] = i;
      check[a[i]] = 1;
      c++;
    }
  }
  vector<int> k;
  k.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (!check[i]) {
      k.push_back(i);
    }
  }
  int h = k.size();
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (ans[i] == 0) {
      ans[i] = k[h - 1];
      h--;
    }
  }
  return c;
}

void print(vector<int> &ans, int c) {
  cout << c << "\n";
  for (int i = 1; i < ans.size(); i++)
    cout << ans[i] << " ";
  cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      cin >> a[i];
    vector<int> ans(n + 1);
    map<int, int> m;
    int number = solve(n, ans, a, m);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      if (ans[i] == i) {
        ans[i] = m[i];
        ans[m[a[i]]] = i;
      }
    }
    print(ans, number);
  }
}
```
