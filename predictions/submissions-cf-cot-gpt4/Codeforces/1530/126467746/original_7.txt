Optimization Steps:

1. Use `std::unordered_map` instead of `std::map`: The `std::unordered_map` offers constant time complexity for search, insert and delete operations on average, while `std::map` offers logarithmic time complexity for these operations. So, replacing `std::map` with `std::unordered_map` will reduce the running time of the program.

2. Pass vectors by reference to functions: In the `solve` function, the `a` vector is passed by value, which means a new copy of the vector is created each time this function is called. This operation consumes a lot of memory and processing time. Passing the vector by reference will solve this problem because it allows the function to work directly on the original vector, without creating a new copy.

3. Remove unused `std::map` `k`: In the `main` function, a `std::map` `k` is created and populated, but it is never used in the rest of the program. Removing this `std::map` will save memory.

4. Use `reserve` for vector `k`: When you know the size of the vector in advance, it's a good practice to reserve the required space before the loop. This will prevent additional memory allocations during the push_back operations.

5. Start iteration from 0 index: In C++, vectors are 0-indexed. But in this code, vectors are accessed starting from 1. This leaves the 0-th element of each vector unused, wasting memory.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int solve(int n, vector<int> &ans, vector<int> &a, unordered_map<int, int> &m) {
  vector<bool> check(2e5 + 12, 0);
  int c = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (!check[a[i]]) {
      ans[i] = a[i];
      m[a[i]] = i;
      check[a[i]] = 1;
      c++;
    }
  }
  vector<int> k;
  k.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (!check[i]) {
      k.push_back(i);
    }
  }
  int h = k.size();
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (ans[i] == 0) {
      ans[i] = k[h - 1];
      h--;
    }
  }
  return c;
}
void print(vector<int> ans, int c) {
  cout << c << "\n";
  for (int i = 0; i < ans.size(); i++)
    cout << ans[i] << " ";
  cout << "\n";
}
int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> a[i];
    vector<int> ans(n);
    unordered_map<int, int> m;
    int number = solve(n, ans, a, m);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (ans[i] == i) {
        ans[i] = a[i];
        ans[m[a[i]]] = i;
      }
    }
    print(ans, number);
  }
}
```
