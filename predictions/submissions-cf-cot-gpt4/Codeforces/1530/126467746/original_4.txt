Step 1: Reduce unnecessary copies
The function solve() is currently accepting the vector a by value, which means that a copy of the vector is created. This is both time consuming and memory intensive. We can improve this by passing the vector by reference.

Step 2: Use unordered_map instead of map
The map in C++ is implemented as a red-black tree and it provides operations like insert, delete, etc in O(logN) time complexity. But unordered_map is implemented using Hash table, where keys are hashed into indices of a hash table so that the insertion is done at constant time complexity O(1). Hence, unordered_map is faster to use than map when we don't need to maintain an ordered sequence.

Step 3: Use std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)
This can see a significant speed up by allowing C++ to ignore the synchronization of C and C++ standard streams.

Step 4: Use cin.tie(NULL)
This unties cin from cout. Tied streams ensure that one stream is flushed automatically before each I/O operation on the tied stream. Untying them can give a little speedup.

Step 5: Use reserve() for vector
By using reserve() function we reserve memory for a vector. This can potentially improve performance by avoiding reallocations and copies when the vector grows in size.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int solve(int n, vector<int> &ans, vector<int> &a, unordered_map<int, int> &m) {
  vector<bool> check(2e5 + 12, 0);
  int c = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (!check[a[i]]) {
      ans[i] = a[i];
      m[a[i]] = i;
      check[a[i]] = 1;
      c++;
    }
  }
  vector<int> k;
  k.reserve(n); // reserve memory for vector
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (!check[i]) {
      k.push_back(i);
    }
  }
  int h = k.size();
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (ans[i] == 0) {
      ans[i] = k[h - 1];
      h--;
    }
  }
  return c;
}
void print(vector<int> ans, int c) {
  cout << c << "\n";
  for (int i = 1; i < ans.size(); i++)
    cout << ans[i] << " ";
  cout << "\n";
}
int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); // speed up IO
  cin.tie(NULL); // untie cin and cout
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      cin >> a[i];
    vector<int> ans(n + 1);
    unordered_map<int, int> m; // use unordered_map instead of map
    int number = solve(n, ans, a, m);
    unordered_map<int, int> k; // use unordered_map instead of map
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      k[i] = a[i];
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      if (ans[i] == i) {
        ans[i] = k[i];
        ans[m[a[i]]] = i;
      }
    }
    print(ans, number);
  }
}
```

Please note that the optimizations above are mainly for speed. In terms of memory, the program is already fairly efficient. The main memory usage comes from the vectors and maps, which are necessary for the logic of the program.
