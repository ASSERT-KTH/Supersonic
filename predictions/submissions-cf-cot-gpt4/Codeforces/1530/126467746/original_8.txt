This program has a number of performance issues that can be optimized:

1. Avoid copying vectors: In the function `solve()`, the vector `a` is passed by value, which creates a copy of the vector. This operation can take considerable time and memory for large vectors. It's better to pass large data structures by reference.

2. Use unordered map: The `std::map` in C++ is an ordered map, which means that the elements in this map are ordered by key. This ordering requires extra processing which can slow down your program. If the ordering of the elements is not important, it's better to use `std::unordered_map`, which doesn't order the elements and is typically faster.

3. Use reserve function for vectors: For the vector `k` in the function `solve()`, you can use the `reserve()` function to preallocate memory. This can improve performance by reducing the number of memory reallocations.

4. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header file includes a lot of unnecessary code that slows down the compilation process considerably. It's better to include only the headers you need.

5. Use prefix increment: In C++, the prefix increment (`++i`) can be more efficient than the postfix increment (`i++`), especially for user-defined types. Although for built-in types, the difference is negligible, it's a good practice to use prefix increment in loops.

Here is the optimized version of the program with the changes mentioned above:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int solve(int n, vector<int> &ans, vector<int> &a, unordered_map<int, int> &m) {
    vector<bool> check(2e5 + 12, 0);
    int c = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (!check[a[i]]) {
            ans[i] = a[i];
            m[a[i]] = i;
            check[a[i]] = 1;
            ++c;
        }
    }
    vector<int> k;
    k.reserve(n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (!check[i]) {
            k.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    int h = k.size();
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (ans[i] == 0) {
            ans[i] = k[h - 1];
            --h;
        }
    }
    return c;
}

void print(vector<int> &ans, int c) {
    cout << c << "\n";
    for (int i = 1; i < ans.size(); ++i)
        cout << ans[i] << " ";
    cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        vector<int> a(n + 1);
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
            cin >> a[i];
        vector<int> ans(n + 1);
        unordered_map<int, int> m;
        int number = solve(n, ans, a, m);
        unordered_map<int, int> k;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
            k[i] = a[i];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            if (ans[i] == i) {
                ans[i] = k[i];
                ans[m[a[i]]] = i;
            }
        }
        print(ans, number);
    }
}
```
