Optimization steps:

1. The array 'a' is passed by value to the function solve(). This means that the entire array is copied, which is not optimal for large arrays. Instead, pass the array by reference.

2. The map 'm' is populated but never used in the function solve(). Therefore, we can remove it to save memory.

3. The map 'k' is used to store the same values as the array 'a'. We can remove it and use 'a' directly to save memory.

4. Instead of using map<int, int> m; we can use unordered_map<int, int> m; which has average constant time complexity O(1) for the operations like insert(), delete() and search().

5. Instead of using 'k' vector to store the unchecked values, we can store these values directly in the 'ans' vector and this way we save the space of a whole vector.

6. Indexing of vectors in C++ starts from 0, not 1. So we need to change the loop variable initialization and other related things accordingly.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int solve(int n, vector<int> &ans, vector<int> &a) {
  vector<bool> check(2e5 + 12, 0);
  int c = 0;
  int h = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (!check[a[i]]) {
      ans[i] = a[i];
      check[a[i]] = 1;
      c++;
    } else {
      while (check[h]) {
        h++;
      }
      ans[i] = h;
      check[h] = 1;
    }
  }
  return c;
}
void print(vector<int> ans, int c) {
  cout << c << "\n";
  for (int i = 0; i < ans.size(); i++)
    cout << ans[i] << " ";
  cout << "\n";
}
int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> a[i];
    vector<int> ans(n);
    int number = solve(n, ans, a);
    print(ans, number);
  }
}
```

By following these steps, we've optimized the program for both running time and memory usage.
