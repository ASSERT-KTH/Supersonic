The program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. Pass Vector and Map by Reference: In the function `solve`, the vector `a` is passed by value, which means a new copy of this vector is created in the function. This process takes both time and memory. We can pass this vector by reference to avoid creating a new copy and save time and memory.

2. Avoid Unnecessary Operations: In the `main` function, the map `k` is created and filled with the values of the vector `a`. However, this map is not necessary, it is a redundant operation. The values of `a` can be used directly.

3. Use Vector Instead of Map: In the function `solve`, a map `m` is used to keep track of the indices of the elements in `a`. However, as the keys in this map are the values of `a`, which are integers in the range [1, n], a vector can be used instead of a map. The look-up time for a vector is constant, while for a map it is logarithmic.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int solve(int n, vector<int> &ans, vector<int> &a, vector<int> &m) {
  vector<bool> check(2e5 + 12, 0);
  int c = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (!check[a[i]]) {
      ans[i] = a[i];
      m[a[i]] = i;
      check[a[i]] = 1;
      c++;
    }
  }
  vector<int> k;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (!check[i]) {
      k.push_back(i);
    }
  }
  int h = k.size();
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (ans[i] == 0) {
      ans[i] = k[h - 1];
      h--;
    }
  }
  return c;
}

void print(vector<int> ans, int c) {
  cout << c << "\n";
  for (int i = 1; i < ans.size(); i++)
    cout << ans[i] << " ";
  cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      cin >> a[i];
    vector<int> ans(n + 1);
    vector<int> m(n + 1);
    int number = solve(n, ans, a, m);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      if (ans[i] == i) {
        ans[i] = a[i];
        ans[m[a[i]]] = i;
      }
    }
    print(ans, number);
  }
}
```

In this optimized code, vectors and maps are passed by reference, unnecessary map creation is avoided and a vector is used instead of a map for faster look-ups, improving both running time and memory usage.
