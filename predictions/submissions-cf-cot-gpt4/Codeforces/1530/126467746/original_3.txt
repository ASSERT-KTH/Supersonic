The original program has multiple for loops that iterate over the entire vector multiple times. This is inefficient and increases the time complexity of the program. We can improve the efficiency of the program by merging these for loops into one, reducing the number of iterations. We can also use a vector to store the numbers that are not present in the input vector instead of a map, which will reduce the memory usage.

Step by step optimization:

Step 1: Merge the first and second for loop in solve function into one. This reduces the number of iterations from 2n to n.

Step 2: Merge the two for loops in the main function into one. This reduces the number of iterations from 2n to n.

Step 3: Replace the map with a vector to store the numbers that are not present in the input vector. This reduces the memory usage.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int solve(int n, vector<int> &ans, vector<int> a) {
  vector<bool> check(2e5 + 12, 0);
  int c = 0;
  vector<int> k;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (!check[a[i]]) {
      ans[i] = a[i];
      check[a[i]] = 1;
      c++;
    }
    if (!check[i]) {
      k.push_back(i);
    }
  }
  int h = k.size();
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (ans[i] == 0) {
      ans[i] = k[h - 1];
      h--;
    }
  }
  return c;
}
void print(vector<int> ans, int c) {
  cout << c << "\n";
  for (int i = 1; i < ans.size(); i++)
    cout << ans[i] << " ";
  cout << "\n";
}
int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      cin >> a[i];
    vector<int> ans(n + 1);
    int number = solve(n, ans, a);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      if (ans[i] == i) {
        ans[i] = a[i];
        ans[a[i]] = i;
      }
    }
    print(ans, number);
  }
}
```

Please note that, although it is commonly used, including `bits/stdc++.h` is not a good practice as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers and increases compilation time. Instead, include only those libraries that are necessary for your code.
