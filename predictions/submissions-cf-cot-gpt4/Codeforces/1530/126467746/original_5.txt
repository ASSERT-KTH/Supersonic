This program can be optimized in several ways:

1. Passing large data structures by reference: The function `solve()` is currently taking a large data structure `vector<int> a` by value, which means that the whole vector is being copied. This is both time consuming and memory consuming. To optimize this, we should pass this vector by reference.

2. Avoiding unnecessary map: In the main function, a map `k` is being created and populated, but it's really not necessary. The original `a` vector already has all the information we need. This map is using extra memory and it's also taking time to populate it.

3. Using unordered_map instead of map: In C++, `std::map` is a balanced binary tree and its time complexity for insertion and access is O(logN). But `std::unordered_map` is a hash table and its average time complexity for insertion and access is O(1). So, if the order of elements doesn't matter, we should use `std::unordered_map` instead of `std::map`.

4. Vector and Map index: Indexing of vectors and maps starts from 0, not from 1. It's better to use 0-based indexing for consistency and to avoid off-by-one errors.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int solve(int n, vector<int> &ans, vector<int> &a, unordered_map<int, int> &m) {
  vector<bool> check(2e5 + 12, 0);
  int c = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (!check[a[i]]) {
      ans[i] = a[i];
      m[a[i]] = i;
      check[a[i]] = 1;
      c++;
    }
  }
  vector<int> k;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (!check[i+1]) {
      k.push_back(i+1);
    }
  }
  int h = k.size();
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (ans[i] == 0) {
      ans[i] = k[h - 1];
      h--;
    }
  }
  return c;
}
void print(vector<int> ans, int c) {
  cout << c << "\n";
  for (int i = 0; i < ans.size(); i++)
    cout << ans[i] << " ";
  cout << "\n";
}
int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> a[i];
    vector<int> ans(n);
    unordered_map<int, int> m;
    int number = solve(n, ans, a, m);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (ans[i] == i+1) {
        ans[i] = a[i];
        ans[m[a[i]]] = i+1;
      }
    }
    print(ans, number);
  }
}
```

This optimized code should run faster and use less memory than the original one.
