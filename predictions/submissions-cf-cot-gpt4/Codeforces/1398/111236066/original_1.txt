Step 1: Remove Unused Macros and Imports
The first thing to note is that there are a lot of unused macros and imports. Removing these will not improve the runtime of the program, but it will make it easier to read and understand. This includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is considered bad practice to include because it includes more than needed and can slow down compilation. Include only the headers that are needed.

Step 2: Optimize Prime Check
The `isPrime` function checks if a number is prime by checking divisibility from 5 to sqrt(n) in increments of 6. This can be optimized by checking divisibility up to sqrt(n) in increments of 2. This reduces the number of iterations and thus the running time.

Step 3: Use Efficient Data Structures
The map `cnt` is used to keep track of the count of numbers. Maps in C++ are implemented as red-black trees and have a time complexity of O(log n) for insertion and access. If the number of unique numbers is not too large, using a vector or array instead can be faster because they have a time complexity of O(1) for insertion and access. However, this might not be applicable in this case if the number of unique numbers can be very large.

Step 4: Avoid Unnecessary Operations
The `solve` function calculates `pre - i` twice. This can be calculated once and stored in a variable to avoid the extra calculation.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <chrono>
#include <random>
#include <string>
#define int long long

using namespace std;

mt19937 rng(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());

bool isPrime(int n) {
  if (n <= 1)
    return false;
  if (n <= 3)
    return true;
  if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0)
    return false;
  for (int i = 5; i * i <= n; i += 2)
    if (n % i == 0)
      return false;
  return true;
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  map<int, int> cnt;
  cnt[1]++;
  int pre = 0;
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int d = s[i] - '0';
    pre += d;
    int diff = pre - i;
    ans += cnt[diff];
    cnt[diff]++;
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int32_t main() {
  int t; 
  cin >> t; 
  while (t--) {
    solve(); 
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This program is optimized for running time by reducing the number of iterations and avoiding unnecessary calculations. The memory usage is also improved by removing unused macros and imports.
