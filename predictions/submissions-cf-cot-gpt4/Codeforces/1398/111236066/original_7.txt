The code is already quite optimized, but there are a few areas where it could be improved:

1. Reduce unnecessary computation in isPrime function: The isPrime function checks if a number is prime by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is a standard optimization. However, it checks divisibility by 2 and 3 separately before entering the loop that starts from 5. This can be avoided as it will be covered in the loop.

2. Unnecessary computation in main function: The `w(t)` macro is used to read the number of test cases and then run the `solve` function for each test case. The macro expands to a while loop. Instead of using a macro, using a standard for loop would be more straightforward and would avoid the overhead of expanding the macro.

3. Avoiding unnecessary IO synchronization: The `FIO` macro is used to unsync the C++ standard streams with their C counterparts. This can speed up IO operations, but in this case, only cin and cout are used, so the sync_with_stdio(false) is unnecessary. 

4. Avoiding unnecessary type definitions: The code uses several macros to define shorter names for common types. This can make the code harder to read and understand, and does not provide any performance benefit. The code would be more readable if the types were used directly.

With these optimizations, the code becomes:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
using namespace __gnu_pbds;
using namespace std;

mt19937 rng(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());

typedef tree<int, null_type, less<int>, rb_tree_tag,
             tree_order_statistics_node_update>
    pbds;

bool isPrime(int n) {
  if (n <= 1)
    return false;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++)
    if (n % i == 0)
      return false;
  return true;
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  map<int, int> cnt;
  cnt[1]++;
  int pre = 0;
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int d = s[i] - '0';
    pre += d;
    ans += cnt[pre - i];
    cnt[pre - i]++;
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  for(int i=0; i<t; i++) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

It should be noted that optimizations that improve readability and maintainability, such as removing macros and type definitions, may be more valuable than micro-optimizations that have a minor impact on performance. Code should be written for humans to read, and only optimized for machines to the extent necessary.
