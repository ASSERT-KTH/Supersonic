Firstly, I will go through the code and see what possible improvements can be made.

1. The 'bits/stdc++.h' header is being used, which includes all the standard library headers. This might be easy to use but it can slow down the compile time as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We should only include the headers that we need.

2. The `isPrime` function is not used in the code, so we can remove it.

3. The map `cnt` is defined inside the solve function, which means it is reallocated for every test case while it can be reused. We can define it at the global scope and just clear it at the start of the solve function.

4. The `pre` variable is used for the partial sum of the digits, but it's updated in every iteration. Instead, we can calculate the prefix sum of the digits beforehand, which will save time in the loop where `ans` is calculated.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef map<ll, ll> mii;

mii cnt;

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  cnt.clear();
  cnt[1]++;
  ll ans = 0;
  vector<ll> pre(n+1, 0);
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    pre[i+1] = pre[i] + (s[i] - '0');
    ans += cnt[pre[i+1] - i - 1];
    cnt[pre[i+1] - i - 1]++;
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);                                               
  cin.tie(0);                                                                  
  cout.tie(0)
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that these optimizations may not result in a noticeable runtime improvement for small inputs, but they can make a difference for large inputs.
