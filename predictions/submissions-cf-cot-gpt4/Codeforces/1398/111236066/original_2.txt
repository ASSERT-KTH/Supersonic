The given C/C++ program seems to be fairly optimized. However, there are a few changes that could be made to potentially improve the performance of the program. 

1. Use of bits/stdc++.h header: This header includes quite a large number of standard C++ libraries. While this is convenient for competitive programming, it can slow down the compilation time. Therefore, it is generally recommended to include only the specific libraries that you need.

2. Use of namespace std: This is generally discouraged in larger programs as it can lead to naming conflicts. However, in a small program like this, it won't have much of an impact on performance.

3. Use of macros: While these can make the code more concise, they can also make it more difficult to debug and understand. Additionally, modern compilers are often able to optimize the code in such a way that the use of macros doesn't provide a significant performance benefit.

4. Avoiding unnecessary operations: The check "n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0" in the isPrime function is unnecessary because the loop "for (int i = 5; i * i <= n; i = i + 6)" will automatically check these cases.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::map;
using std::string;
using std::vector;

bool isPrime(int n) {
  if (n <= 1)
    return false;
  if (n <= 3)
    return true;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++)
    if (n % i == 0)
      return false;
  return true;
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  map<int, int> cnt;
  cnt[1]++;
  int pre = 0;
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int d = s[i] - '0';
    pre += d;
    ans += cnt[pre - i];
    cnt[pre - i]++;
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while(t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the optimization process might vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the program. The above changes might not result in noticeable improvements in every case, but they are generally good practices to follow.
