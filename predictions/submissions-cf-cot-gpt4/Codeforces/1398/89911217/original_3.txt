Let's start by discussing the current code and its issues. The program is using a depth-first search to recursively solve a problem. The dp array is being used to memoize the results of previous function calls to avoid redundant computation. However, the program is making a lot of unnecessary checks and computations that can be optimized.

Step 1: Avoid unnecessary index checking
In the current function solve(), there are multiple checks to see whether each of idx0, idx1, and idx2 is less than the size of the respective vector. These checks are done for each recursion, which is inefficient. We can avoid these checks by ensuring that the vectors have size = N and are filled with zeros initially. By doing this, we ensure that all the indices are valid, and we can safely access the vectors without checking each time.

Step 2: Avoid unnecessary size casting
The code repeatedly casts the size of vectors to int using the (int) cast. This is unnecessary as the size() function returns a size_t value that can be directly used in comparisons with other size_t values.

Step 3: Use std::max instead of custom function
The function smax() is used to find the maximum of two values and assign it to the first argument. This can be replaced by the standard function std::max() which is more efficient and does not require a custom implementation.

Now let's implement these optimizations in the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define _ ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);
#define int long long
const int inf = 0x3f3f3f3f3f3f3f3LL;
const int mod = (int)1e9 + 7;
using namespace std;
#define endl '\n'
const int N = 210;
int len[3];
vector<int> v[3];
int red, green, blue;
int dp[N][N][N];

int solve(int idx0, int idx1, int idx2) {
  int &ans = dp[idx0][idx1][idx2];
  if (ans != -1) {
    return ans;
  }
  ans = 0;
  ans = max(ans, v[0][idx0] * v[1][idx1] + solve(idx0 + 1, idx1 + 1, idx2));
  ans = max(ans, v[0][idx0] * v[2][idx2] + solve(idx0 + 1, idx1, idx2 + 1));
  ans = max(ans, v[1][idx1] * v[2][idx2] + solve(idx0, idx1 + 1, idx2 + 1));
  ans = max(ans, solve(idx0 + 1, idx1, idx2));
  ans = max(ans, solve(idx0, idx1 + 1, idx2));
  ans = max(ans, solve(idx0, idx1, idx2 + 1));
  return ans;
}
int32_t main() {
  _ for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    cin >> len[i];
    v[i].resize(N, 0);
    for (int j = 0; j < len[i]; ++j) {
      cin >> v[i][j];
    }
    sort(v[i].rbegin(), v[i].rend());
  }
  memset(dp, -1, sizeof dp);
  cout << solve(0, 0, 0);
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that this optimization assumes that accessing non-inputted values of the vectors (i.e., zeros) in the solve() function does not affect the correctness of the program. If this assumption is not valid, then the original index checking cannot be avoided.
