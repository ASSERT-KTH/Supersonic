This is a complex piece of code and it seems to be already quite optimized for speed. However, there are a few places where we can make improvements for readability, maintainability and potentially for speed as well.

1. Avoid using the `using namespace` directive: Namespaces are designed to prevent naming conflicts, so it is a good practice to specify which namespace a function or object is from.

2. The Sieve of Eratosthenes function could be improved by avoiding the usage of vectors for storing primes. Vectors are dynamic arrays and they take more time for allocation and deallocation. A simple array would be more efficient.

3. The `memset()` function is used to set the value `-1` for all elements in the `res` array. However, `memset()` is used for setting the same byte for a block of memory, and it can cause problems for multibyte values like `int` or `long long` with a value other than `0` or `-1`. A loop can be used instead to set the values for each element in the array.

4. The `main` function does not have a return type. This may lead to undefined behavior. It's always good to define return type of `main` as `int`.

5. There's a macro `#define int ll` that changes `int` to `long long`. This can cause confusion and it's better to just use the `long long` type directly.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

long long n, x, y, lp[MAXN + 1], res[MAXN];
bool can[MAXN];
std::vector<int> pr;

void SieveOfEratosthenes() {
  for (long long i = 2; i <= MAXN; i++) {
    if (lp[i] == 0)
      lp[i] = i, pr.push_back(i);
    for (long long j = 0; j < pr.size() && pr[j] <= lp[i] && i * pr[j] <= MAXN; ++j)
      lp[i * pr[j]] = pr[j];
  }
}

// ... rest of the code ...

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);

  SieveOfEratosthenes();
  std::cin >> n >> x >> y;
  int OFFSET = x;
  std::vector<long long> l(2 * OFFSET + 1), r(2 * OFFSET + 1);
  
  // ... rest of the code ...

  for (long long i = 0; i <= q; i++)
    res[i] = -1;

  // ... rest of the code ...

  for (long long i = 0; i < q; i++) 
    std::cout << res[i] << " \n"[i == q - 1];

  return 0;
}
```
