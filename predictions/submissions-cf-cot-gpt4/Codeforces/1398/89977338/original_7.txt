This is already an optimized code in terms of time complexity for the given problem, but there are a few minor tweaks that can be done to further optimize it.

1. Remove unnecessary macros: Macros like "#define db(x) cout << #x << " = " << x << "\n";" and "#define mset(a, b) memset(a, b, sizeof(a));" are not used in the code. Removing them can clean up the code a bit.

2. Remove unnecessary "#define ALL(a) a.begin(), a.end()" as it is not used in the program.

3. Use "std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)" instead of "ios::sync_with_stdio(false)" to avoid unnecessary namespace usage.

4. The "#define FIN" macro is not actually used in the program, so you can remove it.

5. The "bool can[MAXN];" array is not initialized explicitly. In C++, local variables are not automatically initialized to zero. So, it would be good to initialize it explicitly to avoid any unexpected behaviour.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
#define int ll
typedef pair<int, int> ii;
#define fore(i, a, b) for (int i = a, ggdem = b; i < ggdem; i++)
#define SZ(a) ((int)(a).size())
#define pb push_back
#define fst first
#define snd second
mt19937 rng(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
const int MAXN = 1 << 20;
int n, x, y, lp[MAXN + 1], res[MAXN];
bool can[MAXN] = {0};
vector<int> pr;
void SieveOfEratosthenes() {
  for (int i = 2; i <= MAXN; i++) {
    if (lp[i] == 0)
      lp[i] = i, pr.pb(i);
    for (int j = 0; j < SZ(pr) && pr[j] <= lp[i] && i * pr[j] <= MAXN; ++j)
      lp[i * pr[j]] = pr[j];
  }
}
//... remaining code is same as before
```
As a side note, using "bits/stdc++.h" is not recommended because it includes all the standard library headers at once, which can slow down the compilation process. It would be better to include only the headers that are actually needed by the program.
