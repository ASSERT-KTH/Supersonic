The given C/C++ program reads an array of double numbers, performs some calculations on them, and prints them with a high precision. Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. **Avoid Unnecessary Recomputations:** In the nested loop structure where 'j' and 'k' are being used as indices, the bit-wise AND operation '((i >> g) & 1)' is being computed multiple times. This operation can be stored in a variable to avoid recomputation.

2. **Avoid Unnecessary Type Casting:** The variable 'ruby' is being multiplied and subtracted in a series of operations. These operations can be performed once and stored in a variable, which can then be used in calculations to avoid type casting and recomputation.

3. **Efficient Memory Usage:** Instead of declaring large vectors upfront, it would be better to declare them only when needed. This will help in managing memory more efficiently as memory will be used only when required.

4. **Use of 'auto' Keyword:** In C++ 11 and later, 'auto' keyword can be used to automatically determine the type of the variable at compile time. This can help in making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

Here's the optimized code:
```cpp
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
#define fore(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < (b); i++)
#define fr(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i >= b; i--)
#define fast                                                                   \
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);                                            \
  cin.tie(0);                                                                  \
  cout.tie(0)
#define N 200005
#define FH 400005
#define inf INT32_MAX
#define MOD 1000000007LL
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pr;
inline void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<vector<double>> m(n, vector<double>(n, 0));
  fore(i, 0, n) fore(j, 0, n) cin >> m[i][j];
  vector<double> dp(1 << n, 0);
  dp[(1 << n) - 1] = 1;
  fr(i, (1 << n) - 1, 0) {
    fore(j, 0, n) fore(k, j + 1, n) {
      if (((i >> j) & 1) && ((i >> k) & 1)) {
        int a = 0, b = 0;
        int ruby = 0;
        fore(g, 0, n) {
          auto bit_g = ((i >> g) & 1);
          if (bit_g)
            ruby++;
          if (g != j && bit_g)
            a += (1 << g);
          if (g != k && bit_g)
            b += (1 << g);
        }
        auto ruby_calc = 2 * dp[i] / (ruby * (ruby - 1));
        dp[b] += ruby_calc * m[j][k];
        dp[a] += ruby_calc * m[k][j];
      }
    }
  }
  fore(i, 0, n) cout << fixed << setprecision(20) << dp[1 << i] << ' ';
}
int main() {
  fast;
#if defined(_DEBUG)
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  solve();
}
```
This optimized program should run faster and use memory more efficiently than the original program.
