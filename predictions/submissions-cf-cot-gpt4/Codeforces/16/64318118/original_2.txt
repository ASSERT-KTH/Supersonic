The code snippet provided is a probability matrix calculation program. This program calculates the probabilities of each state of a system with 'n' states, where each state represents a player. The probability of moving from one state to another is determined by a symmetric matrix 'm'. 

The program can be optimized in the following ways:

1. **Memory Optimization**: The vector 'dp' is initialized with size '1<<n' and it is then filled with zeros. This is memory-inefficient and it would be better to use a map instead of a vector. This way, only the used indices will take up memory. The map 'dp' will only store the non-zero probabilities, hence reducing memory usage.

2. **Optimize the calculation of the bit masks**: The current code calculates the bit masks 'a' and 'b' for each pair (j, k). However, these masks only depend on 'i' and can be precalculated.

3. **Avoid redundant calculations**: The current code calculates 'ruby', 'a' and 'b' for each pair (j, k). They should be calculated only once per 'i'.

4. **Use bit manipulation to replace the loop for calculating 'ruby'**: The number of set bits in 'i' is calculated by looping through all bits of 'i'. This can be done more efficiently by using the built-in function `__builtin_popcount()` which returns the number of 1-bits in 'i'.

5. **Avoid recalculating the same values**: The current code recalculates '2 * dp[i] / (ruby * (ruby - 1))' for each pair (j, k). This value should be calculated only once per 'i'.

Here is the optimized code considering the above steps:

```c++
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
#define fore(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < (b); i++)
#define fr(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i >= b; i--)
#define fast                                                                   \
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);                                            \
  cin.tie(0);                                                                  \
  cout.tie(0)
#define N 200005
#define FH 400005
#define inf INT32_MAX
#define MOD 1000000007LL
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pr;
inline void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<vector<double>> m(n, vector<double>(n, 0));
  fore(i, 0, n) fore(j, 0, n) cin >> m[i][j];
  map<int, double> dp;
  dp[(1 << n) - 1] = 1;
  fr(i, (1 << n) - 1, 0) {
    int ruby = __builtin_popcount(i);
    vector<int> bitmasks;
    fore(g, 0, n) {
      if ((i >> g) & 1) {
        bitmasks.push_back(i - (1 << g));
      }
    }
    double commonValue = 2 * dp[i] / (ruby * (ruby - 1));
    fore(j, 0, ruby) fore(k, j + 1, ruby) {
      dp[bitmasks[j]] += commonValue * m[j][k];
      dp[bitmasks[k]] += commonValue * m[k][j];
    }
  }
  fore(i, 0, n) cout << fixed << setprecision(20) << dp[1 << i] << ' ';
}
int main() {
  fast;
#if defined(_DEBUG)
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  solve();
}
```
This optimized program reduces memory usage by using a map instead of a vector for 'dp' and avoids redundant calculations, thus optimizing the running time. It also uses built-in functions for bit manipulation which are faster than manual calculations.
