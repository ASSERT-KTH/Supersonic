Here are the steps to optimize this program:

1. **Remove Unused Macros:** The macros `N`, `FH`, `inf` and `MOD` are defined but not used anywhere in the code. Removing them will not affect the code's functionality but will make it cleaner and slightly decrease the compilation time.

2. **Avoid Unnecessary Recomputation:** In the nested for loop inside the `solve()` function, the `ruby` variable is recomputed for every possible pair `(j, k)`. However, this value is independent of `j` and `k`, so it can be computed once for each value of `i` and then reused. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2).

3. **Replace `vector<vector<double>>` with `vector<double*>`**: The 2D vector `m` is used to store a square matrix of doubles. It can be replaced by a vector of pointers to double arrays. This will reduce the space overhead associated with the `vector` container and slightly speed up access to the matrix elements.

4. **Pre-calculate `1 << i` values:** In your code, the operation `1 << i` is computed several times. These values can be pre-calculated and stored in an array. This would save some computation time.

Now, let's implement these optimizations:

```cpp
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
#define fore(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < (b); i++)
#define fr(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i >= b; i--)
#define fast ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0)
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pr;

inline void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<double*> m(n);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        m[i] = new double[n];
        for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
            cin >> m[i][j];
    }
    vector<double> dp(1 << n, 0);
    dp[(1 << n) - 1] = 1;
    vector<int> shift(n);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        shift[i] = 1 << i;
    fr(i, (1 << n) - 1, 0) {
        int ruby = 0;
        fore(g, 0, n) {
            if ((i >> g) & 1)
                ruby++;
        }
        fore(j, 0, n) fore(k, j + 1, n) {
            if (((i >> j) & 1) && ((i >> k) & 1)) {
                int a = 0, b = 0;
                fore(g, 0, n) {
                    if (g != j && ((i >> g) & 1))
                        a += shift[g];
                    if (g != k && ((i >> g) & 1))
                        b += shift[g];
                }
                double factor = 2 * dp[i] / (ruby * (ruby - 1));
                dp[b] += factor * m[j][k];
                dp[a] += factor * m[k][j];
            }
        }
    }
    fore(i, 0, n) cout << fixed << setprecision(20) << dp[shift[i]] << ' ';
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        delete[] m[i];
}

int main() {
    fast;
#if defined(_DEBUG)
    freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
    freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
    solve();
}
```
Please note that the optimized program might not run significantly faster than the original one for small inputs, since the overhead of the optimizations might outweigh the time saved. However, for large inputs, the optimizations should significantly decrease the runtime.
