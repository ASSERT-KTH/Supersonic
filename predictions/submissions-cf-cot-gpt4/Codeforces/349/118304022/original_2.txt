The original program reads a number 'n' and an array 'a' of 'n' elements. Then it checks if each element in the array 'a' can be represented as the sum of elements in the set 'st'. If any element can't be represented, it sets 'ok' to 'false'. For each check, it performs a linear search in the set 'st' which makes the program slow for large inputs. 

Optimization Steps:
1. Use an unordered_multiset instead of a multiset. The multiset in C++ is typically implemented as a Red-Black tree, and most operations have a time complexity of O(log(n)). On the other hand, an unordered_multiset in C++ is implemented as a hash table, and most operations have an average time complexity of O(1). Therefore, replacing multiset with unordered_multiset should improve the performance of the program.

2. The size of the array 'a' is known at runtime, so it is better to use a vector instead of a C-style array which will handle memory more efficiently.

3. The 'verdict' macro can be replaced with a function to make the code cleaner and more maintainable.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

string verdict(bool ok) {
    return ok ? "YES" : "NO";
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    unordered_multiset<int> st;
    const int coins[] = {75, 50, 25};
    for (auto &i : a)
        cin >> i;
    bool ok = true;
    for (int i : a) {
        int ret = i - 25;
        if (ret) {
            for (int coin : coins) {
                while (ret && st.count(coin) && ret >= coin)
                    ret -= coin, st.erase(st.find(coin));
            }
            if (ret) {
                ok = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        st.insert(i);
    }
    cout << verdict(ok) << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
