The given program appears to be a cashier change problem, where the cashier has coins of denomination 25, 50, and 75. The cashier receives payments of various amounts and needs to give change. If a payment can be made without needing to give change, or if the exact change can be made, "YES" is printed. Otherwise, "NO" is printed. The cashier does not have any coins initially.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file is not standard and includes a lot of unnecessary stuff that we don't need. Instead, we will specifically include only the headers that we need: `iostream` and `set`.
  
2. The use of a macro for the verdict is unnecessary and can lead to confusion. We will replace it with a conditional operator inside the `cout` statement.
  
3. The `multiset` is used to store the coins. A `multiset` allows duplicate elements and maintains them in a specific order (descending in this case). However, a `multiset` has an overhead due to maintaining the order of elements. In this case, we only need to know how many coins of each denomination we have. We don't really care about the order. So, we can use an array or `vector` instead of a `multiset`.

4. The `coins[]` array is constant and can be declared as `constexpr` for better performance.

5. Instead of reading the `a[]` array all at once, we can read the elements one by one inside the main loop. This will reduce the memory usage.

6. The `st.insert(i);` statement is inside the main loop, so it will be executed even if `ok` is `false` and we have already broken out of the inner loop. We can move it inside an `else` branch to avoid unnecessary insertions.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<int> st(3, 0);
  constexpr int coins[] = {2, 1, 0};  // Indices for 75, 50, 25 coins

  bool ok = true;
  for (int _ = 0; _ < n; _++) {
    int i;
    cin >> i;
    int ret = i / 25 - 1;  // Convert to index and subtract 1 for the coin itself

    if (ret > 0) {
      for (int coin : coins) {
        while (ret > 0 && st[coin] > 0 && ret >= coin) {
          ret -= coin;
          st[coin]--;
        }
      }
      if (ret > 0) {
        ok = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    st[i / 25 - 1]++;  // Add the coin
  }

  cout << (ok ? "YES" : "NO") << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimization assumes that `n` is not very large and that the array `st` can fit in memory. If `n` can be very large, we would need to use a different approach.
