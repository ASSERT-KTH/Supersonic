This program appears to be simulating a ticket selling system where each ticket costs 25 dollars and people can pay with 25, 50, or 75 dollar coins. The task is to find out whether it's possible to provide change for each customer (assuming they pay with the largest coin possible) without running out of change.

The optimization could be approached by:

1. Avoiding the use of variable-length arrays. In C++, the size of arrays should be a compile-time constant. Using a variable-length array is not standard in C++. Instead, we can use a standard container like std::vector.

2. For checking if the change can be given or not, it's not necessary to use a multiset and perform several operations on it. We can simply keep track of the number of 25 and 50 dollar coins, because they are the ones used for the change.

3. Avoiding the use of the macro "verdict", which is less clear and less efficient than simply outputting directly in the conditional statement. Macros in C++ should be avoided when possible, as they can lead to less readable and error-prone code.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (auto &i : a)
        cin >> i;
    int count25 = 0, count50 = 0;
    bool ok = true;
    for (int i : a) {
        if (i == 25) {
            count25++;
        } else if (i == 50) {
            if (count25 == 0) {
                ok = false;
                break;
            }
            count25--;
            count50++;
        } else if (i == 75) {
            if (count50 > 0 && count25 > 0) {
                count50--;
                count25--;
            } else if (count25 >= 3) {
                count25 -= 3;
            } else {
                ok = false;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    cout << (ok ? "YES" : "NO") << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
This version of the program is optimized for both running time and memory usage. It avoids using a multiset, which reduces memory usage and the time complexity of inserting and removing elements. It also optimizes the way coins are counted and checked, which reduces the number of operations needed.
