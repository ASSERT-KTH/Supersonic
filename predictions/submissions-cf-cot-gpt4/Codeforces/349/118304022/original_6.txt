Step 1: Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and replace it with the necessary headers. Including `<bits/stdc++.h>` is bad practice because it includes more headers than needed, which increases compilation time. In this case, we only need `<iostream>` and `<set>`. 

Step 2: Change `#define verdict (ok ? "YES" : "NO")` to a function that returns a string. This is not a direct optimization but rather a good practice. It makes the code easier to read and understand, and allows for changes to be made more easily. 

Step 3: Instead of using a dynamic array `int a[n];` use a vector. Dynamic arrays are not recommended in C++ as they can lead to bugs and crashes. A vector will handle the memory for you and is safer. 

Step 4: Change the for loop that reads the input to the vector from `for (auto &i : a) cin >> i;` to `for (int i=0; i<n; i++) cin >> a[i];`. This is because we can't use range-based for loop to read input to a vector as its size is not defined at the start. 

Step 5: The multiset `st` is used to store the coins and their frequency. Instead of inserting and erasing elements constantly, we can maintain a frequency count of each coin in an array or vector. This will reduce the time complexity of the program.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

string verdict(bool ok) {
  return ok ? "YES" : "NO";
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  vector<int> coins = {75, 50, 25};
  vector<int> freq(100, 0);
  bool ok = true;
  for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  for (int i : a) {
    int ret = i - 25;
    if (ret) {
      for (int coin : coins) {
        while (ret && freq[coin] && ret >= coin) {
          ret -= coin;
          freq[coin]--;
        }
      }
      if (ret) {
        ok = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    freq[i]++;
  }
  cout << verdict(ok) << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that if `n` is significantly large, it might be better to use an unordered_map instead of a vector to store the frequency to save memory usage.
