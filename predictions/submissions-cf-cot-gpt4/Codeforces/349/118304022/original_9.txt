The original program is trying to simulate a system where it takes the input of number of people and their corresponding money they have initially. It checks if the people can get the change or not for the coins defined in the program. 

There are few things that can be optimized in your code.

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes a lot of unnecessary libraries which increases the compilation time. Instead, include only the libraries that are being used in the program. In this case, you only need iostream and set.
2. Avoid using `using namespace std;` as it may cause naming conflicts. It's better to use `std::` before every standard library object.
3. The `verdict` macro is evaluated multiple times in your program. It can be better to replace it with an inline function.
4. The dynamic array `int a[n];` is not a good practice in C++. It's better to use `std::vector<int>`.
5. The `multiset<int, greater<>> st;` is used to store the coins of each person. However, you can use `std::priority_queue` instead. It will maintain the order of coins in descending order and you will not need to explicitly sort them.
6. The `st.count(coin)` is used to check if the coin exists in the set or not, however it takes O(log n) time. Since you are only interested in if the coin exists or not, you can use `!st.empty()` instead. It will take O(1) time.
7. The `st.find(coin)` is used to find the coin in the set. It takes O(log n) time. However, you can use `st.top()` instead which will return the largest coin in O(1) time.
8. The `st.erase(st.find(coin))` is used to remove the coin from the set. It takes O(log n) time. However, you can use `st.pop()` instead which will remove the largest coin in O(1) time.

Here is the optimized version of your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<int> a(n);
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;
    const int coins[] = {75, 50, 25};
    for (auto &i : a)
        std::cin >> i;
    bool ok = true;
    for (int i : a) {
        int ret = i - 25;
        if (ret) {
            for (int coin : coins) {
                while (ret && !pq.empty() && ret >= pq.top())
                    ret -= pq.top(), pq.pop();
            }
            if (ret) {
                ok = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        pq.push(i);
    }
    std::cout << (ok ? "YES" : "NO") << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
