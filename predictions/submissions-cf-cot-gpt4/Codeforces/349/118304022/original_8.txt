The given program seems to be a cashier program that checks if a customer can be given change with available coins.

Optimization steps:

1. Instead of using a multiset which has a logarithmic complexity for insert, erase and find operations, we can use an unordered_map to keep track of the coins. An unordered_map has an average time complexity of O(1) for insert, erase and find operations.
2. The array 'a' is not being used efficiently. It is better to read the input directly into the processing loop.
3. In C++, it is considered good practice to avoid using 'using namespace std;' because it can lead to name collisions.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::unordered_map<int, int> coins_count;
  const int coins[] = {75, 50, 25};

  bool ok = true;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int value;
    std::cin >> value;
    
    int ret = value - 25;
    if (ret) {
      for (int coin : coins) {
        while (ret && coins_count[coin] && ret >= coin) {
          ret -= coin;
          coins_count[coin]--;
        }
      }
      if (ret) {
        ok = false;
        break;
      }
    }

    coins_count[value]++;
  }

  std::cout << (ok ? "YES" : "NO") << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the coins_count map will automatically create entries for missing keys and initialize them to 0 when accessed. This is why we don't need to pre-fill our map with the coin types.
