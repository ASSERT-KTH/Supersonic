The program reads a string from the user and computes the Z-function of the string. The Z-function for a string is an array of size n where the i-th element is equal to the greatest number of characters starting from the position i that coincide with the first characters of the string. It uses a multiset to store the Z-function values. After computing the Z-function, it iterates over the Z-function array from the end to the start and searches for the maximum Z-function value that also appears elsewhere in the string. If it finds such a value, it is saved as the answer. If not, it outputs the string "Just a legend".

The Z-function computation and the iteration over the Z-function array are already efficient. However, using a multiset to count the occurrences of Z-function values is inefficient both in terms of time and memory. A multiset uses a balanced binary search tree internally which causes log(n) overhead for each insertion and deletion. Also, it stores each element individually which increases the memory usage.

The program can be optimized by replacing the multiset with a frequency table implemented as a vector. The frequency table will store the frequency of each Z-function value. This can be done since the Z-function values are non-negative integers and their maximum value is n. The frequency table will allow constant time increment, decrement and access operations, improving the time complexity. It will also use less memory since it only needs to store one integer for each possible Z-function value.

The optimized program is:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int
#define sz(x) (long)x.size()
#define debug(x...)

vector<ll> Z(string s) {
  ll n = sz(s);
  vector<ll> z(n);
  for (ll i = 1, l = 0, r = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i <= r)
      z[i] = min(r - i + 1, z[i - l]);
    while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[z[i] + i]) {
      ++z[i];
    }
    if (i + z[i] - 1 > r) {
      l = i;
      r = i + z[i] - 1;
    }
  }
  return z;
}

signed main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  string s;
  cin >> s;
  string p = "Just a legend";
  ll n = sz(s);
  vector<ll> z = Z(s);
  vector<ll> freq(n+1, 0);
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++)
    freq[z[i]]++;
  debug(freq);
  ll ans = -1;
  for (ll i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    freq[z[i]]--;
    if (i + z[i] == n && freq[z[i]] > 0)
      ans = max(ans, z[i]);
  }
  if (ans == -1)
    cout << p;
  else
    cout << s.substr(0, ans);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimization is based on the fact that we can use a frequency table to count the occurrences of the Z-function values instead of a multiset, which reduces the time and memory complexity.
