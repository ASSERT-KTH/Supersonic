The given program is a complex one that utilizes many features of the C++ STL. It includes a variety of functions like `Z`, `lcm`, `ispalindrome`, etc. which are general utility functions and are optimized already. The main program flow is controlled by the `main` function.

In the `main` function, the program calculates the Z array for a string, and then it performs computations over these Z values inside a loop. There is an optimization potential in the way the Z values are handled. Currently, the program is using `multiset` to store the Z values and then performing an `erase` operation in each iteration of the loop. The `erase` operation in `multiset` is a logarithmic time operation, which increases the time complexity of the program. 

One way to optimize the program is to use a frequency array instead of `multiset`. This will hold the frequency count of the Z values. This way, the `erase` operation is replaced by a simple decrement operation, which is a constant time operation.

Here is the optimized program with this change:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int
#define sz(x) (long)x.size()
vector<ll> Z(string s) {
  ll n = sz(s);
  vector<ll> z(n);
  for (ll i = 1, l = 0, r = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i <= r)
      z[i] = min(r - i + 1, z[i - l]);
    while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[z[i] + i]) {
      ++z[i];
    }
    if (i + z[i] - 1 > r) {
      l = i;
      r = i + z[i] - 1;
    }
  }
  return z;
}
signed main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  string p = "Just a legend";
  ll n = sz(s);
  vector<ll> z = Z(s);
  vector<ll> freq(n+1, 0); // Frequency array
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++)
    freq[z[i]]++; // Increase frequency
  ll ans = -1;
  for (ll i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    freq[z[i]]--; // Decrease frequency
    if (i + z[i] == n && freq[z[i]] > 0) {
      ans = max(ans, z[i]);
    }
  }
  if (ans == -1)
    cout << p;
  else
    cout << s.substr(0, ans);
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the remaining parts of the program not shown here have not been changed. The given program is already quite complex and this small optimization might not lead to noticeable improvements in all cases. However, it does improve the time complexity of the main loop from O(N log N) to O(N), which can be significant for large inputs.
