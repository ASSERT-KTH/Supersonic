This code is already highly optimized and uses various techniques typical for competitive programming tasks, such as the Z function for string processing or the use of macros for common operations. However, there are still minor improvements that could be made:

1. Reuse computations:
   We can notice that the value of `z[i]` is used multiple times in the loop. We can assign it to a variable and use this variable instead of repeatedly accessing the vector.

2. Avoid unnecessary computations:
   The `max` function is called even when `ans` is guaranteed to not change. We can avoid this by checking if the current `z[i]` is greater than `ans` before calling `max`.

3. Use `auto` for type inference:
   In some cases, we can use `auto` to infer the type of variables. This makes the code shorter and easier to change in the future.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
signed main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  string p = "Just a legend";
  ll n = sz(s);
  vector<ll> z = Z(s);
  multiset<ll> ss;
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++)
    ss.insert(z[i]);
  debug(ss);
  ll ans = -1;
  for (ll i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    auto z_i = z[i]; // Reuse computation
    ss.erase(ss.find(z_i));
    if (i + z_i == n) {
      debug(ss, z_i);
      auto it = ss.lb(z_i);
      if (it != ss.end() && *it >= z_i && z_i > ans) // Avoid unnecessary computation
        ans = z_i; // Use assignment instead of max
    }
  }
  if (ans == -1)
    cout << p;
  else
    cout << s.substr(0, ans);
  printclock;
  return 0;
}
```
