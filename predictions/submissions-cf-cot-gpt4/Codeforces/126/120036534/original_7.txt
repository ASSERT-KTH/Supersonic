This program seems to be well optimized for the most part. However, there are a few changes that might be beneficial:

1) Avoid including the whole standard library: `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` should be avoided as it includes more than necessary, which can increase compilation time. Include only the necessary libraries.

2) Remove unused macros and typedefs: The program includes a large number of macros and typedefs, many of which are not in use. This increases the size of the program and can make it more difficult to understand.

3) Use of `multiset` for frequency checking: In this case, `multiset` is used to track the frequency of elements from the Z array. While `multiset` is a perfectly valid data structure for this purpose, it may be a bit overkill. If the range of values in the Z array is known and not too large, a simple array or vector could be used instead, which would reduce the memory usage and potentially increase the speed.

4) Use of debug function: While it's useful for debugging, it's unnecessary for the final version of the program. It might be more efficient to remove it or at least comment it out.

5) Use of `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);`: This is used to speed up I/O operations by untieing `cin` from `cout` and turning off synchronization with the C standard I/O. While it does speed up I/O operations, it can cause problems if you're using both C and C++ I/O in your program. If you're not, it's safe to leave it in.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>
#define ll long long int
#define sz(x) (long)x.size()
using namespace std;

vector<ll> Z(string s) {
  ll n = sz(s);
  vector<ll> z(n);
  for (ll i = 1, l = 0, r = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i <= r)
      z[i] = min(r - i + 1, z[i - l]);
    while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[z[i] + i]) {
      ++z[i];
    }
    if (i + z[i] - 1 > r) {
      l = i;
      r = i + z[i] - 1;
    }
  }
  return z;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  string p = "Just a legend";
  ll n = sz(s);
  vector<ll> z = Z(s);
  multiset<ll> ss;
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++)
    ss.insert(z[i]);
  ll ans = -1;
  for (ll i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    ss.erase(ss.find(z[i]));
    if (i + z[i] == n) {
      auto it = ss.lower_bound(z[i]);
      if (it != ss.end() && *it >= z[i])
        ans = max(ans, z[i]);
    }
  }
  if (ans == -1)
    cout << p;
  else
    cout << s.substr(0, ans);
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the effectiveness of these optimizations depends on the specific use case and the input data. They might not always result in noticeable improvements.
