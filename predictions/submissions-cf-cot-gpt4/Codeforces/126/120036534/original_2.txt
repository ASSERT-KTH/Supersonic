The code you have provided is quite optimized but there are a few points that can be considered for further optimization:

1. Remove Unused Code: There are several template functions that are not used in the code. Removing them will make the code cleaner and faster since it will reduce the compilation time of your code.

2. Avoid #include <bits/stdc++.h>: Although this is a common practice in competitive programming, it's not a good practice in general because this header file includes a lot of unnecessary code that can slow down the compilation process.

3. Avoid Global Variables: Global variables can lead to problems in larger projects and can cause unnecessary memory usage. 

4. Use Fast I/O: The standard cin and cout operations are slower, so to speed up the I/O you can use faster alternatives like scanf and printf.

5. Use reserve() function: If you know the size of the vector beforehand, you can use the reserve() function. This will prevent unnecessary re-allocations and copying during the runtime of the program.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <set>
#include <string>

using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

vector<ll> Z(string s) {
  ll n = s.size();
  vector<ll> z(n);
  for (ll i = 1, l = 0, r = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i <= r)
      z[i] = min(r - i + 1, z[i - l]);
    while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[z[i] + i]) {
      ++z[i];
    }
    if (i + z[i] - 1 > r) {
      l = i;
      r = i + z[i] - 1;
    }
  }
  return z;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  string p = "Just a legend";
  ll n = s.size();
  vector<ll> z = Z(s);
  multiset<ll> ss;
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++)
    ss.insert(z[i]);
  ll ans = -1;
  for (ll i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    ss.erase(ss.find(z[i]));
    if (i + z[i] == n) {
      auto it = ss.lower_bound(z[i]);
      if (it != ss.end() && *it >= z[i])
        ans = max(ans, z[i]);
    }
  }
  if (ans == -1)
    cout << p;
  else
    cout << s.substr(0, ans);
  return 0;
}
```
