The existing code doesn't have any major inefficiencies or issues, but there are a few small tweaks we can make:

1) Pass vector by reference and make it const if it is not modified in the function - This is already done effectively in the given code.

2) Use prefix increment (++i) instead of postfix (i++) in loops - In C++, the prefix version avoids unnecessary temporary object creation and destruction, making it slightly more efficient than the postfix version.

3) Use '\n' instead of endl - The endl manipulator produces a newline character, exactly as the insertion of '\n' does, but it also has the side effect of flushing the output stream, which can be an expensive operation in terms of execution time. The '\n' character doesn't cause a flush.

4) Avoid using std::endl unless you really need to flush the stream - Flushing the stream is an expensive operation, so it's best avoided unless necessary.

5) Don't use "using namespace std;" - This is a matter of good programming practice rather than optimization. It's generally considered better to use the std:: prefix when you're using something from the std namespace in order to avoid potential name clashes.

6) Avoid using bitset. In many cases, simple bitwise operations are faster and use less memory.

7) Remove unnecessary includes - If you're not using something from an include file, don't include it. This can reduce compilation times and potentially executable size.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits>

int recurse(const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& dp, int index = 0, int OR = 0) {
  if (index == a.size()) {
    return OR;
  }
  if (dp[index][OR] != -1)
    return dp[index][OR];
  int answer = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
  for (int i = 0; i < b.size(); ++i) {
    int ret = recurse(a, b, dp, index + 1, OR | (a[index] & b[i]));
    answer = std::min(answer, ret);
  }
  return dp[index][OR] = answer;
}

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  std::vector<int> a(n), b(m);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    std::cin >> a[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
    std::cin >> b[i];
  std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n, std::vector<int>(1 << 9, -1));
  std::cout << recurse(a, b, dp) << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
