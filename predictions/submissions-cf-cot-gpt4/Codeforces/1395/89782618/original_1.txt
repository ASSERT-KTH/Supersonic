The main optimization that can be done in this program is to reduce the number of recursive calls. 

In the original program, the function `recurse` is excessively called due to the loop `for (int i = 0; i < b.size(); ++i)`. This loop iterates over all the elements in the vector `b` and for each element, it makes a recursive call to `recurse`. This can be quite inefficient when the size of `b` is large as it leads to a large number of recursive calls.

We can optimize this by calculating the OR operation on all elements of `b` with `a[index]` in a single loop before the recursive call. After that, we can make a single recursive call to `recurse` function which will reduce the number of recursive calls significantly and hence, will optimize the program both in terms of running time and memory usage.

The optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int recurse(const vector<int> &a, const vector<int> &b, vector<vector<int>> &dp,
            int index = 0, int OR = 0) {
  if (index == a.size()) {
    return OR;
  }
  if (dp[index][OR] != -1)
    return dp[index][OR];
  int answer = numeric_limits<int>::max();
  int ret = numeric_limits<int>::max();
  for (int i = 0; i < b.size(); ++i) {
    ret = min(ret, OR | (a[index] & b[i]));
  }
  answer = min(answer, recurse(a, b, dp, index + 1, ret));
  return dp[index][OR] = answer;
}
int main(int argc, char const *argv[]) {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  vector<int> a(n), b(m);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    cin >> a[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
    cin >> b[i];
  vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(1 << 9, -1));
  cout << recurse(a, b, dp) << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, the loop `for (int i = 0; i < b.size(); ++i)` calculates the OR operation on all elements of `b` with `a[index]` and store the minimum value in `ret`. After that, a single recursive call to `recurse` function is made with `ret` as an argument which will decrease the number of recursive calls and hence, will optimize the program.
