The main optimization that can be done in this program is to reduce the number of recursive calls. This can be achieved by memoization - storing the result of expensive function calls and reusing the result when the same inputs occur again.

For this program, we can see that the function `recurse` is called repeatedly with the same parameters inside the loop in itself. This implies that the function is computing the same value multiple times, which is inefficient. 

We can store the result of the function call in a 2D array `dp` and before making a new function call, we can check if the result for those parameters is already computed and stored in the `dp` array. If it is, we just use that value instead of making a new function call. This reduces the number of function calls, thus improving the time efficiency of the program.

The memory usage of the program is already optimal as it uses only a vector of integers and a 2D vector of integers. The memory usage can only be reduced by reducing the size of these data structures, but that would also reduce the functionality of the program. So, there's not much we can do to optimize memory usage without affecting the functionality.

Here's the optimized program:

```C++
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int recurse(const vector<int> &a, const vector<int> &b, vector<vector<int>> &dp,
            int index = 0, int OR = 0) {
  if (index == a.size()) {
    return OR;
  }
  if (dp[index][OR] != -1)
    return dp[index][OR];
  int answer = numeric_limits<int>::max();
  for (int i = 0; i < b.size(); ++i) {
    int temp = OR | (a[index] & b[i]);
    if(dp[index+1][temp] == -1) {
      dp[index+1][temp] = recurse(a, b, dp, index + 1, temp);
    }
    answer = min(answer, dp[index+1][temp]);
  }
  return dp[index][OR] = answer;
}
int main(int argc, char const *argv[]) {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  vector<int> a(n), b(m);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    cin >> a[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
    cin >> b[i];
  vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(1 << 9, -1));
  cout << recurse(a, b, dp) << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

The main change is in the loop inside the `recurse` function. Before making a recursive call, we compute the value of `OR | (a[index] & b[i])` and store it in `temp`. Then we check if `dp[index+1][temp]` is already computed. If it is, we just use that value. If not, we make a recursive call to compute it and store the result in `dp[index+1][temp]`. This ensures that we are not making unnecessary recursive calls and re-computing values.
