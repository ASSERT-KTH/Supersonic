The given code doesn't seem to have a lot of room for optimization without changing the fundamental approach or data structures used. However, there are a few small things we could do to potentially improve performance:

1. Avoiding the use of `#define` macros: The use of `#define` in C/C++ can lead to potential problems, such as unexpected side-effects, debugging difficulties, and code readability problems. Instead of `#define`, we can use `const` or inline functions.

2. Avoiding the use of `bits/stdc++.h`: This header file includes quite a large number of standard library headers, which can significantly slow down the compilation time. It is more efficient and recommended to only include the specific standard library headers that are actually needed for the code.

3. Reducing the use of global variables: Global variables can make debugging difficult and it's generally a bad practice to use them unless absolutely necessary. In this case, the variables `s` and `d` are global but they could be passed as arguments to the `bfs()` and `print()` functions.

Here is the optimized code according to the suggestions above:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;

const ll INF = 1 << 28;
const long double EPS = 1e-7;

int vis[6000][600];
pii dp[6000][600];

bool bfs(int s, int d) {
  queue<pii> q;
  q.push(make_pair(s, 0));
  vis[s][0] = 1;
  pii p;
  int f = 1, mul, sum;
  while (!q.empty()) {
    p = q.front();
    q.pop();
    for (int i = f; i < 10; i++) {
      sum = p.first;
      sum -= i;
      mul = p.second;
      mul *= 10;
      mul += i;
      mul %= d;
      if (sum == 0 && mul == 0) {
        dp[sum][mul] = make_pair(p.first, p.second);
        return 1;
      }
      if (sum >= 0 && !vis[sum][mul]) {
        vis[sum][mul] = 1;
        q.push(make_pair(sum, mul));
        dp[sum][mul] = make_pair(p.first, p.second);
      }
    }
    f = 0;
  }
  return 0;
}

void print(int sum, int mul, int s) {
  if (sum == s && mul == 0)
    return;
  print(dp[sum][mul].first, dp[sum][mul].second, s);
  cout << dp[sum][mul].first - sum;
}

int main() {
  int d, s;
  cin >> d >> s;
  if (bfs(s, d) == 1) {
    print(0, 0, s);
  } else
    cout << -1 << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the above optimizations might not significantly improve the performance of the program since the bottleneck is primarily the `bfs()` function which is necessary for this problem's solution. However, these changes improve the code quality and maintainability.
