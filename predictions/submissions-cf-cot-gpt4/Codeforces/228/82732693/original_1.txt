This C++ program takes four integers as input, sorts them, and then counts and prints out the number of duplicates. It does this by starting with a count of 3 and decrementing it each time it finds a unique number.

The optimizations that can be done are:

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is quite heavy as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers. It's better to include only the headers that are needed, which in this case are `iostream` and `algorithm`.

2. Instead of using an array, we can use a data structure such as a `std::set` which automatically removes duplicate elements. This way, we don't need to manually sort and compare the elements in the array.

3. Instead of initializing `ans = 3` and decrementing it to count the number of duplicates, we can initialize `ans = 0` and increment it each time we find a duplicate. This leads to simpler and more readable code.

4. Make use of pre-increment (++i) instead of post increment (i++) as it is faster in C++ because it doesn't create a temporary variable.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  set<int> numbers;
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    int num;
    cin >> num;
    numbers.insert(num);
  }
  int ans = 4 - numbers.size();
  cout << ans;
}
```
This code will execute faster and use less memory than the original program.
