This program accepts 4 integer inputs, sorts them, and then checks for duplicates. The variable `ans` is initialized to 3 and decreases every time a unique number is found. Finally, the value of `ans` is output.

The program can be optimized as follows:

1. **Unnecessary use of 'bits/stdc++.h' header**: This header file is actually not a standard library header. It is a GCC specific header that includes every standard library. This increases compilation time significantly. It's better to include only those headers which we are using in our program. In this case, we only need `iostream` and `algorithm`.

2. **Using namespace std**: This is generally considered bad practice. It can cause name clashes because it imports all standard library names into the global namespace.

3. **Use of C-style array**: We can use an `std::array` instead of C-style array which is safer and offers benefits like bound checking.

4. **Unnecessary sorting**: We don't need to sort the array just to find duplicates. Instead, we can use `std::unordered_set` which has an average time complexity of O(1) for insert and find operations. This also eliminates the need for the second for loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <array>

int main() {
    std::array<int,4> mas;
    std::unordered_set<int> unique_numbers;
    int ans = 3;

    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
        std::cin >> mas[i];
        unique_numbers.insert(mas[i]);
    }

    ans -= unique_numbers.size() - 1;
    std::cout << ans;

    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized program, we are using `std::unordered_set` to keep track of the unique numbers. The size of the `unordered_set` gives the number of unique numbers in the input. The `ans` is then adjusted based on the number of unique numbers. This has a time complexity of O(1) for each insertion and find operation.
