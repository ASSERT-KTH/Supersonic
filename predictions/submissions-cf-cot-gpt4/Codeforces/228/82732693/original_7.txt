The given C++ program reads 4 integers into an array, sorts the array, then counts the number of unique elements. 

Here are the possible optimizations:

1. Avoid using `#include<bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes lots of unnecessary stuff which increases the compilation time. So, replace it with necessary header files like `iostream` and `algorithm` in this case.
2. Use of `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);`: This can speed up the I/O in C++ by not synchronizing the C++ standard streams with their corresponding standard C streams.
3. Memory optimization: Instead of using an array `mas[5]`, we can use a vector since we only need 4 elements. This saves memory as vector is dynamic in nature.
4. Use of `std::ios_base::tie(NULL);`: This function unties cin from cout. Tied streams ensure that one stream is flushed automatically before each I/O operation on the other stream.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  
  vector<int> mas(4);
  int ans = 3;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    cin >> mas[i];
  }
  
  sort(mas.begin(), mas.end());
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    if (mas[i] != mas[i + 1])
      --ans;
  }
  
  cout << ans;
}
```

Note: The changes made are relatively minor and the overall structure of the program remains the same. The primary focus of these changes is to reduce the time complexity and memory usage of the program. The time complexity remains O(n log n) due to the sorting step, but the constant factors have been reduced. The memory usage is also slightly reduced due to the use of vector.
