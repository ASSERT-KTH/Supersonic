The given program takes an array of 4 integers as input, sorts them, and then counts the number of duplicate elements in the sorted array.

1. Optimization for Running Time:

The program is already time-optimized, since sorting an array of 4 integers is a constant-time operation O(1). But we can still make a small optimization. Instead of sorting the array, we can use a set to remove duplicates instantly. This will not significantly improve the running time because the size of the array is small, but it is an optimization nevertheless.

2. Optimization for Memory Usage:

The variable `ans` is initially set to 3 and then decremented each time a unique element is found in the array. However, instead of decrementing `ans`, we can increment a counter each time a unique element is found. This lets us get rid of the `mas` array entirely, and read the input directly into a set. This will reduce memory usage.

Optimized program:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  set<int> s;
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    s.insert(x);
  }
  cout << 4 - s.size();
}
```

In this optimized program, we directly read the input into a set, which automatically removes duplicates. The size of the set tells us how many unique elements are in the input. We subtract this from 4 (the total number of elements) to get the count of duplicate elements.
