There are few areas we could optimize in this program:

1. IO operations: Standard C++ IO operations are slower, we could speed up the IO operations using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`.

2. Sort function: The current program uses the `sort` function which has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of elements. Since we only have 4 elements to sort, it would be more efficient to use an algorithm that takes advantage of this fact.

3. Smaller data types: We could use a smaller data type for `mas` and `ans` to save memory if we are sure that the input values will be within the range of the smaller data type.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  short mas[4], ans = 3;
  for (short i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    cin >> mas[i];
  }

  // Manual sort for 4 elements
  for (short i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    for (short j = i + 1; j < 4; ++j) {
      if (mas[i] > mas[j]) {
        swap(mas[i], mas[j]);
      }
    }
  }

  for (short i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    if (mas[i] != mas[i + 1])
      --ans;
  }

  cout << ans;
}
```
This version of the program should run faster and use less memory than the original version. Note that this optimization may not scale well for larger inputs.
