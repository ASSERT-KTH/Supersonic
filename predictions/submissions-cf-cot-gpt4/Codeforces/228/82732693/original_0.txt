This program reads 4 integers from the standard input, sorts them and then counts how many unique numbers there are. The `ans` variable is initially set to 3 because there are 3 potential pairs of adjacent elements that could be equal in a 4-element array. If a pair of adjacent elements is found that are not equal, `ans` is decremented.

Optimization Steps:

1. We can eliminate the usage of `sort()` function. Sorting requires O(n log n) operations and we don't really need the numbers to be sorted in order to count the unique numbers. We can use a data structure like `std::set` which automatically eliminates duplicates and provides a method to count the number of unique elements. This will reduce the time complexity to O(n).

2. We are declaring an array of size 5, but we are only using 4 elements. We can reduce the size of the array to 4 to save memory.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  set<int> values;
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    int input;
    cin >> input;
    values.insert(input);
  }
  cout << 4 - values.size();
}
```

In the optimized program, we read the 4 integers directly into a `std::set`, which automatically eliminates any duplicates. Then we simply print out the number of duplicates by subtracting the number of unique numbers (the size of the set) from 4.
