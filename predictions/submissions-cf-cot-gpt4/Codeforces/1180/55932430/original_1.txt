The program you provided seems to be solving a competitive programming problem. However, there are several ways to optimize it:

1. Avoid creating unnecessary temporary variables: Variables such as `temp`, `a`, and `b` are unnecessary. They increase memory usage. Input can be read directly into the target variable or structure.

2. Unnecessary `deque` operations: The `pop_front` function pops the front element of the deque and then returns it. However, this is a two-step operation. We can directly access the front element, perform the necessary comparisons, and then pop the front element.

3. Avoid using `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations: `cin` and `cout` are significantly slower than their `scanf` and `printf` counterparts. In a program where every millisecond counts, it's better to use the latter.

4. Use `reserve()` for vectors: If you know the maximum size of your vector beforehand, you can use the `reserve()` function to preallocate memory. This prevents the vector from reallocating memory every time an element is added, which can be time-consuming.

5. Replace `while(true)` loop with a condition: Instead of breaking the loop from inside, you can use a condition in the loop statement. This makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.

6. Use `emplace_back()` instead of `push_back()`: `emplace_back()` constructs the pair in-place, thus avoiding the overhead of creating a temporary pair object and then copying it.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the code:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
typedef unsigned long long ULL;
typedef long long LL;
#define FOR(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i <= (b); ++i)
#define REP(i, n) FOR(i, 0, (int)(n - 1))
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, q;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &q);
  deque<int> deq;
  vector<pair<int, int>> v;
  v.reserve(n); // reserve memory for vector
  int mx = -1;
  int pos;
  REP(i, n) {
    scanf("%d", &pos);
    deq.push_back(pos);
    if (pos > mx) {
      mx = pos;
      pos = i;
    }
  }
  vector<int> finalarray;
  finalarray.reserve(n); // reserve memory for vector
  int cnt = 0;
  while (deq.front() != mx) {
    int a = deq.front();
    deq.pop_front();
    int b = deq.front();
    deq.pop_front();
    if (a > b) {
      deq.push_front(a);
      deq.push_back(b);
    } else {
      deq.push_front(b);
      deq.push_back(a);
    }
    v.emplace_back(a, b); // construct pair in-place
    cnt++;
  }
  while (!deq.empty()) {
    finalarray.push_back(deq.front());
    deq.pop_front();
  }
  REP(i, q) {
    LL query;
    scanf("%lld", &query);
    if (query <= cnt) {
      printf("%d %d\n", v[query - 1].first, v[query - 1].second);
    } else {
      query -= cnt + 1;
      query %= n - 1;
      printf("%d %d\n", mx, finalarray[query + 1]);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that the optimization of the code depends on the context and the specific problem you are trying to solve.
