This C++ program involves a lot of pushing and popping from a deque, which can be costly in terms of time and memory. There are also a few other areas that can be optimized.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Minimize the use of "pop_front" function: The "pop_front" function is called multiple times in the code. This function involves moving all elements of the deque, which is costly in terms of time. Instead, you can use an index to keep track of the current front of the deque.

2. Avoid unnecessary deque operations: In the while loop, there are unnecessary deque operations. For example, when a > b, you pop 'a' and 'b' from the deque, and then push 'a' back to the front and 'b' to the back. Instead, you can just push 'b' to the back of the deque.

3. Avoid unnecessary vector operations: You store the pairs (a, b) in a vector 'v' in the while loop. However, you only need the pairs when the query is less than or equal to 'cnt'. Therefore, you can store the pairs in 'v' only when 'cnt' is less than 'q'.

4. Use 'scanf' and 'printf' for input/output: 'scanf' and 'printf' are faster than 'cin' and 'cout'. Therefore, you can replace 'cin' and 'cout' with 'scanf' and 'printf'.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
typedef unsigned long long ULL;
typedef long long LL;
#define FOR(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i <= (b); ++i)
#define REP(i, n) FOR(i, 0, (int)(n - 1))
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, q;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &q);
  deque<int> deq(n);
  vector<pair<int, int>> v(min(n-1, q));
  int mx = -1;
  int idx = 0;
  REP(i, n) {
    scanf("%d", &deq[i]);
    if (deq[i] > mx) {
      mx = deq[i];
      idx = i;
    }
  }
  vector<int> finalarray(n);
  int cnt = 0;
  while (idx > 0) {
    if (deq[0] > deq[1]) {
      deq.push_back(deq[1]);
      if (cnt < q) v[cnt] = make_pair(deq[0], deq[1]);
    } else {
      deq.push_back(deq[0]);
      if (cnt < q) v[cnt] = make_pair(deq[1], deq[0]);
      deq[0] = deq[1];
    }
    idx--;
    cnt++;
  }
  copy(deq.begin(), deq.end(), finalarray.begin());
  REP(i, q) {
    LL query;
    scanf("%lld", &query);
    if (query <= cnt) {
      printf("%d %d\n", v[query - 1].first, v[query - 1].second);
    } else {
      query -= cnt + 1;
      query %= n - 1;
      printf("%d %d\n", mx, finalarray[query + 1]);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces the time complexity from approximately O(n^2) to O(n), and also reduces the memory usage by avoiding unnecessary deque and vector operations.
