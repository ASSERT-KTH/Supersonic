The given C/C++ program seems to be implementing a specific logic and it is not clear what kind of optimization can be applied because it depends on the problem statement.

However, from the code, there are a few improvements that could be done:

1. **Avoid unnecessary copying when pushing to vectors**: When pushing back pairs into the vector v, we can use emplace_back instead of push_back to construct the pair object in place instead of creating a temporary and then copying it.

2. **Avoid unnecessary calls to pop_front**: The pop_front function involves a copy of the front element and then popping it from the deque. Instead we can pop the element directly from the deque and use it.

3. **Avoid unnecessary if check in each iteration**: By first finding the maximum and its position, we can split the deque into two at the position of the maximum. Then we don't have to check if we found the maximum in each iteration.

4. **Avoid using scanf and printf**: Modern C++ code should use cin and cout for input and output. It's more type-safe and easier to use.

Here's how the code looks after applying these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
typedef unsigned long long ULL;
typedef long long LL;
#define FOR(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i <= (b); ++i)
#define REP(i, n) FOR(i, 0, (int)(n - 1))
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, q;
  cin >> n >> q;
  deque<int> deq;
  vector<pair<int, int>> v;
  int mx = -1;
  int pos;
  REP(i, n) {
    int temp;
    cin >> temp;
    deq.push_back(temp);
    if (temp > mx) {
      mx = temp;
      pos = i;
    }
  }
  vector<int> finalarray;
  int cnt = 0;

  deque<int> deq1(deq.begin(), deq.begin() + pos);
  deque<int> deq2(deq.begin() + pos, deq.end());

  while (!deq1.empty()) {
    int a = deq1.front();
    deq1.pop_front();
    int b = deq1.front();
    deq1.pop_front();
    if (a > b) {
      deq1.push_front(a);
      deq1.push_back(b);
    } else {
      deq1.push_front(b);
      deq1.push_back(a);
    }
    v.emplace_back(a, b);
    cnt++;
  }
  while (!deq2.empty()) {
    finalarray.push_back(deq2.front());
    deq2.pop_front();
  }
  REP(i, q) {
    LL query;
    cin >> query;
    if (query <= cnt) {
      cout << v[query - 1].first << " " << v[query - 1].second << "\n";
    } else {
      query -= cnt + 1;
      query %= n - 1;
      cout << mx << " " << finalarray[query + 1] << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
These are just some possible optimizations. Depending on the specific requirements of your problem, there might be other more specific optimizations that can be done.
