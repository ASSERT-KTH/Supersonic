The given C++ program is already optimized to solve a dynamic programming problem using memoization technique. However, there are few things we can do to improve the readability and maintenance of the code. We will not be able to optimize the running time and memory usage significantly in this case as the algorithm used is already efficient.

1. Remove unnecessary `#define` macros: Many of the defined macros are not used in the program. They just add unnecessary clutter. We can keep only those which are being used in the program.

2. Use standard includes instead of `<bits/stdc++.h>`: This is a non-standard header file and it includes a lot of unnecessary header files which can increase compilation time. We will include only those header files which are necessary.

3. Remove the unused namespace `std` at the end of the program. It is not used anywhere in the program and is unnecessary.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<ll> V;
#define f0r(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
const int maxn = 100005;
ll arr1[maxn], arr2[maxn];
ll dp[maxn][3];
int n;

ll dpF(int i, int last) {
  if (i == n)
    return 0LL;
  if (dp[i][last] != -1)
    return dp[i][last];
  ll op1 = 0LL, op2 = 0LL, op3 = 0LL;
  if (last != 1)
    op1 = arr1[i] + dpF(i + 1, 1);
  if (last != 2)
    op2 = arr2[i] + dpF(i + 1, 2);
  op3 = dpF(i + 1, last);
  return dp[i][last] = max({op1, op2, op3});
}

void solve() {
  memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
  cin >> n;
  f0r(i, n) cin >> arr1[i];
  f0r(i, n) cin >> arr2[i];
  cout << dpF(0, 0) << "\n";
}

int main() {
  int t;
  t = 1;
  f0r(i, t) { solve(); }
  return 0;
}
```
The running time of the program will remain the same. The memory usage is mainly determined by the size of the dynamic programming table and the input size, both of which are not changed in the optimized program.
