The given code is already quite efficient. It uses dynamic programming to solve the problem, which is usually an optimal approach. But we can still make a few optimizations:

1. Minimize the usage of macros: Macros (#define) in C/C++ are usually not recommended because they do not provide type safety and can lead to hard-to-track bugs. They also make the code harder to read and maintain. However, in competitive programming, macros are widely used for the sake of typing speed and convenience. In practical software development, it is better to avoid them.

2. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: This header file includes quite literally the entire standard library. This can significantly increase the compile time, and it may also include many things that you do not actually need. It's better to include only the specific standard libraries that you need.

3. Avoid global variables: Global variables can make the program harder to read and debug because they can be accessed and modified from anywhere. It's better to pass them as arguments to functions where they are needed.

Here's the optimized version of the code with mentioned improvements:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int maxn = 100005;

ll dpF(int i, int last, int n, ll arr1[], ll arr2[], ll dp[][3]) {
  if (i == n)
    return 0LL;
  if (dp[i][last] != -1)
    return dp[i][last];
  ll op1 = 0LL, op2 = 0LL, op3 = 0LL;
  if (last != 1)
    op1 = arr1[i] + dpF(i + 1, 1, n, arr1, arr2, dp);
  if (last != 2)
    op2 = arr2[i] + dpF(i + 1, 2, n, arr1, arr2, dp);
  op3 = dpF(i + 1, last, n, arr1, arr2, dp);
  return dp[i][last] = max({op1, op2, op3});
}

void solve() {
  ll arr1[maxn], arr2[maxn];
  ll dp[maxn][3];
  int n;
  memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
  cin >> n;
  for(int i=0; i<n; i++) cin >> arr1[i];
  for(int i=0; i<n; i++) cin >> arr2[i];
  cout << dpF(0, 0, n, arr1, arr2, dp) << "\n";
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  for(int i=0; i<t; i++) solve();
  return 0;
}
```
