This C++ program is already optimized in terms of running time. The main function in this program is "dpF(int i, int last)" which implements Dynamic Programming to solve the problem in an optimal way. The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the size of the given array. This is because each state of the dynamic programming is visited only once. 

However, there are a few changes that can be made to improve the program's readability and maintainability:

1. Do not use "using namespace std". This can cause naming conflicts, especially in larger projects. Instead, specify std:: before each standard library entity.

2. Remove unused macros, typedefs, and functions to reduce clutter. For example, macros like "FastIO", "F", "S", "debug", "REP", "fori", "MP", "UB", "LB", "nw", "issq", "asche", "rev", "srt", "grtsrt", "all", "mnv", "mxv", "valid", "one", "setPrec", "sz", "INF", "diff", "PI" and typedefs like "vi", "V", "mp" are not used in this program.

3. Include only necessary headers. The "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" header is generally considered bad practice because it includes a lot of unnecessary headers, increasing compile time. Instead, include only the headers that are actually used in the program. In this case, "#include <iostream>", "#include <algorithm>", and "#include <cstring>" are enough.

4. Avoid using global variables. In this case, "n", "arr1", "arr2", and "dp" can be passed as arguments to the function "dpF". However, this will require a change in the function signature and can be considered as a rewrite of the program.

5. Use meaningful variable names. For example, "op1", "op2", "op3" can be renamed to "option1", "option2", "option3" to improve readability.

Here is the optimized code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>

typedef long long ll;
const int maxn = 100005;
ll arr1[maxn], arr2[maxn];
ll dp[maxn][3];
int n;

ll dpF(int i, int last) {
  if (i == n)
    return 0LL;
  if (dp[i][last] != -1)
    return dp[i][last];
  ll option1 = 0LL, option2 = 0LL, option3 = 0LL;
  if (last != 1)
    option1 = arr1[i] + dpF(i + 1, 1);
  if (last != 2)
    option2 = arr2[i] + dpF(i + 1, 2);
  option3 = dpF(i + 1, last);
  return dp[i][last] = std::max({option1, option2, option3});
}

void solve() {
  std::memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
  std::cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) std::cin >> arr1[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) std::cin >> arr2[i];
  std::cout << dpF(0, 0) << "\n";
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
