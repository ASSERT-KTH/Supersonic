The given C++ program is already quite efficient and well-written, but there are a few small modifications that we can make to help optimize it.

1. Avoid Redefinition of Namespace: The namespace "std" is defined twice in the program. We can remove the second "using namespace std;" to save memory.

2. Unnecessary Macro Definitions: Some macros are defined but not used anywhere in the program (like FastIO, F, S, fori, MP, UB, LB, nw, issq, rev, asche, srt, grtsrt, all, mnv, mxv, valid, one, setPrec, sz). Removing them will make the program cleaner and slightly faster to compile.

3. Unnecessary Variables: In the function dpF, three variables op1, op2, and op3 are declared. However, we can directly return the maximum without storing the values first.

4. Remove Unused Constants: The constants INF, diff, PI are declared but not used anywhere in the program. Removing them will save memory.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
#define REP(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < b; i++)
#define f0r(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
const int maxn = 100005;
ll arr1[maxn], arr2[maxn];
ll dp[maxn][3];
int n;
ll dpF(int i, int last) {
  if (i == n)
    return 0LL;
  if (dp[i][last] != -1)
    return dp[i][last];
  return dp[i][last] = max({last != 1 ? arr1[i] + dpF(i + 1, 1) : 0LL, last != 2 ? arr2[i] + dpF(i + 1, 2) : 0LL, dpF(i + 1, last)});
}
void solve() {
  memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
  cin >> n;
  f0r(i, n) cin >> arr1[i];
  f0r(i, n) cin >> arr2[i];
  cout << dpF(0, 0) << "\n";
}
int main() {
  int t;
  t = 1;
  f0r(i, t) { solve(); }
  return 0;
}
```

These changes will make the program a little more efficient by saving some memory and making it slightly faster to compile. However, they won't have a significant impact on the runtime of the program as it is already quite efficient.
