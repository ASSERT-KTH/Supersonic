The given program can be optimized in several ways:

1. Remove the unnecessary includes and macros: The given program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which includes most of the standard libraries and slows down the compile time. We can replace it with the libraries that we are using in the program. Similarly, there are macros defined in the program which are not used at all. So, we can remove those too.

2. Minimize the use of global variables: Global variables can increase the memory usage of the program, and they can also make debugging and testing harder. In the given program, `arr1`, `arr2`, `dp`, and `n` are global variables. We can pass these as parameters to the function where these are being used.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This can lead to name conflicts and it's generally a bad practice to use it.

4. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The memory allocation to `dp` is more than required. Only `n` memory is required, but `maxn` memory is allocated to it.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;
using std::max;
typedef long long ll;

ll dpF(int i, int last, int n, vector<ll>& arr1, vector<ll>& arr2, vector<vector<ll> >& dp) {
  if (i == n)
    return 0LL;
  if (dp[i][last] != -1)
    return dp[i][last];
  ll op1 = 0LL, op2 = 0LL, op3 = 0LL;
  if (last != 1)
    op1 = arr1[i] + dpF(i + 1, 1, n, arr1, arr2, dp);
  if (last != 2)
    op2 = arr2[i] + dpF(i + 1, 2, n, arr1, arr2, dp);
  op3 = dpF(i + 1, last, n, arr1, arr2, dp);
  return dp[i][last] = max({op1, op2, op3});
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> arr1(n), arr2(n);
  vector<vector<ll> > dp(n, vector<ll>(3, -1));
  for(int i=0; i<n; i++) 
    cin >> arr1[i];
  for(int i=0; i<n; i++) 
    cin >> arr2[i];
  cout << dpF(0, 0, n, arr1, arr2, dp) << "\n";
}

int main() {
  int t;
  t = 1;
  for(int i=0; i<t; i++) { 
    solve(); 
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program will have decreased compile time, reduced memory usage, and improved readability.
