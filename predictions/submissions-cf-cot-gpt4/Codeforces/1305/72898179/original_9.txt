The given C/C++ program computes the minimum total difference between elements of an array and multiples of numbers that are divisors of the numbers near the array elements. The program utilizes the Sieve of Eratosthenes to compute primes for factorization.

Here are some potential areas of optimization:

1. Using `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout` for faster input and output operations.
2. Avoiding the use of `#define` for loops. This might enhance readability but it actually hinders compiler optimizations such as unrolling.
3. Reducing the use of global variables. This makes the program more maintainable and reduces the chance of name clashes.
4. Avoiding the use of `std::map` where a simple array or vector would suffice.
5. Avoiding the use of `std::map::iterator` to loop over the map. A range-based for loop is simpler and cleaner.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int M = 1e6 + 105, N = 2e5 + 5;
bool bz[M];
int p[M], p0;
long long a[N];
vector<long long> divisors;

void sieve(int n) {
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        if (!bz[i])
            p[++p0] = i;
        for (int j = 1; i * p[j] <= n; j++) {
            bz[i * p[j]] = true;
            if (i % p[j] == 0)
                break;
        }
    }
}

void getDivisors(long long n) {
    divisors.clear();
    for (int i = 1; i <= p0 && (long long)p[i] * p[i] <= n; i++)
        if (n % p[i] == 0) {
            divisors.push_back(p[i]);
            while (n % p[i] == 0)
                n /= p[i];
        }
    if (n > 1)
        divisors.push_back(n);
}

long long check(long long x, int n) {
    long long s = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (a[i] >= x) {
            long long y = a[i] % x;
            s += min(y, x - y);
        } else
            s += x - a[i];
    }
    return s;
}

int main() {
    srand(time(0) + clock());
    sieve(1e6);
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) scanf("%lld", &a[i]);
    random_shuffle(a + 1, a + n + 1);
    unordered_map<long long, int> w;
    for (int i = 1; i <= min(n, 1000); i++) {
        for (int j = -1; j <= 1; j++) {
            long long x = a[i] + j;
            if (x > 1) {
                getDivisors(x);
                for (long long d : divisors) w[d] = 1;
            }
        }
    }
    long long ans = n;
    for (auto& kv : w)
        ans = min(ans, check(kv.first, n));
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
}
```
This optimized version removes unnecessary macros and global variables, replaces `std::map` with `unordered_map` to reduce memory usage and potential CPU cache misses, and utilizes range-based for loops for simplicity and cleaner code. 

Remember that the `unordered_map` has an average time complexity of O(1) for search, insertion and deletion, while `map` has a time complexity of O(log(n)) for these operations. The time complexity of `unordered_map` can become O(n) in the worst case of a hash collision, but this is unlikely to occur in this program because the hashing function is well-distributed.
