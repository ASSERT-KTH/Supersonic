This C/C++ program is an implementation of Sieve of Eratosthenes for finding all prime numbers smaller than a given number. It also calculates some aggregates for randomly shuffled elements of the array a. The program can be optimized in several ways:

1. Reduce the number of global variables: The program uses a lot of global variables that can be moved inside functions to save memory. 

2. Optimize Sieve function: This function can be optimized by checking and marking only the odd numbers as prime, since even numbers (greater than 2) cannot be prime. This will reduce the running time of the function.

3. Use vector instead of map: Maps in C++ are usually slower than vectors. If the keys are not required to be sorted, you can use an unordered_map that has an average time complexity of O(1) for search, insert, and delete operations.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations and checks: For instance, the check function calculates the same values multiple times and this can be avoided with the help of temporary variables.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define fo(i, x, y) for (int i = x, _b = y; i <= _b; i++)
#define ff(i, x, y) for (int i = x, _b = y; i < _b; i++)
#define fd(i, x, y) for (int i = x, _b = y; i >= _b; i--)
#define ll long long
#define pp printf
#define hh pp("\n")
using namespace std;
const int M = 1e6 + 105;
const int N = 2e5 + 5;

void sieve(int n, int* bz, int* p, int& p0) {
  for (int i = 3; i*i <= n; i += 2) {
    if (bz[i] == 0) {
      p[++p0] = i;
      for (int j = i*i; j <= n; j += i)
        bz[j] = 1;
    }
  }
  if (n > 2)
    p[++p0] = 2;
}

void fen(ll n, const int* p, const int p0, ll* u, int& u0) {
  u0 = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= p0 && (ll)p[i] * p[i] <= n; i++)
    if (n % p[i] == 0) {
      u[++u0] = p[i];
      while (n % p[i] == 0)
        n /= p[i];
    }
  if (n > 1)
    u[++u0] = n;
}

void check(ll x, const ll* a, const int n, ll& ans) {
  ll s = 0;
  fo(i, 1, n) {
    if (a[i] >= x) {
      ll y = a[i] % x;
      s += min(y, x - y);
    } else
      s += x - a[i];
    if (s > ans)
      return;
  }
  ans = s;
}

int main() {
  srand(time(0) + clock());
  int bz[M] = {0}, p[M] = {0}, p0 = 0;
  sieve(1e6, bz, p, p0);
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  ll a[N];
  fo(i, 1, n) scanf("%lld", &a[i]);
  random_shuffle(a + 1, a + n + 1);
  unordered_map<ll, int> w;
  ll u[1000];
  int u0;
  fo(i, 1, min(n, 1000)) {
    fo(j, -1, 1) {
      ll x = a[i] + j;
      if (x > 1) {
        fen(x, p, p0, u, u0);
        fo(k, 1, u0) w[u[k]] = 1;
      }
    }
  }
  ll ans = n;
  for (auto& it : w)
    check(it.first, a, n, ans);
  pp("%lld\n", ans);
}
```

This optimized version of the program uses less memory by moving global variables inside functions and replacing the map with an unordered_map for faster access. The Sieve function is also optimized to check only odd numbers as possible primes. The check function is also optimized to avoid calculating the same values multiple times.
