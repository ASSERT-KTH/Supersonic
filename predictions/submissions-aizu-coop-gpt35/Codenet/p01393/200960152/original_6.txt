The provided code is a C++ program that calculates the maximum sum of arc lengths of k non-overlapping arcs from a set of n arcs. Each arc is defined by its start and end angles in radians.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Redundant Trigonometric calculations:
   - The code calculates the `acos` and `sqrt` functions for each arc, which can be computationally expensive. These calculations can be moved outside the loop and stored in variables for reuse.

2. Sorting and removing overlapping arcs:
   - The code sorts the arcs based on their start angles and end angles using the `comp` function. However, the subsequent loop removes overlapping arcs, which can be avoided by modifying the sorting function to include the removal of overlapping arcs.

3. Loop optimization:
   - The nested loop used to calculate `max_l` and `max_r` values can be optimized. Currently, it iterates over all elements in the vector `v` for each element, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2). This can be optimized to O(n) by using a single pass algorithm.

4. Memory optimization:
   - The code creates two vectors, `dp1` and `dp2`, of size `(m + 1) * (k + 1)`. However, only two rows of `dp1` and `dp2` are used at any given time. This can be optimized to use only two vectors of size `(2 * (k + 1))` to reduce memory usage.

5. Compiler optimizations:
   - The code can benefit from compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling and vectorization. The `-O3` optimization flag can be used during compilation to enable these optimizations.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and implementation of these optimizations.
