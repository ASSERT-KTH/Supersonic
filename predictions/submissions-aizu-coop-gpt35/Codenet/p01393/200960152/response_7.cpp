The given code appears to be a solution to a problem involving circles on a 2D plane. The program reads the coordinates and radii of the circles, calculates the intersection points of each circle with the upper half-plane, and then computes the maximum sum of angles among k circles. Finally, it outputs the result divided by PI.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code performs several calculations that could be avoided or simplified. For example, it calculates the start and end angles for each circle but only uses them to check if a circle is entirely in the upper half-plane. We can skip these calculations and directly check if the start angle is less than EPS and the end angle is greater than PI - EPS.

2. Improve data structures: The code uses an array of pairs to store the start and end angles of each circle. Instead, we can use a struct or class to encapsulate this information and make the code more readable. Additionally, the code uses dynamic vectors for storing the angles and performs multiple insertions and deletions. We can use a fixed-size array or pre-allocate memory to avoid dynamic memory allocation and improve performance.

3. Optimize loops and iterations: The code uses nested loops to compare each pair of angles and remove overlapping intervals. This can be optimized by using a single loop and keeping track of the current maximum right interval.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations or pragma directives to the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. For example, we can use compiler flags like -O3 to enable aggressive optimizations.
