The given code calculates the maximum angle that can be covered by light beams emitted from k lighthouses, given n obstacles. The code uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the maximum angle for each obstacle and each number of lighthouses used.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be made:

1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes all standard library headers, which can slow down compilation and increase memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The typedefs `D`, `pdd`, and `vd` are not used effectively in the code. It is better to remove them to improve code readability.

3. Optimize the modify() function: The modify() function is used to ensure that the angle seta is within the range [-PI, PI]. However, it can be optimized by using the fmod() function instead of if statements.

4. Optimize the in_upper() function: The in_upper() function checks if the angle seta is in the upper half of the unit circle. This can be optimized by using a single comparison instead of two.

5. Optimize the comp() function: The comp() function compares two pdd values based on their first and second components. This can be optimized by using a single comparison instead of two.

6. Use reserve() for vector v: The vector v is used to store the temporary pdd values. It can be optimized by using the reserve() function to allocate memory in advance.

7. Optimize the loop that removes overlapping angles: The loop that removes overlapping angles can be optimized by using the erase-remove idiom instead of manually iterating and erasing elements.

8. Optimize the max_l[] and max_r[] calculations: The calculations of max_l[] and max_r[] can be optimized by using a single iteration instead of two nested iterations.

9. Optimize the dp1 and dp2 vectors: The dp1 and dp2 vectors can be optimized by using a single vector instead of two separate vectors.

10. Optimize the calculation of the final answer: The calculation of the final answer can be optimized by using a single loop instead of calling max() multiple times.

Taking these optimizations into consideration, the optimized code is as follows:
