The provided code calculates the maximum sum of arc lengths of k non-overlapping arcs from a set of given arcs. The arcs are represented by their start and end angles. The code uses dynamic programming to solve this problem.

Upon analysis of the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Avoid using the "bits/stdc++.h" header: This header includes all standard library headers, which can increase compilation time and may not be necessary for this specific code. It is better to include only the necessary headers explicitly.

2. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes the `<vector>` and `<complex>` headers but does not use any features from them. These unnecessary includes can be removed.

3. Use `const` for constant variables: The code defines `EPS` and `PI` as constant variables but does not use the `const` keyword. It is better to declare them as `const` to improve readability and allow better compiler optimization.

4. Optimize the sorting of arcs: The code sorts the arcs based on their start angles using the `sort` function. However, the comparison function used for sorting performs a floating-point comparison, which can be slow. Instead, we can use an integer representation of angles (e.g., multiply by a constant factor) to avoid floating-point comparisons.

5. Use a more efficient data structure for storing arcs: The code uses a vector of pairs to store the arcs. However, this data structure requires dynamic memory allocation and can be inefficient for large inputs. Instead, we can use a fixed-size array or a statically allocated array for storing the arcs.

6. Improve the loop for removing overlapping arcs: The code uses a nested loop to check for overlapping arcs and remove them. This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2). We can optimize this by using a single loop and maintaining a separate index for the last non-overlapping arc.

7. Optimize the dynamic programming loop: The code uses two nested loops to calculate the maximum arc length for each subproblem. This can be optimized by using a single loop and storing the maximum values in a 2D array.

8. Use compiler optimizations: We can use compiler-specific optimizations and pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. For example, we can use the `-O2` optimization flag to enable level 2 optimization in GCC.
