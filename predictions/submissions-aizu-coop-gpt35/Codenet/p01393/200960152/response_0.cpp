The provided code calculates the maximum sum of angles from a set of circular arcs, subject to a given constraint. The code uses dynamic programming to compute the maximum sum efficiently. However, there are several areas for optimization:

1. Redundant calculations: The code calculates the start and end angles for each circular arc in the input, even if they are not used later. These calculations can be skipped to improve performance.

2. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a vector (`v`) to store the start and end angles of the circular arcs. However, the search operations (`upper_bound`) on this vector are inefficient, as they have a time complexity of O(log n). We can use a sorted array instead, which allows for faster search operations with a time complexity of O(1) or O(log n) in the worst case.

3. Unoptimized loops: The nested loops that iterate over `v` to remove overlapping arcs and calculate `max_l` and `max_r` can be optimized to reduce unnecessary iterations and improve performance.

4. Compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations and pragmas can be used to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
