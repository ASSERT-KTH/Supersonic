Code Analysis:

1. The code reads input values for `n` and `k`, where `n` represents the number of circles and `k` represents the maximum number of circles that can be selected.
2. It then reads `n` sets of `(x, y, r)` values, representing the center coordinates `(x, y)` and the radius `r` of each circle.
3. For each circle, it calculates the start and end angles of the arc formed by the circle's intersection with the upper half of the plane.
4. It stores the start and end angles in a vector `v`.
5. The vector `v` is sorted in ascending order based on the start angles.
6. The code then removes any arcs that are completely covered by other arcs.
7. The maximum number of arcs that can be selected for each arc is calculated using dynamic programming.
8. The maximum value of the selected arcs is divided by `PI` and printed as the output.

Potential optimizations:

1. Use a custom data structure to represent circles instead of using a vector of pairs. This will allow for more efficient memory usage and faster access to circle properties.
2. Optimize the sorting algorithm used to sort the arcs in vector `v`. The current implementation uses the `sort` function, which has a time complexity of O(nlogn). A more efficient sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort, can be used to reduce the sorting time.
3. Improve the efficiency of the loop that removes completely covered arcs. The current implementation uses a nested loop to compare each pair of arcs. This can be optimized to reduce the time complexity of the loop.
4. Optimize the dynamic programming loop that calculates the maximum value of the selected arcs. This can be done by reducing the number of unnecessary computations and using a more efficient data structure to store the dynamic programming values.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the vector of pairs `p` with a custom Circle structure that stores the center coordinates and radius of each circle.
2. Replace the sorting algorithm used to sort the arcs in vector `v` with a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort.
3. Optimize the loop that removes completely covered arcs by using two pointers technique.
4. Optimize the dynamic programming loop that calculates the maximum value of the selected arcs by reducing unnecessary computations and using a more efficient data structure to store the dynamic programming values.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the vector of pairs `p` with a custom Circle structure that stores the center coordinates and radius of each circle.
   - This optimization step improves memory usage by reducing the number of elements stored in the vector `p`.
   - Declare a struct `Circle` with members for the center coordinates and radius.
   - Replace the vector of pairs `p` with a vector of `Circle` objects.
   - Update the code to read input values into the `Circle` objects.

2. Replace the sorting algorithm used to sort the arcs in vector `v` with a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort.
   - The current implementation uses the `sort` function, which has a time complexity of O(nlogn).
   - Replace the `sort` function with a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort.
   - This optimization step reduces the sorting time and improves the overall running time of the program.

3. Optimize the loop that removes completely covered arcs by using two pointers technique.
   - The current implementation uses a nested loop to compare each pair of arcs, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2).
   - Optimize the loop using the two pointers technique to reduce the time complexity to O(n).
   - Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to 0.
   - While `j` is less than the size of the vector `v`, do the following:
     - If `v[j].fs - EPS < v[i].fs && v[i].sc < v[j].sc + EPS`, remove the arc at index `i` from the vector `v`.
     - Otherwise, increment `j`.
   - This optimization step reduces the time complexity of the loop and improves the overall running time of the program.

4. Optimize the dynamic programming loop that calculates the maximum value of the selected arcs by reducing unnecessary computations and using a more efficient data structure to store the dynamic programming values.
   - The current implementation uses a 2D vector `dp1` to store the dynamic programming values.
   - Replace the 2D vector `dp1` with a 1D vector `dp` to store the dynamic programming values.
   - Initialize the vector `dp` with zeros.
   - Optimize the loop using the following steps:
     - Initialize a variable `use` to store the maximum value of the previous row of the dynamic programming table.
     - For each arc `v[i]`, do the following:
       - Update `dp[max_l[i]][j + 1]` with the maximum value of `dp[max_l[i]][j + 1]` and `use + v[i].sc - v[i].fs`.
       - If `max_r[i]` is not equal to `i`, update `dp[max_r[i]][j + 1]` with the maximum value of `dp[max_r[i]][j + 1]` and `use + v[max_r[i]].fs - v[i].fs`.
       - Update `use` with the maximum value of `dp[i][j]` and `dp2[i][j]`.
   - This optimization step reduces the memory usage and running time of the program.
