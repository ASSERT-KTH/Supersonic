Code Analysis:
Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usages are identified:

1. Data Structures: The code uses an array of pairs (`p`) and a vector of pairs (`v`) to store the input data. However, the vector `v` is not used efficiently and involves unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations.

2. Sorting: The code uses the `sort` function to sort the vector `v` based on a custom comparison function `comp`. This sorting operation can be optimized by using a more efficient sorting algorithm or by avoiding the sorting operation altogether.

3. Redundant Computations: The code performs several redundant computations, such as calculating the difference between two angles multiple times and calculating the upper bound of the vector `v` repeatedly in the inner loop.

4. Memory Usage: The code uses a 2D vector (`dp1`) to store dynamic programming values. However, the vector is allocated with default-initialized values, which is unnecessary and wastes memory.

5. Loop Optimization: The nested loops in the code can potentially be optimized by reducing loop iterations or by using loop unrolling techniques.

Optimization Strategy:
Based on the identified bottlenecks and inefficiencies, the following optimization strategy is proposed:

1. Efficient Data Structures: Replace the array of pairs (`p`) with a vector of pairs (`v`) to store the input data. This eliminates the need for unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations.

2. Sorting Optimization: Avoid the sorting operation by modifying the algorithm to avoid the need for sorted data. This can be achieved by using a different approach to solve the problem.

3. Redundant Computations: Optimize the code by eliminating redundant computations. This includes calculating the difference between two angles only once and avoiding repeated calculations of the upper bound in the inner loop.

4. Memory Usage Optimization: Optimize the memory usage by allocating the `dp1` vector with uninitialized values instead of default-initialized values. This saves memory and avoids unnecessary initialization overhead.

5. Loop Optimization: Optimize the nested loops by reducing loop iterations where possible and considering loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Efficient Data Structures:
   - Replace the array of pairs (`p`) with a vector of pairs (`v`) to store the input data.
   - Remove the unnecessary array (`p`) and its associated code.

2. Sorting Optimization:
   - Instead of sorting the vector `v`, find an alternative approach to solve the problem that does not require sorted data.
   - Since the sorting operation is removed, the `comp` comparison function and the `sort` function can be eliminated.

3. Redundant Computations:
   - Calculate the difference between two angles (`ds`) only once and reuse the value where needed.
   - Calculate the upper bound (`dummy`) of the vector `v` outside the inner loop and reuse the value in the loop.

4. Memory Usage Optimization:
   - Modify the initialization of the `dp1` vector to allocate it with uninitialized values. This can be achieved by using the `vector::resize` function with the desired size and passing an empty `vd` as the second argument.

5. Loop Optimization:
   - Consider loop unrolling techniques to optimize the nested loops if deemed necessary.
