The given code appears to be solving a geometric problem involving circles. The main goal of the code is to find the maximum sum of arc lengths of k non-overlapping circles. The circles are represented by their center coordinates (x, y) and radius r.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Sorting and Removing Overlapping Arcs: The code uses the `sort` function to sort the arcs based on their starting points, and then iterates over the arcs to remove any overlapping arcs. This can be a time-consuming operation, especially for large inputs.

2. Dynamic Programming: The code uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the maximum sum of arc lengths. However, the code uses two separate 2D vectors (`dp1` and `dp2`) to store the dynamic programming values, which can be memory inefficient.

3. Redundant Calculations: The code performs some redundant calculations, such as repeatedly calculating the upper bound of an element in the sorted arcs vector.

4. Unnecessary Complexities: The code includes unnecessary complex data types and typedefs, such as `complex<D>` and `pdd`, which can make the code harder to read and understand.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the sorting and removing overlapping arcs algorithm with a more efficient approach.

2. Simplify the data structures to reduce memory usage and improve code readability.

3. Eliminate redundant calculations and simplify the code where possible.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization and provide the optimized code.
