The given code calculates the diameter of a polygon using the gift wrapping algorithm. The algorithm finds the convex hull of the polygon and then calculates the maximum distance between any two points on the convex hull.

Here are some potential optimizations that can be made to improve the performance and memory usage of the code:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of unnecessary header files. We should include only the necessary header files, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, etc.

2. Remove unused typedefs: The typedefs `typedef Point Vector;` and `typedef Segment Line;` are not used in the code. We can remove these typedefs to improve code readability.

3. Use `const` for constant variables: The constants `COUNTER_CLOCKWISE`, `CLOCKWISE`, `ONLINE_BACK`, `ONLINE_FRONT`, and `ON_SEGMENT` can be declared as `const int` instead of `static const int`. This ensures that these values are not modified and allows the compiler to optimize their usage.

4. Use `constexpr` for constant expressions: The constants `EPS` and `PI` can be declared as `constexpr` instead of using `#define`. This allows the compiler to evaluate the expressions at compile-time and potentially optimize the code.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The `norm()` and `abs()` functions are called multiple times in the code. We can calculate and store the results of these functions in local variables to avoid redundant calculations.

6. Optimize loops: The `andrewScan()` function uses a loop that can be optimized. The condition `for (int n = u.size(); n >= 2 && ccw(u[n - 2], u[n - 1], s[i]) != CLOCKWISE; n--)` can be simplified to `for (; u.size() >= 2 && ccw(u[u.size() - 2], u[u.size() - 1], s[i]) != CLOCKWISE;)`. This eliminates the need to create the
