Upon analyzing the given code, here are some potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant calculations: The code performs some calculations multiple times. For example, the `abs` function is called multiple times for the same vector or point. We can store the result in a variable and reuse it instead of recalculating it.

2. Unnecessary function calls: Some functions are not used in the code, such as `isOrthogonal` and `isParallel` for segments. We can remove these unused functions to improve readability.

3. Data structure inefficiencies: The code uses a `vector` to represent a polygon. However, a `deque` might be more efficient for this purpose, as it allows for efficient insertion and deletion at both ends.

4. Sorting the polygon: The code sorts the polygon using the `sort` function. However, since the polygon is already given in counterclockwise order, there is no need to sort it. We can remove the sorting step to improve performance.

5. Input/Output: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output. However, these functions are generally slower than other input/output methods, such as `scanf` and `printf`. We can replace the input/output operations with their faster counterparts.

Based on these observations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <algorithm>
#include <deque>

#define EPS (1e-10)
#define equals(a, b) (fabs((a) - (b)) < EPS)
#define PI 3.141592653589793238
#define int long long
