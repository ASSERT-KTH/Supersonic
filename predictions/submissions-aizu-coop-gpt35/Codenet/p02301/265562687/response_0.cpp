Code Analysis:

1. The code includes a lot of unnecessary includes that are not used in the program. These should be removed to improve compile time.
2. The `int` data type is used for all variables, even when a smaller data type can be used. This can result in unnecessary memory usage.
3. The `equals` function is defined in terms of a small value `EPS`. This can result in a loss of precision and may not work as expected in some cases.
4. The `Point` struct has several member functions that are not used in the program. These can be removed to reduce code complexity.
5. The `isOrthogonal` and `isParallel` functions have unnecessary overloads that take `Point` arguments instead of `Vector` arguments. These overloads should be removed to avoid confusion.
6. The `getDistanceLP`, `getDistanceSP`, and `getDistance` functions calculate the distance between lines and segments using complex formulas. These calculations can be simplified to improve efficiency.
7. The `ccw` function is used to determine the orientation of three points. This function can be optimized to reduce redundant calculations.
8. The `contains` function checks if a point is inside a polygon. This function can be simplified and optimized to improve efficiency.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line and any other includes that are not used in the code.

2. Use appropriate data types: Replace the `int` data type with a smaller data type, such as `int32_t` or `int64_t`, where appropriate.

3. Improve precision comparison: Instead of using `EPS` to compare floating-point numbers, use a more precise method, such as `std::numeric_limits<double>::epsilon()`.

4. Remove unnecessary member functions: Remove the `norm`, `abs`, `operator<`, and `operator==` member functions from the `Point` struct, as they are not used in the code.
