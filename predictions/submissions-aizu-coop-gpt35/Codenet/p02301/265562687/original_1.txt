The given code represents a C++ program that calculates the diameter of a polygon. The program takes as input the number of vertices of the polygon and the coordinates of each vertex. The program then calculates the diameter of the polygon using the convex hull algorithm.

Upon analyzing the code, a few potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant calculations: Some calculations, such as the norm and absolute value of vectors, are performed multiple times. These calculations can be optimized by storing the results in variables and reusing them where necessary.

2. Unnecessary data structures: The code uses a few unnecessary data structures, such as the `Polygon` type, which is simply an alias for a vector of `Point` objects. Using a vector directly instead of the `Polygon` type can simplify the code and potentially improve performance.

3. Inefficient sorting: The code sorts the vertices of the polygon using the `sort` function. However, the sorting can be optimized by sorting the vertices directly instead of using the `Polygon` type.

4. Redundant functions: Some functions, such as `isOrthogonal` and `isParallel`, are already provided by the C++ standard library. Using these functions instead of the custom implementations can improve code readability and potentially improve performance.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be proposed:

1. Remove unnecessary data structures: Remove the `Polygon` type and replace it with a vector of `Point` objects.

2. Optimize redundant calculations: Store the results of redundant calculations, such as the norm and absolute value of vectors, in variables and reuse them where necessary.

3. Optimize sorting: Sort the vertices of the polygon directly instead of using the `Polygon` type.

4. Replace custom functions: Replace the custom implementations of `isOrthogonal` and `isParallel` with the corresponding functions provided by the C++ standard library.

5. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header file and include only the necessary standard library headers.

Now, let's proceed with the optimized
