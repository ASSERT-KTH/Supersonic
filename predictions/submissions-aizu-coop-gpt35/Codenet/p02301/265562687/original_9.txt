The given code calculates the diameter of a polygon using the rotating calipers algorithm. However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized for better performance and memory usage.

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can lead to longer compilation times and unnecessary memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code calculates the absolute value of a number multiple times, which can be avoided by storing the absolute value in a variable.

3. Optimize loops: The code uses a loop to calculate the convex hull of the polygon, but it can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm like Graham's scan or Jarvis march.

4. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The code calls the `cross` and `dot` functions multiple times, which can be avoided by storing the results in variables and reusing them.

5. Use more efficient data structures: The code uses a vector to store the polygon points, but a deque or a linked list might be more efficient for inserting and deleting elements.

6. Use compiler optimizations: Use compiler optimizations like loop unrolling and inline functions to improve performance.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

#define EPS (1e-10)
#define equals(a, b) (fabs((a) - (b)) < EPS)
#define PI 3.141592653589793238

struct Point {
    double x, y;
    Point() {}
    Point(double x, double y) : x(x), y(y) {}
};

double dist(Point a, Point b) {
    double dx = a.x - b.x;
    double dy = a.y - b.y;
    return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
}

double cross(Point a, Point b, Point c) {
    return (b.x - a.x) * (c.y - a.y) - (b.y
