Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant calculations: There are several functions that perform redundant calculations, such as `norm()` and `abs()` for `Vector` and `Point` objects. These calculations can be avoided by storing the results in variables and reusing them where necessary.

2. Excessive use of `double` data type: The code uses `double` data type for calculations involving coordinates and distances. However, using `double` for all calculations can be computationally expensive. Consider using integer arithmetic or fixed-point representation for calculations that don't require high precision.

3. Inefficient sorting: The `convex_hull()` function uses the `sort()` function to sort the points. However, the sorting operation can be optimized by using a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort.

4. Unnecessary memory usage: The code uses vectors to store points, segments, and polygons. However, in some cases, using arrays or simple data structures instead of vectors can reduce memory usage and improve performance.

5. Inefficient loop structure: The `andrewScan()` function uses a nested loop structure to iterate over the points. This can be optimized by using a single loop or by using iterators instead of indices.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace redundant calculations: Replace the redundant calculations in the `norm()`, `abs()`, and other similar functions with variables to store the results and reuse them where necessary.

2. Use integer arithmetic and fixed-point representation: Identify the calculations that don't require high precision and replace the `double` data type with integer arithmetic or fixed-point representation.

3. Optimize sorting: Replace the `sort()` function used in the `convex_hull()` function with a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort.

4. Reduce memory usage: Replace vectors with arrays or simple data structures in cases where vectors are not necessary.
