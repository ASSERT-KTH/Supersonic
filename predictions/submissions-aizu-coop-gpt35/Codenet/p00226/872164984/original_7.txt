The provided code is a compressed version of a program that reads input from the standard input and counts the number of occurrences of each character. The program then prints the count of each character and the difference between the highest and lowest counts.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several areas that could be optimized:

1. The code uses an array `R` of size 99 to store the count of each character. However, the ASCII range is 0-127, so the array should be of size 128 to accommodate all possible characters. 

2. The use of the ternary operator `b += !!R[c]` and `h += !(R[c] ^= 1 << i % 5)` to update the counts of each character is unnecessary and can be simplified.

3. The use of the `memset` function in each iteration of the loop is redundant and wasteful in terms of performance. It can be moved outside the loop to initialize the array `R` only once.

4. The use of the `printf` function inside the loop is also inefficient. It can be moved outside the loop to print the final results after all characters have been processed.

5. The code lacks comments, making it difficult to understand the purpose of each line. Adding comments will improve code readability.

Based on these observations, we can now proceed with optimizing the code.
