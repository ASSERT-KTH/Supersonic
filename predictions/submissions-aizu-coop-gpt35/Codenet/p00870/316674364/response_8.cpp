The given code appears to be solving a string matching problem. It reads a list of patterns and a text, and then counts the number of occurrences of the patterns in the text. However, the code is not optimized and can be improved in terms of performance and memory usage. Let's analyze the code further and propose optimization strategies.

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The code uses a vector `ha` to store the hash values of the patterns. Storing the hash values of the patterns in a vector requires additional memory and can be avoided. Instead, we can compute the hash value of each pattern on the fly during the matching process, which will save memory.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The code computes the hash values of the patterns during each iteration of the main loop. This is unnecessary as the hash values of the patterns do not change during the execution of the loop. We can precompute the hash values before entering the loop.

3. Optimization Strategy:
   1. Remove the unnecessary vector `ha` and compute the hash values of the patterns on the fly.
   2. Precompute the hash values of the patterns before entering the main loop.
   3. Use a more efficient data structure to store the hash values of the text.
   4. Avoid redundant computations by moving the computation of the hash value of the current substring outside the inner loop.
   5. Use bitwise operations instead of pow function for computing powers of 31.
   6. Use a bitmask to track the matched patterns instead of a separate vector `vis`.
   7. Use a rolling hash to efficiently compute the hash values of the substrings.
