Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant includes: The code includes several unnecessary headers (e.g., `<algorithm>`, `<cassert>`, etc.) that are not used in the program. Removing these unnecessary includes can improve compilation time.

2. Unoptimized string concatenation: The code uses the `+=` operator to concatenate strings, which can be inefficient for large strings. Using `std::stringstream` for string concatenation can be more efficient.

3. Inefficient data structures: The code uses arrays to store the hash values (`ha[]` and `gha[]`) and the lengths of strings (`len[]`). Using `std::vector` instead of arrays can provide more flexibility and efficient memory usage.

4. Unoptimized loops: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the strings and characters. Optimizing these loops by minimizing unnecessary iterations or using more efficient loop constructs can improve performance.

5. Unnecessary calculations: The code performs unnecessary calculations for hash values and lengths of strings. These calculations can be optimized by storing the hash values and lengths in variables instead of recalculating them multiple times.

6. Unnecessary memory allocation: The code unnecessarily allocates memory for the `vis[][]` array. This array can be replaced with a boolean variable to reduce memory usage.

7. Code duplication: The code has some duplicated code blocks that can be consolidated to improve readability and maintainability.

Based on the analysis, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove unnecessary includes.
2. Replace string concatenation with `std::stringstream`.
3. Replace arrays with `std::vector` for hash values and string lengths.
4. Optimize loops by minimizing unnecessary iterations and using more efficient constructs.
5. Store hash values and string lengths in variables to avoid unnecessary calculations.
6. Replace the `vis[][]` array with a boolean variable.
7. Consolidate duplicated code blocks.
