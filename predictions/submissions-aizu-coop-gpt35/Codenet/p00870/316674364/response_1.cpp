The given code appears to be solving a string matching problem. It reads a set of patterns and a text, and then counts how many times the patterns appear in the text. The code uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.

Upon initial analysis, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary Memory Usage: The code defines multiple arrays and data structures that are not used effectively. For example, the `vis` array is defined twice, and the `gha` array could be optimized to use less memory.

2. Redundant Computations: The code performs redundant calculations of hash values for patterns and substrings. These calculations can be optimized to reduce the number of hash computations and improve efficiency.

3. Loop Optimization: The code uses nested loops to iterate over patterns and substrings. This can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The code does not include any compiler optimizations or pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize specific parts of the code. Adding appropriate compiler directives can help improve performance.
