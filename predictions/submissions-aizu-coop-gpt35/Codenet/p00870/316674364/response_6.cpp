Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential optimizations:

1. Use more efficient data structures: The code currently uses arrays extensively, which can be replaced with more efficient data structures like `std::vector` and `std::string` where appropriate. This will help in reducing memory usage and improving performance.

2. Avoid unnecessary computations: There are several places in the code where unnecessary computations are performed. For example, the `shift` function and its variations are not used anywhere in the code. Removing such unused computations will improve the efficiency of the code.

3. Optimize loops and recursive calls: There are loops and recursive calls in the code that can be optimized to improve performance. For example, the nested loop in the `solve` function can be optimized using memoization to avoid repeated computations.

4. Utilize compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, and compiler hints can be used to improve the performance of the code. Using appropriate pragmas and compiler flags can help the compiler optimize the code more effectively.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Use more efficient data structures:
   - Replace arrays `ha` and `len` with `std::vector<ll>` and `std::vector<int>` respectively.
   - Replace array `vis` with a 2D `std::vector<bool>`.
   - Replace array `gha` with a `std::string`.
   - Remove unnecessary includes (`<map>`, `<queue>`, `<stack>`, `<set>`, `<numeric>`).

2. Avoid unnecessary computations:
   - Remove unused functions: `shift`, `rgt`, `lft`, `frt`, `bck`.
   - Remove unused variables: `dx`, `dy`, `dxdy2ce`, `declare`, `FOR`, `FORR`.

3. Optimize loops and recursive calls:
   - Memoize the nested loop in the `solve` function to avoid repeated computations. Use a 2D `std::vector<bool>` instead of the `vis` array to store the memoization table.

4. Utilize compiler optimizations:
   - Add appropriate pragmas and compiler flags to hint the compiler to optimize the code.
