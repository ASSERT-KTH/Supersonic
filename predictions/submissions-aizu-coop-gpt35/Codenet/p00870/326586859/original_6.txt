The given code is a C++ program that solves a problem by reading input from the standard input and printing the output to the standard output. The program takes as input two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` strings and `m` strings. It concatenates the `n` strings and checks how many times the concatenated string appears as a substring in the concatenated `m` strings. The program then prints the number of occurrences.

To optimize this program, we can start by analyzing the code and identifying potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage. 

1. Code Analysis:
- The program uses a vector of strings `e` to store the `n` input strings. This vector is used to compute the `sum_len` vector, which stores the cumulative length of selected strings using bitwise operations. However, the `sum_len` vector is not used efficiently, as it recomputes the string lengths in each iteration of the outer loop. This can be optimized to avoid redundant computations.
- The program uses a 2D boolean array `p` to store intermediate results. The size of this array is fixed at 5000 rows and `(1 << 12)` columns, which is excessive and wastes memory. We can optimize this by dynamically allocating memory based on the input size.
- The program uses a vector of vectors `heads` to store the indices of the selected strings for each position in the concatenated `m` strings. However, this vector is not used efficiently, as it stores the indices of all selected strings at each position. We can optimize this to store only the indices of the selected strings at each position.

2. Optimization Strategy:
Based on the code analysis, we can propose the following optimization steps:
- Optimize the computation of `sum_len` by avoiding redundant string length computations.
- Optimize the memory usage of the `p` array by dynamically allocating memory based on the input size.
- Optimize the `heads` vector by storing only the indices of the selected strings at each position.
- Consider using compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:

Step 1: Optimize the computation of `sum_len`
- In the current code, the `sum_len` vector is computed using nested loops. The outer loop iterates over all possible subsets of strings, and the inner loop iterates over each string in the subset. The string length is computed for each string in each iteration of the inner loop, resulting in redundant computations.
- We can optimize this by computing the string lengths only once and storing them in a separate vector. We can also use bitwise operations to efficiently iterate over all possible subsets of strings.
- Here's the modified code for computing `sum_len`:

```cpp
vector<int> sum_len(1 << n);
vector<int> string_lengths(n);
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
  string_lengths[i] = e[i].size();
}
for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); ++i) {
  sum_len[i] = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
    if ((i & (1 << j)) != 0) {
      sum_len[i] += string_lengths[j];
    }
  }
}
```

Step 2: Optimize the memory usage of the `p` array
- In the current code, the `p` array is statically allocated with a fixed size of 5000 rows and `(1 << 12)` columns. This wastes memory when the input size is smaller.
- We can optimize this by dynamically allocating memory for the `p` array based on the input size. We can use a `vector` of `vector` of `bool` to achieve this.
- Here's the modified code for allocating `p` dynamically:

```cpp
int max_ts_size = concatenated_len;
vector<vector<bool>> p(max_ts_size, vector<bool>(1 << n, false));
```

Step 3: Optimize the `heads` vector
- In the current code, the `heads` vector stores the indices of all selected strings at each position in the concatenated `m` strings. This is unnecessary and wastes memory.
- We can optimize this by storing only the indices of the selected strings at each position. We can use a `vector` of `vector` of `int` to achieve this.
- Here's the modified code for storing only the indices of the selected strings:

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> heads(ts.size());
for (int i = 0; i < ts.size(); ++i) {
  for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
    if (i + e[j].size() > ts.size() || e[j] != ts.substr(i, e[j].size())) {
      continue;
    }
    p[i][1 << j] = true;
    heads[i].push_back(j);
  }
}
```

Step 4: Consider using compiler optimizations or pragma directives
- Depending on the compiler being used, there may be specific compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can be used to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. These optimizations can vary, so it's recommended to consult the compiler documentation or experiment with different options.

    cin >> e[i];
    concatenated_len += e[i].size();
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    string t;
    cin >> t;
    ts += t;
  }
  
  vector<int> sum_len(1 << n);
  vector<int> string_lengths(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    string_lengths[i] = e[i].size();
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); ++i) {
    sum_len[i] = 0;

        sum_len[i] += string_lengths[j];
      }
    }
  }
  
  int max_ts_size = concatenated_len;
  vector<vector<bool>> p(max_ts_size, vector<bool>(1 << n, false));

    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
      if (i + e[j].size() > ts.size() || e[j] != ts.substr(i, e[j].size())) {
        continue;
      }
      p[i][1 << j] = true;
      heads[i].push_back(j);
    }
  }
  
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = ts.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
    for (int j = 1; j < (1 << n); ++j) {
      if (p[i][j] || i + sum_len[j] > ts.size()) {
        continue;
      }
      for (int k : heads[i]) {
        if ((j & (1 << k)) == 0) {
          continue;
        }
        int i2 = i + e[k].size();
        if (p[i2][j & (~(1 << k))]) {
          p[i][j] = true;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    if (p[i][(1 << n) - 1]) {
      ++ans;
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  cin.tie(0);
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  
  cout.setf(ios::fixed);
  cout.precision(10);
  
  for (;;) {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    if (n == 0 && m == 0) {
      break;
    }
    solve(n, m);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
