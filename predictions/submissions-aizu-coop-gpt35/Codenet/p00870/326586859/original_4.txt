The code provided is a C++ program that reads input from the user, performs some calculations, and outputs the result. The program solves a specific problem, but the focus here is on optimizing the code for efficiency.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory usage:
   - The `vector<string> e(n)` stores the input strings. Since the size of `e` is fixed, we can replace it with a C-style array to reduce memory overhead.
   - The `string ts` concatenates the input strings. However, since we only need to check if a substring exists in `ts`, we can optimize memory usage by using a `const char*` instead of `string`.

2. Redundant computations:
   - The calculation of `concatenated_len` is unnecessary since we can calculate it on the fly during the loop.
   - The calculation of `sum_len[i]` can be optimized by using bitwise operations instead of iterating over the bits of `i`.

3. Loop optimization:
   - The nested loops in the `solve` function can be optimized by using loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead.

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - We can suggest compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. This can be done by adding appropriate compiler flags or pragmas.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step.
