Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage:
   - The code uses a vector of strings (`vector<string> e(n)`) to store the input strings. This can be memory-intensive, especially if there are a large number of strings. We can optimize memory usage by using a vector of string pointers instead.
   - The code uses a static 2D boolean array (`static bool p[5000][1 << 12]`) to store the results of partial matches. This array has a fixed size and consumes a significant amount of memory. We can optimize memory usage by using a dynamic 2D boolean array instead.

2. Loop Optimization:
   - The code uses nested loops to compute the `sum_len` array. This can be optimized by using a bitmasking technique to compute the sum of lengths.

3. Compiler Optimization:
   - The code includes pragma directives to enable debugging (`_GLIBCXX_DEBUG`). These directives can impact performance and should be removed for final optimization.
