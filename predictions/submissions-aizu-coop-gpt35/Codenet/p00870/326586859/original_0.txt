The given code is a C++ program that solves a specific problem. The program takes in two integers, `n` and `m`, followed by `n` strings and `m` strings as input. It then concatenates all the `n` strings into one string and checks how many times the concatenated string can be found in the second set of strings. The program outputs the count of occurrences.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Memory Usage: The code uses several vectors and arrays to store intermediate results. We can optimize the memory usage by reducing the size of these data structures where possible.

2. String Operations: The program uses several string operations, such as concatenation, substring matching, and size comparison. We can optimize these operations to reduce the overall running time.

3. Loop Optimization: The program contains several nested loops. We can optimize these loops to reduce the number of iterations and improve the overall running time.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now, let's go through each step and propose optimizations.
