The given code appears to be a program that solves a specific problem. The main function repeatedly calls the solve function to solve multiple instances of the problem. The solve function takes two integers as input, n and m, and performs a series of computations to find a solution. 

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory allocation: The code uses a vector of strings to store the input strings. This can be inefficient in terms of memory usage, as each string object includes additional metadata. We can optimize this by using a vector of character arrays instead.

2. String concatenation: The code concatenates the strings in the input using the += operator. This can be inefficient, as it involves repeatedly creating new string objects and copying the contents. We can optimize this by using a character array to store the concatenated string and manually copying the characters.

3. Bit manipulation: The code uses bit manipulation to represent subsets of strings. However, the current implementation involves multiple bitwise operations and checks, which can be slow. We can optimize this by using a more efficient representation of subsets, such as using integers where each bit represents the presence or absence of a string.

4. Dynamic memory allocation: The code uses dynamic memory allocation for the boolean array `p`. This can be inefficient, especially for large sizes. We can optimize this by using a static array instead.

5. Loop optimization: The code contains nested loops that iterate over the input strings and perform comparisons. We can optimize this by rearranging the loops to minimize the number of iterations and reduce unnecessary computations.

Based on these observations, here is the step-by-step optimization strategy:

1. Replace the vector of strings with a vector of character arrays to optimize memory usage.

2. Replace the string concatenation with manual character copying to avoid unnecessary string object creation and copying.

3. Replace the bitwise operations with integer operations to optimize subset representation.

4. Replace the dynamic memory allocation with a static array for the boolean matrix `p` to optimize memory usage.

5. Optimize the loops by rearranging them and reducing unnecessary computations.

Now, let's proceed with the optimized code:
