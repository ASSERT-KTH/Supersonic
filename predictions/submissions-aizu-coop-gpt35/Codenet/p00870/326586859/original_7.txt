The given code is a C++ program that solves a problem using dynamic programming. The main function reads inputs from the standard input and calls the `solve` function to solve the problem for each input.

Let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient memory usage:
   - The `vector<string> e(n)` is used to store the strings `e[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`. However, the `concatenated_len` variable is used to calculate the total length of all the strings in `e`. This means we can store all the strings in a single string variable instead of a vector. This will save memory and improve cache locality.

2. Redundant computations:
   - The `sum_len` vector is used to store the length of each subset of `e` (represented by `1 << n`). However, the length of each subset can be calculated on-the-fly by adding the lengths of the strings in the subset. This will avoid the need to pre-compute and store the lengths in a separate vector.

3. Inefficient loop iteration:
   - The loops `rep(i, 0, 1 << n)` and `rep(j, 0, n)` are used to iterate over all subsets of `e` and all elements of `e`, respectively. However, these loops can be optimized by using bit manipulation and bitwise operations to iterate over the subsets and elements more efficiently.

4. Unnecessary function calls:
   - The `substr` function is called multiple times in the inner loop to compare substrings. Instead, we can use index-based comparisons to avoid the overhead of creating substrings.

5. Compiler optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. For example, we can enable compiler optimizations using compiler flags (`-O3`) or pragma directives (`#pragma GCC optimize("O3")`) to hint the compiler to optimize the code.

Now let's optimize the code step by step.
