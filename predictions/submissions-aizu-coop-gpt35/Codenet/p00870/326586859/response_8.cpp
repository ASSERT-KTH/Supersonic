The code provided is a C++ program that solves a specific problem. The program reads input from the user, performs some calculations, and outputs the result. However, the code can be optimized for efficiency. 

Let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary header files. It is better to include only the necessary header files explicitly.

2. The code uses the `vector<string>` data structure to store the input strings. Since the size of each string is known in advance, it would be more memory-efficient to use a 2-dimensional character array (`char[][]`) instead.

3. The code uses the `string` concatenation operator (`+=`) repeatedly in a loop. This operation has a time complexity of O(n), which can be costly if performed multiple times. It would be more efficient to use a `stringstream` to concatenate the strings.

4. The code uses a nested loop to calculate the `sum_len` vector. This can be optimized by using bit manipulation and pre-calculating the sum of string lengths for each subset of strings.

5. The code uses a static 2-dimensional boolean array `p` to store intermediate results. Since the size of this array is fixed, it would be more efficient to use a `vector<vector<bool>>` instead.

6. The code uses nested loops to iterate over the `heads` vector. This can be optimized by using a lookup table or a more efficient data structure.

7. The code uses a nested loop to iterate over the `p` array. This can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm such as dynamic programming.

8. The code uses the `substr` function to compare substrings. This function creates a new string object, which can be inefficient. It would be more efficient to use a pointer-based comparison.

Based on the above analysis, here is an optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files and include only the necessary ones explicitly.

2. Replace the `vector<string>` with a 2-dimensional character array.

3. Replace string concatenation with a `stringstream`.

4. Optimize the calculation of the `sum_len` vector using bit manipulation.

5. Replace the static 2-dimensional boolean array `p` with a `vector<vector<bool>>`.

6. Optimize the `heads` vector by using a more efficient data structure.

7. Optimize the loop over the `p` array using a more efficient algorithm such as dynamic programming.

8. Replace the `substr` function with a pointer-based comparison.
