Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `n` followed by an integer `k` from the input.
- It then reads `n` integers and stores them in a vector `ac`.
- It calculates the cumulative sum of the elements in `ac` and stores them in the same vector.
- It initializes `res` to -LLONG_MAX.
- It then iterates from `k` to `n` and calculates the maximum difference between `ac[i]` and `ac[i-k]`.
- Finally, it outputs the maximum difference.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary headers such as `algorithm`, `climits`, `cstring`, `map`, and `string`. These can be removed to improve compile time.
2. Use a more efficient data structure: The use of a vector for `ac` is reasonable, but it can be optimized by reserving `n+1` elements upfront to avoid unnecessary reallocations.
3. Avoid repeated calculations: The cumulative sum can be calculated in the same loop where the elements are read, avoiding the need for an additional loop.
4. Use a more efficient initial value for `res`: Instead of initializing `res` to -LLONG_MAX, it can be initialized to the first element of `ac` to avoid the need for the `ac[i] - ac[i-k]` calculation in the first iteration of the loop.
5. Optimize the loop: The loop can be optimized by using a sliding window approach instead of recalculating `ac[i] - ac[i-k]` in each iteration. This can be achieved by subtracting the first element of the previous window and adding the next element of the current window.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes:
   - Remove the lines `#include <algorithm>`, `#include <climits>`, `#include <cstring>`, `#include <map>`, and `#include <string>`.
   
2. Reserve memory for `ac`:
   - Modify the line `vector<long long> ac(n + 1, 0);` to `vector<long long> ac; ac.reserve(n + 1);`.
   
3. Calculate cumulative sum in the same loop:
   - Modify the loop `for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)` as follows:
     ```
     for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        cin >> ac[i];
        ac[i] += ac[i - 1];
     }
     ```

4. Initialize `res` to the first element of `ac`:
   - Modify the line `long long res = -LLONG_MAX;` to `long long res = ac[k];`.

5. Optimize the loop using a sliding window approach:
   - Modify the loop `for (int i = k; i <= n; ++i)` as follows:
     ```
     for (int i = k; i <= n; ++i) {
        res = max(res, ac[i] - ac[i - k]);
        ac[i] -= ac[i - k];
     }
     ```

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, k;
  while (cin >> n >> k, n) {
    vector<long long> ac;
    ac.reserve(n + 1);

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      long long num;
      cin >> num;
      ac.push_back(num + ac.back());
    }

    long long res = ac[k];
    for (int i = k; i <= n; ++i) {
      res = max(res, ac[i] - ac[i - k]);
      ac[i] -= ac[i - k];
    }

    cout << res << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, unnecessary includes have been removed, memory allocation for the `ac` vector has been optimized, cumulative sum calculation has been combined with the input loop, the initial value of `res` has been optimized, and the loop has been optimized using a sliding window approach.
