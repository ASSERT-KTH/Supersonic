Code Analysis:
- The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input. The loop continues as long as `n` is non-zero.
- Inside the loop, a vector `ac` of size `n+1` is created and initialized with zeros.
- The vector `ac` is then populated with the input values, and each element is updated to be the cumulative sum of the previous elements.
- A variable `res` is initialized with the minimum possible value for a `long long`.
- Another loop iterates from `k` to `n`, and for each iteration, it calculates the difference between the cumulative sum at index `i` and the cumulative sum at index `i-k`. The maximum of these differences is stored in `res`.
- Finally, `res` is printed to the output.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use an array instead of a vector for `ac`: Since the size of `ac` is known at compile-time, using an array instead of a vector can improve performance by reducing memory allocation overhead.
2. Remove unnecessary includes: Some of the `#include` statements are not necessary for the given code and can be removed to improve compile-time performance.
3. Initialize `res` with the minimum possible value: Instead of using `LLONG_MAX` to initialize `res`, we can initialize it with the first value of `ac`. This avoids the need for a conditional check inside the loop to handle the initial iteration.
4. Use prefix sum instead of cumulative sum: Instead of calculating the cumulative sum at each index, we can calculate the prefix sum once and use it to calculate the differences in the inner loop. This avoids repeated calculations and improves performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the line `#include <map>` with `#include <array>` since we will be using an array instead of a vector.
2. Remove the line `#include <cstring>` since it is not needed in the given code.
3. Replace the line `vector<long long> ac(n + 1, 0);` with `long long ac[n + 1] = {0};` to use an array instead of a vector. This eliminates the need for memory allocation and deallocation.
4. Replace the line `cin >> ac[i]; ac[i] += ac[i - 1];` with `cin >> ac[i];` to remove the cumulative sum calculation inside the loop.
5. Add a new line before the second loop to calculate the prefix sum: `for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) ac[i] += ac[i - 1];`
6. Replace the line `long long res = -LLONG_MAX;` with `long long res = ac[k];` to initialize `res` with the first value of `ac`.
7. Replace the line `res = max(res, ac[i] - ac[i - k]);` with `res = max(res, ac[i] - ac[i - k - 1]);` to use the prefix sum to calculate the difference.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, k;
  while (cin >> n >> k, n) {
    long long ac[n + 1] = {0};
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      cin >> ac[i];
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      ac[i] += ac[i - 1];
    }
    long long res = ac[k];
    for (int i = k; i <= n; ++i) {
      res = max(res, ac[i] - ac[i - k - 1]);
    }
    cout << res << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code improves performance by using an array instead of a vector, removing unnecessary includes, initializing `res` with the first value of `ac`, and using the prefix sum to calculate the differences. These changes reduce memory usage, eliminate unnecessary calculations, and improve the overall efficiency of the program.
