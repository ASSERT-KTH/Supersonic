Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structure: The array `S[]` is used to store the input elements. However, this array is not sorted, and binary search is performed on it. This search operation can be improved by using a more efficient data structure, such as a sorted array or a binary search tree.

2. Redundant computation: The `mid` value is recomputed inside the while loop, even though it does not change unless `left` or `right` is updated. This computation can be moved outside the loop to avoid unnecessary calculations.

3. Inefficient loop condition: The `while` loop condition `left < right` is checked at the beginning of each iteration. This condition can be optimized by using a `do-while` loop structure, which checks the loop condition at the end of each iteration.
