Upon initial analysis, there are a few areas where the given code can be optimized:

1. Redundant Computation: The computation of the `mid` value can be moved outside the recursive function to avoid redundant calculations.

2. Tail Recursion: The recursive function `dfs` can be optimized using tail recursion. This would avoid the need for maintaining a call stack and improve the efficiency of the recursive calls.

3. Compiler Optimizations: The compiler can be instructed to perform optimizations by using compiler-specific optimization flags or pragma directives.
