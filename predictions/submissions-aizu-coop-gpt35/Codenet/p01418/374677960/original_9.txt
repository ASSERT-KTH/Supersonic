The given code appears to be implementing a recursive Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to calculate a probability value. However, there are several potential areas for optimization:

1. Avoiding unnecessary calculations: The code performs the calculation `(l + r) / 2` in every recursive call. Since this value doesn't change throughout the recursion, we can calculate it once and pass it as a parameter to the `dfs` function.

2. Reducing function calls: The recursive calls to `dfs` are executed twice for each level of recursion. We can reduce the number of function calls by calculating the two outcomes (`dfs(d - 1, l, mid)` and `dfs(d - 1, mid, r)`) outside of the `return` statement and storing them in variables.

3. Minimizing floating-point operations: The code uses floating-point arithmetic for the calculation of `mid`. However, floating-point operations can be slower than integer operations. We can optimize this by converting the double values to integers and performing the calculations using integers.

4. Utilizing compiler optimizations: We can utilize compiler optimizations to further improve the performance of the code. For example, we can enable compiler optimizations using the `-O3` flag or specific pragma directives that provide hints to the compiler about loop unrolling or inlining certain functions.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with optimizing the given code step-by-step.
