First, let's analyze the provided code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The code uses the `dfs` function to recursively calculate the probability of a target value falling within a given range. However, this recursive approach can lead to redundant computations and potentially exponential time complexity.

2. The calculation of the `mid` value, `(l + r) / 2`, is performed at each recursive call. This division operation can be computationally expensive and can be avoided.

3. The code uses floating-point arithmetic, including comparisons (`<`, `>`), to check if a value falls within a certain range. Floating-point comparisons can be imprecise and may lead to incorrect results. A more robust approach is to use a tolerance range around the target value.

4. The code uses the `printf` function to print the result with nine decimal places. The use of `printf` can be replaced with `std::cout` for improved performance.

Based on this analysis, let's formulate an optimization strategy:

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the recursive approach with an iterative approach to avoid redundant computations and improve performance.

2. Instead of performing division to calculate the `mid` value at each iteration, calculate it once before starting the iterative loop.

3. Use a tolerance range around the target value `T` for comparisons instead of direct floating-point comparisons.

4. Replace `printf` with `std::cout` for printing the result.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization:

Step 1: Replace the recursive approach with an iterative approach.
- The recursive approach can lead to redundant computations and potentially exponential time complexity.
- By using an iterative approach, we can avoid the overhead of function calls and improve performance.
- We can use a loop to iterate `d` times, updating the values of `l` and `r` at each iteration.

Step 2: Calculate the `mid` value only once.
- Instead of calculating `(l + r) / 2` at each iteration, we can calculate it once before starting the iterative loop and reuse the value.

Step 3: Use a tolerance range for comparisons.
- Instead of using direct floating-point comparisons (`<`, `>`), we can use a tolerance range around the target value `T`.
- We can define a lower bound `T_lower = T - E` and an upper bound `T_upper = T + E`.
- Instead of `(T - E < mid && mid < T + E)`, we can use `(T_lower <= mid && mid <= T_upper)`.

Step 4: Replace `printf` with `std::cout`.
- Using `std::cout` for printing the result is generally faster than `printf` for standard output.

Now, let's implement these optimizations in the code:
