Code Analysis:

1. The code uses the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes all standard library headers. This can lead to slower compilation times and may include unnecessary headers.

2. The code defines several macros and typedefs. While they can improve code readability, they can also make the code harder to understand and maintain.

3. The `calc` function calculates the minimum number of coins needed to represent a given value. It uses a loop to iterate through the coin denominations and update the value and the answer. This can be optimized.

4. The code uses a two-dimensional array `dp` to store the minimum number of coins needed to represent a given value. It is initialized with a large value `1001001001`. This initialization is not necessary because the array will be filled in the following loop.

5. The code uses a deque `deq` to store the minimum number of coins needed to represent a given value for each coin denomination. The deque is used to store pairs of values representing the number of coins and the corresponding value. This can be simplified and optimized.

6. The code uses a loop to iterate through the coin denominations and update the minimum number of coins needed for each value. This loop can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary headers and macros to reduce compilation time and simplify the code.

2. Simplify the `calc` function to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to represent a given value more efficiently.

3. Optimize the initialization of the `dp` array by removing the unnecessary initialization.

4. Simplify and optimize the use of the deque `deq` to store the minimum number of coins needed for each value.

5. Optimize the loop that updates the minimum number of coins needed for each value by reducing the number of iterations and avoiding unnecessary updates.

6. Use compiler optimizations and pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary headers and macros:

   - Remove the `bits/stdc++.h` header and include only the necessary standard library headers.

   - Remove unnecessary macros like `int long long` and the `typedef`s.

2. Simplify the `calc` function:

   - The `calc` function can be simplified by using integer division and modulo operations.

   - Instead of using a loop to iterate through the coin denominations, calculate the minimum number of coins needed directly.

   - This simplification reduces the time complexity from O(6) to O(1).

3. Optimize the initialization of the `dp` array:

   - Remove the unnecessary initialization of the `dp` array with a large value.

   - The array will be filled in the following loop, so there is no need to initialize it.

4. Simplify and optimize the use of the deque `deq`:

   - Remove the deque and use a single variable to store the minimum number of coins needed for each value.

   - Instead of using a deque to store pairs of values, use a single variable to store the minimum number of coins needed.

   - This simplification reduces the memory usage and eliminates the need for deque operations.

5. Optimize the loop that updates the minimum number of coins needed:

   - Reduce the number of iterations in the outer loop by iterating from the smallest coin denomination to the largest.

   - Avoid unnecessary updates by checking if the current coin denomination is available.

   - This optimization reduces the number of iterations in the loop and avoids unnecessary updates.

6. Use compiler optimizations and pragmas:

   - Enable compiler optimizations to allow the compiler to optimize the code based on the target platform and compiler settings.

   - Use pragmas or compiler directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code, such as loop unrolling or tail recursion.

   - This can further improve the performance of the code by allowing the compiler to apply additional optimizations.
