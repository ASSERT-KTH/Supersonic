The provided code is a C++ program that performs some graph-related operations. Let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The `reader` function reads an integer from the input. It uses `getchar_unlocked` to read characters one by one and convert them to integers. This function can be optimized by using a more efficient method to read integers from the input.

2. The `bfs` function performs a breadth-first search on a graph. It uses a queue to store the vertices to be visited. However, this implementation can be optimized by avoiding the unnecessary use of a second queue and by using a more efficient data structure to store visited vertices.

3. The main function reads integers from the input, builds a graph, performs some graph operations, and prints the results. The main areas for optimization in this function are:
   - The use of `memset` to initialize the `d` array can be replaced with a more efficient method.
   - The `swap` function is called inside a loop, which can be avoided by using an if-else condition.
   - The graph construction and modification operations can be optimized by using more efficient data structures and algorithms.
