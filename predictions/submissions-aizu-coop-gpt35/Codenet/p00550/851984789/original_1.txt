The given code appears to solve a problem related to graph traversal and counting. However, there are several potential areas for optimization. Let's analyze the code and propose optimizations step by step.

1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes all other standard C++ headers, which can increase compile time and potentially introduce unnecessary dependencies. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Replace the use of `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`: The `<iostream>` library provides the `cin` and `cout` objects, which are generally faster than `scanf` and `printf` in C++. Switching to `cin` and `cout` can improve the input/output performance.

3. Replace the use of `pair` with a custom structure: The use of `pair<int, int>` can be replaced with a custom structure to improve code readability and potentially optimize memory usage.

4. Use `reserve` to optimize vector memory allocation: The vectors `x` and `y` are dynamically resizing during runtime, which can result in frequent memory reallocations. It is more efficient to reserve memory in advance using the `reserve` function.

5. Replace the use of `queue` with a custom queue implementation: The standard `queue` in C++ does not provide direct access to elements, which can be a performance bottleneck. Implementing a custom queue using a fixed-size array and maintaining front and rear indices can improve performance.

6. Replace the use of `used` and `U` arrays with a single `unordered_set`: The arrays `used` and `U` are used to track visited elements. Using a single `unordered_set` can provide faster membership checks and simplify the code.

7. Optimize the inner loops: The nested loops in the code can be optimized by reducing unnecessary iterations and removing redundant checks.

8. Enable compiler optimizations: Use compiler optimizations flags or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize the code further.

Based on these analysis points, let's proceed with the optimization steps.
