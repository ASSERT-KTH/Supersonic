The given code is an implementation of a graph algorithm that finds the number of connected components after removing a specific edge from the graph. The code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to compute the shortest distances from the source node to all other nodes in the graph.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant distance calculations: The code uses the `dist` array to store the shortest distances from the source node to all other nodes. However, this array is initialized with a large value (999999) for all elements, and then the BFS algorithm updates the distances as it progresses. This results in redundant distance calculations for nodes that are not reachable from the source node. 

2. Inefficient data structures: The code uses vectors (`x` and `y`) to store adjacency lists for each node. However, accessing elements in vectors has an O(n) complexity, which can be improved.

3. Unnecessary data storage: The code uses the `used` array to keep track of whether an edge has been visited or not. However, this information can be obtained from the `U` array instead. 

4. Inefficient queue operations: The code uses queues (`Q` and `Q1`) to perform breadth-first searches. However, using a deque instead of a queue can provide better performance due to its constant time complexity for insertions and deletions at both ends.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Optimize distance calculations: Instead of initializing the `dist` array with a large value for all elements, initialize it with -1 for all unreachable nodes. This will avoid redundant distance calculations during the BFS algorithm.

2. Use efficient data structures: Replace the vectors (`x` and `y`) with arrays or linked lists to store adjacency lists. This will improve the performance of accessing elements in the adjacency lists.

3. Eliminate unnecessary data storage: Remove the `used` array and use the `U` array to track whether an edge has been visited or not.

4. Use a deque for queue operations: Replace the queues (`Q` and `Q1`) with deques to improve the performance of insertions and deletions.

Now, let's apply these optimizations step by step.
