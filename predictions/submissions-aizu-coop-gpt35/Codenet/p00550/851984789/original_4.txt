The given code appears to solve a graph problem involving finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for performance and memory usage.

1. Avoid using "bits/stdc++.h": The inclusion of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is not recommended as it includes the entire standard library, which can lead to longer compilation times and unnecessary memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid unnecessary variables: The variable `m` is not used after reading its value from input. It can be removed to improve code readability.

3. Use a more efficient data structure for the graph: The current implementation uses a vector of pairs to represent the graph, which can be inefficient for large graphs. Instead, we can use an adjacency list representation of the graph using a vector of vectors. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

4. Use a more efficient data structure for the distances: The current implementation uses an array `dist` to store the distances from the source node. It initializes all distances to a large value and updates them as the shortest path is found. However, since the maximum number of nodes is given as 110,000, it is better to use a priority queue or a min-heap to store the distances. This will allow us to extract the node with the minimum distance efficiently.

5. Avoid unnecessary checks and updates: In the loop that updates the distances, there is a check `if (dist[i.first] > dist[a1] + 1)` before updating the distance. Instead of checking this condition, we can directly update the distance and push the node into the queue. This will eliminate the need for an additional check.

6. Optimize the inner loop: In the loop that populates the `y` vector and updates the `T` array, there is another unnecessary check `if (dist[i] < dist[j.first])`. Since we are iterating over the neighbors of node `i`, we can assume that `dist[i] < dist[j.first]` will always be true. Therefore, this check can be removed.

7. Use a bitmap for marking used edges: The current implementation uses a boolean array `used` to mark the edges that have been used. However, since the maximum number of edges is given as 210,000, it is more memory-efficient to use a bitmap instead of an array of booleans. This can be achieved by using bitwise operations.

8. Use a bitmap for marking visited nodes: The current implementation uses an array `U` to mark the nodes that have been visited. Similar to the previous optimization, we can use a bitmap instead of an array of integers to mark the visited nodes.

9. Remove unnecessary condition checks: In the inner while loop, there is a check `if (U[a1] == 1 || used[a2] == true)`. Since we are checking these conditions before pushing the nodes into the queue, we can assume that these conditions will always be false. Therefore, these checks can be removed.

10. Use a stack instead of a queue: Instead of using a queue to perform a breadth-first search, we can use a stack and perform a depth-first search. This can reduce the memory usage as the stack does not need to store all the nodes at the same time.

11. Reduce the number of push and pop operations: The current implementation performs multiple push and pop operations on the queue and stack. Instead of pushing and popping individual elements, we can push multiple elements at once and process them in a batch. This can reduce the number of function calls and improve performance.

12. Use a faster output method: The code currently uses `cout` to print the results. However, the `endl` manipulator flushes the output buffer, which can be slow. It is better to use `'\n'` instead of `endl` to improve performance.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_NODES = 110000;
const int MAX_EDGES = 210000;

int n, q, a[MAX_EDGES], b[MAX_EDGES], dist[MAX_NODES], T[MAX_NODES], cnt;
vector<vector<int>> graph(MAX_NODES), rev_graph(MAX_NODES);
bitset<MAX_EDGES> used;
bitset<MAX_NODES> U;

void bfs(int source) {
    fill(dist, dist + n + 1, 999999);
    dist[source] = 0;
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
    pq.push(make_pair(0, source));

    while (!pq.empty()) {
        int u = pq.top().second;
        pq.pop();

        for (int v : graph[u]) {
            if (dist[v] > dist[u] + 1) {
                dist[v] = dist[u] + 1;
                pq.push(make_pair(dist[v], v));
            }
        }
    }
}

void dfs(int u) {
    for (int v : rev_graph[u]) {
        if (dist[u] < dist[v]) {
            T[v]++;
            if (--T[v] == 0 && !U[v]) {
                U[v] = true;
                cnt++;
                dfs(v);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    cin >> n >> q;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        cin >> a[i] >> b[i];
        graph[a[i]].push_back(b[i]);
        rev_graph[b[i]].push_back(a[i]);
    }

    bfs(1);

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (dist[a[i]] < dist[b[i]]) {
            T[b[i]]++;
        } else {
            T[a[i]]++;
        }
    }

    while (q--) {
        int c;
        cin >> c;
        c--;

        int ss = -1;
        if (dist[a[c]] < dist[b[c]]) {
            ss = b[c];
        } else if (dist[a[c]] > dist[b[c]]) {
            ss = a[c];
        }

        if (ss >= 1 && !U[ss] && !used[c]) {
            stack<pair<int, int>> stk;
            stk.push(make_pair(ss, c));

            while (!stk.empty()) {
                int u = stk.top().first;
                int v = stk.top().second;
                stk.pop();

                if (U[u] || used[v]) {
                    continue;
                }

                used[v] = true;
                if (--T[u] == 0) {
                    U[u] = true;
                    cnt++;
                    dfs(u);
                }

                for (int w : rev_graph[u]) {
                    if (!U[w]) {
                        stk.push(make_pair(w, -1));
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        cout << cnt << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Overall, these optimizations aim to reduce unnecessary checks, eliminate redundant computations, and use more efficient data structures. The resulting code should exhibit improved performance and reduced memory usage compared to the original implementation.
