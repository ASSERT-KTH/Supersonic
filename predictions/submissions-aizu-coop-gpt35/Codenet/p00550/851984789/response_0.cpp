The given code appears to be an implementation of a graph algorithm. It calculates the shortest distance from node 1 to all other nodes in the graph and then performs certain operations based on user input queries. 

Upon analyzing the code, here are some potential optimizations that can be applied:

1. Use a more efficient data structure for the graph representation: The current code uses a vector of pairs to represent the adjacency list of each node. This can be quite inefficient in terms of memory usage and access time. Instead, we can use a more optimized data structure like an array of linked lists or an array of vectors to represent the graph.

2. Remove unnecessary variables and computations: There are a few variables and computations that can be removed to improve efficiency. For example, the variable `used` is unnecessary since it is only used for a boolean check. Similarly, the variable `ss` can be removed and the conditions involving it can be simplified.

3. Reduce the number of iterations: The current code uses two nested loops to iterate over the adjacency list of each node. This can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

4. Optimize the use of queues: The code uses two separate queues, `Q` and `Q1`, to perform breadth-first searches. This can be improved by using a single queue.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Use a more efficient data structure for the graph representation:
   - Replace `vector<pair<int, int>> x[110000]` with `list<int> x[110000]` to represent the adjacency list of each node.
   - Replace `vector<pair<int, int>> y[110000]` with `list<int> y[110000]` to represent the list of edges where the destination node has a shorter distance.
   - Replace `queue<pair<int, int>> Q` with `queue<int> Q` since we only need to store the IDs of nodes in the queue.

2. Remove unnecessary variables and computations:
   - Remove the declaration and usage of the `used` array since it is not needed.
   - Remove the `ss` variable and simplify the conditions involving it.

3. Reduce the number of iterations:
   - Instead of iterating over the adjacency list of each node twice, we can combine the two loops into a single loop. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

4. Optimize the use of queues:
   - Replace the separate queues `Q` and `Q1` with a single queue `Q` to perform the breadth-first search.
