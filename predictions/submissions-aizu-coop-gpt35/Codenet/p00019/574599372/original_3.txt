The provided code calculates the factorial of a given number `n`. However, there are several areas where we can optimize the code to improve its performance and reduce memory usage.

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes `<cstdio>` and `<iostream>`, but only `iostream` is being used. We can remove the unused `<cstdio>` include.

2. Remove `using namespace std;`: The `using namespace std;` statement is not required in this code, as it only uses `std::cin` and `std::cout`. We can remove it and use the fully qualified names `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead.

3. Use a more efficient data type: The code currently uses `long long` to store the factorial result. However, we can use a more memory-efficient data type, such as `unsigned long long` or even `unsigned int`, depending on the expected range of `n`.

4. Optimize the factorial calculation: The code calculates the factorial using a simple loop. However, we can optimize it further by using a technique called "loop unrolling". Instead of multiplying `a` with each value of `i`, we can multiply `a` with a set of consecutive numbers in each iteration. This reduces the number of multiplications required.

5. Handle edge cases: The code does not handle the case when `n` is less than 2. In such cases, the factorial should be 1. We can add a check for this and return 1 early.

Here is the optimized code with the above improvements:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

unsigned long long factorial(int n) {
  if (n < 2) {
    return 1;
  }

  unsigned long long result = 1;

  // Calculate factorial using loop unrolling
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i += 2) {
    result *= i;
    if (i + 1 <= n) {
      result *= (i + 1);
    }
  }

  return result;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  unsigned long long factorialResult = factorial(n);

  std::cout << factorialResult << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

By applying these optimizations, we have reduced unnecessary includes, improved the data type usage, optimized the factorial calculation, and handled edge cases. This results in a more efficient and optimized code.
