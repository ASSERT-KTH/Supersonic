The given code calculates the factorial of a number `n` using a simple loop. However, there are a few areas where we can optimize the code for better performance and memory usage.

1. The `using namespace std;` statement is unnecessary and can be removed. It's best to explicitly qualify the standard library functions and types to avoid potential naming conflicts.

2. The variable `a` is declared as `long long` which is unnecessary. Since the factorial of `n` can be very large, we can use an unsigned 64-bit integer (`uint64_t`) instead of `long long` to store the factorial value.

3. The loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n`. However, if `n` is less than 2, the loop will not execute at all, and the final value of `a` will remain 1. We can add a simple check at the beginning to handle this case and return 1 directly.

4. The loop can be optimized by using a pre-increment (`++i`) instead of a post-increment (`i++`). This can potentially save a few CPU cycles by avoiding the creation and copying of temporary objects.

5. To further optimize the loop, we can perform loop unrolling. Loop unrolling involves executing multiple iterations of the loop in a single iteration, reducing the overhead of loop control and branching. We can unroll the loop by a factor of 4, calculating 4 iterations in each iteration of the loop. This can be done by multiplying `a` with `i`, `i+1`, `i+2`, and `i+3` in each iteration.

6. We can also consider enabling compiler optimizations, such as inline expansion and loop optimization, using suitable compiler flags or pragma directives. This allows the compiler to apply various optimization techniques to the code automatically.
