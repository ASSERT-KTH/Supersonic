The provided code is a C++ program that calculates the number of possible paths in a directed graph. The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to detect cycles in the graph and then calculates the number of paths using dynamic programming.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can significantly increase compilation time and memory usage. We should only include the necessary headers for the program, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<cstring>`, and `<algorithm>`.

2. Avoid using macros: The code uses several macros to define constants and shortcuts. Macros can be error-prone and can cause unexpected behavior. It is better to use constants and inline functions instead.

3. Use more descriptive variable and function names: The code uses short and cryptic variable and function names. Using more descriptive names will improve code readability and maintainability.

4. Replace global variables with local variables: The code uses several global variables, such as `N`, `M`, `g`, `r`, `used`, `List`, `l`, `cycle`, `c`, `inCycle`, and `dp`. Global variables can introduce bugs and make the code harder to understand. It is better to pass variables as arguments to functions or define them locally within functions.

5. Optimize the DFS algorithm: The current DFS algorithm uses recursion and stores the visited nodes in the `used` array and the path in the `List` array. This approach can be simplified and optimized by using an iterative implementation of DFS and eliminating the need for the `List` array.

6. Optimize the dynamic programming part: The current dynamic programming implementation uses recursion and memoization to calculate the number of paths. This can be optimized by using an iterative approach and eliminating the need for recursion and memoization.

7. Use appropriate data structures: The code uses `vector` to represent the graph and reverse graph. While `vector` provides dynamic resizing, it can be inefficient for large graphs. Using a more efficient data structure, such as an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix, can improve performance.

8. Minimize memory allocations: The code uses dynamic memory allocation for the `g` and `r` arrays. Using static arrays or reserving memory in advance can reduce memory allocations and deallocations.
