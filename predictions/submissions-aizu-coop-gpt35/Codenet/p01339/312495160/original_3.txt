First, let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant includes: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header file that includes a large number of standard C++ headers. This can result in increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. It's better to include only the necessary standard headers.

2. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a combination of arrays and vectors to represent graphs and other data structures. This can result in unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations. It would be more efficient to use a single vector to represent the graph and modify the code accordingly.

3. Unnecessary computations: The `solve` function uses a recursive approach to calculate the result. However, the same subproblems are being solved multiple times, leading to redundant computations. This can be avoided by using memoization or dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems and reuse them when needed.

4. Inefficient loop structure: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the graph and perform computations. This can result in a high time complexity, especially if the graph is large. It would be better to optimize the loop structure to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

5. Unnecessary global variables: The code uses several global variables, such as `used`, `List`, `l`, `cycle`, `c`, and `inCycle`. These variables can be made local to the functions where they are used, reducing the global memory footprint and improving code clarity.

Based on this analysis, let's formulate an optimization strategy:

1. Optimize includes: Remove the unnecessary includes and include only the necessary standard headers.

2. Optimize data structures: Replace the arrays and vectors used to represent the graph with a single vector. Modify the code to use this new data structure.

3. Optimize redundant computations: Use memoization or dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems in the `solve` function and reuse them when needed.

4. Optimize loop structure: Simplify the loop structure to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

5. Optimize global variables: Make the necessary variables local to the functions where they are used.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization step.
