The given code is a C++ program that solves a problem using a combination of depth-first search (DFS) and dynamic programming. The program takes as input the number of nodes (`N`) and the number of edges (`M`), followed by the edges themselves. It then calculates and outputs the answer to the problem.

Upon analyzing the code, several potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. **Redundant includes**: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is generally discouraged due to its large size. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard library headers needed for the program.

2. **Inefficient data structures**: The code uses several data structures that may not be the most efficient choice for this problem. For example, `vector` is used to represent the adjacency list, which incurs additional memory overhead and may result in slower access time compared to using a plain array.

3. **Inefficient algorithms**: The depth-first search (DFS) algorithm used in the code can be optimized. The current implementation uses recursion, which may result in stack overflow for large inputs. Additionally, the current DFS implementation has a time complexity of O(N*M), which can be improved.

4. **Inefficient memory usage**: The code uses several large arrays (`used`, `List`, `cycle`, `inCycle`, `dp`) that may consume unnecessary memory. It is worth exploring whether these arrays can be reduced in size or if a more efficient data structure can be used.

5. **Lack of optimization directives**: The code does not make use of any compiler optimization directives or pragmas. By adding these directives, the compiler can be instructed to optimize certain parts of the code, resulting in improved performance.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the redundant includes with the necessary standard library headers.

2. Replace the `vector` data structure with plain arrays to improve memory efficiency and access time.

3. Replace the recursive DFS implementation with an iterative implementation to avoid stack overflow and improve performance.

4. Optimize memory usage by reducing the size of the arrays where possible or using more efficient data structures.

5. Add appropriate optimization directives or pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
