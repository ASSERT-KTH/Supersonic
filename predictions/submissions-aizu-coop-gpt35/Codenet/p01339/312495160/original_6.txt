This code appears to be solving a graph problem, where it calculates the number of directed cycles in a given graph. The code uses depth-first search (DFS) to find the cycles in the graph and dynamic programming to calculate the number of cycles.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few areas for potential optimization:

1. Redundant includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it pulls in a large number of headers, potentially impacting compilation time. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Macro definitions: The code uses macros for constants and functions, such as `EPS`, `INF`, and `rep`. While macros can improve code readability, they can also lead to issues such as unexpected behavior and naming conflicts. It is better to use constant variables and inline functions instead of macros.

3. Inefficient data structures: The code uses vectors to represent the graph and reverse graph, `g` and `r`, respectively. However, vectors are not the most efficient data structure for this purpose. A more efficient alternative would be to use adjacency lists.

4. Unnecessary memset: The code uses `memset` to initialize the `dp` array to `-1`. However, the `dp` array is immediately overwritten with actual values. Therefore, the `memset` call is unnecessary.

5. Inefficient loop iterations: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the graph and reverse graph. However, the use of nested loops can lead to unnecessary iterations and impact performance. It would be more efficient to use iterators or range-based loops instead.

6. Unnecessary modulo operations: The code uses modulo operations (`% MOD`) multiple times. While modulo operations are necessary to prevent overflow, they can be expensive. It would be more efficient to perform modulo operations only when necessary, such as at the end of the calculation.

7. Lack of comments: The code lacks comments, making it difficult to understand the purpose and functionality of each section. Adding comments would improve code readability and maintainability.

Based on these observations, we can formulate an optimization strategy to improve the code's efficiency.
