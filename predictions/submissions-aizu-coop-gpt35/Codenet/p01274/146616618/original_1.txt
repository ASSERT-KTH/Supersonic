The provided code is a C++ program that solves a dynamic programming problem. It reads input from the standard input and prints the minimum cost to defeat all enemies. The code uses a 2D dynamic programming table `dp` to store the minimum cost for each combination of character type and remaining enemy health.

Here is an optimization strategy for the given code:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove it and include only the required headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This line brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, explicitly use the `std` namespace where needed, such as `std::cin` and `std::cout`.

3. Avoid using macros: The code uses macros to define constants like `INF`, `N`, `f`, and `s`. Instead, we can use `const int` or `constexpr` variables to define these constants. This will improve code readability and avoid any potential issues caused by macros.

4. Optimize data structures: The code uses a vector of pairs `mg[2]` to store the magic spells. However, it can be optimized by using a vector of vectors or a map. This will eliminate the need for checking the type of magic spell and simplify the code.

5. Optimize looping: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the magic spells and enemy health. We can optimize the loops by using range-based loops (`for-each`) and iterator-based loops, which can improve performance.

6. Avoid unnecessary computations: The code initializes the `dp` array with `INF` and then updates it in the loop. We can avoid this initialization by using a sentinel value for `dp`.

7. Optimize memory usage: The `dp` array is declared as `int dp[2][N + 10]`, which can be quite large. We can reduce the memory usage by using a 1D array instead of a 2D array. This can be achieved by using a linear indexing scheme for the 2D array.

8. Use compiler optimizations: We can enable compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. This can be done by passing appropriate flags to the compiler or using pragma directives.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and provide the optimized code.
