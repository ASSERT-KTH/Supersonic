The given code appears to solve a dynamic programming problem. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Unnecessary Memory Usage: The code defines two arrays `dp1` and `dp2` with sizes that are larger than necessary. The arrays are only used up to index 10000, but they are defined with sizes 10009 and 10006, respectively. This leads to unnecessary memory allocation and initialization.

2. Redundant Sorting: The code sorts the `num` array using the `std::sort` function, even though it is not required for the subsequent calculations. This sorting operation can be removed to improve efficiency.

3. Inefficient Loop: The loop that calculates the `dp1` array iterates over all indices from `x` to 10000, even though the values before `x` will always be 0. This loop can be optimized to start from `x` instead of 0, reducing the number of iterations.

4. Inefficient Loop: Similarly, the loop that calculates the `dp2` array iterates over all indices from `x` to 10000, even though the values before `x` will always be -inf. This loop can also be optimized to start from `x` instead of 0, reducing the number of iterations.

5. Inefficient Search: The inner loop that calculates the `sum` variable searches for the lower bound of `num[j] - dp2[i]` in the `dp1` array using `std::lower_bound`. This search operation has a time complexity of O(log(n)), which can be avoided by using a different approach.

6. Unnecessary Memory Initialization: The code initializes the `dp1` array with zeros using `memset`. However, this initialization is not required because the subsequent calculations overwrite all the values.

To optimize the code, we can follow these steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary memory allocation and initialization for `dp1` and `dp2`.

2. Remove the sorting of the `num` array, as it is not required for the subsequent calculations.

3. Modify the loop that calculates the `dp1` array to start from `x` instead of 0.

4. Modify the loop that calculates the `dp2` array to start from `x` instead of 0.

5. Replace the search operation in the inner loop with a more efficient approach.

6. Remove the unnecessary memory initialization for `dp1`.

Here is the optimized code with detailed explanations for each optimization step:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#define ll long long
#define maxn 100009
#define inf 999999999999
using namespace std;

ll dp1[10001];
ll dp2[10001];
char s[25];
int num[105];

int main() {
  int n, m, x, y;
  while (scanf("%d", &n) != EOF) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%d", &num[i]);
      
    // Sort the num array (removed)
      
    // Remove unnecessary memory allocation and initialization for dp1 and dp2
    // for (int i = 1; i <= 10000; i++)
    //   dp2[i] = -inf;

    // Initialize flag variable outside the loop
    bool flag = false;

    // Remove unnecessary memory initialization for dp1
    // memset(dp1, 0, sizeof dp1);
    
    scanf("%d", &m);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      scanf("%s", s);
      scanf("%d", &x);
      scanf("%s", s);
      scanf("%d", &y);
      
      if (x == 0 && y > 0)
        flag = true;
      
      if (s[0] == 'S') {
        // Modify the loop to start from x instead of 0
        for (int j = x; j <= 10000; j++)
          dp1[j] = max(dp1[j], dp1[j - x] + y);
      } else {
        // Modify the loop to start from x instead of 0
        for (int j = x; j <= 10000; j++)
          dp2[j] = max(dp2[j], dp2[j - x] + y);
      }
    }
    
    if (flag) {
      puts("0");
      continue;
    }
    
    ll ans = 1ll << 60, sum;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 10001; i++) {
      if (dp2[i] < 0)
        continue;
        
      sum = i;
      
      // Replace the search operation with a more efficient approach
      int lower_bound_index = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        while (lower_bound_index < 10000 && dp1[lower_bound_index] < num[j] - dp2[i])
          lower_bound_index++;
        sum += lower_bound_index;
      }
      
      ans = min(ans, sum);
    }
    
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

By applying these optimizations, the code should run more efficiently and use less memory compared to the original implementation.
