The given code implements a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find the discovery time (d[i]) and finishing time (f[i]) for each node in a directed graph. However, there are several opportunities for optimization:

1. Unnecessary memory usage: The adjacency matrix G[][] is a 2D array of size 101x101, which is unnecessary for most cases. The size of the matrix can be reduced to match the actual number of nodes in the graph.

2. Redundant checks: The condition `if (i == next && G[i][i] > 0)` inside the loop is redundant because it is already checked in the next condition `if (G[i][next] > 0 && color[next] == WHITE)`. This condition can be removed.

3. Inefficient loop: The loop `for (next = 1; next <= n; next++)` iterates over all nodes in the graph, even if they are not connected to the current node `i`. It would be more efficient to iterate only over the nodes that are connected to `i`.

4. Unnecessary recursion: The function `search_loop()` uses recursion to traverse the graph. However, this can be replaced with a stack-based iterative approach, which would be more efficient in terms of memory usage and function call overhead.

5. Compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and compiler directives (such as pragmas) can be used to further enhance the performance of the code.
