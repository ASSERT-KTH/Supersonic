The given code is an implementation of a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find the discovery time (d) and finishing time (f) of each node in a graph. However, there are several areas of the code that can be optimized for improved performance and reduced memory usage.

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The graph is represented using a 2D array `G[101][101]`. This is inefficient because it uses a lot of memory, even for sparse graphs. Additionally, accessing and iterating over the 2D array can be slow. A more efficient alternative would be to use an adjacency list representation.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The line `if (i == next && G[i][i] > 0) break;` checks for self-loops in the graph. However, this check is unnecessary because the loop condition `next <= n` already ensures that `i != next`. Therefore, this line can be removed.
   - The line `for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) color[i] = WHITE;` in the `dfs()` function initializes the `color` array in every function call. This is redundant because the `color` array is already initialized in the `search_loop()` function. This line can be moved to the `main()` function and removed from `dfs()`.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The loops that iterate over the graph can be optimized by using a loop unrolling technique. By processing multiple elements in each iteration, we can reduce the loop overhead and improve performance.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Adding compiler optimization flags, such as `-O2`, can help the compiler to automatically optimize the code by performing loop unrolling, inlining functions, and applying other optimization techniques. These optimizations can result in significant performance improvements.
