The provided code seems relatively simple and doesn't have any major performance bottlenecks. However, there are a few optimizations that can be made to improve efficiency.

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes unnecessary header files, such as `<algorithm>` and `<bits/stdc++.h>`. These headers are not being used in the code and can be safely removed.

2. Use `const` for constant variables: The variable `pai` is a constant value and should be declared as `const double` instead of `double`. This informs the compiler that the value of `pai` is not going to change, allowing for potential optimizations.

3. Use `cout` instead of `printf`: The code currently uses `printf` for output. While `printf` is generally fast, using `cout` from the `<iostream>` header can provide better performance in this case.

4. Avoid unnecessary string comparisons: Instead of comparing strings using `if-else` statements, we can directly compare the values of `a` and `b` and output the result. This eliminates the need for string comparisons, which can be slower.

5. Optimize input: Instead of using `scanf` for input, we can use `cin` from the `<iostream>` header. While `scanf` is generally fast, using `cin` can simplify the code and provide better performance.

With these optimizations in mind, let's modify the code accordingly:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  const double pai = 3.141592653589;
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;

  if (a > b)
    std::cout << "a > b\n";
  else if (a < b)
    std::cout << "a < b\n";
  else
    std::cout << "a == b\n";

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, unnecessary header files are removed, `const` is used for `pai`, `cout` is used for output, `cin` is used for input, and string comparisons are eliminated. These changes improve the efficiency of the code while preserving the original functionality and output.
