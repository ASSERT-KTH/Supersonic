Code Analysis:
- The code includes unnecessary header files like `<algorithm>`, `<bits/stdc++.h>`, and `<vector>`.
- The code uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output, which can be slower compared to `cin` and `cout`.
- The code calculates the value of `pai` (pi) but doesn't use it anywhere.
- The code compares `a` and `b` using an if-else statement and prints the result.
