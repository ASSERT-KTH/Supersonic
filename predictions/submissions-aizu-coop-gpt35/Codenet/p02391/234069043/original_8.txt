The given code is a simple program that compares two integer inputs and prints whether one is greater than, less than, or equal to the other. 

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The inclusion of unnecessary headers: The code includes unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>` and `<bits/stdc++.h>`. These headers are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. The use of `scanf` and `printf` for input/output: The code uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations. These functions are slower compared to their C++ counterparts `cin` and `cout`. Replacing `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` can improve the performance.

3. Redundant declaration and initialization of constant variables: The code initializes the variable `pai` with the constant value of pi (Ï€), but this variable is not used in the code. This declaration and initialization can be removed to improve efficiency.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  
  if (a > b)
    cout << "a > b" << endl;
  else if (a < b)
    cout << "a < b" << endl;
  else
    cout << "a == b" << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code:
1. The unnecessary headers `<algorithm>` and `<bits/stdc++.h>` have been removed.

2. The `scanf` and `printf` functions have been replaced with `cin` and `cout`, respectively. This change improves the efficiency of input and output operations.

3. The declaration and initialization of the unused variable `pai` have been removed.

The optimized code maintains the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance by removing unnecessary operations and using faster input/output functions.
