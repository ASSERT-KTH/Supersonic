The given code is a simple program that compares two integers `a` and `b` and prints whether `a` is greater than, less than, or equal to `b`. Although the code is correct, there are several areas where optimization can be applied to improve performance and reduce memory usage.

1. Avoid unnecessary header inclusions: The code includes unnecessary headers like `<algorithm>` and `<bits/stdc++.h>`. These headers can increase compile time and can potentially introduce unnecessary dependencies. Since the code does not use any functions or features from these headers, they should be removed.

2. Use `const` keyword for constant variables: The variable `pai` is declared as a constant but is missing the `const` keyword. Adding `const` to the declaration will help in better code optimization by allowing the compiler to make certain assumptions.

3. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The code uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations. While these functions are fast, they are less type-safe and can introduce potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Using the `std::cin` and `std::cout` stream objects from the `<iostream>` header is recommended for type-safe and efficient I/O operations.

4. Avoid unnecessary inclusion of the entire `std` namespace: The code currently includes the entire `std` namespace with `using namespace std;`. This practice is generally discouraged as it can lead to namespace clashes and can make code harder to understand. Instead of including the entire namespace, only specific elements that are used should be included.
