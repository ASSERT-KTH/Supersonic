Analysis:
- The code includes unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<vector>`.
- The code uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output, which are slower than the standard C++ input/output streams (`cin` and `cout`).
- The code includes the unnecessary inclusion of the `<algorithm>` header.
- The code does not require the use of the `pai` variable.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary headers.
2. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`.
3. Remove the `pai` variable.
4. Provide step-by-step explanations for each optimization.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  if (a > b)
    cout << "a > b" << endl;
  else if (a < b)
    cout << "a < b" << endl;
  else
    cout << "a == b" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary headers:
   - The original code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<vector>`, which are not used in the code and can be removed.
   - Removing unnecessary headers reduces the compilation time and unnecessary memory usage.

2. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`:
   - The original code uses the slower C input/output functions (`scanf` and `printf`).
   - Replacing them with the C++ input/output streams (`cin` and `cout`) improves the code's performance.
   - `cin` and `cout` use buffered I/O, which eliminates the need for manual buffering and improves the efficiency of input/output operations.

3. Remove the `pai` variable:
   - The `pai` variable is not used in the code.
   - Removing it reduces unnecessary memory usage.

Trade-offs:
- The optimized code is more readable and efficient.
- The removal of unnecessary headers and variables reduces memory usage.
- Replacing `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` improves the performance of input and output operations.
- No significant trade-offs or code complexity increases are introduced in this optimization.
