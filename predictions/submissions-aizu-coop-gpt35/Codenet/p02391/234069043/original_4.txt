Code Analysis:
- The code includes unnecessary header files such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<vector>`.
- The `using namespace std` statement is not required.
- The code uses the `scanf` and `printf` functions for input/output, which are slower compared to the C++ stream-based input/output.
- The code does not perform any complex computations or operations, so there are no major bottlenecks.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<vector>` header files.

2. Remove "using namespace std": Instead of using the entire `std` namespace, use the specific functions and classes from the `std` namespace.

3. Use C++ stream-based input/output: Replace the `scanf` and `printf` functions with the C++ stream-based input/output (`cin` and `cout`). This can improve performance and provide better type safety.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the lines `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `#include <vector>` since they are not used in the code.

2. Remove "using namespace std": Replace the line `using namespace std` with explicit usage of functions and classes from the `std` namespace, for example, `std::cout` instead of `cout`.

3. Use C++ stream-based input/output: Replace the `scanf` and `printf` functions with `cin` and `cout` respectively. This will improve performance and provide better type safety.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  double pai = 3.141592653589;
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  if (a > b)
    std::cout << "a > b\n";
  else if (a < b)
    std::cout << "a < b\n";
  else
    std::cout << "a == b\n";
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code removes unnecessary header files, avoids using the `using namespace std` statement, and replaces the `scanf` and `printf` functions with `cin` and `cout` respectively. These changes improve performance, reduce unnecessary memory usage, and provide better type safety.
