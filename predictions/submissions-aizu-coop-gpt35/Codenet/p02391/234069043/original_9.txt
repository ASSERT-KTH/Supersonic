Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Including unnecessary headers: The code includes unnecessary headers like `algorithm`, `bits/stdc++.h`, and `vector`. These headers are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Using `scanf` and `printf` for input/output: The code uses the `scanf` and `printf` functions for input and output. While these functions are efficient, they can be replaced with the more user-friendly `cin` and `cout` stream objects provided by the `iostream` header. This can improve code readability.

3. Using floating-point precision for an integer comparison: The code uses a `double` variable to store the value of pi (`pai`) even though the comparison is done between two integers (`a` and `b`). This unnecessary use of floating-point precision can be replaced with an integer constant for pi.

4. Redundant `else if` condition: The code uses an `else if` condition to check if `a` is less than `b`. However, this condition is not necessary as the `else` condition will execute if `a` is neither greater than nor equal to `b`. This can be simplified by using only an `else` condition.

To optimize the code, I will make the following changes step-by-step:

Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

Step 2: Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`:
```cpp
int main() {
  double pai = 3.141592653589;
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  if (a > b)
    cout << "a > b\n";
  else if (a < b)
    cout << "a < b\n";
  else
    cout << "a == b\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Step 3: Replace `pai` with an integer constant for pi:
```cpp
int main() {
  const int pi = 3;
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  if (a > b)
    cout << "a > b\n";
  else if (a < b)
    cout << "a < b\n";
  else
    cout << "a == b\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Step 4: Simplify the conditional statement:
```cpp
int main() {
  const int pi = 3;
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  if (a > b)
    cout << "a > b\n";
  else
    cout << "a < b or a == b\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  const int pi = 3;
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  if (a > b)
    std::cout << "a > b\n";
  else
    std::cout << "a < b or a == b\n";
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code reduces unnecessary header inclusions, simplifies the conditional statement, and improves code readability by using `cin` and `cout` for input/output.
