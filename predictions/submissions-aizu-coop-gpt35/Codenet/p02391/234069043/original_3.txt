The given code is a simple program that compares two integers and prints whether `a` is greater than, less than, or equal to `b`. The code seems to be straightforward and doesn't have any major performance issues. However, there are a few optimizations that can be made to improve efficiency:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes unnecessary header files such as `<algorithm>` and `<bits/stdc++.h>`. These can be removed as they are not being used in the code.

2. Avoid using `scanf` and `printf`: The `scanf` and `printf` functions are slower compared to the C++ input/output streams (`cin` and `cout`). It is recommended to use `cin` and `cout` instead for better performance.

3. Remove unused variable: The variable `pai` (should be `pi`) is declared but not used in the code. It can be removed to eliminate unnecessary memory usage.

4. Use a ternary operator: Instead of using multiple `if-else` statements, a ternary operator (`?:`) can be used to make the code more concise and potentially faster.

5. Add comments: It is important to add comments to the code to explain the purpose of each section and any optimizations made.

Here's the optimized code with the above changes implemented:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;

  // Compare a and b using ternary operator
  cout << (a > b ? "a > b" : (a < b ? "a < b" : "a == b")) << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations ensure that unnecessary code and headers are removed, and the code is simplified and more efficient overall.
