First, let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The code includes unnecessary headers that are not used in the program, such as `<algorithm>`, `<functional>`, `<list>`, `<map>`, `<numeric>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, and `<vector>`. These headers should be removed to reduce unnecessary compilation time and memory usage.

2. The code uses macros (`REP`, `rep`, `all`, `rall`, `foreach`) for loop iteration. While macros can improve code readability, they can also lead to code bloat and make it harder for the compiler to optimize the code. It's recommended to replace these macros with inline functions or templates to allow the compiler to perform better loop optimization.

3. The code uses a 3D array (`DP`) to store intermediate results. However, it's not clear how this array is used, and it seems to be unnecessary. Understanding its purpose and simplifying or removing it can potentially improve performance and reduce memory usage.

4. The code uses a priority queue to store states for the search algorithm. However, the comparison operator for the `state` struct is quite complex, which can lead to inefficient sorting and retrieval of elements from the priority queue. Simplifying the comparison operator or using a different data structure, such as a custom heap or a sorted vector, may improve performance.

5. The code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to compute distances between cells in the grid. However, the BFS is performed multiple times within the main loop, which can be inefficient. It would be more efficient to perform the BFS once and store the computed distances for later use.

6. The code uses a bitmask (`Sc`) to represent the state of the containers (`c`). However, this bitmask is not used consistently, and it's not clear how it affects the search algorithm. Simplifying or removing the bitmask may improve performance and readability.

7. The code uses a fixed-size array (`cx` and `cy`) to store the coordinates of the containers (`c`). However, the size of the array is hardcoded, which limits the program's flexibility. Using a container class, such as `std::vector`, can allow for a variable number of containers.

Based on these observations, let's formulate an optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary headers to reduce compilation time and memory usage.

2. Replace macros with inline functions or templates for loop iteration to allow better loop optimization.

3. Simplify or remove the `DP` array, as it is not clear how it is used and seems unnecessary.

4. Simplify the comparison operator for the `state` struct to improve sorting and retrieval from the priority queue.

5. Perform the BFS once and store the computed distances for later use.

6. Simplify or remove the `Sc` bitmask, as it is not used consistently and its purpose is unclear.

7. Replace the fixed-size arrays with container classes to allow for a variable number of containers.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization step and provide the optimized code.
