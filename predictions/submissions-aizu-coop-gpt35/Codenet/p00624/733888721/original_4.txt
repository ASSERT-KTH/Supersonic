Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a multi-dimensional array `field` to represent the game field, which is not efficient for storing and accessing data. Additionally, the use of multiple arrays (`wx`, `wy`, `cx`, `cy`) to store the positions of certain elements in the field can be improved.

2. Redundant computations: The code repeatedly computes the same values, such as the size of arrays and the indices of elements in the arrays. These computations can be avoided by storing the values in variables.

3. Inefficient loop structure: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the elements of the field. However, some of these loops can be optimized by using more efficient loop structures, such as `for` loops instead of `while` loops.

4. Unnecessary memory usage: The code uses a 8-dimensional array `DP` to store intermediate results. However, this array is not necessary and can be replaced with a more efficient data structure.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the multi-dimensional array `field` with a more efficient data structure, such as a `vector<vector<char>>`. This will improve memory usage and access times.

2. Replace the arrays `wx`, `wy`, `cx`, `cy` with a single data structure, such as a `vector<pair<char, char>>`, to store the positions of elements in the field. This will simplify the code and improve memory usage.

3. Store the sizes of arrays (`csize`, `wsize`) in variables instead of computing them repeatedly. This will avoid redundant computations.

4. Use `for` loops instead of `while` loops in the main loop structure. This will simplify the code and make it more efficient.

5. Replace the 8-dimensional array `DP` with a more efficient data structure, such as a `map`. This will reduce memory usage and improve access times.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code.
