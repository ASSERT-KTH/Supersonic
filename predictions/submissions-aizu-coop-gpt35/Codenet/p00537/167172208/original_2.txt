The given code implements a segment tree data structure and uses it to perform range updates and range queries. The segment tree is used to keep track of the number of updates in each segment of the input array. The goal is to optimize this code for efficiency.

1. Code Analysis:
   - The code uses a vector to represent the segment tree, which can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and cache locality.
   - The code calculates the size of the segment tree as a power of 2, which can be simplified by using the next power of 2 greater than or equal to the input size.
   - The code performs unnecessary calculations in the `Add` function. The `seg` and `add` arrays are updated recursively, which can be optimized to update them iteratively.
   - The `Query` function can be optimized by removing unnecessary conditions and calculations.
   - The code performs unnecessary calculations in the main loop, where the `used` variable is calculated in each iteration.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. Replace the vector with a dynamically allocated array to improve memory usage and cache locality.
   2. Calculate the size of the segment tree using the next power of 2 greater than or equal to the input size.
   3. Optimize the `Add` function by updating the `seg` and `add` arrays iteratively instead of recursively.
   4. Optimize the `Query` function by removing unnecessary conditions and calculations.
   5. Remove unnecessary calculations in the main loop by calculating the `used` variable once outside the loop.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. To replace the vector with a dynamically allocated array, we need to change the `seg` and `add` declarations. We can use the `new` operator to allocate memory for these arrays.
   2. To calculate the size of the segment tree, we can use the `__builtin_ceil` function to find the next power of 2 greater than or equal to `n`. We will also need to update the `sz` member variable accordingly.
   3. To optimize the `Add` function, we can replace the recursive calls with an iterative loop. We can use a stack to keep track of the intervals that need to be updated. Instead of updating the `seg` array during the recursive calls, we can update it after the loop.
   4. To optimize the `Query` function, we can remove the unnecessary conditions and calculations. We can simplify the function by using a single return statement.
   5. To remove unnecessary calculations in the main loop, we can calculate the `used` variable once outside the loop.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct SegmentTree {
  int *seg, *add;
  int sz;
  
  SegmentTree(int n) {
    sz = 1;
    while (sz < n)
      sz *= 2;
    seg = new int[sz * 2 + 1];
    add = new int[sz * 2 + 1];
    memset(seg, 0, sizeof(int) * (sz * 2 + 1));
    memset(add, 0, sizeof(int) * (sz * 2 + 1));
  }

  void Add(int a, int b, int x) {
    a += sz;
    b += sz;
    while (a < b) {
      if (a % 2 == 1) {
        add[a] += x;
        seg[a] += x;
        a++;
      }
      if (b % 2 == 1) {
        b--;
        add[b] += x;
        seg[b] += x;
      }
      a /= 2;
      b /= 2;
    }
  }

  int Query(int a, int b) {
    a += sz;
    b += sz;
    int res = 0;
    while (a < b) {
      if (a % 2 == 1) {
        res += seg[a] + add[a];
        a++;
      }
      if (b % 2 == 1) {
        b--;
        res += seg[b] + add[b];
      }
      a /= 2;
      b /= 2;
    }
    return res;
  }
};

int main() {
  int N, M, P[100000];
  scanf("%d %d", &N, &M);
  SegmentTree segtree(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &P[i]);
    --P[i];
  }
  for (int i = 1; i < M; i++) {
    int u = min(P[i - 1], P[i]), v = max(P[i - 1], P[i]);
    segtree.Add(u, v, 1);
  }
  long long ret = 0;
  int used = segtree.Query(0, 1);
  for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
    int A, B, C;
    scanf("%d %d %d", &A, &B, &C);
    ret += min((long long)used * A, (long long)C + used * B);
    used += segtree.Query(i + 1, i + 2);
  }
  cout << ret << endl;

  delete[] segtree.seg;
  delete[] segtree.add;
  return 0;
}
```

With these optimizations, the code should run more efficiently, with improved memory usage and reduced unnecessary calculations.
