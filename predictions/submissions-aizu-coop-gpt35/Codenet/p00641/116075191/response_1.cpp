The provided code appears to implement a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to calculate the number of paths in a graph. However, there are several potential areas for optimization.

1. Unnecessary Array Sizes:
   - The arrays `b` and `f` have a fixed size of `2` by `100100`, but the actual size used is determined by the value of `n`. This results in unnecessary memory allocation and can be optimized by dynamically allocating memory based on the value of `n`.

2. Redundant Memory Usage:
   - The `v` array is used to mark visited nodes in the graph. However, the `v` array can be replaced with a local boolean variable within the `dfs` function since it is not used outside of this function.

3. Inefficient Looping:
   - The loop within the `dfs` function iterates over both values of `i` (0 and 1) for each recursive call. However, the `return` statements within the loop will cause the function to exit after the first iteration. This loop can be simplified by removing it and replacing it with direct recursive calls for `i = 0` and `i = 1`.

4. Redundant Function Parameters:
   - The `num` parameter in the `dfs` function is unnecessary since it can be replaced with a local variable within the function.

5. Inefficient Modulus Operation:
   - The `ans` variable is updated using the modulus operator `% 10007` in each iteration of the loop. Instead of performing this operation repeatedly, it can be performed once at the end of the loop using the final value of `ans`.
