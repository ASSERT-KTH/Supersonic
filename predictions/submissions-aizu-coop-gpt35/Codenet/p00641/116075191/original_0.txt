Code Analysis:
The given code appears to be implementing a depth-first search algorithm to calculate the number of possible paths in a graph. The graph is represented by two arrays, `b` and `f`, where `b[i][j]` represents the next node from node `j` in the `i-th` direction, and `f[i][j]` represents the weight of the edge from node `j` to the next node in the `i-th` direction.

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage in the code include:
- Recalculating the maximum weight and the number of paths for each node in the graph, even if they have already been calculated.
- Using a recursive approach for the depth-first search, which can result in a large number of function calls and potential stack overflow for large graphs.
- Using an array `v` to mark visited nodes, which is not necessary since the graph is acyclic.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Eliminate redundant calculations of the maximum weight and the number of paths for each node.
2. Replace the recursive depth-first search with an iterative approach to avoid function call overhead.
3. Remove the unnecessary array `v`.
4. Use compiler optimizations to further improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. To eliminate redundant calculations, we will create two arrays, `maxWeight` and `numPaths`, to store the maximum weight and the number of paths for each node. Initialize both arrays to 0.
2. During the depth-first search, when visiting a node, check if the maximum weight and the number of paths have already been calculated. If so, skip the calculations and use the stored values.
3. Update the stored values for each node as they are visited and their maximum weight and number of paths are calculated.
4. Replace the recursive depth-first search with an iterative approach using a stack to avoid function call overhead.
5. Remove the unnecessary array `v` and the corresponding checks for visited nodes.
6. Use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization, to further improve performance. This can be achieved by enabling compiler optimizations or using pragma directives specific to the compiler being used.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

int n, b[2][100100], f[2][100100];
int maxWeight[100100];
int numPaths[100100];

int main() {
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> b[0][i] >> f[0][i] >> b[1][i] >> f[1][i];
      maxWeight[i] = 0;
      numPaths[i] = 0;
    }

    int ans = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (maxWeight[i] == 0 && numPaths[i] == 0) {
        stack<int> nodeStack;
        nodeStack.push(i);

        while (!nodeStack.empty()) {
          int node = nodeStack.top();
          nodeStack.pop();

          if (maxWeight[node] != 0 && numPaths[node] != 0) {
            ans = (ans * numPaths[node]) % 10007;
            continue;
          }

          maxWeight[node] = f[0][node];
          numPaths[node] = 1;

          for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
            int nextNode = b[j][node];
            if (nextNode == i) {
              ans = (ans * numPaths[node]) % 10007;
            } else if (maxWeight[nextNode] < f[j][node]) {
              maxWeight[nextNode] = f[j][node];
              numPaths[nextNode] = numPaths[node];
              nodeStack.push(nextNode);
            } else if (maxWeight[nextNode] == f[j][node]) {
              numPaths[nextNode] = (numPaths[nextNode] + numPaths[node]) % 10007;
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

In the optimized code:
- The arrays `maxWeight` and `numPaths` are introduced to store the maximum weight and the number of paths for each node. These arrays are initialized to 0 before processing the graph.
- The recursive depth-first search is replaced with an iterative approach using a stack. The stack is used to keep track of the nodes to be visited.
- The array `v` and the corresponding checks for visited nodes are removed, as they are no longer needed.
- The stored values of maximum weight and number of paths are checked before recalculating them for each node. If the values are already computed, they are used directly.
- The final answer is updated during the depth-first search loop itself, avoiding the need for a separate multiplication step.
- Compiler optimizations can be applied by enabling compiler optimizations or using specific pragma directives depending on the compiler being used.
