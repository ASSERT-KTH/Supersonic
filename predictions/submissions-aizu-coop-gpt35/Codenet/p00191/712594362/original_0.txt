After analyzing the given code, I have identified several areas that can be optimized to improve performance and reduce memory usage:

1. Redundant calculations: The current code recalculates the same values multiple times, leading to unnecessary computations. For example, the function `solve(times + 1, i)` is called multiple times with the same arguments. We can optimize this by storing the computed values in a temporary variable and reusing them.

2. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a 2D array `dp` to store the computed values. However, the array is initialized with -1 and only positive values are used. We can optimize this by using a 1D array instead, reducing memory usage.

3. Unnecessary type casting: The `fill` function is used to initialize the `dp` array with -1. However, the type casting `(double *)` is unnecessary and can be removed.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can suggest using compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. This can be done by enabling compiler flags like `-O3` or using pragmas to provide hints to the compiler for optimization.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and provide the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int n, m;
double dp[101];
double t[101][101];

double solve(int times, int prev) {
  if (dp[times] != -1)
    return dp[times];

  if (times == m)
    return dp[times] = 1;

  double tmp = -1;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    double val = (times == 0) ? 1 : t[prev][i];
    tmp = max(tmp, solve(times + 1, i) * val);
  }

  return dp[times] = tmp;
}

int main(void) {
  while (cin >> n >> m) {
    if (!(n | m))
      break;

    fill(dp, dp + 101, -1);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        cin >> t[i][j];
      }
    }

    double retd = solve(0, 0) * 100;
    printf("%.2lf\n", round(retd) / 100);
  }
}
```

In this optimized code, the changes made are as follows:

1. The `dp` array is changed to a 1D array `dp[101]` instead of a 2D array `dp[101][101]`. This reduces memory usage and improves cache efficiency.

2. The `fill` function is used without unnecessary type casting. The `dp` array is filled with -1 to indicate uninitialized values.

3. The redundant calculations in the `solve` function are eliminated by storing the computed values in a temporary variable `val` and reusing them.

4. No changes are made to the I/O operations and the output format remains the same.

By implementing these optimizations, the code should have improved running time and reduced memory usage.
