The given program appears to solve a problem using a dynamic programming approach. However, there are several areas where optimization can be applied to improve performance and reduce memory usage.

1. Use a more efficient data structure for the `dp` array:
   The `dp` array is currently implemented as a 2D array of doubles. However, since the array is only used to store values of either -1 or 1, it can be replaced with a 2D array of booleans. This change will reduce the memory usage by a factor of 8 and improve cache locality.

2. Avoid unnecessary floating-point calculations:
   The `solve` function currently performs unnecessary floating-point calculations when updating the `tmp` variable. Since the values being multiplied are either 1 or elements from the `t` array, the multiplication can be avoided and replaced with a simple assignment.

3. Remove unnecessary condition in the loop:
   The loop in the `solve` function has a condition `times == 0` that checks if it is the first iteration. However, this condition is not necessary as the loop will still work correctly without it. Removing this condition will simplify the code and potentially improve performance.

4. Use a more efficient loop structure:
   The loop in the `solve` function iterates over all possible values of `i` in each iteration. However, this can be optimized by using a more efficient loop structure such as a range-based loop or a loop that starts from the previous value of `prev`.

5. Use `memset` instead of `fill`:
   The `fill` function is used to initialize the `dp` array with -1. However, the `memset` function can be used instead, which is more efficient for initializing large arrays with a single value.

6. Use `scanf` instead of `cin`:
   The `cin` stream is used for input, but it is generally slower than the `scanf` function for reading large amounts of data. Changing the input reading code to use `scanf` can improve performance.
