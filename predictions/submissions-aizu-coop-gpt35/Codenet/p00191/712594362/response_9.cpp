The provided code calculates the maximum probability of a sequence of events occurring, given a transition matrix and the number of events. The code uses a recursive function `solve` to calculate the probability for each event.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage can be identified:

1. The use of `double` data type for the `dp` and `t` arrays: The code uses a 2D array `dp` of type `double` to store the calculated probabilities. However, the probabilities are always rounded to two decimal places before printing. Storing probabilities as `double` values is unnecessary and can result in inefficient memory usage.

2. Recursive function with overlapping subproblems: The `solve` function is called recursively for each event and previous event combination. However, the calculated probabilities are stored in the `dp` array to avoid redundant calculations. This indicates that there may be overlapping subproblems, which can be optimized using dynamic programming.

3. Redundant calculation of probabilities: The code currently calculates the probability for each event and previous event combination, even if the probability has already been calculated before. This results in redundant calculations and can be optimized.

4. Inefficient use of `fill` function: The `fill` function is used to initialize the `dp` array with -1. However, using `fill` on a 2D array of type `double` may not work as expected due to the way memory is laid out for multi-dimensional arrays.

To optimize the code, the following steps can be taken:

1. Change the data type of the `dp` array: Since the probabilities are rounded to two decimal places before printing, it is sufficient to store the probabilities as integers representing the number of hundredths. This will reduce memory usage and eliminate the need for rounding.

2. Use an iterative approach instead of recursion: Instead of using a recursive function, use an iterative approach to calculate the probabilities for each event. This will eliminate the overhead of function calls and improve performance.

3. Use a 1D array instead of a 2D array for `dp`: Since the probabilities for each event only depend on the probabilities of the previous event, a 1D array can be used to store the probabilities for the current event. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.

4. Calculate and store probabilities only once: Instead of recalculating the probabilities for each event and previous event combination, calculate and store the probabilities once in a 2D array. This will eliminate redundant calculations and improve performance.

5. Use a more efficient method to round the probabilities: Instead of using `round` and dividing by 100, multiply the probabilities by 100 and cast them to integers. This will eliminate the need for floating-point arithmetic and improve performance.
