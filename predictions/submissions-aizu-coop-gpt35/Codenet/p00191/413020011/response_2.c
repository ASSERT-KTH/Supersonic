Code Analysis:
- The code uses a recursive function `solve` to calculate the maximum product of probabilities.
- The code uses a 3D array `memo` for memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
- The main function reads input, initializes the `memo` array, and calls the `solve` function to calculate the result.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the use of `double` with `float`:
   - The code uses `double` data type for all variables and arrays. However, using `float` instead of `double` can significantly reduce memory usage. Since the problem statement does not specify the required precision, using `float` should be sufficient.
   - Trade-off: Reduced memory usage at the cost of slightly reduced precision.

2. Optimize the `solve` function:
   - The `solve` function uses recursion to calculate the maximum product of probabilities. This can be optimized by using dynamic programming.
   - Create a 2D array `dp` to store the intermediate results. The dimensions of `dp` will be `(m+1) x (n+1)`. Initialize all elements of `dp` to 0.
   - Use bottom-up dynamic programming to fill the `dp` array. For each `i` from 1 to `m` and each `j` from 0 to `n`, calculate `dp[i][j]` as the maximum product of probabilities using the formula: `dp[i][j] = MAX(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][k] * a[k][j])` where `k` ranges from 0 to `n`.
   - The final result will be the maximum value in the last row of `dp`.
   - Trade-off: Improved performance at the cost of increased code complexity.

3. Use `scanf` format specifier `%lf` for `float` input:
   - Currently, the code uses `%lf` format specifier for reading `double` values. Replace it with `%f` to correctly read `float` values.
