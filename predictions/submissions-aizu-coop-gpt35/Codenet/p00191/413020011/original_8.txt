The given code implements a recursive function `solve` that calculates the maximum product of probabilities by making a series of choices. The function uses a 3D memoization array `memo` to store previously calculated results and avoid redundant computations.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant Computations: The `solve` function is called multiple times with the same parameters. This leads to redundant computations and can be avoided by caching the results in the `memo` array.

2. Inefficient Data Structure: The `memo` array is of size 101x101x101, which is larger than necessary. We can optimize memory usage by reducing the size of this array.

3. Recursion: Recursive calls can be computationally expensive due to the function call overhead. We can potentially optimize the recursive calls by using a different approach, such as dynamic programming.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations and pragmas to provide hints to the compiler for optimizing the code.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization strategy step by step.
