The provided code is a C++ program that takes an input array `a`, an integer `n`, and an integer `l`. It creates an object of the `StaticRMQ` class and uses it to find the minimum value in each consecutive subarray of length `l` in `a`. The program then prints the minimum values separated by spaces.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Memory Allocation: The `StaticRMQ` class allocates several arrays using `calloc`. However, `calloc` is a relatively slow function for allocating memory. It would be more efficient to use `new` or `std::vector` for memory allocation.

2. Redundant Computations: The code contains a lot of redundant computations, such as repeatedly calculating the same values in loops. These calculations can be optimized to improve performance.

3. Loop Unrolling: The loops used to calculate the minimum values in each subarray can be unrolled to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.

4. Compiler Optimization: The code does not use any compiler optimizations. Enabling compiler optimizations can significantly improve the performance of the program.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace `calloc` with `new` or `std::vector` for memory allocation in the `StaticRMQ` class.

2. Avoid redundant computations by storing intermediate values in variables and reusing them where necessary.

3. Unroll the loops used to calculate the minimum values in each subarray.

4. Enable compiler optimizations using pragma directives.

Now, I will provide a step-by-step explanation of each optimization and present the optimized code.
