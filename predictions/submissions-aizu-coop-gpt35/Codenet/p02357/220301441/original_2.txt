The given program appears to be solving the Range Minimum Query (RMQ) problem using a static algorithm. The program reads an integer `n` and `l` from the user, followed by `n` integers into a vector `a`. It then constructs an instance of the `StaticRMQ` class using the vector `a`, and calculates the minimum value in each consecutive subarray of length `l` using the `operator()` function. Finally, it prints the results to the console.

Upon analysis, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Memory Allocation: The `StaticRMQ` class allocates several arrays dynamically using `calloc`. This can be time-consuming and memory-intensive, especially for large input sizes. Reallocating memory for each instance of the class can also lead to fragmentation.

2. Loop Iteration: The main loop in the `StaticRMQ` constructor iterates over the entire input array, performing several comparisons and assignments within each iteration. This can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and improve cache locality.

3. Bitwise Operations: The code extensively uses bitwise operations for bit manipulation, which can be hard to read and understand. These operations may also have a negative impact on code readability and maintainability.

4. Redundant Calculations: The `operator()` function calculates the same values repeatedly within each iteration of the loop, which can be avoided by storing the results in variables.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Memory Allocation: Replace the dynamic memory allocation with static arrays of appropriate sizes. This eliminates the need for memory management and reduces the memory overhead.

2. Loop Iteration: Optimize the main loop in the `StaticRMQ` constructor to reduce the number of iterations. This can be achieved by skipping unnecessary assignments and comparisons.

3. Bitwise Operations: Replace the bitwise operations with more readable and maintainable code. This improves code readability and reduces the chance of introducing bugs.

4. Redundant Calculations: Store the results of calculations in variables to avoid redundant computations within the loop.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step optimization of the given code.
