The given code is a C++ program that calculates the minimum value in a sliding window of size `l` for each possible window position in an array `a`. The program uses a class named `StaticRMQ` to efficiently answer range minimum queries for a fixed array.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage can be identified:

1. Memory allocation: The `StaticRMQ` class allocates memory for several arrays using `calloc()`. This can be inefficient, especially when the array size is large. Additionally, the memory allocated for these arrays is not freed.

2. Redundant computations: The code performs certain computations repeatedly that could be avoided to improve efficiency. For example, the code calculates the minimum value for each window position in a loop, but it doesn't take advantage of the fact that the minimum of the next window can be derived from the current window by removing the first element and adding the next element.

3. Inefficient data structures: The code uses arrays to store various data, such as the input array `a`, the bitmask arrays `R`, `L`, `part`, and the table for range minimum queries. Using more efficient data structures can improve both memory usage and performance.

To optimize the code, we can follow the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace `calloc()` with `std::vector` for memory allocation to improve memory management and reduce the chances of memory leaks.

2. Eliminate redundant computations by using a sliding window approach to calculate the minimum value for each window position.

3. Replace arrays with more efficient data structures, such as `std::vector` or `std::array`, where applicable.

4. Consider using compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler for potential optimizations.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail.

Step 1: Replace `calloc()` with `std::vector` for memory allocation.

In the `StaticRMQ` class, the following arrays are allocated using `calloc()`:

- `a` (input array)
- `R` (bitmask array)
- `L` (bitmask array)
- `part` (array)
- `table` (table for range minimum queries)

We can replace these arrays with `std::vector` to simplify memory management and ensure proper memory deallocation.

Step 2: Eliminate redundant computations using a sliding window approach.

Currently, the code calculates the minimum value for each window position in a loop. However, we can optimize this by using a sliding window approach.

To implement the sliding window approach, we can initialize the minimum value of the first window as the minimum of the first `l` elements. Then, for each subsequent window, we can remove the first element of the previous window and add the next element to calculate the minimum value efficiently.

Step 3: Replace arrays with more efficient data structures.

- Replace `a`, `R`, and `L` arrays with `std::vector` or `std::array`. This will improve memory usage and make the code more readable.

- Replace the `table` array with a 2D `std::vector` or `std::array` to store the table for range minimum queries. This change will improve memory usage and simplify indexing.

Step 4: Consider using compiler optimizations and pragma directives.

We can use compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler for potential optimizations. For example, we can use optimization flags (`-O2`, `-O3`) during compilation to enable compiler optimizations. Additionally, we can use pragma directives, such as `#pragma GCC optimize ("O3")`, to enable specific optimizations for certain code blocks.

Now, let's implement these optimization steps in the code block below.
