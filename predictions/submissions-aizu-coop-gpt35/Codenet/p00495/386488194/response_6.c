The given code seems to be solving a dynamic programming problem using a bottom-up approach. However, there are several areas where optimization can be applied to improve the efficiency of the code.

1. Unnecessary Memory Allocation:
   - The arrays `c` and `d` are allocated with a fixed size of 5004 elements. However, the values of `*c` and `i` are used to determine the actual size of these arrays. It is unnecessary to allocate memory for more elements than required.
   - To optimize memory usage, we can dynamically allocate memory for `c` and `d` based on the value of `*c` (the number of elements to be read).

2. Inefficient Loop:
   - In the first loop, the code uses a `scanf` statement inside the loop condition. This can lead to poor performance as it involves multiple function calls.
   - Instead, we can move the `scanf` statement outside the loop and use a separate variable to store the value of `++i + c` in each iteration.

3. Redundant Computation:
   - In the second loop, the code checks if `x - c[i]` is equal to zero in each iteration. This condition does not change within the loop, so it can be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant computation.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. For example, enabling compiler optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, and optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` can potentially yield performance improvements.
