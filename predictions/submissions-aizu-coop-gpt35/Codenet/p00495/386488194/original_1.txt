The given code appears to be solving a dynamic programming problem. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for improved performance and reduced memory usage. Let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization.

1. Inefficient data structures:
   - The arrays `c` and `d` have fixed sizes of 5004, which may be unnecessary for the given problem. We can potentially reduce their sizes to the maximum required by the input.
   - The variable `f` is used to store a format specifier string, but it is only used once. We can remove this variable and use the format specifier directly in the `scanf` and `printf` functions.

2. Redundant computations:
   - The loop `for (scanf("%d%*d", c); i < *c; scanf(f, ++i + c))` is used to read the input values into the array `c`, but it also increments `i` unnecessarily. We can simplify this loop and remove the unnecessary increment of `i`.

3. Loop optimizations:
   - The loop `for (u = i = t = 0; i++ < *c; t = d[i], d[i] = m < u ? m = u : u)` can be optimized to reduce the number of comparisons and assignments. The current logic can be simplified to calculate `m` and `d[i]` simultaneously.

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization and then provide the optimized code.
