The provided code appears to implement a data structure known as a Fenwick tree or Binary Indexed Tree (BIT). However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency.

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not necessary and can slow down the compilation process. Instead, include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`.

2. Replace `bool` data type with `int` for `op`: The variable `op` is used to store a boolean value, but it is more efficient to use an `int` data type. In C++, using a `bool` type can lead to slower performance due to memory alignment issues.

3. Optimize input/output operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output, respectively. These operations can be slow, especially when dealing with large input or output. To optimize this, you can use faster input/output methods such as `scanf` and `printf`.

4. Optimize loop iterations: The code uses a loop to iterate over the ranges `s` to `n` and `t+1` to `n` in the `else` block. However, this can be optimized by using the Fenwick tree's properties. Specifically, we can update the ranges `s` to `n` and `t+1` to `n` using a single loop. This eliminates the need for two separate loops and improves efficiency.

5. Optimize the calculation of the next index in the Fenwick tree: The code uses the expression `i += i & -i` to calculate the next index in the Fenwick tree. This expression can be optimized by using `i |= i + 1`. This optimization removes the need for a subtraction operation and improves efficiency.

6. Avoid unnecessary memory usage: The code uses an array `S` of size `maxn` to store the values in the Fenwick tree. However, the code only uses elements from index 1 to `n`. To optimize memory usage, we can reduce the size of `S` to `n+1` instead of `maxn`.
