This code appears to be implementing a Fenwick tree (also known as a Binary Indexed Tree) data structure to efficiently perform range updates and point queries on an array. However, there are several potential areas for optimization.

1. Unnecessary use of the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can increase compilation time and memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` for input/output operations.

2. Inefficient use of data types:
    - The `typedef long long ll;` is not necessary and can be replaced with `using ll = long long;` for improved readability.
    - The array `S[]` is declared as a global variable, which can lead to potential performance issues. It is better to declare it inside the `main()` function.

3. Redundant computation of the bitwise complement `-i & -i`:
    - The loop `for (int i = k; i > 0; i -= i & -i)` is used to iterate through the binary representation of `k` to calculate the prefix sum. However, the bitwise complement `-i & -i` can be precomputed outside the loop to improve efficiency.

4. Inefficient range updates:
    - The range update operation is performed using two separate loops, which can be combined into a single loop for better performance.
    - The second loop `for (int i = t + 1; i <= n; i += i & -i)` updates the elements from `t + 1` to `n` with a negative value. Instead of subtracting `x` from each element individually, we can subtract it once from the element at index `t + 1` and then add it once to the element at index `n + 1`.

5. Lack of comments: The code lacks comments explaining the purpose of each section and variable, making it difficult to understand its functionality. Adding comments will improve code readability and maintainability.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with optimizing the code step by step.
