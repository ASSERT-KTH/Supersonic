The given code appears to be implementing a Fenwick tree data structure. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance and memory usage. 

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This is a non-standard and non-portable include statement that includes many unnecessary headers. Instead, include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`, to reduce compilation time and improve code readability.

2. Avoid using global variables: The use of global variables (`S`, `n`, and `q`) can make the code harder to reason about and can lead to bugs. It is better to encapsulate them within a class or pass them as function arguments.

3. Remove unnecessary `typedef`: The `typedef long long ll` statement is not used in the code and can be removed.

4. Optimize input/output operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output, respectively. These operations can be slow, especially for large inputs. Consider using faster input/output functions, such as `scanf` and `printf`, to improve performance.

5. Avoid unnecessary computations: The code performs `i & -i` multiple times in both the `if` and `else` blocks. This computation can be moved outside the loops to avoid redundant calculations.

6. Optimize loop iterations: The loops in the `if` and `else` blocks can be optimized by using a range-based `for` loop instead of a traditional `for` loop. This can improve code readability and potentially lead to better compiler optimizations.

7. Optimize memory usage: The `S` array has a fixed size of `maxn`, which may be larger than necessary. Consider using a dynamically allocated array or a `std::vector` to reduce memory usage.

8. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: By default, the C++ standard streams are synchronized with the C standard streams, which can impact performance. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable this synchronization and potentially improve performance.
