The given code appears to implement a Fenwick tree or Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) data structure. However, there are several opportunities for optimization in terms of both time and space complexity.

1. Inefficient use of `std::cin` and `std::cout`: Reading input and printing output using `std::cin` and `std::cout` can be slow, especially for large inputs. It is better to use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, and use `std::cin.tie(NULL)` to untie `std::cin` from `std::cout` for better performance.

2. Unnecessary use of `std::bits/stdc++.h`: Including the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header can significantly increase compilation time and memory usage, as it includes all standard library headers. It is better to include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

3. Inefficient memory usage: The array `S` is declared with a fixed maximum size of `maxn`, which may be much larger than necessary. This leads to wastage of memory. We can optimize the memory usage by dynamically allocating memory for `S` based on the input value of `n`.

4. Redundant computation in the loop: The loop that calculates `ans` can be optimized by using the low bit trick. Instead of subtracting `i & -i` in each iteration, we can calculate it once outside the loop and subtract it in each iteration. This eliminates the need for repeated calculations.

5. Redundant loop for updating `S`: The two loops that update the values of `S` can be combined into a single loop to improve efficiency. This reduces the number of iterations and eliminates the need for two separate loops.

6. Compiler optimizations: We can suggest the compiler to optimize the code by using compiler-specific optimizations and pragma directives. For example, we can use `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")` to enable aggressive optimization with GCC.
