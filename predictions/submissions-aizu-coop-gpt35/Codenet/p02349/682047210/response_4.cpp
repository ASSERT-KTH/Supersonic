Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential optimizations:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of headers, which can slow down compilation and increase memory usage. We can replace it with specific headers that are actually required for the code, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Optimize data types: The code uses a `typedef` to define `long long` as `ll`. This can be replaced with the `int64_t` type from the `<cstdint>` header. Additionally, the `vector` and `Monoid` types can be configured to use `int64_t` instead of the default `int` to optimize memory usage.

3. Minimize unnecessary computations: The `init` function uses a bitwise shift operation to find the next power of 2, which can be optimized to use a logarithm operation. We can replace `while (N < sz) N <<= 1;` with `N = pow(2, ceil(log2(sz)));`.

4. Optimize the `build` function: The `build` function initializes all the leaf nodes in the segment tree, which can be optimized by directly assigning the values instead of using a loop. We can replace the loop with `std::copy(v.begin(), v.end(), node.begin() + N - 1);`.

5. Optimize the `add` function: The `add` function uses recursion, which can be slow for large ranges. We can optimize it by using an iterative approach instead. We can replace the recursive calls with a loop that iterates over the nodes in a bottom-up manner.

6. Optimize the `getSum` function: Similar to the `add` function, the `getSum` function also uses recursion. We can optimize it using an iterative approach, similar to the `add` function.

7. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: The `emplace_back` function can be used instead of `push_back` in the `build` function to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary copies.

8. Use range-based loops: The `for` loop in the `main` function can be optimized by using a range-based loop instead of a traditional `for` loop. This can improve readability and potentially optimize performance.
