The given code implements a lazy segment tree data structure and uses it to perform range updates and range queries on an array. However, there are several potential areas of improvement in terms of performance and memory usage:

1. Inefficient memory usage: The code uses a vector to store the segment tree nodes and another vector to store the lazy propagation values. This results in a significant amount of memory overhead, especially for large input sizes. Instead of using two separate vectors, we can use a single vector to store both the nodes and the lazy values, which will reduce memory usage.

2. Redundant computations: The `add` function currently computes the left and right child indices (`2 * k + 1` and `2 * k + 2`) multiple times in each recursive call. We can optimize this by computing the child indices once and storing them in variables before the recursive calls.

3. Compiler optimizations: We can suggest the compiler to optimize the code by using appropriate compiler optimizations and pragma directives. This can potentially improve the performance of the code without making any changes to the code itself.
