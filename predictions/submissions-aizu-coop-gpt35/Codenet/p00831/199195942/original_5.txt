The provided code calculates the Damerau-Levenshtein distance between pairs of strings in a given list and outputs the pairs whose distance is less than or equal to a given threshold. The code uses a nested loop to compare each pair of strings and calculate their distance using the `damerau_levenshtein_distance` function.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Reducing memory usage:
   - The `unordered_map` `da` is used to store the last occurrence index of each character in string `a`. However, since the alphabet size is fixed at 26, we can replace `unordered_map<int, int> da` with a simple array of size 26 to store the last occurrence index of each character. This will reduce memory usage and improve access time.

2. Improving the performance of the `damerau_levenshtein_distance` function:
   - The function uses a nested loop to calculate the distance between each pair of characters in strings `a` and `b`. However, we can optimize this by using a single loop and accessing the characters directly from the strings, instead of using indices.
   - Instead of using a nested `unordered_map` to store the distances, we can use a 2D array. This will improve memory access speed and reduce memory usage.

3. Reducing unnecessary computations:
   - The loop `for (int j = 1; j <= b.size(); ++j)` calculates `k` and `l` in each iteration, even though their values remain the same for each `i`. We can move the calculation of `k` and `l` outside the loop to avoid redundant computations.

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and inline functions, to improve the performance of the code.

Now let's go through the step-by-step explanation of each optimization and provide the optimized code.
