The given code is a C++ program that implements a max-heap data structure. The max-heap is used to maintain a collection of integers, with the ability to insert new integers and extract the maximum value from the heap.

Upon analyzing the code, here are some potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Avoid Dynamic Memory Allocation: The current implementation dynamically allocates an array of size 2,000,000 to store the heap elements. This can be a significant waste of memory if the number of elements in the heap is much smaller. Instead, we can use a dynamically resizing container like `std::vector` to avoid the need for pre-allocating a large array.

2. Use `std::make_heap`: The `max_heapify` function implements the logic to maintain the max-heap property. However, the C++ Standard Library already provides the `std::make_heap` algorithm that can be used to construct a max-heap from a range of elements. We can use this algorithm to simplify the code and potentially improve performance.

3. Avoid Repeated Calculations: The `max_heapify` function recalculates the indices of the parent and child nodes in each iteration of the while loop. These calculations can be moved outside the loop to avoid unnecessary repeated calculations.

4. Simplify Insertion Logic: The current insertion logic uses a while loop to find the correct position for the new element in the heap. However, we can simplify this logic using the `std::push_heap` algorithm, which efficiently inserts an element into a max-heap.

5. Improve Input Parsing: The current code reads input using `fgets` and then manually parses the inserted value from the input string. This can be simplified by using `cin` to directly read integers from the input stream.

6. Remove Unused Code: The `extract` function is not used in the main program, so it can be safely removed.

Let's now optimize the code step-by-step:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Heap {
public:
  void insert(int data) {
    array.push_back(data);
    std::push_heap(array.begin(), array.end());
  }

  int extract() {
    std::pop_heap(array.begin(), array.end());
    int ret = array.back();
    array.pop_back();
    return ret;
  }

private:
  std::vector<int> array;
};

int main() {
  int insert_data;
  char buf[22];
  Heap heap;

  while (true) {
    std::cin.getline(buf, 22);
    if (buf[2] == 'd')
      break;
    if (buf[0] == 'i') {
      insert_data = std::stoi(buf + 2);
      heap.insert(insert_data);
    } else {
      std::cout << heap.extract() << std::endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code:

1. We replaced the dynamically allocated array with a `std::vector<int>` named `array`. The vector will automatically resize as needed, reducing memory waste.

2. We used the `std::push_heap` algorithm to insert elements into the max-heap. This algorithm ensures the heap property is maintained efficiently.

3. We used the `std::pop_heap` algorithm to remove the maximum element from the heap. This algorithm moves the maximum element to the end of the range, allowing us to easily retrieve and remove it.

4. We replaced the input parsing logic with `std::cin` and `std::cout` for reading and printing integers, respectively. This simplifies the code and improves readability.

By making these optimizations, we have improved the memory usage by using a dynamically resizing container instead of a fixed-size array. We have also simplified the insertion and extraction logic using the Standard Library algorithms, potentially improving performance.
