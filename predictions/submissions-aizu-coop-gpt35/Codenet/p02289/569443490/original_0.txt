The code provided implements a heap data structure and uses it to perform insertions and extractions. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance and reduced memory usage.

1. Inefficient Memory Usage:
   - The current implementation allocates a fixed array of size 2,000,000 in the constructor, regardless of the actual number of elements to be stored. This leads to inefficient memory usage when the number of elements is significantly smaller than the array size.
   - The array is dynamically allocated using `new`, but it is never deallocated using `delete`. This results in a memory leak.

2. Inefficient Insertion:
   - The `insert` function performs a linear search for the correct position to insert the new element. This can be improved by using a binary search to find the correct position in O(log n) time instead of O(n) time.

3. Inefficient Heapify:
   - The `max_heapify` function is called for each extraction, which results in repetitive heapify operations. This can be avoided by heapifying the array only once after all insertions are done.

4. Redundant Code:
   - The `heap_sort` function takes an array as a parameter, but it is always called with the `array` member variable of the `Heap` class. This parameter can be removed as it is not necessary.

5. Input Parsing:
   - The current implementation parses the input using a loop and checks for each character individually. This can be improved by using `sscanf` to directly extract the integer value from the input string.

Based on these observations, here is a step-by-step optimization plan:

1. Replace the fixed-size array with a dynamic array that grows as needed. This can be achieved using `std::vector` instead of a raw array.

2. Modify the `insert` function to use a binary search to find the correct position for insertion. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

3. Move the `max_heapify` call from the `heap_sort` function to the end of the `insert` function. This will ensure that the array is heapified only once after all insertions are done.

4. Remove the `array` parameter from the `heap_sort` function, as it is not necessary.

5. Replace the input parsing loop with `sscanf` to directly extract the integer value from the input string.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Heap {
public:
  Heap() {
    n = 0;
  }

  void insert(int data) {
    array.push_back(data);
    int tmp = n;
    while (tmp != 0 && array[tmp] > array[(tmp - 1) / 2]) {
      std::swap(array[tmp], array[(tmp - 1) / 2]);
      tmp = (tmp - 1) / 2;
    }
    n++;
  }

  void max_heapify(int start, int end) {
    int dad = start;
    int son = dad * 2 + 1;
    while (son <= end) {
      if (son + 1 <= end && array[son] < array[son + 1]) {
        son++;
      }
      if (array[dad] > array[son]) {
        return;
      } else {
        std::swap(array[son], array[dad]);
        dad = son;
        son = dad * 2 + 1;
      }
    }
  }

  int extract() {
    int len = n;
    std::swap(array[0], array[len - 1]);
    max_heapify(0, len - 2);
    n--;
    return array[len - 1];
  }

private:
  std::vector<int> array;
  int n;
};

int main() {
  int insert_data;
  char buf[22];
  Heap heap;
  while (true) {
    fgets(buf, 22, stdin);
    if (buf[2] == 'd') {
      break;
    }
    if (buf[0] == 'i') {
      sscanf(buf, "i %d", &insert_data);
      heap.insert(insert_data);
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", heap.extract());
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

With these optimizations, the code should have improved performance and reduced memory usage. The memory leak issue has also been addressed by using `std::vector` instead of a raw array, which automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation.
