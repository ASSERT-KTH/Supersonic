**Code Analysis:**

Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage can be identified:

1. Memory Allocation: The `Heap` class allocates memory for the array dynamically using `new int[2000000]`. This fixed size allocation is not efficient as it reserves a large amount of memory even if the actual number of elements inserted is much smaller.

2. Insertion: The `insert` function performs a while loop to maintain the heap property by swapping elements. However, it can be optimized as the current implementation does unnecessary swaps when the inserted element is smaller than its parent.

3. Sorting: The `heap_sort` function is called for every extraction, which performs a complete heapify operation on the array. This operation can be optimized as the function only needs to fix the heap property for the root element.

4. Input Parsing: The input parsing logic in the main function is inefficient. It iterates over the buffer character by character to extract the integer value. This can be improved by using a more efficient method for parsing the integer.

**Optimization Strategy:**

Based on the analysis, the following optimization steps can be taken:

1. Use a dynamic data structure for the heap array to allocate memory only for the inserted elements.

2. Optimize the `insert` function to avoid unnecessary swaps and improve the insertion process.

3. Modify the `heap_sort` function to fix the heap property for the root element only, instead of performing a complete heapify operation.

4. Use a more efficient method for parsing the integer from the input buffer.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Replace the fixed-size array allocation in `Heap` class with a `std::vector<int>`. This will allow dynamic resizing of the array based on the number of elements inserted.

```cpp
#include <vector>
...
class Heap {
public:
  Heap() {
    n = 0;
  }
  void insert(int data) {
    array.push_back(data);
    int tmp = n;
    while (tmp != 0 && array[tmp] > array[(tmp - 1) / 2]) {
      std::swap(array[tmp], array[(tmp - 1) / 2]);
      tmp = (tmp - 1) / 2;
    }
    n++;
  }
  // Remove the private array member as it is now replaced by std::vector<int> array
  ...
private:
  std::vector<int> array;
  int n;
};
```

2. Optimize the `insert` function by avoiding unnecessary swaps and improving the insertion process. Instead of swapping elements multiple times, we can shift the elements up by using assignments.

```cpp
void insert(int data) {
  array.push_back(data);
  int tmp = n;
  while (tmp != 0 && array[tmp] > array[(tmp - 1) / 2]) {
    array[tmp] = array[(tmp - 1) / 2];
    tmp = (tmp - 1) / 2;
  }
  array[tmp] = data;
  n++;
}
```

3. Modify the `heap_sort` function to fix the heap property for the root element only, instead of performing a complete heapify operation. This can be done by shifting the last element to the root position and then fixing the heap property downwards.

```cpp
int heap_sort(int len) {
  int root = array[0];
  array[0] = array[len - 1];
  int dad = 0;
  int son = dad * 2 + 1;
  while (son < len - 1) {
    if (array[son] < array[son + 1])
      son++;
    if (array[dad] > array[son])
      break;
    std::swap(array[dad], array[son]);
    dad = son;
    son = dad * 2 + 1;
  }
  return root;
}
```

4. Use a more efficient method for parsing the integer from the input buffer. Instead of iterating over the buffer character by character, use `std::stoi` to directly parse the integer.

```cpp
while (true) {
  fgets(buf, 22, stdin);
  if (buf[2] == 'd')
    break;
  if (buf[0] == 'i') {
    insert_data = std::stoi(buf + 2);
    heap.insert(insert_data);
  } else {
    printf("%d\n", heap.extract());
  }
}
```

**Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>

class Heap {
public:
  Heap() {
    n = 0;
  }
  void insert(int data) {
    array.push_back(data);
    int tmp = n;
    while (tmp != 0 && array[tmp] > array[(tmp - 1) / 2]) {
      array[tmp] = array[(tmp - 1) / 2];
      tmp = (tmp - 1) / 2;
    }
    array[tmp] = data;
    n++;
  }
  int heap_sort(int len) {
    int root = array[0];
    array[0] = array[len - 1];
    int dad = 0;
    int son = dad * 2 + 1;
    while (son < len - 1) {
      if (array[son] < array[son + 1])
        son++;
      if (array[dad] > array[son])
        break;
      std::swap(array[dad], array[son]);
      dad = son;
      son = dad * 2 + 1;
    }
    return root;
  }
  int extract() {
    int ret = heap_sort(n);
    n--;
    return ret;
  }

private:
  std::vector<int> array;
  int n;
};

int main() {
  int insert_data;
  char buf[22];
  Heap heap;
  while (true) {
    fgets(buf, 22, stdin);
    if (buf[2] == 'd')
      break;
    if (buf[0] == 'i') {
      insert_data = std::stoi(buf + 2);
      heap.insert(insert_data);
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", heap.extract());
    }
  }
}
```

**Trade-offs:**

1. The optimized code uses a dynamic data structure (`std::vector`) for the heap array, which allows for efficient memory usage. However, it introduces some overhead due to dynamic memory allocations and resizing as elements are inserted. This overhead is typically negligible compared to the performance gain.

2. The optimized `insert` function avoids unnecessary swaps by shifting elements using assignments. This improves the insertion process but may slightly increase the code complexity compared to the original swap-based implementation. However, the overall performance gain outweighs this trade-off.

3. The optimized `heap_sort` function only fixes the heap property for the root element, resulting in a more efficient sorting process. However, this optimization sacrifices the ability to directly access the sorted elements in the array. If direct access to sorted elements is required, a complete heapify operation would be necessary.
