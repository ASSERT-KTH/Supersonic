The given code implements a priority queue using a max-heap data structure. The main operations supported are insertion and extraction of the maximum element from the heap. The code seems to be working correctly, but there are several areas where it can be optimized for efficiency. 

Let's analyze the code and propose optimizations step by step:

1. Remove unnecessary includes:
   The code includes the `<algorithm>`, `<cstdio>`, `<cstring>`, and `<iostream>` headers, but only uses the `swap` function from `<algorithm>`. We can remove the unused headers to reduce unnecessary overhead.

2. Avoid using the `using namespace std` directive:
   The `using namespace std` directive is generally considered bad practice as it pollutes the global namespace. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix to explicitly specify the namespace when using standard library functions and objects.

3. Use `std::vector` instead of a fixed-size array:
   The code uses a fixed-size array `A` with a maximum size of `MAX`. This fixed-size array is inefficient as it occupies memory even if the actual number of elements is much less than `MAX`. We can replace the array with a `std::vector<int>` to dynamically allocate memory as needed.

4. Use `std::push_heap` and `std::pop_heap` algorithms:
   The `maxHeap` function is used to maintain the max-heap property of the array. Instead of implementing this manually, we can use the `std::push_heap` and `std::pop_heap` algorithms provided by the `<algorithm>` header. This will simplify the code and improve its readability.

5. Use a binary shift to calculate `INFTY`:
   The code currently uses the expression `(1 << 30)` to calculate `INFTY`. This can be replaced with the more readable and efficient `INT_MAX` constant defined in the `<climits>` header.

6. Optimize the `increasekey` function:
   The `increasekey` function is used to increase the value of a key already present in the heap. The current implementation uses a loop to swap the key with its parent until the heap property is satisfied. This can be optimized by using a single loop with bitwise operations to find the parent index.

7. Avoid unnecessary assignments and comparisons:
   The code has a few unnecessary assignments and comparisons that can be removed to improve performance.
