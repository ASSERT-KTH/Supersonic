The given code implements a max-heap data structure and provides functions for inserting elements into the heap and extracting the maximum element. The code reads commands from the user, where 'i' denotes an insertion and 'e' denotes an extraction of the maximum element.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>` and `<cstdio>`. Since these headers are not used in the code, they can be removed.

2. Redundant macros: The code defines two macros, `MAX` and `INFTY`, but only `INFTY` is used in the code. The `MAX` macro is not used and can be removed.

3. Recursive maxHeap function: The `maxHeap` function is implemented recursively, which can lead to a large number of function calls for large heap sizes. This can be optimized by implementing the function iteratively.

4. Input/output operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, respectively. These operations can be slow compared to other input/output methods. Using a faster input/output method, such as `scanf` and `printf`, can improve performance.

To optimize the code, the following steps can be taken:

Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros:
- Remove the `#include <algorithm>` and `#include <cstdio>` lines.
- Remove the `#define MAX 2000000` line.

Step 2: Optimize the `maxHeap` function:
- Replace the recursive implementation of `maxHeap` with an iterative implementation.
- The iterative implementation can be achieved by using a loop instead of recursion.

Step 3: Optimize input/output operations:
- Replace `cin` with `scanf` for input operations.
- Replace `cout` with `printf` for output operations.

Here's the optimized code with the above changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define INFTY (1 << 30)

int H, A[2000001];

void maxHeap(int i) {
  int l, r, large;
  while (true) {
    l = 2 * i;
    r = 2 * i + 1;
    large = i;

    if (l <= H && A[l] > A[i]) {
      large = l;
    }
    if (r <= H && A[r] > A[large]) {
      large = r;
    }
    if (large == i) {
      break;
    }

    swap(A[large], A[i]);
    i = large;
  }
}

int extract() {
  int maxv;
  if (H < 1)
    return -INFTY;
  maxv = A[1];
  A[1] = A[H--];
  maxHeap(1);
  return maxv;
}

void increasekey(int i, int key) {
  if (key < A[i])
    return;
  A[i] = key;
  while (i > 1 && A[i / 2] < A[i]) {
    swap(A[i], A[i / 2]);
    i = i / 2;
  }
}

void insert(int key) {
  H++;
  A[H] = -INFTY;
  increasekey(H, key);
}

int main() {
  int key;
  char com[10];
  while (true) {
    scanf("%s", com);
    if (com[0] == 'e' && com[1] == 'n')
      break;
    if (com[0] == 'i') {
      scanf("%d", &key);
      insert(key);
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", extract());
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, the code will have improved performance and reduced memory usage.
