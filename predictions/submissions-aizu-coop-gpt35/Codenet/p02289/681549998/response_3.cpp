The given code implements a max heap data structure and provides operations to insert elements into the heap and extract the maximum element. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance:

1. Unnecessary Header Files: The code includes unnecessary header files such as `<algorithm>`, `<cstdio>`, and `<cstring>`. These headers are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Unnecessary `using namespace std`: The code uses the `using namespace std` directive which brings all names in the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and is generally considered bad practice. Instead, it is recommended to use the `std::` prefix for specific names from the `std` namespace.

3. Redundant Definitions: The code defines a constant `MAX` but never uses it in the code. This constant can be removed as it serves no purpose.

4. Inefficient Input Checking: The code checks for the command "en" to break out of the loop. However, this check can be optimized by comparing the first character of the command with 'e' and the second character with 'n' instead of comparing the entire string.

5. Inefficient Heapify Function: The `maxHeap` function uses recursion to heapify the elements, which can be inefficient for large heaps. This can be optimized by using an iterative approach instead of recursion.

6. Inefficient Extract Function: The `extract` function swaps the root element with the last element and then heapifies the heap. However, the heap is already heapified except for the root element. Instead of heapifying the entire heap again, we can simply heapify the root element.

7. Inefficient Increase Key Function: The `increasekey` function performs a series of swaps to move the element to its correct position in the heap. However, this can be optimized by repeatedly comparing the key with its parent and moving it up the heap in a single pass.

8. Unoptimized Memory Usage: The code uses an array `A` of size `MAX + 1`, which may be larger than necessary. We can optimize memory usage by dynamically allocating memory for the heap based on the number of elements inserted.

Based on the above analysis, the optimization strategy can be summarized as follows:

1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Remove the `using namespace std` directive.
3. Remove the `MAX` constant.
4. Optimize the input checking by comparing individual characters instead of the entire string.
5. Replace the recursive `maxHeap` function with an iterative approach.
6. Optimize the `extract` function to only heapify the root element.
7. Optimize the `increasekey` function to move the element up the heap in a single pass.
8. Dynamically allocate memory for the heap based on the number of elements inserted.
