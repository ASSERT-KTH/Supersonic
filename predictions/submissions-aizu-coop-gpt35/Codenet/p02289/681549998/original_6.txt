The provided code implements a max heap data structure. It reads commands from the user, where "insert" command inserts a key into the heap and "extract" command removes and returns the maximum key from the heap. 

Upon analysis of the code, the following potential optimizations can be proposed:

1. Avoid using the `namespace std` directive: The `using namespace std` directive brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can cause naming conflicts and make the code less readable. Instead, explicitly qualify the names from the `std` namespace using the `std::` prefix.

2. Use a fixed-size array instead of dynamic memory allocation: The code uses a dynamically allocated array `A` to store the heap elements. However, the maximum size of the array is fixed at `MAX + 1`. Instead of dynamically allocating memory, we can use a fixed-size array to eliminate the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

3. Optimize the `maxHeap` function: The `maxHeap` function is responsible for maintaining the max heap property after an element is removed from the heap. Currently, it uses recursive calls to find the largest child and swap it with the current element. This can be optimized by using a loop instead of recursion, which can reduce the function call overhead.

4. Use a more efficient method to read commands: The current implementation reads the command character by character, which can be inefficient. Instead, we can read the entire command as a string and use string comparison to determine the command type.

5. Replace the `INFTY` constant with numeric limits: The `INFTY` constant is used as a sentinel value to represent infinity. Instead of using a custom constant, we can use the `std::numeric_limits<int>::max()` function to get the maximum value representable by the `int` type.

Taking these optimizations into consideration, let's modify the code accordingly:
