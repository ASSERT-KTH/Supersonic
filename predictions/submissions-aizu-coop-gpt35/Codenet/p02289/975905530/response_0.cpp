The given code is a simple program that reads user input and performs operations on a priority queue. The program accepts two commands: "insert" followed by an integer to insert into the priority queue, and any other input to pop the top element from the priority queue and print it.

Upon analyzing the code, a few potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Removing unnecessary headers: The code includes headers that are not required for the functionality of the program, such as `<limits.h>`, `<queue>`, and `<vector>`. These headers can be removed to minimize compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Avoiding the use of `using namespace std;`: While using the `std` namespace can save some typing, it is generally considered bad practice to include the entire namespace. Instead, it is better to use the `std::` prefix for specific elements from the `std` namespace.

3. Improving input parsing: The current implementation reads input using the `>>` operator, which can be slow and inefficient for large inputs. An alternative approach is to use `getline()` to read the entire line and then parse it accordingly. This can improve performance, especially when the input is not in the expected format.

4. Avoiding unnecessary function calls: The `pop_and_print()` function is called for each input, even when the input is "end". This results in unnecessary function calls and can impact performance. Instead, the popping and printing logic can be moved directly into the `main()` function to avoid the overhead of function calls.

5. Avoiding unnecessary return statements: The `pop_and_print()` function has a return statement that is not used. Since the function is only called for its side effects (printing), the return statement can be removed.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove unnecessary headers (`<limits.h>`, `<queue>`, and `<vector>`).
2. Replace the `using namespace std;` directive with explicit `std::` prefixes.
3. Improve input parsing using `getline()` and parse the input accordingly.
4. Move the popping and printing logic directly into the `main()` function.
5. Remove the unnecessary return statement from the `pop_and_print()` function.
