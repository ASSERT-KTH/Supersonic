Analysis:

1. The code uses a priority_queue to store integers in descending order.
2. The main function reads inputs from the user until the user enters "end". If the input is "insert", it reads an integer and inserts it into the priority_queue. If the input is anything else, it calls the pop_and_print function to remove and print the top element of the priority_queue.
3. The pop_and_print function prints the top element and then removes it from the priority_queue.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the priority_queue with a vector and sort it in descending order.
2. Use a binary search to find the insertion position for new elements in the vector.
3. Modify the pop_and_print function to directly access and remove the top element from the vector.
4. Use a do-while loop instead of a while loop in the main function to avoid unnecessary checks.
5. Add compiler optimizations to improve code performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the priority_queue with a vector and sort it in descending order:
   - The priority_queue is not efficient in this case because every time an element is inserted, it requires the priority_queue to be sorted again. This can be avoided by using a vector and sorting it in descending order.
   - Replace the line `priority_queue<int> qu;` with `vector<int> qu;`.
   - After inserting elements into the vector, sort it in descending order using `sort(qu.begin(), qu.end(), greater<int>());`.

2. Use a binary search to find the insertion position for new elements in the vector:
   - Currently, new elements are inserted at the end of the vector and then sorted. This can be optimized by using a binary search to find the correct insertion position.
   - Modify the `else if (s == "insert")` block as follows:
     - Read the input integer `inp`.
     - Use the `lower_bound` function to find the position where `inp` should be inserted in the sorted vector.
     - Insert `inp` at the found position using the `insert` function.

3. Modify the pop_and_print function to directly access and remove the top element from the vector:
   - The current `pop_and_print` function uses `qu.top()` to access the top element and `qu.pop()` to remove it. However, these operations are not efficient for a vector.
   - Modify the `pop_and_print` function as follows:
     - Print the first element of the vector using `qu[0]`.
     - Remove the first element using `qu.erase(qu.begin())`.

4. Use a do-while loop instead of a while loop in the main function:
   - The current while loop checks the condition at the beginning, which is unnecessary. Using a do-while loop will avoid this unnecessary check.
   - Replace `while (1)` with `do { ... } while (s != "end");`.

5. Add compiler optimizations to improve code performance:
   - Add compiler optimizations to take advantage of the specific architecture and improve code performance. For example, use `-O3` optimization level with GCC or Clang.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int pop_and_print(vector<int>& qu) {
  cout << qu[0] << endl;
  qu.erase(qu.begin());
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  string s;
  int inp;
  vector<int> qu;

  do {
    cin >> s;

    if (s == "end") {
      break;
    } else if (s == "insert") {
      cin >> inp;
      auto it = lower_bound(qu.begin(), qu.end(), inp, greater<int>());
      qu.insert(it, inp);
    } else {
      pop_and_print(qu);
    }
  } while (s != "end");

  return 0;
}
```
