Analysis:
- The code uses a priority queue to store integers.
- The `pop_and_print` function pops the top element from the priority queue and prints it.
- The main function reads commands from the user and performs the corresponding operations on the priority queue.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid unnecessary function call overhead: The `pop_and_print` function is called for each "pop" command. Instead of calling a separate function for this, we can directly perform the pop operation in the main loop.

2. Avoid unnecessary copying: The `pop_and_print` function takes the priority queue by reference but does not modify it. We can change the function signature to take the priority queue by const reference to avoid unnecessary copying.

3. Improve input handling: The code currently uses string comparison to determine the command type. Instead, we can use a switch statement with integer constants to improve efficiency.

4. Minimize memory usage: Currently, the priority queue stores integers as objects. We can use a vector to store the integers and apply the `make_heap`, `push_heap`, and `pop_heap` algorithms to maintain the heap property.

Optimization strategy:
1. Remove the `pop_and_print` function and perform the pop operation directly in the main loop.
2. Change the function signature of `pop_and_print` to take the priority queue by const reference.
3. Replace the string comparison in the main loop with a switch statement using integer constants.
4. Replace the priority queue with a vector and use heap algorithms to maintain the heap property.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Remove the `pop_and_print` function and inline its logic directly into the main loop. This eliminates the function call overhead.

2. Change the function signature of `pop_and_print` to take the priority queue by const reference. This avoids unnecessary copying of the priority queue.

3. Replace the string comparison in the main loop with a switch statement using integer constants. This improves efficiency by avoiding string operations.

4. Replace the priority queue with a vector and use heap algorithms to maintain the heap property. This minimizes memory usage by storing only the integers in the vector.

Optimized code block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string s;
  int inp;
  vector<int> heap;
  make_heap(heap.begin(), heap.end());
  
  while (1) {
    cin >> s;
    if (s == "end") {
      break;
    } else {
      switch (s[0]) {
        case 'i':
          cin >> inp;
          heap.push_back(inp);
          push_heap(heap.begin(), heap.end());
          break;
        case 'p':
          cout << heap.front() << endl;
          pop_heap(heap.begin(), heap.end());
          heap.pop_back();
          break;
      }
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code eliminates unnecessary function calls, avoids copying of the priority queue, improves input handling efficiency, and minimizes memory usage by using a vector and heap algorithms.
