The provided code seems to implement a simple program that accepts inputs from the user and performs two operations: inserting a value into a priority queue and popping the top value from the queue.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified a few areas that can be optimized:

1. Avoiding unnecessary include directives: The code includes the `<limits.h>` header, which is not used in the program. This header can be removed to improve compilation time.

2. Reducing memory usage: The priority queue is implemented using the `std::priority_queue` container, which internally uses a heap. However, a heap-based priority queue requires additional memory for maintaining the heap property. Instead, we can use a simpler data structure like a sorted vector to achieve the same functionality with reduced memory usage.

3. Eliminating unnecessary function calls: The `pop_and_print` function is called for every operation, even when the operation is an insertion. This results in unnecessary function calls and can be avoided by moving the print statement directly inside the `main` function.

4. Avoiding unnecessary string comparisons: The code uses string comparisons to check for the "end" and "insert" operations. However, we can improve performance by using a more efficient data structure to map operations to their corresponding functions.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code.

Optimization strategy:
1. Remove the unnecessary include directive for `<limits.h>`.
2. Replace the priority queue container with a sorted vector to reduce memory usage.
3. Replace the string comparisons with a more efficient data structure, such as an `unordered_map`, to map operations to their corresponding functions.
4. Move the print statement directly inside the `main` function to avoid unnecessary function calls.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Step 1: Remove the unnecessary include directive for `<limits.h>`.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
```

Step 2: Replace the priority queue container with a sorted vector to reduce memory usage.
```cpp
vector<int> qu;
```

Step 3: Replace the string comparisons with an `unordered_map` to map operations to their corresponding functions.
```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
unordered_map<string, function<void()>> operations;
operations["insert"] = [&]() {
  cin >> inp;
  qu.insert(lower_bound(qu.begin(), qu.end(), inp), inp);
};
operations["pop"] = [&]() {
  if (!qu.empty()) {
    cout << qu.back() << endl;
    qu.pop_back();
  }
};
```

Step 4: Move the print statement directly inside the `main` function to avoid unnecessary function calls.
```cpp
while (1) {
  cin >> s;
  if (s == "end") {
    break;
  } else {
    operations[s]();
  }
}
```

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  vector<int> qu;
  unordered_map<string, function<void()>> operations;
  operations["insert"] = [&]() {
    int inp;
    cin >> inp;
    qu.insert(lower_bound(qu.begin(), qu.end(), inp), inp);
  };
  operations["pop"] = [&]() {
    if (!qu.empty()) {
      cout << qu.back() << endl;
      qu.pop_back();
    }
  };

  string s;
  while (cin >> s) {
    if (s == "end") {
      break;
    } else {
      operations[s]();
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code improves performance by using a sorted vector instead of a priority queue, avoiding unnecessary function calls, and using an `unordered_map` for efficient string-to-operation mapping. The code maintains the original functionality and produces the same output.
