The given code is a C++ program that solves a geometric problem. It uses various C++ features such as templates, operator overloading, and the Standard Template Library (STL). The program reads input data consisting of the number of shoolacks (geometric shapes), the number of sides of each shoolack, and the rotation amount between each side. It then calculates the minimum scaling factor that can be applied to the shoolacks such that they can be completely contained within a larger shape.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary header files. These should be removed to reduce compile time and unnecessary memory usage.
