The given code is a solution to a problem involving geometric calculations. It uses several data structures and functions from the `geom` namespace to perform these calculations.

To optimize this code for efficiency, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary header files that are not used in the code. Removing these includes can improve compile time.

2. Remove unused typedefs: The code defines several typedefs that are not used. Removing these typedefs can reduce code complexity.

3. Optimize the `operator<<` functions: The `operator<<` functions for printing vectors, sets, and pairs are defined using a generic template. However, these functions are not necessary for the optimization task and can be removed.

4. Optimize the
