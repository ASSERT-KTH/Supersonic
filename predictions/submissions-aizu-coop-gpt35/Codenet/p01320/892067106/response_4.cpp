The given code is a C++ program that solves a geometric optimization problem. The program reads input consisting of the number of objects, the number of sides in each object, and the number of steps to rotate the objects to form a polygon. It then calculates the minimum radius of a circle that can enclose all the objects after rotating them according to the given steps.

To optimize this code, we will focus on the following areas:

1. Reducing unnecessary includes: The code includes a large number of unnecessary header files. We will remove the unnecessary headers to improve compilation time.
