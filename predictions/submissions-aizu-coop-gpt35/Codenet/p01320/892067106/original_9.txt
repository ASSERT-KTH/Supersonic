The provided code is a solution to a problem that involves finding the smallest enclosing circle around a set of points. The current implementation uses a custom library for geometric calculations and relies on binary search to find the optimal radius of the circle. 

Upon initial analysis, the code seems to be well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, there are a few areas where we can optimize the code for better performance:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary header files that are not used in the program. Removing these includes will reduce the compilation time and improve the overall performance.

2. Remove unused typedefs: The code includes several typedefs that are not used in the program. Removing these typedefs will make the code cleaner and easier to read.

3. Simpl
