The given code calculates prime factors of numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. However, there are several areas where we can optimize the code for better performance:

1. Unnecessary headers: The code includes several unnecessary headers that are not used. These headers should be removed to reduce compilation time and memory usage.

2. Redundant typedefs: The code has multiple typedefs for the same data types. We can remove the redundant typedefs to simplify the code.

3. Unnecessary use of vectors: The code uses a vector to store the prime numbers, which is unnecessary. We can use a simple array instead, as we know the maximum size required.

4. Unnecessary use of a while loop: The code uses a while loop to continuously read input until the number 1 is entered. We can use a simple if statement instead, as we only need to check once.

5. Unnecessary use of range-based for loop: The code uses a range-based for loop to iterate over the prime numbers. We can use a regular for loop with an index, which may be more efficient.

6. Inefficient calculation of prime numbers: The code uses a brute force approach to calculate prime numbers, which is not efficient. We can optimize this by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers up to a certain limit.

7. Inefficient prime factor calculation: The code checks if each prime number is a factor of the input number. This can be optimized by checking only up to the square root of the input number.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of the proposed optimizations.
