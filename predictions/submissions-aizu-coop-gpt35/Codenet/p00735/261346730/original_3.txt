Based on a preliminary analysis of the code, here are some potential areas for optimization:

1. Data structure: The `vector<int> lists` is used to store prime numbers. However, it can be improved by using a `bitset` instead. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache performance.

2. Loop optimization: The loop that marks multiples of prime numbers can be optimized by incrementing `i` by `p` instead of `k`. This eliminates the need for the `k` variable and reduces the number of iterations.

3. Input/output optimization: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, respectively. These operations can be slow, especially when there are a large number of inputs. Using `scanf` and `printf` from the C standard library can improve performance.

4. Compiler optimizations: The code can be compiled with optimization flags to enable specific optimizations. For example, the `-O3` flag can be used to enable aggressive optimization by the compiler.

Let's implement these optimizations step by step:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 300000;

int main() {
    bitset<MAXN + 1> checked;
    vector<int> lists;
    for (int i = 2; i <= MAXN; ++i) {
        if (checked[i])
            continue;
        if (i % 7 == 1 || i % 7 == 6) {
            lists.push_back(i);
            for (int j = i; j <= MAXN; j += i) {
                checked.set(j);
            }
        }
    }
    while (true) {
        int n;
        scanf("%d", &n);
        if (n == 1)
            break;
        vector<int> ans;
        for (auto p : lists) {
            if (n % p == 0) {
                ans.push_back(p);
            }
        }
        printf("%d:", n);
        for (int i = 0; i < ans.size(); ++i) {
            printf(" %d", ans[i]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Data structure: Replaced `vector<int> lists` with `bitset<MAXN + 1> checked` to mark prime numbers. This reduces memory usage and improves cache performance.

2. Loop optimization: Changed the loop that marks multiples of prime numbers to increment `j` by `i` instead of using a separate variable `k`. This eliminates the need for the `k` variable and reduces the number of iterations.

3. Input/output optimization: Replaced `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations, respectively. These functions are generally faster than their C++ counterparts.

4. Compiler optimizations: No specific compiler optimizations are applied in the code, but it is suggested to compile the code with optimization flags, such as `-O3`, to enable aggressive optimization by the compiler. This can further improve performance.

Trade-offs:

1. The use of `bitset` instead of `vector` for marking prime numbers improves memory usage and cache performance but requires a fixed maximum size. If the maximum size is not known in advance, a different data structure may be required.

2. Using `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout` can make the code less readable and more error-prone due to the format specifiers. However, it provides a significant performance improvement, especially for large input/output operations.

Overall, these optimizations aim to reduce memory usage, improve cache performance, and minimize input/output overhead.
