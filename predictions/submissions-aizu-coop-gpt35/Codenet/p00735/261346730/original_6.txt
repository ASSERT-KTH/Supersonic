Code Analysis:
1. The code includes a large number of unnecessary header files, such as `<algorithm>`, `<array>`, `<bitset>`, etc. These header files are not used in the code and can be removed.
2. The code defines a large number of type aliases (`typedef`) that are not used in the code. These can also be removed.
3. The code uses a `vector<int>` named `lists` to store prime numbers. However, it is not necessary to store all prime numbers up to 300,000. We can optimize the code to only check for prime factors of the input number `n`.
4. The code uses a boolean array `checked` to mark non-prime numbers. However, since the array is initialized to `false` by default, we can remove the explicit initialization.
5. The code checks if `n == 1` inside the while loop. This check can be moved outside the loop to improve efficiency.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Remove unused type aliases.
3. Optimize the prime number generation by checking for prime factors of `n` instead of storing all prime numbers up to 300,000.
4. Move the `n == 1` check outside the while loop.
5. Consider using compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization, to further improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the `#include` statements for header files that are not used in the code. This reduces unnecessary compilation time and memory usage.
2. Remove unused type aliases: Remove the `typedef` statements for type aliases that are not used in the code. This simplifies the code and reduces memory usage.
3. Optimize prime number generation: Instead of storing all prime numbers up to 300,000 in the `lists` vector, we can optimize the code to only check for prime factors of the input number `n`. This reduces memory usage and improves efficiency.
4. Move `n == 1` check outside the while loop: Instead of checking for `n == 1` inside the while loop, we can move this check outside the loop. This eliminates the need to perform unnecessary computations and improves efficiency.
5. Consider compiler optimizations: Depending on the compiler being used, consider enabling compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization, to further improve performance. This can be done using compiler-specific pragmas or command-line options.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cin.tie(0);
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    
    while (true) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        if (n == 1)
            break;

        vector<int> ans;
        for (int p = 2; p * p <= n; p++) {
            while (n % p == 0) {
                ans.push_back(p);
                n /= p;
            }
        }
        if (n > 1)
            ans.push_back(n);

        cout << n << ':';
        for (int i = 0; i < ans.size(); i++) {
            cout << " " << ans[i];
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```

In the optimized code:
1. Unnecessary header files have been removed to reduce memory usage and compilation time.
2. Unused type aliases have been removed to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.
3. The prime number generation has been optimized to only check for prime factors of the input number `n`. This reduces memory usage and improves efficiency.
4. The `n == 1` check has been moved outside the while loop to avoid unnecessary computations.
5. Compiler optimizations have not been explicitly added in the code. However, depending on the compiler being used, consider enabling compiler optimizations to further improve performance.
