The given code appears to be a program that calculates the prime factors of a given number. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized to improve its performance and memory usage.

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes several unnecessary header files that are not used in the program. These can be removed to reduce the compilation time and improve code readability.

2. Simplify the variable types: The code uses various typedefs to define variable types such as `ll`, `pll`, `vi`, etc. These typedefs add unnecessary complexity to the code and can be replaced with simpler variable types (`long long`, `pair<int, int>`, `vector<int>`, etc.).

3. Use a more efficient data structure for the checked array: The checked array is currently implemented as a boolean array with a fixed size of 300,000 + 1. This array can be replaced with a more memory-efficient data structure, such as a bitset, to reduce memory usage.

4. Use a more efficient loop for marking multiples of primes: The current code uses a while loop to mark multiples of a prime number as checked. This can be optimized by using a for loop and incrementing the loop variable by the prime number itself.

5. Optimize the prime factor calculation loop: The current code uses a for-each loop to iterate over the prime numbers and check if the given number is divisible by each prime number. This can be optimized by using a for loop with an index variable and direct access to the prime numbers, which will eliminate the overhead of iterating over the vector.

6. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The current code checks if the given number is divisible by each prime number, even if the number is already known to be divisible by a smaller prime number. This can be optimized by breaking out of the loop as soon as a smaller prime divisor is found.

7. Use a more efficient output method: The current code outputs the prime factors using multiple cout statements. This can be optimized by storing the prime factors in a string and then outputting the string all at once.

Based on these observations, the following is an optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cin.tie(0);
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    
    vector<int> lists;
    bitset<300001> checked;
    
    for (int i = 2; i <= 300000; i++) {
        if (checked[i])
            continue;
        if (i % 7 == 1 || i % 7 == 6) {
            lists.push_back(i);
            for (int k = i; k <= 300000; k += i) {
                checked[k] = true;
            }
        }
    }
    
    while (true) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        if (n == 1)
            break;
        
        string ans;
        for (int i = 0; i < lists.size(); i++) {
            if (n % lists[i] == 0) {
                ans += " " + to_string(lists[i]);
                while (n % lists[i] == 0) {
                    n /= lists[i];
                }
            }
        }
        
        cout << n << ":" << ans << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces unnecessary complexity and improves performance by using a more memory-efficient data structure, optimizing loops, avoiding redundant calculations, and optimizing the output method.
