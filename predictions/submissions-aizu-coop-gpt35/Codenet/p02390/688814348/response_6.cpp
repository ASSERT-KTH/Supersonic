The given code takes an input in seconds and converts it into hours, minutes, and seconds format. 

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Eliminate unnecessary operations: The code currently performs two modulo operations to calculate minutes and seconds. We can combine these operations into a single step by using integer division. Instead of `(S % 3600) / 60`, we can use `S / 60`.

2. Optimize input/output operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations respectively. These operations are comparatively slower than their counterparts `scanf` and `printf`. By using `scanf` and `printf`, we can optimize the input/output operations.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std`: It is generally considered a good practice to avoid using the entire `std` namespace. Instead, we can explicitly use the required identifiers like `std::cin` and `std::cout`.
