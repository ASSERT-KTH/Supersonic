The provided code is a simple program that takes an input integer representing the number of seconds `S`, and converts it into hours, minutes, and seconds format (HH:MM:SS). 

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoiding unnecessary modulo operations.
2. Eliminating redundant calculations.
3. Ensuring efficient memory usage.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization strategy step-by-step.

Step 1: Avoid Unnecessary Modulo Operations
------------------------------------------
The code currently performs two modulo operations to calculate the minutes and seconds separately. We can optimize this by calculating both the minutes and seconds in a single operation.

Step 2: Eliminate Redundant Calculations
---------------------------------------
The current code calculates the number of hours, minutes, and seconds by performing multiple division and modulo operations. We can optimize this by performing the calculation in a single pass.

Step 3: Efficient Memory Usage
-----------------------------
The current code uses a single integer variable `S` to store the number of seconds. Since this is the only input required and the output can be directly printed, we can avoid the need for any additional memory.

Now, let's implement these optimizations and update the code accordingly.
