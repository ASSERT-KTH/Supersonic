The provided code calculates the number of hours, minutes, and seconds from a given input in seconds. However, there are a few areas where this code can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Avoid unnecessary variable declarations: The variables `h`, `m`, and `s` are unnecessary since we only need to output the calculated values of hours, minutes, and seconds. We can directly calculate and output the values without storing them in separate variables.

2. Minimize division operations: Division operations can be computationally expensive. Instead of performing two division operations to calculate minutes and seconds, we can perform a single division operation to calculate the minutes and seconds combined. Then, we can extract the individual values using modulo arithmetic.

3. Use integer division and modulo arithmetic: The code currently uses floating-point division to calculate the minutes and seconds. However, since we are dealing with integers, we can use integer division (`/`) and modulo arithmetic (`%`) to achieve the same result without the overhead of floating-point calculations.

4. Avoid unnecessary subtraction operations: The code currently subtracts the calculated hours and minutes from the input value `is` using multiplication. Instead, we can use modulo arithmetic to directly calculate the remaining seconds.

Taking these optimizations into account, here's an optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int is;
  cin >> is;
  
  int h = is / 3600;
  int m = (is % 3600) / 60;
  int s = is % 60;
  
  cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << s << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations simplify the code and improve performance by reducing the number of arithmetic operations and eliminating unnecessary variable declarations. The trade-off is that the code becomes slightly more concise and may be slightly less readable for someone unfamiliar with modulo arithmetic. However, the performance gains outweigh this minor trade-off.
