The given code takes an input in seconds and converts it to hours, minutes, and seconds format. While the code is correct and functional, there are a few areas that can be optimized for performance and memory usage.

1. Avoiding the `using namespace std;` directive: It is generally considered a good practice to avoid using the entire `std` namespace. Instead, only use the specific elements from the namespace that are needed. This helps prevent potential naming conflicts and makes the code more readable.

2. Minimizing variable usage: The code uses four variables: `is` for the input seconds, and `h`, `m`, and `s` for the hours, minutes, and seconds respectively. However, since the code only needs to print the hours, minutes, and seconds, there is no need to store the intermediate values in separate variables. We can directly print the values without storing them.

3. Removing unnecessary subtraction: The code subtracts the product of `h * 3600` from `is` to get the remaining seconds. Similarly, it subtracts the product of `m * 60` from `is` to get the remaining seconds again. This is redundant and can be avoided.

4. Improving input handling: The code assumes that the input will always be in seconds. However, it is a good practice to validate the input and handle any invalid inputs gracefully. We can add input validation to ensure that only positive integers are accepted as input.

Taking these optimization steps into consideration, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int seconds;
    std::cout << "Enter the number of seconds: ";
    std::cin >> seconds;

    if (seconds < 0) {
        std::cout << "Invalid input! Please enter a positive integer." << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }

    int hours = seconds / 3600;
    seconds %= 3600;

    int minutes = seconds / 60;
    seconds %= 60;

    std::cout << hours << ":" << minutes << ":" << seconds << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have reduced the number of variables used and removed the redundant subtraction operations. We have also added input validation to handle invalid inputs. These changes improve both the performance and memory usage of the program.
