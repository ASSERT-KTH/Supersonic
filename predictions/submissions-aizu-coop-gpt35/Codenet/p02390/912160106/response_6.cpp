The provided code is a simple program that takes an input in seconds and converts it into hours, minutes, and seconds. The program then outputs the converted time in the format "hours:minutes:seconds". 

Upon analysis, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization in this code:

1. Redundant variable creation: The variable `is` is used to store the input value and is then modified and used to store intermediate values. This can be improved by reusing the same variable for all operations.

2. Redundant calculations: The code repeatedly calculates `h * 3600` and `m * 60` to subtract from the `is` variable. These calculations can be avoided by using the modulo operator `%` instead.

With these optimizations in mind, I will now outline the step-by-step approach to optimize the code:

1. Remove the `using namespace std;` directive as it is considered a bad practice.

2. Remove the declaration of `is` and declare variables `h`, `m`, and `s` directly.

3. Read the input directly into the `h` variable.

4. Calculate the minutes and seconds using the modulo operator `%` and division operator `/`.

5. Output the converted time in the desired format.
