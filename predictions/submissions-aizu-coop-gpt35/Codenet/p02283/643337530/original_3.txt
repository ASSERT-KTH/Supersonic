Code Analysis:

1. The code uses a binary search tree (BST) to store and retrieve integers.
2. The BST is implemented using a linked data structure, where each node has a key value, left and right child pointers, and a parent pointer.
3. The code includes two functions, `insert` and `print`, to insert new nodes into the BST and print the keys in inorder and preorder traversal, respectively.
4. The code reads input commands from the user, where the command "insert" is followed by an integer to be inserted into the BST, and the command "print" prints the keys in the BST.

Potential Improvements:

1. Memory Allocation: The code currently uses `malloc` to allocate memory for each new node. Instead, we can use `new Node` to allocate memory, which is the recommended way in C++.
2. Input/Output: The code uses `printf` and `scanf` for input/output. These functions have overhead and are slower compared to C++'s `cout` and `cin` respectively. We can switch to `cout` and `cin` for faster I/O.
3. Unnecessary Include: The code includes the `<string>` library, but it is not used. We can remove this unnecessary include statement.
4. Avoiding Namespace: The code uses `using namespace std;`, which is generally considered bad practice. We can avoid using the namespace and explicitly use `std::` prefix where necessary.
5. Redundant Declarations: The code declares a variable `Node *z` before the while loop in the `insert` function, but it is only assigned a value inside the loop. We can move this declaration inside the loop to improve readability.
6. NIL Node: The code uses a `NIL` node to represent the empty child of a leaf node. We can use a null pointer instead of a special `NIL` node to simplify the code.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace `malloc` with `new Node` for memory allocation.
2. Replace `printf` and `scanf` with `cout` and `cin` for input/output.
3. Remove the unnecessary `<string>` include statement.
4. Avoid using the namespace and explicitly use `std::` prefix where necessary.
5. Move the declaration of `Node *z` inside the while loop in the `insert` function.
6. Replace the `NIL` node with a null pointer to represent the empty child of a leaf node.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace `malloc` with `new Node`:
   - In the `insert` function, replace the line `z = (Node *)malloc(sizeof(Node));` with `z = new Node;`.
   - This change ensures that memory allocation is done using the C++ `new` operator, which is recommended over `malloc` in C++.

2. Replace `printf` and `scanf` with `cout` and `cin`:
   - In the `inorder` and `preorder` functions, replace `printf` with `cout` and `scanf` with `cin`.
   - In the `main` function, replace `printf` with `cout` and `scanf` with `cin`.
   - This change improves the input/output performance by using C++'s `cout` and `cin` instead of C's `printf` and `scanf`.

3. Remove the unnecessary `<string>` include statement:
   - Remove the line `#include <string>` as it is not used in the code.

4. Avoid using the namespace and explicitly use `std::` prefix:
   - Remove the line `using namespace std;` and replace `cin`, `cout`, and `endl` with `std::cin`, `std::cout`, and `std::endl` respectively.
   - This change avoids potential naming conflicts and makes the code more readable.

5. Move the declaration of `Node *z` inside the while loop in the `insert` function:
   - Move the line `Node *z;` inside the while loop, just before the line `z = new Node;`.
   - This change improves code readability by declaring `z` closer to its usage and avoids unnecessary declarations outside the loop.

6. Replace the `NIL` node with a null pointer:
   - Remove the global declaration of `NIL` and replace all occurrences of `NIL` with `nullptr`.
   - This change simplifies the code by using a null pointer to represent the empty child of a leaf node.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Node {
  int key;
  Node *right, *left, *parent;
};

Node *root = nullptr;

void insert(int k) {
  Node *y = nullptr;
  Node *x = root;
  Node *z;

  while (x != nullptr) {
    y = x;
    if (k < x->key) {
      x = x->left;
    } else {
      x = x->right;
    }
  }

  z = new Node;
  z->key = k;
  z->left = nullptr;
  z->right = nullptr;
  z->parent = y;

  if (y == nullptr) {
    root = z;
  } else {
    if (k < y->key) {
      y->left = z;
    } else {
      y->right = z;
    }
  }
}

void inorder(Node *u) {
  if (u == nullptr)
    return;
  inorder(u->left);
  std::cout << " " << u->key;
  inorder(u->right);
}

void preorder(Node *u) {
  if (u == nullptr)
    return;
  std::cout << " " << u->key;
  preorder(u->left);
  preorder(u->right);
}

int main() {
  int n, i, x;
  std::string com;
  std::cin >> n;

  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> com;
    if (com == "insert") {
      std::cin >> x;
      insert(x);
    } else if (com == "print") {
      inorder(root);
      std::cout << std::endl;
      preorder(root);
      std::cout << std::endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code retains the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance by using C++ features and removing unnecessary code.
