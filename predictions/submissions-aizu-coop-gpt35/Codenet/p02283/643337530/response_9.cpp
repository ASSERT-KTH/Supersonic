This code is an implementation of a binary search tree (BST). The main function reads a series of commands from input and performs either an "insert" or "print" operation. The "insert" operation inserts a key into the BST, and the "print" operation prints the keys in the BST in both inorder and preorder traversal orders.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several areas for optimization:

1. Memory Allocation: The code uses dynamic memory allocation for each node using `malloc`. This can be optimized by using `new` instead, which is more efficient in terms of memory allocation and deallocation.

2. Input/Output: The code uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output, respectively. These functions can be replaced with `cin` and `cout` from the `<iostream>` library. The `cin` and `cout` functions are generally faster and more efficient for input and output operations.

3. Memory Usage: The `Node` struct contains a pointer for both the parent and the NIL node. However, the NIL node is the same for all nodes and can be shared. This can reduce memory usage and improve cache efficiency.

4. Optimization Flags: We can enable compiler optimizations by adding compiler flags. For example, using the `-O2` flag for GCC or Clang will enable level 2 of optimization, which can significantly improve the performance of the code.
