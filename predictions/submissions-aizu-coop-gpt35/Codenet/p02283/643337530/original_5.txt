Code Analysis:
1. The code uses a struct called Node to represent each node in a binary search tree.
2. The insert function is used to insert a new node into the binary search tree.
3. The inorder and preorder functions are used to print the nodes of the binary search tree in inorder and preorder traversal, respectively.
4. The main function reads input commands from the user and performs the corresponding operations on the binary search tree.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the usage of `malloc` with `new` operator for memory allocation.
2. Remove the unnecessary `string` header, as it is not used in the code.
3. Use `std::cout` instead of `printf` for output, as it is more efficient.
4. Pass the `Node` pointers by reference instead of by value in the `inorder` and `preorder` functions, to avoid unnecessary copying.
5. Use `std::cin` instead of `scanf` for input, as it is more efficient.
6. Replace the usage of `scanf` with `std::cin` for reading integers.
7. Remove the unused variable `x` in the main function.
8. Add a constructor to the `Node` struct to initialize the pointers to `NIL`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the usage of `malloc` with `new` operator for memory allocation:
   - Instead of `z = (Node *)malloc(sizeof(Node))`, use `z = new Node()`.
   - This change ensures that the memory allocation and deallocation are done correctly and consistently, using C++ memory management.
   - It also allows us to use the constructor for the `Node` struct to initialize the pointers to `NIL`.

2. Remove the unnecessary `string` header:
   - Since the code does not use any features from the `string` header, it can be safely removed.

3. Use `std::cout` instead of `printf` for output:
   - Replace `printf(" %d", u->key)` with `std::cout << " " << u->key`.
   - This change uses the more efficient C++ output stream instead of the C-style `printf` function for printing.

4. Pass the `Node` pointers by reference instead of by value:
   - Change the function signatures of `inorder` and `preorder` to accept `Node*&` instead of `Node*`.
   - This change ensures that the actual pointer is modified in the function, rather than creating a copy of the pointer.
   - It avoids unnecessary copying and improves performance.

5. Use `std::cin` instead of `scanf` for input:
   - Replace `scanf("%d", &n)` with `std::cin >> n`.
   - This change uses the more efficient C++ input stream instead of the C-style `scanf` function for reading integers.

6. Replace the usage of `scanf` with `std::cin` for reading integers:
   - Replace `scanf("%d", &x)` with `std::cin >> x`.
   - This change uses the more efficient C++ input stream instead of the C-style `scanf` function for reading integers.

7. Remove the unused variable `x` in the main function:
   - Since the variable `x` is not used, it can be safely removed from the code.

8. Add a constructor to the `Node` struct to initialize the pointers to `NIL`:
   - Add a constructor to the `Node` struct that initializes the `left`, `right`, and `parent` pointers to `NIL`.
   - This change ensures that the `NIL` pointers are properly initialized for each new node created.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Node {
  int key;
  Node *right, *left, *parent;

  Node() : key(0), right(nullptr), left(nullptr), parent(nullptr) {}
};

Node *root = nullptr;
Node *NIL = nullptr;

void insert(int k) {
  Node *y = NIL;
  Node *x = root;
  Node *z = new Node();
  z->key = k;
  z->left = NIL;
  z->right = NIL;

  while (x != NIL) {
    y = x;
    if (z->key < x->key) {
      x = x->left;
    } else {
      x = x->right;
    }
  }

  z->parent = y;
  if (y == NIL) {
    root = z;
  } else {
    if (z->key < y->key) {
      y->left = z;
    } else {
      y->right = z;
    }
  }
}

void inorder(Node *&u) {
  if (u == NIL)
    return;
  inorder(u->left);
  std::cout << " " << u->key;
  inorder(u->right);
}

void preorder(Node *&u) {
  if (u == NIL)
    return;
  std::cout << " " << u->key;
  preorder(u->left);
  preorder(u->right);
}

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::string com;
    std::cin >> com;

    if (com == "insert") {
      int x;
      std::cin >> x;
      insert(x);
    } else if (com == "print") {
      inorder(root);
      std::cout << "\n";
      preorder(root);
      std::cout << "\n";
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the optimized code may not necessarily result in a significant improvement in performance, as it still performs the same operations on the binary search tree. However, the optimizations will help improve memory management and code efficiency.
