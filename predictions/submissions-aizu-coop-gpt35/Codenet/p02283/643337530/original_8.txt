The given code implements a binary search tree (BST) data structure using a linked list. The program takes a series of commands as input, where each command can be either "insert" followed by an integer or "print". The "insert" command inserts a node with the given integer into the binary search tree, while the "print" command prints the keys of the nodes in the tree in inorder and preorder traversal.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:
1. Memory allocation: Currently, the code uses dynamic memory allocation with `malloc` to create each node of the BST. Instead, we can use the `new` operator in C++ for memory allocation, which is more efficient and also simplifies memory management.
2. Input and output operations: The code uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations. These functions can be slow compared to their C++ counterparts (`cin` and `cout`). We can replace the C-style input/output functions with C++ iostreams for improved performance.
3. Redundant code: The code contains redundant include statements for unnecessary C++ standard libraries. We can remove these includes to make the code cleaner.
4. Unused variables: The variables `left` and `right` in the `Node` struct are unused and can be removed to reduce memory usage.
5. Unnecessary global variables: The variables `root` and `NIL` are declared as global variables. It's generally better to avoid using global variables as they can lead to potential bugs and make the code harder to reason about. We can move these variables to the `main` function and pass them as parameters to the other functions that require them.
6. Code readability: We can add comments to the code to make it easier to understand and maintain.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps one by one.
