The given code implements a binary search tree (BST) data structure and provides operations to insert nodes into the tree and print the tree in in-order and pre-order traversal.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Memory Allocation: The code uses manual memory allocation with `malloc` to create new nodes. This can be replaced with `new` operator for better memory management.

2. Unnecessary String Comparison: The code uses the `string` class for comparing commands. This can be replaced with simple character comparison for improved efficiency.

3. Redundant Function Calls: The code calls `inorder` and `preorder` functions recursively, which can be optimized to avoid unnecessary function call overhead.

4. Missing Pragma Directives: The code lacks any compiler optimization directives or pragmas that could hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

To optimize the code, the following steps can be taken:

1. Replace `malloc` with `new` for memory allocation to improve memory management.

2. Replace string comparison with character comparison for command checking to reduce overhead.

3. Optimize the `inorder` and `preorder` functions to avoid unnecessary recursion. This can be achieved by using an iterative approach with a stack.

4. Add appropriate compiler optimization directives or pragmas to guide the compiler in optimizing the code.

With these optimizations in mind, the code can be optimized as follows:
