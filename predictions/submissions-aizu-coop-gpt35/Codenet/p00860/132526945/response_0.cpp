The given code is a C++ program that solves a puzzle game. It reads input from the user, representing a grid of characters, and finds the shortest path from a starting position to a goal position.

To optimize this code, we need to analyze the program and identify potential performance bottlenecks and areas where memory usage can be improved.

Here is a step-by-step optimization strategy:

1. Avoid using the `using namespace std;` directive: This directive imports all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts. It's better to explicitly use the `std` namespace where needed.

2. Improve memory usage for the `vis` array: The `vis` array is used to keep track of visited positions in the grid. Currently, it uses an array of unsigned shorts, which results in a memory usage of 1 MB. Since the grid size is at most 16x20, we can optimize the memory usage by using a bitset instead of an array. This will reduce the memory usage to 156.25 KB.

3. Optimize the `check` function: The `check` function is called multiple times in the `solve` function to validate if a move is valid. The function uses bitwise operations to check for collisions and invalid moves. However, the function can be optimized by using a lookup table to check for collisions and invalid moves. This will eliminate the need for bitwise operations, resulting in faster execution.

4. Use early termination in the `solve` function: Currently, the `solve` function continues searching for the shortest path even after finding the goal position. We can optimize the `solve` function by adding an early termination condition when the goal position is found. This will save unnecessary iterations and improve performance.

5. Optimize the loop in the `solve` function: The loop in the `solve` function iterates over all possible moves in the grid. However, we can optimize this loop by using loop unrolling. Loop unrolling will reduce the number of iterations and eliminate redundant checks for empty cells.

6. Use `fgets` instead of `scanf` for input: The `scanf` function is used to read input from the user, but it is relatively slow compared to other input functions. We can optimize the program by replacing `scanf` with `fgets` to read input more efficiently.
