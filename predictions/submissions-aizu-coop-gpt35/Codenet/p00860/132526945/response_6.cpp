The given code is a C++ program that solves a maze puzzle. It reads an input grid representing a maze, with the characters representing walls, goal positions, and starting positions. The program then finds the shortest path from the starting position to the goal position using a breadth-first search algorithm.

To optimize this program, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory usage:
   - The `vis` array is used to keep track of visited positions in the maze. However, it is unnecessarily storing a large amount of data. We can optimize this by using a bitset instead, which will significantly reduce memory usage.

2. Improve data structure efficiency:
   - The `queue` data structure is used to perform the breadth-first search. However, this implementation can be improved by using a faster queue data structure, such as a `deque` or a custom queue that uses a circular buffer.

3. Reduce redundant computations:
   - The `check` function is called multiple times for the same positions, leading to redundant computations. We can optimize this by storing the results of the `check` function in a lookup table to avoid recomputation.

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations to help the compiler generate more efficient code. This can be done by enabling compiler optimizations, using appropriate compiler flags, or using `#pragma` directives to guide the compiler's optimizations.
