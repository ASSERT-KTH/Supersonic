The provided code is a C++ program that solves a maze puzzle. It uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path from a given start position to a goal position in the maze.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage: The code uses an array `vis` of size `1 << 24` to store visited states. This array is used to mark visited positions in the maze. However, the size of this array is unnecessarily large, considering the maximum input size of the maze is 16x20. We can optimize the memory usage by reducing the size of the `vis` array to a more appropriate size.

2. Bit Manipulation: The code uses bitwise operations to extract and manipulate bits in integers. While this can be an efficient way to perform certain operations, it is also error-prone and can make the code less readable. We can consider using more intuitive and safer data structures and operations.

3. Loop Optimization: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the maze positions. There might be opportunities to optimize these loops by eliminating unnecessary iterations or applying loop unrolling techniques.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The code does not include any compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. We can explore using compiler optimizations to further improve the performance of the program.
