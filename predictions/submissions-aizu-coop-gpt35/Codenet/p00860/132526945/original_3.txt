The given code is a C++ program that solves a maze puzzle. It uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path from a starting position to a goal position in the maze. The maze is represented as a grid of characters, where '#' represents a wall, uppercase letters represent goal positions, and lowercase letters represent starting positions.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage: The program uses an array of unsigned shorts (`vis`) to keep track of visited positions in the maze. The size of this array is `1 << 24`, which is quite large and may lead to excessive memory consumption. We can explore more memory-efficient alternatives to store the visited positions.

2. Loop Optimization: The code contains nested loops that iterate over the positions in the maze. We can investigate loop unrolling or other loop optimizations to improve the efficiency of these iterations.

3. Compiler Optimizations: We can explore compiler optimizations and pragma directives to help the compiler optimize the code. This may include inlining functions, enabling loop vectorization, or providing optimization hints to the compiler.

Based on these observations, let's formulate an optimization strategy and propose optimizations for the given code.
