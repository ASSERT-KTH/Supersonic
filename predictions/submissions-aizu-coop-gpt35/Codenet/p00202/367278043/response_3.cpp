Upon analyzing the provided code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The `prime` array is being used to store whether a number is prime or not. Currently, the array has a size of 1,000,001, which is much larger than necessary. We can reduce the size of this array to a more reasonable value based on the maximum value of `x` provided in the input.

2. The `dp` array is used to store whether a sum `i` can be achieved using the available numbers. This array has a size of 1,000,001, which is again larger than necessary. We can reduce the size of this array based on the maximum value of `x` provided in the input.

3. The current implementation of the algorithm has a time complexity of O(n * x), where n is the number of available numbers and x is the target sum. This can be improved by optimizing the inner loop.

4. The `sort` function is being used to sort the array of available numbers. However, the input constraints state that the number of available numbers will be at most 30. In such cases, it is more efficient to use a simpler sorting algorithm, such as bubble sort or insertion sort, instead of the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` library.

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following optimization strategy:

1. Determine the maximum value of `x` provided in the input and reduce the size of the `prime` and `dp` arrays accordingly.
2. Replace the `sort` function with a simpler sorting algorithm.
3. Optimize the inner loop by breaking out of it as soon as a sum `i` is found to be achievable.
