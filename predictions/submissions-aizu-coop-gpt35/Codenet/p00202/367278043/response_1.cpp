Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several areas for optimization:

1. Use a more efficient data structure for the `prime` array. The current implementation uses a simple boolean array to represent prime numbers. However, this approach requires a large amount of memory, especially for larger input values. Instead, we can use a bitset to represent prime numbers, which will significantly reduce memory usage.

2. The current implementation of the `dp` array is not efficient. It uses a boolean array of size 1000001, which is much larger than necessary. We can optimize this by using a dynamic programming approach that only requires an array of size `x+1`, where `x` is the maximum number we need to compute.

3. The sorting operation on the `a` array can be optimized. The current implementation uses the `std::sort` function, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). However, since the array is already sorted in ascending order, we can avoid this sorting step altogether.

4. The nested loops in the main calculation can be optimized. The current implementation has a time complexity of O(n*x), which can be reduced by optimizing the looping conditions and using an early exit strategy.
