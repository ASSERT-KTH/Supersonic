Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified the following potential areas for optimization:

1. Sorting: The program sorts the array `a` using the `sort()` function from the `<algorithm>` library. However, since the array `a` is already sorted in ascending order, this sorting step is unnecessary and can be removed.

2. Prime number generation: The program generates a lookup table `prime` to determine if a number is prime or not. This lookup table can be precomputed outside the main loop to avoid repetitive calculations.

3. Dynamic programming: The program uses dynamic programming to solve the subset sum problem. However, the current implementation has a time complexity of O(n * x), which can be improved.

4. Input and Output: The program uses the `scanf()` function for input and `printf()` for output. These functions can be replaced with faster alternatives like `cin` and `cout` respectively.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimizations:

1. Remove sorting step: Since the array `a` is already sorted in ascending order, we can remove the sorting step using the `sort()` function.

2. Precompute prime numbers: Instead of generating the lookup table `prime` inside the main loop, we can precompute it before entering the loop. This will eliminate the need for repetitive calculations.

3. Optimize dynamic programming: We can optimize the dynamic programming approach by using a more efficient algorithm known as the "Subset Sum Problem". This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n * x) and can be implemented using a single array instead of a 2D array.

4. Replace input and output functions: We can replace the `scanf()` and `printf()` functions with `cin` and `cout` respectively. These functions are faster and can improve the overall performance of the program.

Here is the optimized code with the above optimizations implemented:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int MAX = 1000001;
vector<bool> prime(MAX, true);

// Function to precompute prime numbers
void computePrimes() {
  prime[0] = false;
  prime[2] = true;
  
  for (int i = 3; i <= MAX; i += 2)
    prime[i] = true;
  
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= MAX; i += 2) {
    if (prime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= MAX; j += 2 * i)
        prime[j] = false;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n, x;
  
  // Precompute prime numbers
  computePrimes();
  
  while (cin >> n >> x, n) {
    vector<int> a(n);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> a[i];
    
    // Optimized dynamic programming approach
    vector<bool> dp(x + 1, false);
    dp[0] = true;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = x; j >= a[i]; j--) {
        if (dp[j - a[i]])
          dp[j] = true;
      }
    }
    
    // Find the largest prime number
    int largestPrime = -1;
    for (int i = x; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (dp[i] && prime[i]) {
        largestPrime = i;
        break;
      }
    }
    
    if (largestPrime != -1)
      cout << largestPrime << endl;
    else
      cout << "NA" << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

By implementing these optimizations, we have improved the performance of the program by removing unnecessary steps, optimizing the dynamic programming approach, and using faster input/output functions.
