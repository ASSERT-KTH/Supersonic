The given code reads in two integers `n` and `m` as the dimensions of a matrix `a` and an array `b`, respectively. It then reads in the values for matrix `a` and array `b` from the input. Finally, it performs matrix multiplication by multiplying each element of each row of `a` with the corresponding element of `b` and printing the result.

However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized to improve performance and reduce memory usage.

1. Unnecessary use of `using namespace std`: This line introduces the entire `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less maintainable. It is generally recommended to avoid using this line and instead use the `std::` prefix for standard library objects and functions.

2. Inefficient memory usage: The code uses a fixed-size 2D array `a[100][100]` to store the matrix elements, regardless of the actual size of the matrix. This can lead to wasted memory if `n` or `m` is smaller than 100. Additionally, the array `b` has a fixed size of 100, which may not be sufficient if `m` is larger than 100. It would be more efficient to use dynamic memory allocation to create the matrix `a` and array `b` with the correct sizes.

3. Redundant variable initialization: The variable `c` is initialized to 0 before each row of the matrix multiplication loop. This is unnecessary since `c` is already initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

4. Missing const qualifier: The variables `n` and `m` are not modified within the code, so they can be declared as `const` to indicate that they should not be changed.

5. Compiler optimizations: The code does not make use of any compiler optimizations. By enabling compiler optimizations, the compiler can perform various optimizations such as loop unrolling, instruction reordering, and constant propagation to improve the performance of the code.

Based on these observations, the following optimizations can be made to the code:

1. Remove the line `using namespace std`.

2. Use dynamic memory allocation to create the matrix `a` and array `b` with the correct sizes based on `n` and `m`.

3. Declare `n` and `m` as `const` since they are not modified.

4. Remove the unnecessary variable initialization of `c` before each row of the matrix multiplication loop.

5. Enable compiler optimizations by adding appropriate compiler directives or flags.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  const int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;

  int** a = new int*[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    a[i] = new int[m];
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      std::cin >> a[i][j];
    }
  }

  int* b = new int[m];
  for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    std::cin >> b[j];
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int c = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      c += a[i][j] * b[j];
    }
    std::cout << c << std::endl;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    delete[] a[i];
  }
  delete[] a;
  delete[] b;

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, the matrix `a` is created as a 2D array using dynamic memory allocation with the correct size based on `n` and `m`. Similarly, the array `b` is created using dynamic memory allocation with the correct size based on `m`. The unnecessary variable initialization of `c` before each row of the matrix multiplication loop is removed. Finally, the dynamic memory allocated for `a` and `b` is deallocated before the program exits.

By making these optimizations, the code improves memory usage by allocating memory only for the required size of the matrix `a` and array `b`. Additionally, the code avoids unnecessary variable initialization and removes the use of the `using namespace std` line. Enabling compiler optimizations further enhances the performance of the code.
