The provided code calculates the matrix multiplication of a given matrix A (size n x m) with a vector B (size m x 1). The result is stored in a vector C (size n x 1) and printed to the console. 

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified the following potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Memory Usage: The code uses a 2D array `a` with fixed size 100 x 100 to store the matrix A, even though the actual size is determined at runtime. This can lead to unnecessary memory allocation and waste of memory if the actual size is smaller. Similarly, the vector B is also allocated with a fixed size of 100, even though the actual size is determined at runtime.

2. Redundant Use of Intermediate Variables: The variables `x` and `y` are used to read the input values for each element of matrix A and vector B, respectively. However, these variables are only used once and can be avoided altogether.

3. Unnecessary Resetting of `c`: The variable `c` is set to zero after each row calculation. Since it is overwritten in the next iteration, this reset is not necessary.

4. Lack of Compiler Optimizations: The code does not make use of any compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the fixed-size arrays `a` and `b` with dynamically allocated arrays based on the actual input size n and m. This will reduce unnecessary memory allocation and improve memory usage efficiency.

2. Remove the intermediate variables `x` and `y` and directly read the input values into the matrix A and vector B.

3. Remove the unnecessary resetting of `c` after each row calculation.

4. Add compiler optimizations/pragma directives to encourage the compiler to optimize the code further.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step by step:
