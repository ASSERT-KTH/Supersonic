The provided code reads two integers `n` and `m` from the user. It then reads `n` rows of `m` integers into a 2D array `a`. It also reads `m` integers into a 1D array `b`. Finally, it performs matrix multiplication of `a` and `b` and outputs the result.

In terms of performance optimization, there are a few areas that can be improved:

1. Memory Allocation: The arrays `a` and `b` are statically allocated with a fixed size of 100. This limits the size of the matrices that can be processed. We can improve this by dynamically allocating memory for `a` and `b` based on the input `n` and `m`.

2. Input/Output: The code performs individual input and output operations for each element of `a` and the result. This can be optimized by using buffered input/output operations.

3. Loop Optimization: The nested loops used for matrix multiplication can be optimized by rearranging the loop order and using loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations.

4. Compiler Optimization: We can suggest compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
