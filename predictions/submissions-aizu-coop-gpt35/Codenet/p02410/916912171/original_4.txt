The given code is a simple matrix multiplication program. It reads an input matrix `inact` of size `row x col` and a vector `act` of size `col`. It then performs matrix multiplication between `inact` and `act` to calculate the result vector `ans`. Finally, it prints the elements of `ans` one by one.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory allocation: The code allocates three 2D arrays `inact`, `act`, and `ans`, each of size 100x100. However, the actual size of these arrays is determined at runtime and can be smaller than 100x100. We can optimize memory usage by dynamically allocating these arrays based on the input `row` and `col`.

2. Initialization: The code initializes all elements of `inact`, `act`, and `ans` to 0 using nested loops. However, this is unnecessary since these arrays will be fully populated with input values. We can remove the initialization loops.

3. Loop order: The loops for multiplying `inact` and `act` are not optimized in terms of memory access. The current loop order is row-major, which might result in poor cache utilization. We can optimize the loop order to column-major to improve cache locality.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can also suggest some compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling and auto-vectorization to improve performance.

Now let's proceed with optimizing the code step by step.
