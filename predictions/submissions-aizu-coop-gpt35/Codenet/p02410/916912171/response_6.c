The provided code calculates the product of two matrices: `inact` and `act`. The resulting matrix is stored in the `ans` array and printed to the console.

Upon analyzing the code, here are some potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Reducing Memory Usage:
   - The `inact` array is initialized to all zeros before being used. However, this is unnecessary since the array is subsequently populated with user input. We can remove the initialization loop for `inact`.
   - Similarly, the `act` and `ans` arrays are initialized to all zeros but are not required to be zero-initialized. We can remove the initialization loops for `act` and `ans`.

2. Loop Optimization:
   - The nested loops used to calculate the product of the matrices can be optimized. The outer loop iterates over the rows of `inact`, and the inner loop iterates over the columns of `inact` and `act`. However, the inner loop can be optimized by swapping the order of iteration. By doing this, we can improve cache locality and reduce cache misses.
   - Additionally, we can use loop unrolling to process multiple elements in each iteration of the inner loop. This can provide a performance boost by reducing loop overhead and improving instruction-level parallelism.

3. Compiler Optimization:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations to allow the compiler to apply its own set of optimizations. This can include loop unrolling, vectorization, and other optimizations that can significantly improve performance. We can use compiler-specific pragmas or flags to enable optimizations.
