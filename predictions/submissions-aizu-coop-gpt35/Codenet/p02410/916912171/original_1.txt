Analysis:
1. The code initializes three arrays: `inact`, `act`, and `ans`, with size 100 each. These arrays are used to store input values and perform calculations.
2. The code reads the values of `row` and `col` from the user, which determine the dimensions of the `inact` array.
3. The code then reads the values of the `inact` array and the `act` array from the user.
4. The code calculates the product of each row of the `inact` array with the `act` array and stores the result in the `ans` array.
5. Finally, the code prints the values of the `ans` array.

Potential optimizations:
1. The code initializes all elements of the `inact` array to 0, which is unnecessary since all elements will be assigned a value from user input. This initialization can be removed.
2. The code initializes all elements of the `act` and `ans` arrays to 0, which is also unnecessary. These arrays will be overwritten with user input and calculation results, respectively. The initialization can be removed.
3. The code uses a nested loop to calculate the product for each element of the `inact` array with the corresponding element of the `act` array. This can be optimized to avoid redundant multiplications and loop iterations.
4. The code uses a separate loop to print the values of the `ans` array. This can be combined with the previous loop to avoid unnecessary iterations.

Optimization strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary array initializations.
2. Optimize the multiplication loop by:
   - Reorganizing the loop to iterate over the `act` array first, instead of the `inact` array. This allows us to calculate the product for each row without accessing the `inact` array multiple times.
   - Use a temporary variable to accumulate the product for each row, instead of accessing the `ans` array multiple times.
3. Combine the multiplication and printing loops into a single loop.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary array initializations:
   - Remove the initialization loop for the `inact` array, as all elements will be assigned a value from user input.
   - Remove the initialization loops for the `act` and `ans` arrays, as they will be overwritten with user input and calculation results, respectively.

2. Optimize the multiplication loop:
   - Reorganize the loop to iterate over the `act` array first, instead of the `inact` array. This allows us to calculate the product for each row without accessing the `inact` array multiple times.
   - Use a temporary variable to accumulate the product for each row, instead of accessing the `ans` array multiple times. This reduces memory access and improves cache locality.

3. Combine the multiplication and printing loops:
   - Combine the two loops into a single loop to avoid unnecessary iterations.

Optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int inact[100][100];
  int act[100];
  int row, col;
  int i, j, k;
  
  scanf("%d %d", &row, &col);
  
  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      scanf("%d", &inact[i][j]);
    }
  }
  
  for (i = 0; i < col; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &act[i]);
  }
  
  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    int ans = 0; // Temporary variable to accumulate product
    for (j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      ans += inact[i][j] * act[j];
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code removes unnecessary array initializations and combines the multiplication and printing loops. These changes reduce memory access and loop iterations, resulting in improved performance.
