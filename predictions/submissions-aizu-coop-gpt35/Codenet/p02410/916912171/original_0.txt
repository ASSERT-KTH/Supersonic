The provided code appears to be a matrix multiplication program. It multiplies a given matrix `inact` with a given array `act` to produce another array `ans`. The program then prints the elements of `ans` one by one.

Now, let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage:
   - The program declares three arrays `inact`, `act`, and `ans`, each with a fixed size of 100. This limits the program's ability to handle larger matrices.
   - The arrays are initialized with zeros, even though they will be overwritten with user input values.

2. Input Handling:
   - The program reads input values row by row for the `inact` matrix and column by column for the `act` array. This may not be the most efficient way to handle input, especially if the input is large.

3. Computation:
   - The matrix multiplication is performed using nested loops. This is a straightforward approach, but it may not be the most efficient for larger matrices.
   - The multiplication is done row by row, which can result in cache misses and inefficient memory access patterns.
   - The multiplication is performed using simple integer arithmetic, which may not take full advantage of hardware optimizations.

Based on these observations, we can devise an optimization strategy:

1. Memory Usage:
   - Instead of using fixed-size arrays, we can dynamically allocate memory for the `inact`, `act`, and `ans` arrays based on the user input.
   - We can eliminate the initialization of the arrays since they will be overwritten with user input.

2. Input Handling:
   - We can read the input values directly into the dynamically allocated arrays, avoiding the need for intermediate variables.

3. Computation:
   - We can optimize the matrix multiplication by using loop unrolling and taking advantage of vectorized instructions if available.
   - Instead of multiplying row by row, we can perform the multiplication column by column to improve memory access patterns.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations to let the compiler automatically apply optimizations based on the target architecture.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step by step.
