Analysis:

1. The code implements a dynamic programming solution for the 0/1 Knapsack problem, where the goal is to maximize the total value of items that can be included in a knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.

2. The code defines two arrays, `value` and `weight`, to store the values and weights of the items respectively.

3. It then defines a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum value that can be achieved for each subproblem. The rows represent the items, and the columns represent the weight capacity.

4. The code uses nested loops to iterate through each item and weight capacity combination, and computes the maximum value that can be achieved by either including or excluding the current item.

5. Finally, the code outputs the maximum value stored in `dp[N][W]`.

Potential optimizations:

1. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary headers for the specific functionality used in the code. This will improve compile time and avoid unnecessary inclusion of standard library headers.

2. The code uses fixed-size arrays `value[N]` and `weight[N]` to store the values and weights respectively. This limits the code to a maximum of 100 items (`N` is assumed to be at most 100). Consider using dynamic memory allocation (`new[]` and `delete[]`) or a container class (`std::vector`) to allow for variable-sized inputs.

3. The 2D array `dp` has dimensions `[110][10010]`, which is much larger than necessary for the given problem constraints (`N` and `W` are at most 100). Consider reducing the size of `dp` to `[N+1][W+1]` to save memory.

4. In the outer loop that iterates over the items, the loop counter `i` is used to access the `value` and `weight` arrays. The loop condition should be `i < N`, not `i <= N`, to avoid accessing out-of-bounds memory.

5. The inner loop that iterates over the weight capacity should start from 0 instead of 1, as there is a need to compute the maximum value for zero weight capacity.

6. The inner loop condition `w <= W` is not necessary, since the maximum weight capacity is already defined as `W`. Changing the condition to `w < W` will avoid an unnecessary iteration.

7. The `if` condition inside the inner loop can be simplified by removing the `else` block and setting `dp[i + 1][w]` to `dp[i][w]` before the `if` condition. This eliminates the need for the `else` block.

8. The maximum value computation inside the `if` condition can be simplified by using `max()` directly on the two values, without the need for subtraction and addition.

Optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary headers.

2. Replace the fixed-size arrays `value[N]` and `weight[N]` with a `std::vector` to allow for variable-sized inputs.

3. Reduce the size of the `dp` array to `[N+1][W+1]`.

4. Fix the loop bounds and conditions to prevent out-of-bounds memory access.

5. Simplify the inner loop condition, remove the unnecessary `else` block, and simplify the maximum value computation.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary headers, such as `#include <iostream>` and `#include <algorithm>`.

2. Replace the fixed-size arrays `value[N]` and `weight[N]` with a `std::vector<int> value(N)` and `std::vector<int> weight(N)` respectively.

3. Reduce the size of the `dp` array to `[N+1][W+1]` by changing `int dp[110][10010]` to `int dp[N+1][W+1]`.

4. Fix the loop bounds and conditions:
   - In the outer loop, change `for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++)` to `for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)`.
   - In the inner loop, change `for (int w = 1; w <= W; w++)` to `for (int w = 0; w < W; w++)`.

5. Simplify the inner loop condition and remove the unnecessary `else` block:
   - Change `if (w >= weight[i])` to `dp[i + 1][w] = dp[i][w];` before the `if` condition.
   - Remove the `else` block and update the `if` condition to `if (w >= weight[i])`.

6. Simplify the maximum value computation by using `std::max()` directly on the two values:
   - Change `dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);` to `dp[i + 1][w] = std::max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);`.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int N, W;
  std::cin >> N >> W;
  std::vector<int> value(N);
  std::vector<int> weight(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    std::cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(N + 1, std::vector<int>(W + 1, 0));
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int w = 0; w < W; w++) {
      dp[i + 1][w] = dp[i][w];
      if (w >= weight[i])
        dp[i + 1][w] = std::max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
    }
  }
  std::cout << dp[N][W] << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code improves the memory usage by using `std::vector` instead of fixed-size arrays and reduces the unnecessary memory allocation for the `dp` array. It also fixes the loop bounds and conditions to prevent out-of-bounds memory access. Additionally, it simplifies the code by removing unnecessary `else` blocks and simplifying the maximum value computation using `std::max()`.
