The given code implements a dynamic programming solution to the 0/1 Knapsack problem. The goal is to optimize the code for efficiency, specifically focusing on reducing running time and minimizing memory usage. 

Let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The code includes several unnecessary macro definitions, such as `ll`, `vvi`, `vec`, `pq`, and `all(v)`. These macros can be replaced with their corresponding types or functions to improve code readability.

2. The `uniqueV` macro is not used in the code and can be removed.

3. The `debug` macros are intended for debugging purposes and should be removed to improve performance.

4. The `line` macro is not used and can be removed.

5. The `printA` function is not used and can be removed.

6. The `dx` and `dy` arrays are defined but not used in the code and can be removed.

7. The `PI` constant is defined but not used in the code and can be removed.

8. The `dp` array is declared with a fixed size of 110x10010, which is larger than necessary. The size can be adjusted based on the input values of `n` and `W` to reduce memory usage.

9. The initialization of `dp[0][W]` inside the first loop is incorrect. It should be `dp[0][i] = 0` instead of `dp[0][W] = 0`.

10. The outer loop of the dynamic programming solution iterates over the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1`, which can be optimized by using a range-based for loop instead.

11. The inner loop of the dynamic programming solution iterates over the values of `w` from 0 to `W`, which can be optimized by using the `max` function outside the loop.

Now that we have identified potential areas for optimization, let's formulate an optimization strategy and explain each step in detail.
