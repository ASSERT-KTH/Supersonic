Code Analysis:

1. The code defines several macros, such as `REP`, `rep`, `MOD1`, and `MOD2`, but these macros are not used in the code. They can be removed.

2. The `pow` function is defined to calculate the power of a number. However, this function is not used in the code. It can be removed.

3. The `dic_op` function converts a string representation of a DNA sequence to a numerical representation. The function uses a loop to iterate over the characters of the string and calculates the numerical representation by multiplying the corresponding value of each character by a power of 5. The function can be optimized to avoid the repeated multiplication and addition operations.

4. The main loop reads input from `stdin` and performs operations based on the input. The operations are stored in a character array `opstr` and the DNA sequence is stored in a character array `str`. The `dic_op` function is called to convert the DNA sequence to a numerical representation, and the result is used as an index to access the `dic` array.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unused macros: The `REP`, `rep`, `MOD1`, and `MOD2` macros are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Optimize `dic_op` function:
   - Instead of using a loop to calculate the numerical representation, we can use a lookup table to directly map each character to its corresponding value. This will eliminate the need for repeated multiplication and addition operations.
   - The lookup table can be implemented as a simple array.
   - To avoid the need for a terminating character in the input string, we can pass the length of the string as a parameter to the `dic_op` function.
   - The function can return `ull` instead of `int` to handle larger values.

3. Replace `scanf` with `cin`: The `scanf` function is used to read input, but since the code already includes the `<iostream>` header, it would be more consistent to use `cin` instead.

4. Use a `vector` instead of a static array: The `dic` array is currently defined as a static array with a fixed size. This can lead to wasted memory if the actual number of elements used is much smaller. Using a `vector` instead will dynamically allocate memory as needed and reduce memory usage.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unused macros:
   - Remove the `#define` statements for `REP`, `rep`, `MOD1`, and `MOD2`.

2. Optimize `dic_op` function:
   - Replace the `dic_op` function with the following optimized version:

```cpp
ull dic_op(char str[], int len) {
  static const int values[256] = {0}; // Initialize all elements to 0
  values['A'] = 1;
  values['C'] = 2;
  values['G'] = 3;
  values['T'] = 4;
  ull g = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j < len; j++) {
    g += values[str[j]];
    if (j < len - 1)
      g *= 5;
  }
  return g;
}
```

3. Replace `scanf` with `cin`:
   - Replace the `scanf` statement with `cin` to read the input:

```cpp
cin >> opstr >> str;
```

4. Use a `vector` instead of a static array:
   - Replace the static array `dic` with a `vector`:

```cpp
vector<bool> dic(90000000, false);
```

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef unsigned long long ull;

ull dic_op(char str[], int len) {
  static const int values[256] = {0}; // Initialize all elements to 0
  values['A'] = 1;
  values['C'] = 2;
  values['G'] = 3;
  values['T'] = 4;
  ull g = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j < len; j++) {
    g += values[str[j]];
    if (j < len - 1)
      g *= 5;
  }
  return g;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<bool> dic(90000000, false);
  char opstr[7];
  char str[13];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> opstr >> str;
    int len = strlen(str);
    if (opstr[0] == 'i') {
      dic[dic_op(str, len)] = true;
    } else if (opstr[0] == 'f') {
      if (dic[dic_op(str, len)])
        puts("yes");
      else
        puts("no");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes unused macros, optimizes the `dic_op` function, replaces `scanf` with `cin`, and uses a `vector` instead of a static array. These changes improve performance by eliminating unnecessary operations and reducing memory usage. The functionality and output of the original code are preserved.
