Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be made:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the `<string.h>` and `<string>` headers, but they are not being used. These can be removed.

2. Remove redundant return statement: In the `getnum()` function, the last `return 0;` statement is never reached. It can be removed.

3. Optimize the getkey() function:
   - Use `unsigned long long` instead of `long long` for the return type to avoid potential overflow.
   - Use a constant array `int num[128]` to directly map characters to their corresponding numbers, instead of using multiple if-else statements in the `getnum()` function.
   - Initialize `sum` and `p` outside the loop and use a pre-increment (`++p`) instead of multiplying by 5 in each iteration.

4. Optimize the insert() and find() functions:
   - Store the length of each string in a separate array `int strLength[M]` to avoid calling `strlen()` repeatedly.
   - Cache the result of `h1(key)` and `h2(key)` in variables instead of calling the functions multiple times.
   - Use a for loop with a maximum number of iterations (`i < M`) instead of an infinite loop with a `break` statement.
   - Use the `!=` operator instead of `strcmp()` for string comparison.

5. Avoid unnecessary assignments: In the main() function, the statement `H[i][L] = '\0';` can be removed because `H` is already zero-initialized.
