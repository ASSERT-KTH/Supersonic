## Code Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided code, here are some potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. The `bool d[33554432]` array is quite large, taking up a significant amount of memory. This array is used to store the presence or absence of a specific DNA sequence.

2. The `char k[128]` array is used as a lookup table to map DNA characters to their corresponding integer values.

3. The `c` function converts a given DNA sequence into an integer representation. The conversion is done by shifting bits and adding the corresponding integer values from the `k` array.

4. The code uses the `scanf` function for input, which can be slow when used repeatedly.

5. The code uses the `printf` and `puts` functions for output, which can also impact performance.

## Optimization Strategy

Based on the code analysis, here is the optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `bool d[33554432]` array with a more memory-efficient data structure.

2. Optimize the `c` function to reduce the number of operations and improve performance.

3. Use more efficient input and output methods to speed up the program.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Replace the `bool d[33554432]` array with a `bitset` data structure. The `bitset` provides a more memory-efficient way to represent a large number of boolean values. Instead of using one byte for each boolean value, it uses a single bit. This reduces the memory usage by a factor of 8.

2. Optimize the `c` function by using bitwise operations instead of shifting and adding. Instead of shifting `ans` by 2 and adding `k[str[i]]`, we can use bitwise operators to achieve the same result. Shifting `ans` by 2 is equivalent to multiplying it by 4, so we can use the left shift operator `<<` to multiply `ans` by 4. Then, we can use the bitwise OR operator `|` to add `k[str[i]]` to `ans`. This reduces the number of operations and improves performance.

3. Replace the `scanf` function with `std::cin` for input and `std::cout` for output. `std::cin` and `std::cout` are generally faster than `scanf` and `printf` for C++ programs.

4. Add compiler optimization flags to hint the compiler to optimize the code. For example, using `-O3` flag with GCC or Clang enables aggressive optimizations that can significantly improve performance.

## Optimized Code Block

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

int main() {
  std::bitset<33554432> d;
  char k[128];
  k['A'] = 0;
  k['C'] = 1;
  k['G'] = 2;
  k['T'] = 3;

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  char s[7], str[12];
  while (n--) {
    std::cin >> s >> str;
    if (s[0] == 'i')
      d[c(str)] = true;
    else
      std::cout << (d[c(str)] ? "yes" : "no") << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Please note that the `c` function is not optimized in the provided optimized code block. I will optimize the `c` function separately in the next code block.
