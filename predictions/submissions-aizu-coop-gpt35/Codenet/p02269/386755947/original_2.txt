Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified several areas that can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Inefficient data structure: The boolean array `d` is declared with a size of 33,554,432, which is unnecessarily large. This array is used to store the presence or absence of a DNA sequence. Since there are only 4 possible nucleotides (A, C, G, T), it would be more efficient to use a bitset instead of a boolean array. This will reduce the memory usage significantly.

2. Redundant computation: The character array `k` is used to map each nucleotide character to an integer. However, this mapping is fixed and does not change throughout the execution of the program. Instead of using an array, we can use a switch statement inside the `c()` function to directly compute the integer value of each nucleotide character. This will eliminate the need for the `k` array and reduce the number of memory accesses.

3. Inefficient loop: The loop in the `c()` function iterates over each character of the input string `str` to compute the corresponding integer value. However, instead of using a loop, we can use a recursive approach to compute the value. This will avoid the need for the `i` variable and reduce the number of iterations.

4. Lack of compiler optimizations: The code does not include any compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler for potential optimizations. By enabling compiler optimizations, we can let the compiler optimize the code further based on the target architecture.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization steps:

1. Replace the boolean array `d` with a bitset to reduce memory usage.

2. Remove the `k` array and replace it with a switch statement inside the `c()` function to directly compute the integer value of each nucleotide character.

3. Rewrite the `c()` function using a recursive approach to avoid the need for a loop.

4. Enable compiler optimizations by adding the appropriate compiler flags or pragma directives.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

bitset<33554432> d;

int c(char str[12], int i = 0, int ans = 0) {
  if (str[i] == '\0') {
    return ans;
  }
  
  ans <<= 2;
  switch (str[i]) {
    case 'A':
      ans += 0;
      break;
    case 'C':
      ans += 1;
      break;
    case 'G':
      ans += 2;
      break;
    case 'T':
      ans += 3;
      break;
  }
  
  return c(str, i + 1, ans);
}

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  char s[7], str[12];

  while (n--) {
    scanf("%s %s", s, str);

    if (s[0] == 'i')
      d[c(str)] = true;
    else
      puts(d[c(str)] ? "yes" : "no");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have reduced memory usage by replacing the boolean array with a bitset and removed the unnecessary `k` array. We have also optimized the `c()` function by using a recursive approach instead of a loop. Enabling compiler optimizations will further enhance the performance of the code.
