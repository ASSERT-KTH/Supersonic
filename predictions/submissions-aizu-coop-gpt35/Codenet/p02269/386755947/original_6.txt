Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structure: The boolean array `d` is currently being used to store the presence or absence of certain strings. However, since the maximum possible number of strings is 33554432, this array is very large and consumes a significant amount of memory.

2. Unnecessary computation: The `c` function performs a left shift and addition operation for each character in the input string. This can be optimized to reduce the number of operations.

3. Inefficient loop: The loop in the `c` function can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

4. Lack of compiler optimizations: The code does not include any compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can guide the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the boolean array `d` with a more memory-efficient data structure that can store the presence or absence of strings. One possible alternative is to use a `std::unordered_set` or a `std::unordered_map`.

2. Optimize the `c` function to reduce the number of operations and improve performance. This can be done by:
   - Precomputing the shift values for each character in the `k` array.
   - Using bitwise operators instead of arithmetic operations.

3. Optimize the loop in the `c` function by:
   - Using a pointer to iterate over the characters in the input string.
   - Using a bitwise OR operation instead of addition.

4. Include compiler optimizations or pragma directives to guide the compiler in optimizing the code.

Now, I will provide a step-by-step explanation of each optimization step.
