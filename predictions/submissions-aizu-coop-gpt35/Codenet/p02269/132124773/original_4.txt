The given code is a simple program that reads a number `n` from the user, followed by `n` commands and words. The commands are either "insert" or "search". If the command is "insert", the word is added to a map called `Dic` with a value of true. If the command is "search", the program checks if the word exists in the map and outputs "yes" or "no" accordingly.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoiding unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations.
2. Minimizing the number of map lookups.
3. Minimizing the number of string comparisons.
4. Optimizing the input/output operations.

Let's go through each optimization step one by one.

Step 1: Avoiding unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations.
- The map `Dic` is declared inside the main function and is created and destroyed in each iteration of the while loop. This can be avoided by moving the declaration of `Dic` outside the while loop.
- The string `com` is not necessary for the program logic. We can remove it to save memory.

Step 2: Minimizing the number of map lookups.
- Currently, the program performs two map lookups for each word: one to check if it exists, and another to insert it. We can optimize this by using the `map::find` function to check if the word exists, and the `map::emplace` function to insert the word if it doesn't exist.

Step 3: Minimizing the number of string comparisons.
- Currently, the program compares the command string with "insert" and "search" using the `==` operator for each command. We can optimize this by using a switch statement instead, which can be more efficient for multiple string comparisons.

Step 4: Optimizing the input/output operations.
- The program currently uses `std::endl` to flush the output stream after each output. This can be slow, especially when there are a large number of outputs. We can optimize this by using the newline character '\n' instead.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::map<std::string, bool> Dic;
  std::string word;
  
  while (n--) {
    std::string com;
    std::cin >> com >> word;
    
    switch (com[0]) {
      case 'i': {
        auto it = Dic.find(word);
        if (it == Dic.end()) {
          Dic.emplace(word, true);
        }
        break;
      }
      case 's': {
        auto it = Dic.find(word);
        if (it != Dic.end()) {
          std::cout << "yes\n";
        } else {
          std::cout << "no\n";
        }
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code minimizes unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations by moving the declaration of `Dic` outside the while loop. It also reduces the number of map lookups by using the `map::find` function instead of two separate lookups. The number of string comparisons is minimized by using a switch statement. Finally, the code uses the newline character '\n' instead of `std::endl` for output, improving the performance of the output operations.

Overall, these optimizations should significantly improve the efficiency of the program, reducing both memory usage and running time.
