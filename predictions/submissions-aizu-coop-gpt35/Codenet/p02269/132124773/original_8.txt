The provided code is a simple program that takes a number 'n' as input and then reads 'n' lines of commands and words. The commands can be either "insert" or "search". If the command is "insert", the word is added to a map called "Dic" with a value of true. If the command is "search", the program checks if the word exists in the map and outputs "yes" or "no" accordingly.

To optimize this code for efficiency, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary string operations: The current code uses the 'com' string to compare the command. Instead of using the string comparison, we can use character comparison directly, which is faster.

2. Efficient data structure: The current code uses a map to store the words. While maps provide fast lookup time, they use more memory compared to other alternatives like unordered_set or vector. We can switch to unordered_set to reduce memory usage.

3. Minimize input/output operations: The current code performs an input operation and two output operations in each iteration of the loop. We can reduce the number of these operations by storing the output in a string and printing it once after the loop finishes.

4. Avoid unnecessary copying: The current code copies the word from input to a temporary variable before inserting or searching it in the map. We can avoid this unnecessary copy by directly using the input string.

Now let's proceed to optimize the code step by step.
