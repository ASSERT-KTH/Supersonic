The given code reads a number `n` as input, and then reads `n` pairs of strings. For each pair, if the first string is "i", it inserts the second string into a map with a value of `true`. If the first string is not "i", it checks if the second string exists in the map and prints "yes" or "no" accordingly.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The use of `map<string, bool>` can be optimized to reduce memory usage.

2. Reduce input/output operations: The current code performs multiple input/output operations inside the loop, which can be reduced to improve performance.

3. Optimize string comparison: The code currently compares the first character of the input string to determine the operation. This can be improved to avoid repeated string operations.
