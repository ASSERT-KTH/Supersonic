Code Analysis:

The given code is a simple program that reads a series of instructions and strings from the input and performs operations based on the instructions. The main performance bottleneck in this code is the `h()` function, which calculates the hash value of a string. The hash value is used as an index to access the `chk` array.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the `chk` array with a more memory-efficient data structure.
2. Optimize the `h()` function to reduce unnecessary computations.
3. Use compiler optimizations to further improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the `chk` array:
   - The `chk` array is of type `bool` and has a size of 244140624, which is equivalent to 244,140,624 bytes or approximately 233 MB. This is a huge amount of memory for a boolean array.
   - Instead of using a boolean array, we can use a bitset, which is a more memory-efficient data structure for storing boolean values.
   - Replace the declaration `bool chk[244140624];` with `bitset<244140624> chk;`.
   - A `bitset` allows individual bits to be set or cleared, which is sufficient for our needs since we only need to store boolean values.

2. Optimize the `h()` function:
   - The `h()` function calculates the hash value of a string. Currently, it uses a loop and a series of conditional statements to map each character to a numeric value.
   - We can optimize this process by using a lookup table instead of conditional statements.
   - Create a lookup table that maps each character ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') to its corresponding numeric value (1, 2, 3, 4).
   - Modify the `h()` function to use the lookup table instead of conditional statements.
   - The modified `h()` function should look like this:

```cpp
int h(string s) {
  int ret = 0;
  int lookup[128] = {};  // Initialize the lookup table with zeros
  lookup['A'] = 1;
  lookup['C'] = 2;
  lookup['G'] = 3;
  lookup['T'] = 4;
  for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); ++i) {
    ret *= 5;
    ret += lookup[s[i]];
  }
  return ret;
}
```

3. Use compiler optimizations:
   - Enable compiler optimizations to further improve the performance of the code.
   - Add the `-O3` flag to the compiler command to enable aggressive optimizations.
   - For example, if you are using `g++` to compile the code, the command would be: `g++ -O3 -o optimized_code original_code.cpp`.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

int n;
string ins, s;

int h(string s) {
  int ret = 0;
  int lookup[128] = {};  // Initialize the lookup table with zeros
  lookup['A'] = 1;
  lookup['C'] = 2;
  lookup['G'] = 3;
  lookup['T'] = 4;
  for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); ++i) {
    ret *= 5;
    ret += lookup[s[i]];
  }
  return ret;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin >> n;

  bitset<244140624> chk;

  while (n--) {
    cin >> ins >> s;
    if (ins[0] == 'i') {
      chk[h(s)] = true;
    } else {
      cout << (chk[h(s)] ? "yes" : "no") << endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces memory usage by replacing the boolean array with a bitset. It also improves the performance of the `h()` function by using a lookup table instead of conditional statements. Finally, enabling compiler optimizations further enhances the overall performance of the program.
