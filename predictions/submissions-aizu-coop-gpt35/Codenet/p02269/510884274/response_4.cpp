The provided code performs a series of insertions and searches on a boolean array `chk` based on a hash function `h()`. The hash function converts a DNA sequence string into an integer by assigning a unique number to each of the four nucleotides A, C, G, and T. The insertions set the corresponding index in `chk` to true, while the searches output "yes" if the index is true and "no" otherwise.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified the following potential areas for optimization:

1. Replace the boolean array with a bitset: The current implementation uses a boolean array `chk` to store the presence of DNA sequences. However, since each element in the array requires a full byte to store a boolean value, it leads to inefficient memory usage. By replacing it with a `std::bitset`, which packs boolean values into individual bits, we can significantly reduce memory usage.

2. Optimize the hash function: The current hash function `h()` converts each nucleotide of the DNA sequence into a number and accumulates them to obtain a hash value. However, this can be optimized by using bitwise operations instead of multiplication and addition. By assigning unique bit patterns to each nucleotide and combining them using bitwise OR, we can avoid costly arithmetic operations.

3. Avoid redundant computations: The current implementation performs the hash computation `h(s)` twice for each input string - once for insertion and once for search. We can improve efficiency by computing the hash value once and storing it in a variable for reuse.

4. Enable compiler optimizations: We can utilize compiler optimizations to further improve the performance of the code. By providing appropriate compiler flags or pragma directives, we can instruct the compiler to apply various optimization techniques such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and vectorization.
