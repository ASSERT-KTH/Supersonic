Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Memory Usage: The `chk` array is declared with a size of 244140624, which is quite large and may consume a significant amount of memory. This can be optimized by using a more efficient data structure.
2. String Operations: The `h` function converts each character of the string `s` into a digit using conditional statements. This can be optimized to reduce the number of conditional checks and improve string processing efficiency.
3. Input/Output Operations: The `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` statement is used to improve input/output efficiency by disabling synchronization between C and C++ standard streams. However, this optimization may not be necessary depending on the specific requirements of the program.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Use a more efficient data structure instead of the `chk` array to reduce memory usage.
2. Optimize the `h` function to improve string processing efficiency.
3. Evaluate the necessity of the `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` statement and remove it if not required.

Let's now proceed with a step-by-step explanation of each optimization:

1. Efficient Data Structure: Instead of using a boolean array `chk`, we can use a `std::unordered_set<int>` to store the hashed values of the strings. This will reduce memory usage by only storing the unique hashed values.

2. Optimizing `h` Function:
   - We can avoid using conditional statements by mapping the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' to the values 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. This can be achieved using a lookup table.
   - Instead of multiplying `ret` by 5 in each iteration, we can use a precalculated power of 5 to improve performance.

3. Evaluate `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This statement can be removed if the program does not require synchronization between C and C++ standard streams.

Now, let's implement these optimizations in the code block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

unordered_set<int> chk;
int n;
string ins, s;
int charToValue[128]; // Lookup table for character to value mapping

int h(const string& s) {
  int ret = 0;
  int power = 1;
  for (int i = s.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
    ret += charToValue[s[i]] * power;
    power *= 5;
  }
  return ret;
}

int main() {
  // Populate the lookup table
  charToValue['A'] = 1;
  charToValue['C'] = 2;
  charToValue['G'] = 3;
  charToValue['T'] = 4;

  cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> ins >> s;
    if (ins[0] == 'i') {
      chk.insert(h(s));
    } else {
      cout << (chk.count(h(s)) ? "yes" : "no") << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code preserves the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance and reducing memory usage. It uses an unordered set instead of a boolean array to store hashed values, optimizes the `h` function by avoiding conditional statements and using a lookup table, and removes the unnecessary `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` statement.
