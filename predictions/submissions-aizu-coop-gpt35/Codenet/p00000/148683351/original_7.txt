The provided code is a simple program that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. However, there are a few potential optimizations that can be made to improve its performance and memory usage.

1. Avoiding namespace std:
   The line `using namespace std;` imports the entire std namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts and potentially slower compilation times. It is better to avoid this and explicitly use `std::` prefix for the standard library functions and objects.

2. Minimizing cout calls:
   The current code calls `cout` for each multiplication operation, resulting in multiple function calls and potentially slower output. Instead, we can store the results in a string and then print them all at once using a single cout call. This can significantly improve the performance.

3. Update loop parameters:
   The outer loop iterates from 1 to 9, and the inner loop also iterates from 1 to 9. However, since we are calculating the multiplication table, the inner loop can start from the value of the outer loop variable (i). This eliminates redundant calculations and reduces the number of iterations.

4. Use pre-increment operator:
   The current code uses the post-increment operator (i++) for the loop variables. However, the pre-increment operator (++i) is generally more efficient as it avoids creating a temporary copy of the variable.

5. Use a more efficient data structure:
   The current code does not use any data structure other than basic integer variables. However, using a more efficient data structure, such as a 2D array, can improve memory access patterns and reduce cache misses.

Based on these observations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  const int tableSize = 10;
  const int maxDigits = 2;
  const std::string separator = "   ";

  std::string table[tableSize][tableSize];

  for (int i = 1; i < tableSize; ++i) {
    for (int j = i; j < tableSize; ++j) {
      int value = i * j;
      table[i][j] = std::to_string(value);
      table[j][i] = std::to_string(value);
    }
  }

  for (int i = 1; i < tableSize; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j < tableSize; ++j) {
      std::cout << table[i][j];
      std::cout << std::string(maxDigits - table[i][j].length(), ' ');
      std::cout << separator;
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Let's go through the optimizations step by step:

1. Removed `using namespace std;` and added `std::` prefix where necessary to avoid namespace pollution.

2. Created a `table` array of strings to store the multiplication results. Each element of the array represents one entry of the multiplication table.

3. Modified the nested loops to start from the loop index of the outer loop. This eliminates redundant calculations and reduces the number of iterations.

4. Used the pre-increment operator (++i) instead of post-increment (i++) for the loop variables.

5. Added additional constants to improve code readability. `tableSize` represents the size of the multiplication table, `maxDigits` represents the maximum number of digits in a multiplication result, and `separator` represents the separator between table entries.

6. Converted the multiplication results to strings using `std::to_string` and stored them in the `table` array.

7. Printed the multiplication table by iterating over the `table` array and adding appropriate padding and separators.

The trade-offs of these optimizations include slightly increased code complexity due to the use of a 2D array and additional string operations. However, the overall performance is expected to be significantly improved due to reduced redundant calculations and optimized memory access patterns.
