Analysis:
The given code is a simple program that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. However, there are a few areas where the code can be optimized for better performance:

1. Unnecessary use of `using namespace std`: This can be removed to avoid polluting the global namespace.

2. Redundant string concatenation: The code currently concatenates multiple strings using the `+` operator. This can be replaced with a more efficient approach to improve performance.

3. Printing to `std::cout` repeatedly: The code currently prints each multiplication result individually using `std::cout`. This can be optimized by minimizing the number of calls to `std::cout`.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std` statement.

2. Replace the string concatenation with a more efficient approach, such as using a stringstream.

3. Reduce the number of calls to `std::cout` by storing the multiplication results in a string and printing the entire string at once.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Step 1: Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std` statement.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      std::cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << std::endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Removing the `using namespace std` statement helps avoid potential naming conflicts and makes the code more readable.

Step 2: Replace string concatenation with a stringstream.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      std::stringstream ss;
      ss << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << std::endl;
      std::cout << ss.str();
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
By using a stringstream, we can efficiently concatenate the string representations of `i`, `j`, `i * j`, and the "=" character.

Step 3: Reduce the number of calls to `std::cout` by storing the multiplication results in a string.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  std::stringstream ss;

  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      ss << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << std::endl;
    }
  }

  std::cout << ss.str();

  return 0;
}
```
Instead of printing each multiplication result individually, we store the results in the `stringstream` and print the entire string at once using `std::cout`. This reduces the number of calls to `std::cout`, improving performance.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  std::stringstream ss;

  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      ss << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << std::endl;
    }
  }

  std::cout << ss.str();

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code retains the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance by reducing unnecessary string concatenations and minimizing calls to `std::cout`.
