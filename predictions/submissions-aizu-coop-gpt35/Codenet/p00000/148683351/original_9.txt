The provided code is a simple program that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. Although the code is functional, there are several areas where it can be optimized for performance and memory usage.

1. Inefficient memory usage:
- The code currently uses the `std::endl` manipulator to insert a newline character and flush the output stream after each multiplication. This can be inefficient as it forces the stream to be flushed after each operation, resulting in multiple I/O operations. Instead, we can use the `'\n'` character to insert a newline without flushing the stream.

2. Redundant computations:
- The code currently calculates the multiplication `i * j` in each iteration of the nested loops. Since the multiplication table is fixed, we can pre-calculate all the products before the loops and store them in an array. This eliminates the need for redundant calculations and improves performance.

3. Compiler optimizations:
- We can suggest using compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. These optimizations can include loop unrolling, function inlining, and compiler-specific optimization flags. However, these optimizations may vary depending on the compiler being used.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step by step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  // Pre-calculate the multiplication table products
  int products[9][9];
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      products[i-1][j-1] = i * j;
    }
  }

  // Print the multiplication table
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << products[i-1][j-1] << '\n';
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code:
- We pre-calculate the multiplication table products using a 2D array `products[9][9]`.
- The nested loops now access the pre-calculated products directly from the array, eliminating the need for redundant calculations.
- Instead of using `std::endl`, we use `'\n'` to insert a newline character, which is more efficient as it doesn't flush the output stream.
- The code is well-commented to explain the changes made and improve code readability.

These optimizations improve the performance of the code by eliminating redundant calculations and reducing the number of I/O operations. The trade-off is a slightly increased code complexity due to the introduction of the `products` array. However, the overall impact on code readability and maintainability is minimal.
