The provided code is a simple program that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. However, there are a few areas where we can optimize the code to improve its efficiency.

1. Remove unnecessary namespace usage:
   The line `using namespace std;` is not needed in this code as we are only using the `cout` object from the `std` namespace. We can remove this line and prefix `cout` with `std::` to avoid unnecessary namespace pollution.

2. Avoid repeated multiplication:
   Currently, for each value of `i` and `j`, we are performing the multiplication `i * j` twice: once to print it and once to store it in the `cout` buffer. We can eliminate this redundancy by calculating the multiplication once and storing it in a variable before printing.

3. Use pre-increment operator:
   The loop variables `i` and `j` are incremented using the post-increment operator `i++` and `j++`. However, the pre-increment operator `++i` and `++j` can be used instead, which may be slightly more efficient as it avoids the creation of a temporary object.

4. Optimize the loop conditions:
   The loop conditions `i <= 9` and `j <= 9` are checked for every iteration of the nested loop. We can optimize this by precalculating the value `9` and storing it in a variable before the loop begins.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the code optimization.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  const int maxVal = 9;
  for (int i = 1; i <= maxVal; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= maxVal; ++j) {
      int result = i * j;
      std::cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << result << '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code:
- The unnecessary `using namespace std;` line has been removed.
- The multiplication `i * j` has been calculated once and stored in the `result` variable before printing.
- The pre-increment operator `++i` and `++j` have been used instead of the post-increment operator.
- The loop conditions have been replaced with a constant variable `maxVal`, calculated and stored before the loop starts.

These optimizations minimize unnecessary computations, reduce memory usage, and improve the overall efficiency of the code. The changes made are minimal yet effective, preserving the original functionality and output of the program.
