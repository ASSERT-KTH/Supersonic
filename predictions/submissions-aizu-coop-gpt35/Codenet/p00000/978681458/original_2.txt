The provided code is a simple program that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. While the code is correct and produces the desired output, there are several areas where we can optimize it for better performance.

1. Redundant Print Statements: The current code prints the multiplication table for each pair of numbers (i, j). However, we can observe that the multiplication table is symmetric, i.e., the result of 2x3 is the same as 3x2. Therefore, we can reduce the number of print statements by half.

2. Loop Bounds: The current code uses a loop from 1 to 9 for both i and j. However, we can optimize it further by using a loop from 1 to i for j. This will eliminate redundant calculations and reduce the number of iterations.

3. Unused Variables: The variables `i` and `j` are declared as integers, but they are not used outside the scope of the loop. We can declare them inside the loop to optimize memory usage.

4. Compiler Optimization: We can also suggest the use of compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or optimizing the printf function, to further improve the performance of the code.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps and provide the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", j, i, i * j); // Print the multiplication table symmetrically
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have made the following changes:

1. We have declared the variables `i` and `j` inside the loop, reducing unnecessary memory usage.

2. We have changed the loop condition for `j` to `j <= i` to eliminate redundant calculations and reduce the number of iterations.

3. We have modified the printf statement to print the multiplication table symmetrically, reducing the number of print statements by half.

These optimizations result in better performance by reducing the number of iterations and eliminating redundant calculations. Additionally, the code is still concise and easy to understand.
