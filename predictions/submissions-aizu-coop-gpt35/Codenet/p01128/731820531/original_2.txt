Code Analysis:

1. The code includes a large number of unnecessary header files. Many of these header files are not used in the code and can be removed to reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

2. The code includes a lot of unnecessary macros and typedefs. These macros and typedefs make the code less readable and harder to understand. They should be removed or replaced with more descriptive names.

3. The code includes a number of unnecessary functions. These functions are not used in the code and can be removed to reduce the memory usage and improve the overall performance.

4. The code includes a large number of unnecessary comments. These comments do not provide any useful information and can be removed to improve the readability of the code.

5. The code includes a number of unnecessary data structures. These data structures are not used in the code and can be removed to reduce the memory usage and improve the overall performance.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: There are many unnecessary header files included in the code. These header files should be removed to reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary macros and typedefs: There are many unnecessary macros and typedefs in the code. These macros and typedefs should be removed or replaced with more descriptive names to improve the readability of the code.

3. Remove unnecessary functions: There are many unnecessary functions in the code. These functions are not used in the code and can be removed to reduce the memory usage and improve the overall performance.

4. Remove unnecessary comments: There are many unnecessary comments in the code. These comments do not provide any useful information and can be removed to improve the readability of the code.

5. Remove unnecessary data structures: There are many unnecessary data structures in the code. These data structures are not used in the code and can be removed to reduce the memory usage and improve the overall performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files
- Remove the unnecessary header files that are not used in the code. This will reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros and typedefs
- Remove the unnecessary macros and typedefs in the code. These macros and typedefs make the code less readable and harder to understand. Replace them with more descriptive names if necessary.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary functions
- Remove the unnecessary functions in the code that are not used. This will reduce the memory usage and improve the overall performance.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary comments
- Remove the unnecessary comments in the code that do not provide any useful information. This will improve the readability of the code.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary data structures
- Remove the unnecessary data structures in the code that are not used. This will reduce the memory usage and improve the overall performance.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct Point {
  double x, y;

  Point(double x = 0, double y = 0) : x(x), y(y) {}
};

struct Line {
  Point first, second;

  Line(const Point &first,
