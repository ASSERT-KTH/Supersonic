Code Analysis:
- The code includes many unnecessary and unused header files.
- The code includes many unnecessary macros and typedefs.
- The code includes unnecessary functions for printing and inputting data.
- The code includes unnecessary mathematical functions and constants.
- The code includes unnecessary overloaded operators for printing data structures.
- The code includes unnecessary geometric classes and functions that are not used in the main function.
- The code uses a sorting algorithm to sort the vector of points, which is unnecessary as the points can be inserted in sorted order.
- The code uses a loop to iterate over the vector of points, which can be replaced with a more efficient algorithm.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove all unnecessary header files that are not used in the code.
2. Remove unnecessary macros and typedefs: Remove all unnecessary macros and typedefs that are not used in the code.
3. Remove unnecessary functions: Remove all unnecessary functions for printing and inputting data.
4. Remove unnecessary mathematical functions and constants: Remove all unnecessary mathematical functions and constants that are not used in the code.
5. Remove unnecessary overloaded operators: Remove all unnecessary overloaded operators for printing data structures.
6. Remove unnecessary geometric classes and functions: Remove all unnecessary geometric classes and functions that are not used in the main function.
7. Optimize the sorting algorithm: Instead of sorting the vector of points, insert the points in sorted order.
8. Optimize the loop over the vector of points: Use a more efficient algorithm to count the number of changes in the boolean values of the points.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary header files that are not used in the code.
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
```

2. Remove unnecessary macros and typedefs: Remove the unnecessary macros and typedefs that are not used in the code.

3. Remove unnecessary functions: Remove the unnecessary functions for printing and inputting data.

4. Remove unnecessary mathematical functions and constants: Remove the unnecessary mathematical functions and constants that are not used in the code.

5. Remove unnecessary overloaded operators: Remove the unnecessary overloaded operators for printing data structures.

6. Remove unnecessary geometric classes and functions: Remove the unnecessary geometric classes and functions that are not used in the main function.

7. Optimize the sorting algorithm: Instead of sorting the vector of points, insert the points in sorted order. This can be done by using the `lower_bound` function to find the position where the new point should be inserted.

8. Optimize the loop over the vector of points: Use a more efficient algorithm to count the number of changes in the boolean values of the points. This can be done by keeping track of the previous boolean value and comparing it with the current boolean value.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

struct Point {
  double x, y;
  bool operator<(const Point& other) const {
    return x < other.x || (x == other.x && y < other.y);
  }
