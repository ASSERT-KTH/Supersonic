Code Analysis:
- The code includes a large number of header files, many of which are not used in the program. This can lead to unnecessary overhead and slower compilation times.
- The code uses various macros and template functions to simplify certain operations. While these can improve code readability, they can also introduce additional function calls and overhead.
- The code includes many unnecessary utility functions, such as print_container, print, input, etc. These functions are not used in the main program and can be removed.
- The code includes several unnecessary typedefs, such as pint, Convex, etc. These typedefs are not used in the main program and can be removed.
- The code includes a large number of unnecessary includes, such as <algorithm>, <bitset>, <cassert>, etc. These includes can be removed to reduce compilation time.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove all unnecessary includes to reduce compilation time and unnecessary overhead.
2. Remove unnecessary functions: Remove all unnecessary utility functions and typedefs to simplify the code and reduce overhead.
3. Simplify macros: Replace macro functions with inline functions or simple code to reduce function call overhead.
4. Remove unnecessary calculations: Remove any calculations that are not necessary for the desired output of the program.
5. Optimize loops: Analyze loops in the code and identify opportunities for loop unrolling or other loop optimizations.
6. Compiler optimizations: Use compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove all unnecessary includes to reduce compilation time and unnecessary overhead.
   - Remove all unnecessary include statements at the beginning of the code.

2. Remove unnecessary functions: Remove all unnecessary utility functions and typedefs to simplify the code and reduce overhead.
   - Remove all unnecessary utility functions, such as print_container, print, input, etc.
   - Remove all unnecessary typedefs, such as pint, Convex, etc.

3. Simplify macros: Replace macro functions with inline functions or simple code to reduce function call overhead.
   - Replace the macro function `chmax` with an inline function that performs the same operation.
   - Replace the macro function `chmin` with an inline function that performs the same operation.
   - Replace the macro function `uniq` with the `std::unique` function from the algorithm library.

4. Remove unnecessary calculations: Remove any calculations that are not necessary for the desired output of the program.
   - Remove the calculation of `rota` in the main function, as it is not used in any subsequent calculations.

5. Optimize loops: Analyze loops in the code and identify opportunities for loop unrolling or other loop optimizations.
   - No specific loops in the code can be optimized further.

6. Compiler optimizations: Use compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
   - Add compiler optimization flags to the build process, such as `-O2` or `-O3`, to enable compiler optimizations.
