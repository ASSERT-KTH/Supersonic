Code Analysis:
- The code includes a lot of unnecessary header files.
- The code includes many unnecessary macros and functions that are not used in the program.
- The code includes a lot of unnecessary typedefs and overloaded operators for printing and reading various data structures.
- The code includes many unnecessary utility functions for geometric calculations.
- The code uses a lot of unnecessary STL containers like vectors and pairs.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes a lot of unnecessary header files that are not used in the program. These can be removed to reduce compile time and improve performance.

2. Remove unnecessary macros, functions, and typedefs: The code includes many unnecessary macros, functions, and typedefs that are not used in the program. These can be removed to simplify the code and improve readability.

3. Remove unnecessary utility functions: The code includes many unnecessary utility functions for geometric calculations. These functions are not used in the program and can be removed.

4. Simplify data structures: The code uses many unnecessary STL containers like vectors and pairs. These can be replaced with simpler data structures to improve performance and reduce memory usage.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: The following header files are not used in the program and can be removed: <algorithm>, <bitset>, <cassert>, <cfloat>, <climits>, <cmath>, <complex>, <cstdio>, <cstdlib>, <cstring>, <ctime>, <fstream>, <functional>, <iomanip>, <list>, <map>, <memory>, <numeric>, <queue>, <set>, <sstream>, <stack>, <string>, <utility>.
   - This optimization step reduces unnecessary code and improves compile time.

2. Remove unnecessary macros, functions, and typedefs: The following macros, functions, and typedefs are not used in the program and can be removed: rep, foreach, rforeach, all, rall, CL, COPY, ten, bin, erep, revrep, pb, chmax, chmin, uniq, to_s, to_T, print_container, operator<< for vector, set, multiset, deque, map, pair, print, print2d, input, fix_pre, fast_io, trace, in_rect, in_seg.
   - This optimization step simplifies the code and improves readability.

3. Remove unnecessary utility functions: The following utility functions for geometric calculations are not used in the program and can be removed: side_G, dot, cross, ccw, is_orthogonal, is_parallel, intersect_LP, intersect_SP, intersect_LL, intersect_LS, intersect_SL, intersect_SS, dist_LP, dist_PL, dist_LL, dist_LS, dist_SL, dist_SP, dist_PS, dist_SS, ip_SS, ip_LL.
   - This optimization step reduces unnecessary code and improves compile time.

4. Simplify data structures: The code uses many unnecessary STL containers like vectors and pairs. These can be replaced with simpler data structures to improve performance and reduce memory usage.
   - The vector<pair<Point, bool>> c can be replaced with a simpler array of pairs to reduce memory usage and improve
