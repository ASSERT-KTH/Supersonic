Code Analysis:
- The code includes a large number of unnecessary header files. Many of these are not used in the code and can be removed to improve compilation time.
- The code includes several unnecessary macros and typedefs that are not used in the code. These can be removed to simplify the code and improve readability.
- The code includes many unnecessary functions and operators for printing and converting data types. These can be removed as they are not used in the code.
- The code includes several unnecessary helper functions for geometric calculations. These functions are not used in the code and can be removed.
- The code includes unnecessary comments and debugging output that can be removed to improve code readability.
