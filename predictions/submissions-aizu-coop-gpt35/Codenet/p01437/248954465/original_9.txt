The provided code is a C++ program that solves a maze traversal problem. Given a maze represented as a grid of characters, the program finds a path from a starting position to an exit position within a given number of steps. The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore the maze.

Upon analysis of the code, a few potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Avoiding unnecessary string operations: The code uses the `find` function to search for a character in the `tmp` string. This operation has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the length of the string. Since `tmp` is a constant string, we can replace the `find` operation with a constant-time O(1) lookup by using an array instead of a string.

2. Minimizing memory usage: The `nxt` array is used to store the number of steps taken to reach each position in the maze from a given direction. This array is initialized with -1 to indicate that a position has not been visited before. However, we can reduce memory usage by using a boolean array instead of a 3D array of integers. This will reduce the memory footprint by a factor of sizeof(int64) / sizeof(bool).

3. Avoiding unnecessary recursion: The `dfs` function uses recursion to explore the maze. However, the recursion is not tail-recursive, meaning that each recursive call requires additional stack space. We can optimize this by converting the recursive calls to a loop. This will reduce the stack usage and improve the overall performance of the program.

4. Minimizing unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the next position in each iteration of the loop using addition and modulus operations. These calculations can be avoided by using precomputed arrays to store the next position and the next direction for each possible direction.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization steps.
