The provided code appears to be an implementation of a maze exploration algorithm. The goal is to find a path through the maze from the starting position to the destination position within a given number of steps.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Recursive calls: The `dfs` function is implemented recursively. Recursive function calls can be expensive in terms of memory usage and stack space. It may be possible to optimize the recursive calls to improve performance.

2. Memory usage: The `nxt` array is used to store the number of steps taken for each position and direction combination. This array has a size of 100x100x4, resulting in a large amount of memory being allocated. It may be possible to reduce the memory usage by using a more efficient data structure.

3. Redundant computations: The `dfs` function performs redundant computations by recalculating the next position and direction for each step. This can be optimized to avoid unnecessary calculations.

4. Lack of compiler optimizations: The code does not include any compiler optimization flags or directives. Enabling compiler optimizations can potentially improve the performance of the code.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy is proposed:

1. Replace the recursive implementation of the `dfs` function with an iterative implementation. This will eliminate the overhead of recursive function calls and improve memory usage.

2. Replace the `nxt` array with a more memory-efficient data structure. Instead of storing the number of steps for each position and direction combination, store only the last step taken for each position and direction combination.

3. Optimize the computation of the next position and direction by precalculating them outside the loop. This will avoid redundant computations and improve efficiency.

4. Enable compiler optimizations by adding appropriate compiler flags or pragma directives.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and implementation of the optimizations.
