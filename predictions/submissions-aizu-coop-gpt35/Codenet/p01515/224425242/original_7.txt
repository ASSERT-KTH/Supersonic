Code Analysis:
- The code implements a parser that evaluates boolean expressions.
- The parser uses a recursive descent approach, where each method corresponds to a non-terminal in the grammar.
- The main function reads boolean expressions from input and calls the solve function to evaluate each expression.
- The solve function uses a loop to generate all possible combinations of true/false values for the variables in the expression and checks if the expression evaluates to true for each combination.

Potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:
1. Redundant computations: The code evaluates the same expression multiple times for different combinations of variable values. This can be optimized by caching the results of previous evaluations.
2. Memory usage: The code uses a recursive approach, which can lead to excessive stack usage for deeply nested expressions. This can be optimized by using an iterative approach instead.
3. Loop optimization: The loop in the solve function can be optimized to iterate only over the required number of combinations, instead of iterating over all possible combinations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Caching results: Use a memoization table to store the results of previous evaluations and avoid redundant computations.
2. Iterative approach: Replace the recursive calls with an iterative approach using a stack data structure.
3. Loop optimization: Calculate the number of required combinations based on the number of variables in the expression, and iterate only over those combinations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the recursive calls in the Parser class with an iterative approach using a stack.
2. Add a memoization table to store the results of previous evaluations.
3. Calculate the number of required combinations based on the number of variables in the expression.
4. Iterate over the required combinations and evaluate the expression using the iterative approach.
5. Return the optimized code.

Explanation:
1. The formula method in the Parser class has been modified to use an iterative approach using a stack. The operands stack is used to store intermediate results, and the operators stack is used to store operators.
2. The while loop in the formula method iterates over the expression and performs the necessary calculations using the operators and operands stacks.
3. A memoization table, implemented as an unordered_map, has been added to cache the results of previous evaluations. The key for each entry in the memoization table consists of the mask value and the input expression.
4. The number of required combinations is calculated based on the number of variables in the expression using the count_if function from the algorithm library.
5. The loop in the solve function is optimized to iterate only over the required number of combinations.
6. Before evaluating the expression for each combination, the code checks if the result is already present in the memoization table. If so, it uses the cached result instead of performing the evaluation again.
7. The optimized code maintains the functionality and output of the original code, but with improved performance and reduced memory usage.

Trade-offs:
1. The iterative approach using a stack introduces some additional complexity compared to the original recursive approach. However, the improved performance and reduced memory usage justify this trade-off.
2. The memoization table increases memory usage to store the cached results. However, this trade-off is necessary to avoid redundant computations and improve performance.
