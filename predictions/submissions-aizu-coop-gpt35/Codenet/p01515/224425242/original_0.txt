The given code is a C++ program that evaluates a boolean expression for a given set of inputs. The program reads boolean expressions from standard input and evaluates them using a backtracking algorithm. The algorithm uses recursion to evaluate the boolean expression. 

To optimize this code, we can focus on improving the efficiency of the backtracking algorithm and reducing unnecessary computations. 

Optimization Strategy:

1. Avoid unnecessary recursion: The current implementation of the `solve` function uses recursion to evaluate the boolean expression. However, this is not necessary as the expression can be evaluated iteratively. We can replace the recursion with an iterative loop.

2. Avoid unnecessary string copying: The `solve` function takes the input string `S` by value, which creates a copy of the string. This can be avoided by passing the string by reference.

3. Use bitwise operations instead of `pow`: The current implementation uses the expression `(1 << 11)` to calculate the value of `(2^11)`. This can be replaced with the more efficient expression `1 << 11`.

4. Use boolean literals instead of integers: The `Parser` class uses `1` and `0` to represent boolean values. We can replace these with `true` and `false` to improve code clarity.

5. Use prefix increment instead of postfix increment: The current implementation uses postfix increment (`begin++`) in multiple places. We can replace it with prefix increment (`++begin`) to avoid the overhead of creating a temporary copy.

6. Avoid unnecessary copying of iterators: The `begin` iterator is passed by reference to multiple functions. However, the functions do not modify the iterator. We can pass it by value instead to avoid unnecessary copying.
