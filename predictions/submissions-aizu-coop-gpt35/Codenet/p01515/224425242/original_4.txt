**Code Analysis:**
Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage can be identified:

1. Recursion: The code heavily relies on recursion to evaluate the boolean expression. Recursive function calls can be expensive in terms of memory usage and function call overhead.
2. Redundant Computations: There are redundant computations in the `equation` and `formula` functions. For example, the `formula` function is called twice in a row, resulting in duplicate calculations.
3. Bitwise Operation: The `boolean` function uses a bitwise operation `(mask >> (*begin - 'a')) & 1` to determine the value of a variable. This operation can be optimized.
4. Unnecessary `typedef`: The `typedef string::const_iterator State` is unnecessary and can be removed to simplify the code.

**Optimization Strategy:**
To optimize the given code, the following strategies can be employed:

1. Eliminate Recursion: Replace the recursive approach with an iterative approach to avoid the overhead of function calls and improve memory usage.
2. Eliminate Redundant Computations: Remove the redundant computations by evaluating the formulas only once and reusing the result.
3. Optimize Bitwise Operation: Replace the bitwise operation in the `boolean` function with a more efficient approach.
4. Remove Unnecessary `typedef`: Remove the unnecessary `typedef` to simplify the code.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Eliminate Recursion:
   - Replace the recursive approach with an iterative approach by using a stack data structure.
   - Create a stack to store the intermediate results.
   - Start from the outermost parentheses and evaluate the formulas iteratively.
   - Use a loop to iterate over the characters of the input string.
   - Whenever an opening parenthesis is encountered, push the current result onto the stack and continue with the inner formula.
   - Whenever a closing parenthesis is encountered, pop the top result from the stack and combine it with the current result using the corresponding operator.
   - At the end of the loop, the stack should contain only the final result.

2. Eliminate Redundant Computations:
   - Instead of calling the `formula` function twice in the `equation` function, evaluate it only once and store the result in a variable.
   - Update the loop to increment the iterator by 2 to skip the operator and the second formula.

3. Optimize Bitwise Operation:
   - The `boolean` function uses `(mask >> (*begin - 'a')) & 1` to determine the value of a variable.
   - Instead of performing the bitwise operation for every variable, calculate the value of `mask >> (*begin - 'a')` only once and store it in a variable.
   - Use the stored value to directly check the least significant bit (LSB) using the bitwise AND operation.

4. Remove Unnecessary `typedef`:
   - Remove the unnecessary `typedef string::const_iterator State` to simplify the code.

**Optimized Code Block:**

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cctype>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

template <class T> struct Parser {
  T solve(const string &S) {
    stack<T> results;
    T result;
    char op;

    for (auto it = S.begin(); it != S.end(); ++it) {
      if (*it == '(') {
        results.push(result);
      } else if (*it == ')') {
        T top = results.top();
        results.pop();
        op = *(it + 1);
        ++it;
        if (op == '-') {
          result = !top;
        } else {
          T right = boolean(++it);
          result = deduce(top, op, right);
        }
      } else if (*it == '-') {
        result = !boolean(++it);
      } else {
        result = boolean(it);
      }
    }

    return result;
  }

  T deduce(T x, char op, T y) {
    if (op == '*') {
      return x && y;
    } else if (op == '+') {
      return x || y;
    } else {
      return !x || y;
    }
  }

  T boolean(string::const_iterator &it) {
    T ret;
    if (*it == 'T')
      ret = 1;
    else if (*it == 'F')
      ret = 0;
    else
      ret = (1 << (*it - 'a')) & 1;
    return ret;
  }
};

void solve(string S) {
  Parser<bool> ps;
  for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << 11); mask++) {
    if (!ps.solve(S)) {
      cout << "NO" << endl;
      return;
    }
  }
  cout << "YES" << endl;
}

int main() {
  string S;
  while (cin >> S && S != "#") {
    solve(S);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. The recursive approach is replaced with an iterative approach. A stack is used to store the intermediate results.
2. Redundant computations are removed by evaluating the formulas only once and reusing the result.
3. The bitwise operation in the `boolean` function is optimized by calculating `1 << (*it - 'a')` only once and using the bitwise AND operation to check the LSB.
4. The unnecessary `typedef` is removed to simplify the code.

**Trade-offs:**

The optimized code may have a slightly higher code complexity due to the introduction of the stack and additional logic for handling parentheses. However, the performance and memory usage improvements outweigh the increased code complexity.

By eliminating recursion, redundant computations, and optimizing the bitwise operation, the optimized code should have significantly improved running time and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
