Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers.
- It then reads another integer `t` and for each of the `t` integers, it checks if there is a subset of the array that sums up to that integer.
- The code uses a recursive function `solve` to check all possible subsets.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the global variable `N` with a local variable inside the `main` function. This will reduce memory usage and make the code more readable.
2. Change the return type of the `solve` function to `bool` instead of `int`. This will make the code clearer and more consistent.
3. Use a memoization technique to avoid redundant computations in the `solve` function. This will improve the running time of the code.
4. Consider using a more efficient algorithm to solve the subset sum problem, such as dynamic programming. This will provide a significant performance improvement.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the line `int *N;` with `int n;` inside the `main` function. This will make `N` a local variable instead of a global variable.
2. Change the return type of the `solve` function from `int` to `bool`. Since the function returns `true` or `false`, it is more appropriate to use the `bool` type.
3. Add a memoization table to store the results of already computed subsets. Initialize it with all `false` values. This will reduce redundant recursive calls.
4. Modify the `solve` function to check the memoization table before making recursive calls. If the result for a particular subproblem is already computed, return it directly from the memoization table.
5. Modify the `solve` function to store the computed result in the memoization table before returning it.
6. Replace the recursive calls in the `solve` function with a loop that iterates over all remaining elements in the array. This will avoid unnecessary recursive overhead.
7. Replace the recursive calls in the loop with direct table lookups in the memoization table. This will further reduce redundant computations.
8. Use dynamic programming to solve the subset sum problem. Create a 2D table `dp` of size `(n+1) x (m+1)` to store the intermediate results. Initialize it with all `false` values.
9. Set `dp[i][0] = true` for all `i` from 0 to `n`. This means that an empty subset can always sum up to 0.
10. Use a nested loop to iterate over all elements of the array and all possible sums from 1 to `m`. For each element, check if the current sum can be achieved by including or excluding the element. Update `dp[i][j]` accordingly.
11. Finally, for each query, check if `dp[n][p]` is `true` or `false` and print the corresponding result.

  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    int p;
    scanf("%d", &p);
    if (subsetSum(nums, p)) {
      cout << "yes" << endl;

The optimized code uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the subset sum problem. It avoids redundant computations by using a memoization table. This results in a significant improvement in running time.
