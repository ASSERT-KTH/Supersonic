Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `n` and an array `N` of size `n` from input.
- It then reads an integer `t` from input.
- For each `t`, it reads an integer `p` and calls the `solve` function with initial parameters `i=0` and `m=p`.
- The `solve` function is a recursive function that tries to find a combination of numbers from the array `N` that sums up to `m`.
- If a combination is found, it returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.
- The result is printed as "yes" if `solve` returns `true`, and "no" otherwise.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The array `N` is allocated using `calloc` which initializes all elements to zero. However, this is not necessary because the array is immediately overwritten by reading values from input. We can simply declare `N` as `int* N = nullptr;` and remove the `calloc` call.
2. Use pass-by-reference for `solve` parameters: The `solve` function currently takes `i` and `m` as parameters by value. This means that for each recursive call, a copy of these parameters is made. Since the function modifies these parameters, it would be more efficient to pass them by reference (`int& i, int& m`) to avoid unnecessary copying.
3. Add memoization: The current implementation of `solve` is naive and does not take advantage of previously computed results. This can lead to redundant computations for the same values of `i` and `m`. We can improve the performance by adding memoization, which stores the results of previous computations and reuses them when needed.
4. Avoid unnecessary ternary operation: The line `return m == 0 ? true : false;` can be simplified to `return m == 0;` since the comparison already returns a boolean value.
5. Optimize input/output operations: The code uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output, which can be slower compared to other input/output methods. We can use `cin` and `cout` for faster input/output. Additionally, we can use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` to disable synchronization between C and C++ input/output, which can further improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the unnecessary memory allocation by changing the declaration of `N` to `int* N = nullptr;`.
2. Modify the `solve` function to take `i` and `m` as references (`int& i, int& m`).
3. Add memoization to the `solve` function by using a `vector` to store the results of previous computations. We can create a 2D vector `memo` of size `n+1` by `t+1`, initialized with `false`. Each element `memo[i][j]` will store the result of `solve(i, j)`.
4. In the `solve` function, before making the recursive calls, check if the result for the current `i` and `m` is already computed and return it if found. If not found, store the computed result in `memo[i][m]`.
5. Remove the unnecessary ternary operation in the `solve` function by changing the line `return m == 0 ? true : false;` to `return m == 0;`.
6. Replace the usage of `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`.
7. Add `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` before `cin` to improve performance.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int *N;
int n;
vector<vector<bool>> memo;

bool solve(int& i, int& m) {
  if (i == n) {
    return m == 0;
  }
  
  if (memo[i][m]) {
    return memo[i][m];
  }
  
  bool result = solve(++i, m - N[i]) || solve(i, m);
  memo[i][m] = result;
  
  return result;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int t;
  cin >> n;
  N = new int[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> N[i];
  }
  cin >> t;
  memo.assign(n + 1, vector<bool>(t + 1, false));
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    int p;
    cin >> p;
    int index = 0;
    if (solve(index, p)) {
      cout << "yes" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
  
  delete[] N;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should improve the efficiency of the original program by avoiding unnecessary memory allocation, using pass-by-reference, adding memoization, and optimizing input/output operations.
