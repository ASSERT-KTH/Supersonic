The given code is a C++ program that solves a subset sum problem using recursive backtracking. The program takes an array of integers `N`, the size of the array `n`, and a number `t` as input. For each query `p`, the program checks whether there exists a subset of `N` that sums to `p` and prints "yes" or "no" accordingly.

While the code accomplishes its task, there are several optimizations that can be applied to improve its efficiency:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The code currently dynamically allocates memory for the array `N` using `calloc`. Since the size of the array is known at compile-time, we can replace `N` with a static array of appropriate size.

2. Use pass-by-reference instead of pass-by-value: The function `solve` currently takes `i` and `m` as value parameters. Since the function modifies the values of `i` and `m` recursively, it would be more efficient to pass them by reference.

3. Memoization: The recursive implementation of `solve` performs redundant computations. By using memoization, we can avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.

4. Use early exit: If we find a subset that sums to `p`, we don't need to continue searching for other subsets. We can add an early exit condition to improve the average-case performance.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool solve(const vector<int>& N, int i, int m, vector<vector<int>>& memo) {
  if (m == 0) {
    return true;
  }
  if (i == N.size() || m < 0) {
    return false;
  }
  if (memo[i][m] != -1) {
    return memo[i][m];
  }
  bool result = solve(N, i + 1, m - N[i], memo) || solve(N, i + 1, m, memo);
  memo[i][m] = result ? 1 : 0;
  return result;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> N(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> N[i];
  }
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    int p;
    cin >> p;
    vector<vector<int>> memo(n, vector<int>(p + 1, -1));
    if (solve(N, 0, p, memo)) {
      cout << "yes" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
}
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the optimizations made:

1. Replaced `int* N` with `vector<int> N`: Instead of using a dynamically allocated array, we can use a `vector` to store the input array `N`. Vectors offer similar performance characteristics as arrays, but with the added benefits of automatic memory management and size tracking.

2. Changed `solve` function signature: The `solve` function now takes the array `N` as a constant reference, the current index `i` and remaining sum `m` as value parameters, and a `vector<vector<int>>` as a reference parameter for memoization. By making these changes, we avoid unnecessary memory allocations and improve code readability.

3. Added memoization: The `solve` function now uses a memoization table to store the results of previously solved subproblems. The memoization table is a 2D vector of integers initialized with -1. Before making a recursive call, we check if the solution for the subproblem has already been computed and return it directly if available.

4. Early exit condition: If we find a subset that sums to `p`, we exit the loop and print "yes" immediately. This avoids unnecessary computations and improves the average-case performance.

Overall, these optimizations improve the code's efficiency by reducing redundant computations and memory allocations. The use of memoization significantly reduces the time complexity of the algorithm from exponential to pseudo-polynomial.
