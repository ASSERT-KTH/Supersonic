Analysis:

1. The `solve` function is using recursion to iterate through all possible combinations of elements in the array `N` to check if their sum is equal to `m`. This approach has an exponential time complexity and can be highly inefficient for large values of `n` and `m`.
2. The code uses a dynamic array `N` to store the input values. However, there is no need to allocate memory dynamically in this case since the size of the array is known at compile time. Using a static array would be more efficient.
3. The code includes unnecessary header files, such as `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<complex>`, etc., which are not used in the program. Removing these unnecessary headers will reduce the compilation time and improve overall efficiency.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the dynamic array `N` with a static array since the size is known at compile time.
2. Use an iterative approach instead of recursion to solve the problem. This will eliminate the overhead of function calls and improve performance.
3. Remove unnecessary header files to reduce compilation time.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the dynamic array `N` with a static array since the size is known at compile time. This eliminates the need for dynamic memory allocation and improves efficiency.

2. Modify the `solve` function to use an iterative approach instead of recursion. This can be done by using a stack to keep track of the values of `i` and `m` instead of making recursive calls. This eliminates the overhead of function calls and improves performance.

3. Remove unnecessary header files to reduce compilation time. The headers `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<complex>`, `<cstdio>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<cstring>`, `<deque>`, `<functional>`, `<iostream>`, `<list>`, `<map>`, `<numeric>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<string>`, `<utility>`, and `<vector>` are not used in the program and can be removed.

Optimized Code Block:

Below is the optimized code with the suggested changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

const int MAX_N = 1000;

int N[MAX_N];
int n;

bool solve(int m) {
  bool dp[MAX_N + 1][MAX_N + 1] = {false};

  dp[0][0] = true;

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= m; j++) {
      dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
      if (j >= N[i - 1]) {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] || dp[i - 1][j - N[i - 1]];
      }
    }
  }

  return dp[n][m];
}

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> N[i];
  }
  std::cin >> t;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    int p;
    std::cin >> p;
    if (solve(p)) {
      std::cout << "yes" << std::endl;
    } else {
      std::cout << "no" << std::endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code:

1. The dynamic array `N` is replaced with a static array `N[MAX_N]`.
2. The `solve` function is modified to use an iterative approach with a dynamic programming technique. It uses a 2D boolean array `dp[MAX_N + 1][MAX_N + 1]` to store the results of subproblems. The outer loop iterates over the elements of `N`, and the inner loop iterates over `m` from 0 to the target value. The solution is built bottom-up, and each cell in the `dp` array represents whether a subset of elements can sum up to the given value of `m`. This approach has a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the number of elements in `N` and m is the target value.
3. Unnecessary header files are removed to reduce compilation time.

The optimized code preserves the functionality and output of the original code while improving efficiency by eliminating unnecessary computations and using a more efficient algorithm.
