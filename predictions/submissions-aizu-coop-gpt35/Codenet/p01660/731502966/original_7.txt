Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structure: The current implementation uses a dynamic array `N` to store the input values. However, since the array size is fixed at `M`, we can instead use a static array to improve memory usage and access time.

2. Redundant computations: The `checkPath` function is called multiple times with the same arguments, resulting in redundant computations. We can optimize this by memoizing the results of previous function calls and reusing them if the same arguments are encountered again.

3. Inefficient loop: The loop in the `MakePath` function iterates from `0` to `6` to calculate the `bestpath`. However, we can optimize this loop by using a range-based for loop instead.

4. Unnecessary dynamic memory allocation: The `path` array is dynamically allocated in the `MakePath` function, but it is never deallocated. This can lead to memory leaks. We can optimize this by allocating the `path` array in the `main` function and passing it as a parameter to `MakePath`.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the dynamic array `N` with a static array.
2. Implement memoization in the `checkPath` function to avoid redundant computations.
3. Optimize the loop in the `MakePath` function using a range-based for loop.
4. Allocate the `path` array in the `main` function and pass it as a parameter to `MakePath`.
5. Remove the unnecessary dynamic memory deallocation for `path`.

Let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and optimized code block.
