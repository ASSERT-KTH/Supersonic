Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structure: The `visit` array is a static boolean array of size `MAX_M` which is unnecessary. It can be replaced with a dynamic boolean array that is allocated with a size of `M` based on the input.

2. Redundant function calls: The `MakePath` function is called recursively for every position, even if it has already been visited. This leads to redundant computations and can be optimized.

3. Unnecessary calculations: The `checkPath` lambda function calculates the position by adding `N[moveto]` to the `moveto` variable. This calculation can be done once outside the lambda function to avoid repeated calculations.

4. Loop optimizations: The loop in the `MakePath` function can be optimized by using loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations and improve cache utilization.

5. Compiler optimizations: The use of compiler optimizations, such as loop vectorization and auto-vectorization, can be suggested to the compiler through pragma directives to further optimize the code.

Now, let's proceed with optimizing the code step-by-step.
