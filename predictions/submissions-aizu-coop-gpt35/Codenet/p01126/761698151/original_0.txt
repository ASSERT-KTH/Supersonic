The given code implements a program that simulates a game called Amida. The program takes input values `n`, `m`, and `a` and then reads `m` lines of input to construct a 2D array `amida` representing the game board. The program then simulates the movement of a ball through the game board and outputs the final position of the ball.

Here are some potential optimizations for this code:

1. Use a more efficient data structure for the game board:
   - The current implementation uses a 2D array `amida` to represent the game board. This approach is inefficient because it allocates memory for a large number of cells, most of which are not used.
   - An alternative approach is to use a more compact data structure, such as a linked list or an array of linked lists, to represent the connections between the columns of the game board. This would eliminate the need for the 2D array and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary computations:
   - The current implementation checks for the end of the game (`n == 0 && m == 0 && a == 0`) inside the main loop. This check can be moved to the beginning of the loop to avoid unnecessary computations.

3. Optimize the ball movement simulation:
   - The current implementation iterates over each column in reverse order and checks if the ball can move up or down. This can be optimized by using a binary search to find the highest column that the ball can move to. This would reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

4. Use compiler optimizations:
   - The code can be compiled with optimization flags (e.g., `-O2` or `-O3`) to enable compiler optimizations. These optimizations can include loop unrolling, function inlining, and other transformations that can improve performance.

Now, let's go through each step and optimize the code accordingly.
