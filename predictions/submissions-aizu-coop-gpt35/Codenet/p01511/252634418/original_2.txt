The given code is a C++ program that solves a dynamic programming problem. It uses matrices and vectors to perform matrix multiplication and exponentiation. The objective is to optimize the code for efficiency, focusing on reducing running time and minimizing memory usage.

Let's start by analyzing the code and identifying potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary and can slow down compilation time. It would be better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Use of `using namespace std`: This statement brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code harder to understand. It is better to avoid using this statement and explicitly specify the namespace for each name.

3. Use of macros: The code uses macros for defining `rep`, `all`, `pb`, `fi`, `se`, and `dbg`. While these macros provide convenience, they can also make the code harder to read and understand. It would be better to replace them with regular functions or inline constants.

4. Excessive use of nested loops: The code contains several nested loops, which can result in poor performance. We should look for opportunities to reduce the number of nested loops or optimize them.

5. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a `vector` of `vector` (`mat`) for matrix representation and a `map` for storing objects. These data structures can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and access time. We should consider using more efficient alternatives, such as arrays or unordered maps.

6. Inefficient matrix multiplication: The current matrix multiplication implementation uses three nested loops, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^3). We can explore more efficient algorithms, such as Strassen's algorithm or parallelization, to improve matrix multiplication performance.

7. Redundant computations: The code performs some redundant computations, such as recalculating the same matrix powers multiple times. We can optimize these computations by storing the intermediate results and reusing them when needed.

Based on these observations, let's formulate an optimization strategy and explain each step in detail.
