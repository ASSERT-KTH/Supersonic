The given code is a C++ program that solves a dynamic programming problem. It takes input in the form of the width (`w`), height (`h`), and number of objects (`n`) in each test case. For each test case, it calculates the number of ways to reach the last column of the grid (`w-1`) from the first column (`0`) in a grid of size `w x h`, considering certain restrictions on object placements.

Upon analysis of the code, the following potential optimizations can be made:

1. Avoid Unnecessary Includes: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes all standard library headers, which can be unnecessary and can increase compilation time. Instead, include only the required headers.

2. Avoid Using Macros: The code uses macros for loop iteration (`rep`) and vector indexing (`pb`). Using macros can make the code less readable and can lead to unintended side effects. Replace these macros with inline functions or const variables.

3. Avoid Using `using namespace std`: The code uses the `using namespace std` statement, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less maintainable. Instead, use the `std::` prefix to explicitly specify the namespace for standard library entities.

4. Avoid Using `endl`: The code uses `endl` to insert a newline character and flush the output stream. However, this can be inefficient as it flushes the stream every time. Use `'\n'` instead to insert a newline character and manually flush the stream when necessary.

5. Avoid Using `map` for Object Storage: The code uses a `map` to store the objects based on their y-coordinate, which can be inefficient. Instead, use a `vector` of vectors to represent the grid and mark the presence of objects at their respective coordinates.

6. Optimize Matrix Multiplication: The code uses a matrix multiplication function (`mul`) to multiply two matrices. This function performs three nested loops, which can be optimized by loop unrolling and loop reordering.

7. Avoid Unnecessary Matrix Exponentiation: The code uses matrix exponentiation (`mat_pow`) to raise a matrix to a power. However, this is not required as the powers of the matrix (`O`) have a specific pattern that can be calculated without exponentiation.

8. Optimize Memory Usage: The code uses a `vector` to represent a matrix, where each row is a `vector` of `long long` integers. This can be memory inefficient as each row is stored as a separate `vector` object. Instead, use a single continuous block of memory to represent the matrix.

9. Avoid Redundant Matrix Operations: The code performs several redundant matrix operations by multiplying the same matrices multiple times. Instead, perform these operations only once and reuse the result.

10. Avoid Unnecessary Function Calls: The code uses a function `mul` to multiply a matrix with a vector. However, this can be avoided by directly multiplying the matrix elements with the vector elements inside a loop.

11. Use Compiler Optimizations: Use compiler optimizations, such as optimization flags (`-O2`, `-O3`) or pragma directives (`#pragma omp`, `#pragma GCC optimize`) to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
