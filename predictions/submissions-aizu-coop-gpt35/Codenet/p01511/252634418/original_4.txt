The given code appears to be solving a dynamic programming problem. It uses matrices and vectors to represent and manipulate the data. To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The given code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended for production code. We can remove this and include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<map>`.

2. Avoid unnecessary template functions: The code defines template functions for printing pairs and vectors. These functions are not used in the given code and can be safely removed.

3. Optimize matrix multiplication: The `mul` function is used to multiply matrices and vectors. Currently, it uses three nested loops, which can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations.

4. Optimize matrix exponentiation: The `mat_pow` function is used to exponentiate a matrix. We can optimize this function to reduce the number of matrix multiplications.

5. Optimize the main loop: The main loop processes test cases. We can optimize this loop by avoiding unnecessary operations and redundant computations.

6. Use more efficient data structures: The `map<ll, vector<int>> obj` is used to store objects at different heights. We can use a more efficient data structure, such as a `vector<vector<int>>`, to store this information.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step.
