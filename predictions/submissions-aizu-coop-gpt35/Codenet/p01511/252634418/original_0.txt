The provided code calculates the number of paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid, considering certain obstacles. The code uses matrix multiplication to efficiently calculate the number of paths. However, we can optimize the code further to improve its efficiency.

Here is the step-by-step optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it includes all standard library headers and can slow down the compilation. We should only include the necessary headers: `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<map>`, and `<cstdio>`.

2. Avoid namespace `std`: The code uses the `using namespace std;` directive, which is generally not recommended in C++. It is better to explicitly use the `std::` prefix for standard library entities to avoid potential naming conflicts.

3. Replace macros with inline functions: The code uses macros for `rep`, `all`, `pb`, `fi`, `se`, and `dbg`. We should replace these macros with inline functions to improve type safety.

4. Avoid unnecessary copies: The code creates unnecessary copies of vectors and maps. We can use references instead to avoid these copies.

5. Improve data structure for objects: The code uses a map to store the objects. However, a map has an O(log n) complexity for insertion, which can be improved to O(1) using a vector of vectors. We can store the objects in a 2D vector, where each row represents a specific y-coordinate and contains the x-coordinates of the objects. This change will significantly improve the insertion time and overall performance.

6. Optimize matrix multiplication: The current implementation of matrix multiplication multiplies each element of the resulting matrix independently. We can optimize this by using loop unrolling and loop interchange techniques. Additionally, we can take advantage of the fact that the matrix is sparse and contains many zeros. We can skip unnecessary multiplications by checking if the value of `B[i][i + j]` is zero before multiplying in the inner loop.

7. Avoid unnecessary matrix power calculations: The code uses `mat_pow` to calculate the power of matrix `O`. However, we can optimize this by calculating the powers of `O` incrementally. We can update `O` on each iteration of the loop instead of calculating the power from scratch. This change will reduce the number of matrix multiplications and improve performance.

8. Optimize multiplication with vector: The current implementation of multiplying a matrix with a vector has a complexity of O(n^2). We can optimize this by using a loop unrolling technique and checking for zero values in the matrix.

9. Remove unnecessary modulo operation: The code uses the modulo operation `%` on each element of the matrix and vector. Since the result is only used in the final calculation of `ans`, we can remove the modulo operation during intermediate calculations to improve performance. We only need to take the modulo once at the end.

10. Use `printf` instead of `cout`: The code uses `cout` for printing the output. However, `printf` is generally faster and more efficient for formatted output. We should replace the `printf` statement with `cout` for printing the input values.

Now, let's implement these optimizations in the code:
