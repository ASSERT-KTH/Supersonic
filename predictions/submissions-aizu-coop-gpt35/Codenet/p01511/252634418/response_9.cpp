The given code appears to be a solution to a problem involving matrix exponentiation. The main goal of the code is to calculate the number of paths from the top-left corner of a grid to the bottom-right corner, with certain obstacles present in the grid.

Upon analysis, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Matrix Multiplication: The `mul` function is used to perform matrix multiplication. However, the current implementation uses three nested loops, which results in a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the size of the matrix. This can be a performance bottleneck, especially when dealing with large matrices.

2. Power Calculation: The `mat_pow` function calculates the power of a matrix using repeated squaring. While this is an efficient algorithm, it can be further optimized by avoiding unnecessary calculations.

3. Memory Usage: The code uses a lot of memory for storing matrices and vectors. This can be a concern when dealing with large inputs. Optimizing the memory usage can help reduce the overall memory footprint.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Optimize Matrix Multiplication: Use a more efficient algorithm for matrix multiplication, such as the Strassen's algorithm or an optimized version of the conventional matrix multiplication algorithm.

2. Optimize Power Calculation: Modify the `mat_pow` function to avoid unnecessary calculations by checking the bits of the exponent and only performing multiplication when necessary.

3. Optimize Memory Usage: Reduce the memory footprint by using smaller data types where possible, avoiding unnecessary copying of data, and releasing memory when it is no longer needed.
