Code Analysis:
1. The code defines several macros and template functions for debugging and printing purposes.
2. It uses a matrix multiplication function `mul` to perform matrix operations.
3. The code uses a map `obj` to store the positions of objects in a 2D space.
4. It initializes matrices `O` and `A` with values based on the width `w` of the 2D space.
5. It iterates over the objects in `obj` and performs matrix operations based on their positions.
6. Finally, it calculates the result by multiplying matrix `A` with a vector `b` and prints the answer.

Potential Optimization Strategies:
1. Avoid unnecessary template functions and macros: The template functions `operator<<` for `pair` and `vector` are not used in the code. Removing them will simplify the code and reduce compile time.
2. Optimize matrix multiplication: The current implementation of matrix multiplication (`mul` function) uses three nested loops, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^3). This can be improved by using more efficient matrix multiplication algorithms such as Strassen's algorithm or the Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm.
3. Optimize object position storage: The current implementation uses a map `obj` to store the positions of objects. Iterating over this map in each iteration can be expensive. Instead, we can use a 2D vector to directly store the object positions, eliminating the need for map operations.
4. Optimize matrix initialization: The matrices `O` and `A` are initialized with certain values based on the width `w`. This initialization can be simplified by using nested loops instead of the current manual initialization.
5. Optimize matrix exponentiation: The `mat_pow` function uses a binary exponentiation algorithm to calculate the power of a matrix. This can be optimized by using exponentiation by squaring or other efficient matrix exponentiation algorithms.
6. Optimize multiplication with matrix B: The code multiplies matrix `B` with matrix `A` in each iteration. This can be optimized by storing the indices of the columns to be zeroed out in a separate vector and directly modifying the matrix `A` instead of creating a separate matrix `B`.

Step-by-Step Explanation of Optimizations:

1. Remove unnecessary template functions and macros:
   - Remove the template functions `operator<<` for `pair` and `vector`.
   - Remove the macros `rep`, `all`, `pb`, `fi`, `se`, and `dbg`.
   - Update the `mul` function to take matrices and vectors by reference to avoid unnecessary copying.

2. Optimize matrix multiplication:
   - Replace the current implementation of the `mul` function with an optimized matrix multiplication algorithm, such as Strassen's algorithm or the Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm.
   - This will reduce the time complexity of matrix multiplication from O(n^3) to a more efficient algorithm with a lower time complexity.

3. Optimize object position storage:
   - Replace the map `obj` with a 2D vector to directly store the object positions.
   - Instead of using `obj[y].pb(x)`, directly access the 2D vector using `obj[y][x] = true` to mark the object position.
   - This will eliminate the need for map operations and improve performance.

4. Optimize matrix initialization:
   - Replace the manual initialization of matrices `O` and `A` with nested loops.
   - Use `O[i][i + j] = 1` and `A[i][i] = 1` to initialize the matrices.
   - This will simplify the code and improve readability.

5. Optimize matrix exponentiation:
   - Replace the current binary exponentiation algorithm in the `mat_pow` function with a more efficient algorithm, such as exponentiation by squaring.
   - This will optimize the matrix exponentiation process and reduce the number of multiplications required.

6. Optimize multiplication with matrix B:
   - Instead of multiplying matrix `B` with matrix `A` using a separate matrix `B`, directly modify matrix `A` in place.
   - Store the indices of the columns to be zeroed out in a separate vector.
   - Iterate over the positions in `p.se` and set the corresponding columns in `A` to zero using the stored indices.
   - This will eliminate the need to create a separate matrix `B` and reduce memory usage.
