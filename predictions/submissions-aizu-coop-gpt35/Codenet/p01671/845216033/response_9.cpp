The given code is a C++ program that solves a graph problem using the Union-Find data structure. The program takes as input the number of nodes N and the number of edges M, followed by M lines representing the edges and their weights. The program then calculates the cost of the minimum spanning tree of the graph and outputs the cost of each edge in the original graph.

Upon analysis of the code, several potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Inefficient data structures:
   - The program uses a vector of integers `data` to represent the Union-Find data structure. This implementation has a high memory overhead due to the use of a vector, and the `unite` and `find` operations have a time complexity of O(logN) due to the use of path compression and union by rank. A more efficient alternative is to use a flat array to represent the Union-Find data structure, which reduces the memory overhead and improves the time complexity of the operations to O(α(N)), where α(N) is the inverse Ackermann function.

2. Redundant computations:
   - The program computes the size of each connected component using the Union-Find data structure. However, this information is not used in the final output, making these computations unnecessary. Removing these computations can improve the running time of the program.

3. Inefficient loop iteration:
   - The program uses a loop to iterate over the edges and populate the `edges` vector. However, this loop can be eliminated by directly populating the `edges` vector while reading the input. This avoids the need for an additional loop and improves the efficiency of the program.

4. Unnecessary memory allocations:
   - The program uses a vector of sets (`component`) to store the edges of each connected component. However, since the edges are stored in a set, each edge is allocated separately in memory, leading to unnecessary memory allocations and increased memory usage. A more efficient alternative is to use a vector of vectors to store the edges, which reduces the memory overhead and improves the memory usage of the program.

To optimize the given code, the following steps can be taken:

1. Replace the vector `data` in the `UnionFind` struct with a flat array to represent the Union-Find data structure. This reduces the memory overhead and improves the time complexity of the operations.

2. Remove the computation of the component sizes in the `UnionFind` struct, as this information is not used in the final output.

3. Eliminate the loop that populates the `edges` vector by directly populating the `edges` vector while reading the input. This improves the efficiency of the program by avoiding an additional loop.

4. Replace the vector of sets (`component`) with a vector of vectors to store the edges of each connected component. This reduces the memory overhead and improves the memory usage of the program.
