Code Analysis:
1. The program takes inputs for the number of nodes (N), number of edges (M), and an array A of size 3.
2. It then reads M pairs of integers representing edges and stores them in a graph G.
3. The program initializes a 3D array dp of size 101x51x51 and sets dp[0][i][i] to true for all i.
4. It then iterates over i from 1 to 100, j from 0 to N-1, and k from 0 to N-1 and sets dp[i][j][to] to true for all to in G[k] if dp[i-1][j][k] is true.
5. The program initializes an array used of size 51 with all elements set to false.
6. It enters an infinite loop and checks if there exists an index i such that for each element a in A, there are exactly three indices k such that dp[a][i][k] is true and used[k] is true. If such an index i exists, it marks used[i] as true and checks if used[0] is true. If it is, it prints the iteration count and exits the loop.
7. If no such index i is found, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE".

Potential optimizations:
1. The use of the "bits/stdc++.h" header is generally discouraged as it includes unnecessary headers and can slow down compilation. Instead, specific headers should be included as required.
2. The use of a 3D array dp with dimensions 101x51x51 can be optimized to save memory.
3. The infinite loop can be replaced with a loop that iterates up to N times, where N is the number of nodes.
4. The inner loop that checks for each element in A can be optimized to break early if fewer than three indices are found.
5. The use of the vector idx can be avoided by directly marking used[i] as true inside the loop.
6. The program can be optimized to exit the loop as soon as used[0] is found to be true, instead of continuing the loop until the end.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the "bits/stdc++.h" header with specific headers needed for the program.
2. Replace the 3D array dp with a 2D array dp of size 51x51. This is sufficient because the maximum value of A[i] is 100.
3. Replace the infinite loop with a loop that iterates up to N times.
4. Optimize the inner loop that checks for each element in A to break early if fewer than three indices are found.
5. Remove the vector idx and directly mark used[i] as true inside the loop.
6. Add a condition to exit the loop as soon as used[0] is found to be true.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the "bits/stdc++.h" header with the specific headers needed for the program.
   - This is a best practice to avoid including unnecessary headers and improve compilation time and memory usage.

2. Replace the 3D array dp with a 2D array dp of size 51x51.
   - The maximum value of A[i] is 100, so a 2D array of size 51x51 is sufficient to store the values of dp[a][i][k].
   - This change will significantly reduce the memory usage of the program.

3. Replace the infinite loop with a loop that iterates up to N times.
   - Instead of using an infinite loop and breaking when necessary, we can change the loop to iterate up to N times, where N is the number of nodes.
   - This will make the code more readable and easier to understand.

4. Optimize the inner loop that checks for each element in A to break early if fewer than three indices are found.
   - Currently, the inner loop checks for each element in A if there are exactly three indices k such that dp[a][i][k] is true and used[k] is true.
   - We can optimize this loop to break early if fewer than three indices are found, as there is no need to continue checking once the condition is not met.
   - This will improve the running time of the loop.

5. Remove the vector idx and directly mark used[i] as true inside the loop.
   - Instead of storing the indices in a vector and marking them as true outside the loop, we can directly mark used[i] as true inside the loop.
   - This will eliminate the need for the extra vector and improve the memory usage of the program.

6. Add a condition to exit the loop as soon as used[0] is found to be true.
   - Currently, the program continues the loop until the end, even after used[0] is found to be true.
   - We can add a condition to break the loop as soon as used[0] is true, as there is no need to continue the loop.
