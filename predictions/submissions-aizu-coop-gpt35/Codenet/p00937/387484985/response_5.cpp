Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage: The code uses a 3D boolean array `dp[101][51][51]` to store intermediate results. This can be quite memory-intensive, especially when `N` and `M` are large. We can optimize this by finding a more efficient data structure to represent the problem.

2. Redundant Computations: The code currently checks multiple times if a certain condition is true or false, resulting in redundant computations. We can optimize this by minimizing the number of times we perform these checks.

3. Loop Efficiency: The nested loops used in the code can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

4. Compiler Optimization: We can suggest compiler optimizations and pragma directives that can potentially improve the performance of the code.
