Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage: The code uses a 3D boolean array `dp` of size 101x51x51. This array can be quite large, especially if the value of `N` is large. We can optimize memory usage by using a 2D boolean array instead.

2. Loop Unrolling: The innermost loop in the `for` loop at line 37 can be unrolled. Instead of using a range-based `for` loop, we can manually iterate over the `G[k]` vector using an index. This can potentially improve cache locality and reduce loop overhead.

3. Early Termination: The code currently continues iterating until it finds a solution or exhausts all possibilities. However, we can optimize it by introducing an early termination condition. If at any point during the iteration, all nodes have been marked as `used` except for the first node, we can terminate the loop and output "IMPOSSIBLE".

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. We can enable the compiler to perform loop optimizations, such as loop unrolling and loop fusion, by providing compiler-specific pragmas or flags.
