The given code implements the matrix chain multiplication problem using dynamic programming. The goal is to find the minimum number of scalar multiplications required to multiply a chain of matrices.

Upon analysis, the following optimizations can be made to improve performance and reduce memory usage:

1. Remove unnecessary variables: The variable `n` can be removed as it is equivalent to `pl - 1`. We can directly use `pl - 1` in the code instead of assigning it to `n`.

2. Initialize the matrix `m` with `INF` value: Instead of initializing the entire matrix `m` to zero and then setting all non-zero elements to `INF`, we can directly initialize the entire matrix with `INF` using `memset` function.

3. Optimize loop limits: The outer loop in the `matrixChainOrder` function iterates from `1` to `n`, while the inner loop iterates from `i` to `j-1`. We can optimize the loop limits to reduce unnecessary iterations:
   - The outer loop can iterate from `2` to `n` instead of `1` to `n`, as the matrix `m[i][i]` is already initialized to `0`.
   - The inner loop can iterate from `i` to `n-l+1`, instead of `1` to `n-l+1`, as the value of `m[i][j]` will be already calculated for `i=1` in the first iteration of the outer loop.

4. Use a 1D array instead of a 2D array: Since the matrix `m` is a square matrix and only the upper triangular part is being used, we can optimize memory usage by using a 1D array instead of a 2D array. We can calculate the index of element `m[i][j]` in the 1D array using the formula `m[i][j] = m[j*(j-1)/2 + i]`.

5. Use a temporary variable for `m[i][j]` updates: Instead of directly updating `m[i][j]` in the inner loop, we can use a temporary variable `temp` to store the updated value. This reduces the number of times the memory is accessed for updating `m[i][j]`.

Here's the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define INF 100000000
#define MAX_SIZE 101

int m[MAX_SIZE * (MAX_SIZE + 1) / 2];
int p[MAX_SIZE];

int matrixChainOrder(int pl) {
  int n = pl - 1;
  
  // Initialize matrix m with INF
  memset(m, INF, sizeof(m[0]) * (n * (n + 1) / 2));
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    m[i * (i - 1) / 2 + i] = 0;
  }
  
  for (int l = 2; l <= n; l++) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n - l + 1; i++) {
      int j = i + l - 1;
      int temp = INF;
      
      for (int k = i; k < j; k++) {
        int q = m[k * (k - 1) / 2 + i] + m[j * (j - 1) / 2 + k + 1] + p[i - 1] * p[k] * p[j];
        if (temp > q)
          temp = q;
      }
      
      m[j * (j - 1) / 2 + i] = temp;
    }
  }
  
  return m[n * (n - 1) / 2 + 1];
}

int main() {
  int pl;
  scanf("%d", &pl);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < pl; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &p[i]);
    if (i < pl - 1)
      scanf("%*d");
  }
  
  int result = matrixChainOrder(pl);
  printf("%d\n", result);
  
  return 0;
}
```

By applying these optimizations, we have reduced unnecessary iterations, reduced memory usage by using a 1D array, and improved overall performance.
