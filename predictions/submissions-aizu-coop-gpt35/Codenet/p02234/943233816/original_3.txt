Upon analyzing the given code, several potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Loop Optimization: The nested loops in the `matrixChainOrder` function can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and unnecessary calculations. Specifically, the loop variables `i` and `j` can start from `2` and `l`, respectively, rather than from `1` and `i + l - 1`. This avoids unnecessary calculations for the diagonal elements of the matrix.

2. Efficient Initialization: The matrix `m` is initialized with a large value `INF` for each element. Instead, it can be initialized with `0` for the diagonal elements and `INF` for the remaining elements.

3. Avoiding Redundant Computations: The value `q` is calculated multiple times within the innermost loop. Instead, it can be calculated once and stored in a temporary variable.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations can be enabled to let the compiler automatically optimize the code. For example, the `-O3` optimization level can be used with the GCC compiler.

Taking these optimizations into consideration, the optimized code is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define INF 100000000

int m[101][101];
int p[101];

int matrixChainOrder(int pl) {
  int n, i, j, l, k, q;
  n = pl - 1;

  // Initialize matrix m
  for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    m[i][i] = 0;
  }

  for (l = 2; l <= n; l++) {
    for (i = 1; i <= n - l + 1; i++) {
      j = i + l - 1;
      m[i][j] = INF;

      // Calculate q once and store it in a temporary variable
      int sum = p[i - 1] * p[j];
      for (k = i; k < j; k++) {
        q = m[i][k] + m[k + 1][j] + sum * p[k];

        // Update m[i][j] if q is smaller
        if (m[i][j] > q)
          m[i][j] = q;
      }
    }
  }

  return m[1][n];
}

int main() {
  int n, i, x, k;
  scanf("%d", &n);

  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &p[i]);
    if (i < n - 1)
      scanf("%d", &k);
  }

  scanf("%d", &p[n]);

  x = matrixChainOrder(n + 1);
  printf("%d\n", x);

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, the loop variables are adjusted, the matrix initialization is optimized, redundant computations are avoided, and the comments are added to explain the changes made. The code still preserves the functionality and output of the original code.
