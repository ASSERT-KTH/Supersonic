Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structure: The "visited" array is a four-dimensional boolean array, which can be quite large and inefficient for larger values of w and h. This array is used to keep track of visited states during the BFS traversal.

2. Redundant computation: The computation of the "cnt" variable inside the BFS loop is redundant and can be avoided. This variable is used to check if both the left and right sides have reached a '%' character.

3. Inefficient string concatenation: The "mp" array consists of two-dimensional arrays of strings. However, string concatenation using the '+' operator can be inefficient, especially when performed repeatedly inside a loop.

4. Inefficient memory usage: The "po" struct is used to represent the current state of the BFS traversal. However, this struct contains four integer values, which can result in inefficient memory usage.

To optimize the code, I propose the following steps:

1. Replace the four-dimensional "visited" array with a two-dimensional boolean array. The dimensions of the array will be (w x h), which is sufficient to store the visited states. The "visited" array will be used to keep track of visited states during the BFS traversal.

2. Remove the computation of the "cnt" variable inside the BFS loop. This computation is redundant and can be avoided.

3. Instead of using string concatenation, concatenate the two strings of the "mp" array using the append() function. This function is more efficient for repeated concatenation.

4. Replace the "po" struct with two pairs of integers. Instead of storing four integer values, simply store the x and y coordinates of the left and right sides.

5. Use the 'emplace' function of the queue to directly construct the "po" objects in the queue, instead of using the push() function and creating temporary objects.

6. Use the 'break' statement instead of 'continue' when a state is visited or has only one side reached the '%' character. This will avoid unnecessary iterations of the BFS loop.
