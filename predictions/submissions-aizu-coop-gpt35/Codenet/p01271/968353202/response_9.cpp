First, let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The `visited` array is used to keep track of visited positions. However, it is not necessary to use a 4D array to achieve this. Since the positions of the left and right players are independent, we can use separate 2D arrays for each player instead of a 4D array.

2. The code uses a `queue` to perform a breadth-first search (BFS). While BFS is an efficient approach for this problem, we can optimize it further by avoiding unnecessary operations. For example, we can avoid pushing positions into the queue if they are already visited or if only one player is on a wall.

3. The code uses a struct `po` to represent positions. However, we can replace it with a pair of pairs, `(pair<int, int>, pair<int, int>)`, to represent the positions of the left and right players.

4. The code does not handle invalid input, such as when the width or height is greater than 50.

5. The code does not include any compiler optimizations or pragmas that could help the compiler optimize the code.

Based on the above analysis, here is a step-by-step optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `visited` array with separate 2D arrays for each player, `visitedL` and `visitedR`.

2. Modify the BFS loop to skip unnecessary positions and avoid pushing them into the queue. This can be achieved by checking if a position is already visited or if only one player is on a wall.

3. Replace the struct `po` with a pair of pairs, `(pair<int, int>, pair<int, int>)`, to represent the positions of the left and right players.

4. Add input validation to handle invalid input.

5. Consider using compiler optimizations or pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize the code further.
