The given code calculates the minimum cost to paint n walls, where each wall can be painted either red or blue. The cost of painting a wall depends on the color of the previous wall. The code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem, but there are several areas where it can be optimized for better performance.

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The code uses a static 3D array `dp` to store the minimum costs. However, the size of this array is unnecessarily large. Since the maximum possible value of `n` is `5000`, the size of the array can be reduced to `2 x 2501 x 2` to save memory.

2. Remove redundant initialization: The code initializes the entire `dp` array with a large value `INF`. However, only a small portion of the array is used in each iteration of the loop. Initializing only the necessary elements can save unnecessary computation time.

3. Eliminate unnecessary modulo operation: In each iteration of the outer loop, the code calculates `s = i % 2` and `t = 1 - s`. This modulo operation can be eliminated by using a boolean flag to toggle between the two states.

4. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`: The code uses the C-style I/O functions `scanf` and `printf` for input and output. However, the C++ I/O streams `cin` and `cout` are generally faster and safer to use.

5. Optimize the loop bounds: The inner loop iterates from `0` to `n/2`. However, since the maximum value of `j` is `n/2`, the loop can be optimized to iterate from `1` to `n/2` to avoid unnecessary computations.

6. Avoid repeated array lookups: The code repeatedly looks up `dp[t][j - 1][0]` and `dp[t][j - 1][1]`. Storing these values in separate variables can eliminate the redundant array lookups.

Based on these observations, here is an optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const int INF = 1000000000;
  int n, c;
  static int dp[2][2501][2];

  cin >> n;

  int s = 1, t = 0;
  dp[s][1][0] = 0;
  dp[s][0][1] = 0;

  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> c;
    swap(s, t);
    for (int j = 1; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      int prev0 = dp[t][j - 1][0];
      int prev1 = dp[t][j - 1][1];
      dp[s][j][0] = min(prev0, prev1 + c);
      dp[s][j][1] = min(dp[t][j][0] + c, dp[t][j][1]);
    }
  }

  cout << min(dp[s][n / 2][0], dp[s][n / 2][1]) << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations aim to reduce unnecessary memory usage, eliminate redundant computations, and utilize more efficient I/O operations. The trade-off is a slightly more complex code structure, but it should result in improved performance.
