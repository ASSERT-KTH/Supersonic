Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. The use of a static array `dp[2][5000 + 2][2]` with a size of 5002. This array is quite large and may consume a significant amount of memory.

2. The use of a nested loop to initialize the `dp` array. This loop iterates over all elements of the array and sets their initial values to `INF`.

3. The use of the `scanf()` function for input and `printf()` function for output. These functions are generally slower than their C++ counterparts `cin` and `cout`.

4. The use of the `min()` function inside a loop. This function call may introduce extra overhead, especially if it is called frequently.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `static int dp[2][5000 + 2][2]` array with a dynamically allocated 2D array. This will reduce the memory footprint of the program.

2. Initialize the `dp` array using a single loop instead of nested loops. This will reduce the number of iterations required for initialization.

3. Replace the `scanf()` and `printf()` functions with `cin` and `cout` respectively. This will improve the input/output performance.

4. Replace the `min()` function calls with inline comparisons. This will eliminate the overhead of function calls.
