Code Analysis:
1. The code uses a three-dimensional array `dp` to store intermediate results for dynamic programming.
2. The code initializes all elements of `dp` to a large value `INF` and updates the values in subsequent iterations.
3. The code uses a nested loop structure to iterate over the dimensions of `dp` and compute the minimum values.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a two-dimensional array instead of a three-dimensional array to reduce memory usage.
2. Eliminate the need for the `s` and `t` variables by using a single index variable for the current row and the previous row.
3. Replace the `scanf` and `printf` functions with the more efficient `cin` and `cout` stream operations.
4. Consider using compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization, to improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the three-dimensional array `dp` with a two-dimensional array. The size of the second dimension can be reduced to `n/2 + 1` since the maximum value of `j` is `n/2`.
2. Remove the initialization loop for `dp` and initialize the first row of the array separately.
3. Replace the `scanf` and `printf` functions with `cin` and `cout` for more efficient input and output operations.
4. Modify the loop structure to use a single index variable `i` instead of `s` and `t`.
5. Replace the calls to `min` with conditional statements to avoid unnecessary function calls.
6. Consider enabling compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization, to further improve performance.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const int INF = 1000000000;
  int n, c;
  static int dp[2][5000 + 2];
  
  cin >> n;
  dp[1][1] = 0;
  dp[1][0] = 0;

  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    int j;
    cin >> c;
    for (j = 0; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      if (j == 0)
        dp[i % 2][j] = INF;
      else
        dp[i % 2][j] = dp[(i - 1) % 2][j - 1] < dp[(i - 1) % 2][j - 1] + c ? dp[(i - 1) % 2][j - 1] : dp[(i - 1) % 2][j - 1] + c;
      dp[i % 2][j] = dp[(i - 1) % 2][j] + c < dp[(i - 1) % 2][j] ? dp[(i - 1) % 2][j] + c : dp[(i - 1) % 2][j];
    }
  }
  
  cout << (dp[0][n / 2] < dp[0][n / 2] ? dp[0][n / 2] : dp[0][n / 2]) << endl;
}
```

The optimized code reduces memory usage by using a two-dimensional array instead of a three-dimensional array. It also eliminates unnecessary function calls and uses more efficient input and output operations. The loop structure is modified to use a single index variable, and conditional statements are used instead of the `min` function. Compiler optimizations can be applied to further improve performance.
