The provided code is a C++ program that calculates the minimum cost of traversing a path of length `n` with two possible states at each step. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.

Upon analyzing the code, several potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Inefficient memory usage: The program uses two-dimensional arrays `dp` and `tmp` to store intermediate results. These arrays have a fixed size of 5002, regardless of the input value `n`. This leads to unnecessary memory allocation and potentially wastes memory.

2. Redundant computation: The `minCost` function is called repeatedly to determine the minimum cost between two values. However, this function can be simplified by using the `std::min` function from the `<algorithm>` header.

3. Unnecessary nested loops: The outer loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, while the inner loop iterates from `0` to `n/2`. However, the purpose of the inner loop is to copy values from `dp` to `tmp`, which can be done without iteration.

Based on this analysis, the following optimization steps can be proposed:

1. Replace fixed-size arrays with dynamically allocated arrays: Instead of using fixed-size arrays `dp` and `tmp`, dynamically allocate memory based on the input value `n`. This reduces unnecessary memory allocation and potential memory waste.

2. Replace the `minCost` function with `std::min`: Replace the custom `minCost` function with the `std::min` function from the `<algorithm>` header. This simplifies the code and potentially provides compiler optimizations.

3. Remove the unnecessary nested loops: Instead of using nested loops to copy values from `dp` to `tmp`, directly assign the values using a single loop.
