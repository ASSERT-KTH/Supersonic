After analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage:
   - The `tmp` and `dp` arrays have a fixed size of `5002` rows and `2` columns. However, the problem statement mentions that the input value of `n` can be as large as `10002`. Therefore, these arrays have excessive memory allocation.
   - The `tmp` array is only used to store the previous row of the `dp` array, so we don't need to maintain both `tmp` and `dp` arrays separately.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `minCost` function can be simplified by using the `std::min` function from the `<algorithm>` header, which is more efficient and readable.
   - The `solve` function initializes the `tmp` array with zeros for indices `0` and `1`. However, these indices are never used or updated in the subsequent loop, so this initialization is unnecessary.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The outer loop in the `solve` function runs from `1` to `n-1`, but it only uses the value of `i` to access `t[i-1]`. We can change the loop to run from `0` to `n-2` and directly access `t[i]`, eliminating the need for `i-1` indexing.
   - The outer loop also updates the `tmp` array by copying the entire `dp` array row by row. This can be optimized by swapping the `tmp` and `dp` arrays instead of copying them.

Based on these observations, I will now provide a step-by-step explanation of the optimization process.
