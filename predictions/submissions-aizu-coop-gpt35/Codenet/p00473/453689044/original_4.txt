This code appears to solve a dynamic programming problem where the goal is to find the minimum cost of traversing a path of length `n` with two types of steps, represented by the `t` array. The code is using a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant Memory Allocation: The code initializes and uses two-dimensional arrays `dp` and `tmp` to store intermediate results. However, it is not necessary to allocate and initialize these arrays at each iteration of the outer loop. We can optimize memory usage by reusing a single two-dimensional array and swapping its values with the `tmp` array at each iteration.

2. Unnecessary Function Call: The `minCost` function is called multiple times during the computation. This function can be replaced with a simple ternary expression to directly calculate the minimum cost.

3. Unnecessary Array Copy: After each inner loop, the values of `dp` are copied to `tmp`. This copy operation can be avoided by using a single array and swapping the indices used for accessing the elements.

4. Compiler Optimization: The code can benefit from compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and enabling compiler optimizations using pragmas or compiler flags.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps to improve the performance and memory usage of the code.
