Code Analysis:
1. The code implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a given source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
2. The graph is represented using an adjacency list, where each vertex is associated with a vector of edges.
3. The code uses a priority queue to select the vertex with the smallest distance from the source vertex at each step.
4. The distances are stored in an array `d`, where `d[i]` represents the shortest distance from the source vertex to vertex `i`.

Potential Optimizations:
1. The `fill` function is used to initialize the distance array with a large value (`INF`). However, since the `d` array is immediately overwritten with `d[r] = 0`, the initialization step is unnecessary.
2. The code uses a `priority_queue` to select the vertex with the smallest distance at each step. However, the `priority_queue` does not support efficient deletion or updating of elements. This can lead to duplicate elements in the queue and increase the overall time complexity of the algorithm.
3. The `d` array is currently implemented as a fixed-size array of size `v`. This can be a limitation in terms of memory usage, especially if `v` is large. Using a dynamic data structure, such as `std::vector`, can help optimize memory usage.
4. The code uses a `for` loop with `G[nv].size()` as the loop condition to iterate over the neighboring vertices. However, this condition is evaluated at every iteration, which can be inefficient. Storing the size in a separate variable before the loop can improve performance.
5. The `pop` operation is called on the priority queue at each iteration of the main loop. This operation has a time complexity of `O(log n)`. However, since we only need to access the smallest element, using a `std::set` instead of a `priority_queue` can provide better performance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove the `fill` function call to remove unnecessary initialization of the `d` array.
2. Replace the `priority_queue` with a `set` data structure to improve performance.
3. Replace the fixed-size `d` array with a `vector` to optimize memory usage.
4. Store the size of `G[nv]` in a separate variable before the loop to avoid evaluating the size at each iteration.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the `fill` function call to remove unnecessary initialization of the `d` array. This is safe to do because the array is immediately overwritten with `d[r] = 0`.
2. Replace the `priority_queue` with a `set` data structure to improve performance. The `set` will automatically order the elements based on the distance value, allowing us to access the smallest element efficiently.
3. Replace the fixed-size `d` array with a `vector` to optimize memory usage. The size of the `vector` will be determined dynamically based on the number of vertices in the graph.
4. Store the size of `G[nv]` in a separate variable before the loop to avoid evaluating the size at each iteration. This will improve performance by eliminating the repeated evaluation of `G[nv].size()`.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 1000000000;
struct edge {
  int to, cost;
};
vector<edge> G[100000];
int v, e, r;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
set<P> q;
int main() {
  scanf("%d %d %d", &v, &e, &r);
  for (int i = 0; i < e; i++) {
    int s, t, d;
    scanf("%d %d %d", &s, &t, &d);
    edge tmp;
    tmp.to = t;
    tmp.cost = d;
    G[s].push_back(tmp);
  }
  vector<int> d(v, INF);
  d[r] = 0;
  q.insert(P(0, r));
  while (!q.empty()) {
    P p = *q.begin();
    q.erase(q.begin());
    int nv = p.second;
    if (p.first > d[nv])
      continue;
    int size = G[nv].size();
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      if (d[nv] + G[nv][i].cost < d[G[nv][i].to]) {
        q.erase(P(d[G[nv][i].to], G[nv][i].to));
        d[G[nv][i].to] = d[nv] + G[nv][i].cost;
        q.insert(P(d[G[nv][i].to], G[nv][i].to));
      }
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < v; i++) {
    if (d[i] == INF)
      printf("INF\n");
    else
      printf("%d\n", d[i]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized code initializes the `d` vector directly with the desired size and removes the unnecessary `fill` function call. The `priority_queue` is replaced with a `set` data structure, and the fixed-size `d` array is replaced with a `vector`. The size of `G[nv]` is stored in a separate variable to avoid repeated evaluations. These changes improve both the running time and memory usage of the program.
