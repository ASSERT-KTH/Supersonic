The given code is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path from a given source vertex to all other vertices in a directed graph. The code reads the number of vertices, number of edges, and the source vertex from the input, builds the graph, and then runs Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest paths.

Upon analyzing the code, there are a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant Memory Allocation: The code uses a vector of vectors (`G`) to represent the graph. However, since the number of vertices is known in advance, it is more efficient to use a fixed-sized array of vectors. This avoids the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

2. Unnecessary Memory Initialization: The code initializes the `d` array with `INF` for all vertices. However, the Dijkstra's algorithm already ensures that all distances are updated during the execution. Therefore, there is no need to initialize the array.

3. Inefficient Priority Queue: The code uses a `std::priority_queue` to maintain the vertices with the minimum distance. However, the `priority_queue` does not provide efficient removal of elements in the middle. This leads to redundant operations when updating the distances during the algorithm execution. A better alternative is to use a custom implementation of a min-heap data structure that allows efficient decrease-key operations.

4. Inefficient Loop Iterations: The code uses the `size()` function of the `std::vector` class in the inner loop condition. This function has a time complexity of O(1), but it is still better to precompute the size of the vector before the loop to avoid unnecessary function calls.

5. Compiler Optimizations: The code can benefit from enabling compiler optimizations. This can be achieved by specifying appropriate optimization flags during the compilation process or by using pragma directives to provide optimization hints to the compiler.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps one by one.
