The given code is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the single-source shortest path problem. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency.

1. Use a custom priority queue: The code currently uses the `std::priority_queue` container to implement the priority queue for Dijkstra's algorithm. However, the `std::priority_queue` has some overhead due to additional memory allocations and comparisons. It is more efficient to use a custom priority queue implementation that avoids these overheads.

2. Use a `std::vector<bool>` for visited nodes: The code currently uses an array `d` to keep track of the shortest distances from the source node to each node. Instead of using this array, we can use a `std::vector<bool>` to mark nodes as visited. This change will reduce memory usage.

3. Use a `std::vector<int>` for distances: Instead of using an array `d` to store the shortest distances, we can use a `std::vector<int>`. This change will allow us to use the `std::vector` methods to initialize and access the distances, resulting in cleaner and potentially more optimized code.

4. Use a custom struct for edges: The code currently uses a `struct` to represent edges. Instead of using a `struct`, we can use a `std::pair<int, int>` to represent edges, where the first element represents the destination node and the second element represents the cost.

5. Use `reserve()` method for `std::vector`: Before adding elements to the `std::vector`, we can use the `reserve()` method to pre-allocate memory for the vector. This will reduce the number of memory allocations and improve performance.

6. Use range-based for loop: Instead of using a traditional for loop to iterate over the elements of a vector, we can use a range-based for loop. This change will improve code readability and potentially optimize the loop.

7. Use `emplace_back()` instead of `push_back()`: Instead of using `push_back()` to add elements to a vector, we can use `emplace_back()`. The `emplace_back()` method constructs the object in-place in the vector, eliminating the need for an extra copy or move operation.

8. Use `printf()` for faster output: Instead of using `std::cout` for output, we can use `printf()`, which is generally faster for formatted output.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized code is as follows:
