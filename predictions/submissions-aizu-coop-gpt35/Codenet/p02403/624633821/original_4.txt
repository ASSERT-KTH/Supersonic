Code Analysis:
- The code reads pairs of integers into arrays H and W until it encounters a pair of zeros.
- For each pair, it prints a rectangle of "#" characters with dimensions specified by H and W.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary memory usage:
   - The code uses two arrays, H and W, to store the input. Since the maximum size is 100, we can use a single array of pairs instead.
   - This reduces the memory usage from 200 integers to 100 pairs.

2. Minimize function calls:
   - The code currently uses the printf function to print each "#" character. However, using cout is generally faster than printf in C++.
   - By replacing printf with cout, we can avoid unnecessary function calls and improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace arrays H and W with a single array of pairs:
   - Instead of using two arrays to store the input, we can use a single array of pairs.
   - This reduces the memory usage from 200 integers to 100 pairs.
   - Update the code to use the new array for input.

2. Replace printf with cout:
   - The code currently uses printf to print each "#" character.
   - By replacing printf with cout, we can avoid unnecessary function calls and improve performance.
   - Update the code to use cout for printing.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a = 0;
  pair<int, int> dimensions[100];

  while (1) {
    cin >> dimensions[a].first >> dimensions[a].second;
    if (dimensions[a].first == 0 && dimensions[a].second == 0)
      break;
    a++;
  }

  for (int b = 0; b < a; b++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < dimensions[b].first; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < dimensions[b].second; j++) {
        cout << "#";
      }
      cout << endl;
    }
    cout << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code reduces memory usage by using a single array of pairs instead of two separate arrays. It also replaces printf with cout for printing, improving performance. The functionality and output of the original code are preserved.
