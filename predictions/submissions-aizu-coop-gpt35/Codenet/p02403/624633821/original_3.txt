The provided code reads pairs of integers into arrays `H` and `W`, and then prints a rectangle of '#' characters based on the values in the arrays. The code uses a nested loop to iterate through the arrays and print the '#' characters.

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary headers:
   - The `<algorithm>` header is not used in the code and can be removed.
   - The `<stdio.h>` header can be replaced with `<cstdio>` for compatibility with C++.

2. Use `std::vector` instead of fixed-size arrays:
   - The code currently uses fixed-size arrays `H[100]` and `W[100]` to store the input values. However, using `std::vector` would allow the arrays to dynamically resize based on the actual number of inputs. This eliminates the need for a separate counter variable (`a`) and simplifies the code.

3. Use a more efficient method to print the rectangles:
   - The code currently uses nested loops to print the rectangles. However, we can improve the efficiency by using a single loop and printing a string of '#' characters instead of printing them individually. This reduces the number of function calls and improves performance.

4. Add compiler optimizations:
   - We can suggest the use of compiler optimizations, such as enabling loop unrolling and optimizing for speed, to further improve the performance of the code.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step by step:
