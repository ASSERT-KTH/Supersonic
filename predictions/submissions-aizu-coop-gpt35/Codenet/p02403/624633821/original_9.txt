The provided code reads pairs of integers into arrays `H` and `W` until it encounters a pair of zeros. For each pair, it prints a rectangle of hashes with height `H` and width `W`.

Upon analyzing the code, here are some potential optimizations:

1. Use `std::vector` instead of fixed-size arrays: The current code uses fixed-size arrays `H[100]` and `W[100]`. Instead, we can use `std::vector<int>` to dynamically store the input values. This will prevent potential buffer overflows and allow for flexibility in the number of input pairs.

2. Avoid unnecessary `#include` statements: The code includes unnecessary headers `<algorithm>` and `<iostream>`. We can remove them since they are not used in the code.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: It is considered good practice to avoid using `using namespace std;` globally. Instead, we can qualify the usage of `cin`, `cout`, and `endl` with `std::` to avoid potential naming conflicts.

4. Use `'\n'` instead of `printf("\n")`: The code uses `printf("\n")` to print a newline character. We can replace it with `'\n'` for better performance.

Based on these optimizations, here's the refactored code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::vector<int> H, W;
  int h, w;

  while (true) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0)
      break;
    H.push_back(h);
    W.push_back(w);
  }

  for (size_t i = 0; i < H.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < H[i]; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < W[i]; k++) {
        std::cout << '#';
      }
      std::cout << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the performance and maintain the functionality of the original code.
