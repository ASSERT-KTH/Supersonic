The provided code seems to solve a problem related to printing rectangles of different sizes. However, there are several potential performance optimizations that can be made.

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The code currently uses two arrays, `H` and `W`, to store the height and width of each rectangle. This approach has a fixed size of 100 and does not handle dynamic input well. Additionally, it requires iterating over the entire array to determine the number of rectangles entered.
   - A more efficient alternative is to use a `std::vector` to dynamically store the rectangles' dimensions. This allows for better memory management and eliminates the need to iterate over the entire array to determine the number of rectangles.

2. Redundant Computation:
   - The current code uses a `while` loop with a condition `while (1)` to read rectangles until a `0 0` input is encountered. This approach requires an additional check inside the loop to break out of it. It would be more efficient to use a `do-while` loop to eliminate the redundant check.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The code uses nested loops to print the rectangles. However, there is an opportunity for loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance. By unrolling the outer loop, we can eliminate the need to repeatedly check the condition `b < a` and increment `b` within the loop.

4. Compiler Optimization:
   - Using compiler optimizations can often result in significant performance improvements. We can use compiler-specific pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize the code further.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step by step.
