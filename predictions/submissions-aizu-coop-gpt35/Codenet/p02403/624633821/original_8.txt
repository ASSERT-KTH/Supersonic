The provided code reads a series of pairs of integers from the user until a pair of zeros is encountered. For each pair, it prints a rectangle of '#' characters with dimensions given by the pair. The code uses two arrays, `H` and `W`, to store the heights and widths of the rectangles.

Here are some potential optimizations for this code:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the `<algorithm>` header, which is not used. Removing unnecessary includes can improve compilation time.

2. Avoid using the `namespace std`: The code uses `using namespace std`, which brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. While this can make the code a bit more concise, it may lead to naming conflicts and make the code less maintainable. It's better to qualify specific names with `std::` instead.

3. Use `std::vector` instead of fixed-size arrays: The code uses fixed-size arrays `H` and `W` with a maximum size of 100. This can be problematic if the user enters more than 100 pairs. Using `std::vector` instead of fixed-size arrays allows for dynamic resizing and avoids potential buffer overflows.

4. Avoid unnecessary increment and comparison: In the first `while` loop, the code increments `a` and then checks if `H[a]` and `W[a]` are zero. This can result in accessing indices beyond the valid range if the user enters more than 100 pairs. It would be better to check for zero values first and then increment `a` if necessary.

5. Use `std::cout` instead of `printf`: The code uses `printf` to print the '#' character and a newline. Using `std::cout` is generally faster and more idiomatic in C++.

6. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment: In the outer `while` loop, the code uses post-increment (`b++`) to increment `b`. Pre-increment (`++b`) can be more efficient in some cases, as it avoids creating a temporary copy of `b`.

7. Minimize the number of calls to `std::endl`: The code uses `printf("\n")` for newlines and `std::endl` for flushing the output. Flushing the output after each newline can be expensive. It's better to use `"\n"` for newlines and flush the output once after the loop using `std::cout << std::flush`.

Here's the optimized code with the above changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> H, W;
    int h, w;
    
    while (true) {
        std::cin >> h >> w;
        if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
            break;
        }
        H.push_back(h);
        W.push_back(w);
    }
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < H.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < H[i]; j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k < W[i]; k++) {
                std::cout << '#';
            }
            std::cout << '\n';
        }
        if (i != H.size() - 1) {
            std::cout << '\n';
        }
    }
    
    std::cout << std::flush;
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code improves memory usage by using `std::vector` instead of fixed-size arrays, avoids unnecessary includes, and reduces the number of unnecessary operations. It also maintains the functionality and output of the original code.
