The provided code is a C++ program that solves a maze problem using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The program reads an input matrix representing the maze, and it finds the shortest path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the maze. The program uses four separate BFS functions (`bfs()`, `bfs2()`, `bfs3()`, and `bfs4()`) to explore different starting points.

Upon analyzing the code, here are some potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. Duplicate Code: There is a lot of duplicated code in the four BFS functions. This can make the code harder to read, maintain, and optimize. We can refactor the code to eliminate the duplicate logic and improve code reuse.

2. Redundant Checks: The code includes several redundant checks for boundary conditions and invalid positions. These checks can be simplified and optimized to reduce unnecessary computations.

3. Data Structures: The code uses a `map` data structure to store the maze cells, which are accessed by their coordinates. However, a `map` has a logarithmic time complexity for insertion and lookup operations. We can optimize this by using a more efficient data structure, such as a 2D array or a flat array.

4. Memory Usage: The code uses a 2D array of size `cost[100001]` to store the cost of each cell. However, the maximum number of cells in the maze is `n*m`, which can be much larger than `100001`. This leads to inefficient memory usage. We can optimize this by dynamically allocating the `cost` array based on the maze size.

5. Loop Unrolling: The inner loops in the BFS functions can be unrolled to reduce the number of iterations and improve cache locality.

6. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and auto-vectorization, to improve the performance of the code.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization strategy and step-by-step explanation of each proposed optimization.
