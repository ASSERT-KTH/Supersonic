Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant Code: There are four separate functions `bfs()`, `bfs2()`, `bfs3()`, and `bfs4()`, which have almost identical code. We can consolidate these functions into a single function, reducing code duplication.

2. Unnecessary Data Structures: The `std::map` data structure is used to store the values of `g`. However, we only use this map to check if a specific value exists or not. Using a `std::unordered_set` instead of a map will provide faster lookup times.

3. Loop Optimization: The nested for loops in the `bfs()` function can be optimized. The current implementation checks all positions around each point in the grid. We can optimize this by only checking the positions that are necessary for the given problem.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest the use of compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling, to improve the performance of the code.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization:

1. Consolidating the BFS Functions:
   - Combine the `bfs()`, `bfs2()`, `bfs3()`, and `bfs4()` functions into a single function, called `bfs()`.
   - Modify the `bfs()` function to accept two additional parameters: `int startX` and `int startY`.
   - Inside the `bfs()` function, replace all instances of `n` and `m` with `startX` and `startY`, respectively.

2. Using `std::unordered_set`:
   - Replace the `map<ll, int> g` declaration with `unordered_set<ll> g`.
   - Instead of `g.find()`, use `g.count()` to check if a value exists in the set.
   - Modify the `g[(ll)y[i] * n + x[i]] = i;` line to `g.insert((ll)y[i] * n + x[i]);`.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - In the nested for loops, change the limits of the outer loop from `-2` to `2` to `-1` to `1`.
   - Adjust the inner loop limits accordingly to `-1` to `1`.
   - This change will reduce the unnecessary checks for positions that are not relevant to the problem.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Add compiler optimizations flags, such as `-O2` or `-O3`, to the compilation command to enable optimization at compile-time.
   - Use `#pragma` directives, such as `#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")`, to suggest loop unrolling to the compiler.

Here is the optimized code:

#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <queue>
#include <set>

#include <vector>
#define MOD 1000000007LL

int cost[100001];

int bfs(int startX, int startY) {
  queue<int> que;
  queue<int> que2;
  bool flag = false;
  memset(cost, -1, sizeof(cost));
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= startX - 1; i++) {
    ll val = (ll)i * n;
    if (g.count(val)) {
      que.push(g[val]);
      cost[g[val]] = 0;
    }
  }
  
  while (!que.empty()) {
    int q = que.front();
    que.pop();
    for (int i = -1; i
