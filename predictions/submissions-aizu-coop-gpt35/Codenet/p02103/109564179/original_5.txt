The code provided is a C++ program that solves a maze problem using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The goal is to find the shortest path from the top-left corner of the maze to the bottom-right corner.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies can be identified:

1. Redundant BFS Functions: There are four separate BFS functions (`bfs`, `bfs2`, `bfs3`, `bfs4`) that perform almost identical operations. These functions differ only in the way they initialize the starting points for the BFS search. This redundancy can be eliminated by merging these functions into a single function.

2. Repetitive Code: There is a significant amount of code duplication between the four BFS functions. The inner loops that perform the BFS search are almost identical in each function, differing only in the starting point and boundary conditions. This repetitive code can be refactored and consolidated into a single loop.

3. Inefficient Data Structure: The use of a `map` to store the maze positions and their corresponding indices (`g` map) is not the most efficient data structure for this problem. Accessing elements in a `map` has a logarithmic time complexity, which can be improved by using a more suitable data structure, such as a 2D array.

4. Unnecessary Memory Allocation: The `cost` array is initialized with -1 for each BFS function call. However, this initialization can be avoided by initializing `cost` array only once outside the BFS functions.

5. Inefficient Loop Conditions: The inner loops in the BFS functions iterate over -2 to 2 to handle the neighboring cells. However, since the maximum difference between neighboring cells is 1 in either direction, these loops can be optimized to iterate from -1 to 1.

Based on these observations, the optimization strategy can be formulated as follows:

1. Merge the four separate BFS functions into a single BFS function.
2. Refactor and consolidate the repetitive code into a single loop.
3. Replace the `map` data structure (`g` map) with a more efficient data structure, such as a 2D array.
4. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation by initializing the `cost` array only once outside the BFS function.
5. Optimize the loop conditions to iterate from -1 to 1 instead of -2 to 2.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization and provide the optimized code at the end.
