To optimize the given code, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The code includes several unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<functional>`, `<map>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, and `<string>`. Since these headers are not used in the code, we can safely remove them.

2. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The `map<ll, int> g` is used to store the mapping between coordinates and indices. However, using a `map` introduces unnecessary memory overhead and can lead to slower performance. Instead of using a `map`, we can use a 2D array to store the mapping. Since the maximum value of `n` and `m` is 1000, we can define a 2D array `int g[1000][1000]` to store the mapping. By doing this, we can directly access the mapping using `g[ny][nx]` instead of using the `find` function of `map`.

3. Optimize the BFS functions:
   - Merge the four separate BFS functions (`bfs`, `bfs2`, `bfs3`, and `bfs4`) into a single function. The only difference between these functions is the starting coordinate, which can be easily passed as a parameter to the function.
   - Instead of pushing the elements into two separate queues (`que` and `que2`), we can use a single queue and use a flag to track whether we encountered a "1" cost.
   - Avoid unnecessary checks and continue statements inside the nested loops. For example, instead of checking `if (nx < 0) continue`, we can update the loop boundaries to avoid negative values.
   - Remove redundant checks for `(nx == 0 && ny == 0)` and `(nx == n - 1 && ny == m - 1)` inside the nested loops. These conditions are already checked outside the nested loops.

4. Remove unnecessary variables and function calls:
   - The variable `int res` is used to store the minimum result of the four BFS functions. Instead of using this variable, we can directly print the minimum result using `printf("%d\n", min(bfs(), min(bfs2(), min(bfs3(), bfs4()))))`.
   - Since the `cost` array is initialized with `-1` at the beginning of each BFS function, there is no need to check `if (cost[g[nval]] == -1)` before updating its value. We can safely update the `cost` array without any checks.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>

#define MOD 1000000007LL

typedef long long ll;

int n, m, k;
int x[100001], y[100001];
int g[1000][1000];
int cost[100001];

int bfs(int sx, int sy) {
    int dx[] = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2};
    int dy[] = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2};
    int dxSize = sizeof(dx) / sizeof(dx[0]);
    int dySize = sizeof(dy) / sizeof(dy[0]);

    int res = 2;
    bool flag = false;

    memset(cost, -1, sizeof(cost));
    std::queue<int> que;
    que.push(g[sy][sx]);
    cost[g[sy][sx]] = 0;

    while (!que.empty()) {
        int q = que.front();
        que.pop();

        for (int i = 0; i < dxSize; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < dySize; j++) {
                int nc = 0;
                if (abs(dx[i]) > 1 || abs(dy
