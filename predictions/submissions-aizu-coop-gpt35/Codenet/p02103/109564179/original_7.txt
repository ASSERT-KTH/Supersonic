This code appears to be solving a graph traversal problem using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The goal is to find the shortest path from the top-left corner of a grid to the bottom-right corner, while avoiding certain obstacles represented by the `x` and `y` arrays. The code is divided into four separate BFS functions, each handling a different starting position (top, bottom, left, right) and direction of traversal. The results from all four BFS functions are then compared to find the minimum path length.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory usage: The `x` and `y` arrays are used to represent the obstacles in the grid. However, we can avoid using separate arrays and instead use the `g` map to directly store the obstacle positions as keys, with the corresponding obstacle index as the value.

2. Reduce redundant computations: The code performs several unnecessary computations, such as repeatedly calculating the same values in multiple loops. We can avoid these redundant computations to improve efficiency.

3. Optimize data structures: The `map` data structure used to store the obstacle positions (`g`) can be quite slow for large inputs. We can replace it with a more efficient data structure, such as a `vector` or a `set`.

4. Improve loop efficiency: The nested loops in the BFS functions can be optimized using loop unrolling or other loop optimizations to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

5. Utilize compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations, such as optimizing flags or pragmas, to hint the compiler to optimize specific sections of the code.

Let's now go through these optimizations step by step.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#define MOD 1000000007LL
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> P;
int n, m, k;
vector<int> obstacles; // Replace the map with a vector to store obstacle positions
int cost[100001];
int dx[] = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}; // Possible x offsets for BFS
int dy[] = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}; // Possible y offsets for BFS

int bfs() {
  queue<int> que;
  queue<int> que2;
  bool flag = false;
  memset(cost, -1, sizeof(cost));
  for (int i = 1; i <= m - 1; i++) {
    int val = i * n;
    if (binary_search(obstacles.begin(), obstacles.end(), val)) { // Use binary search to check if obstacle exists
      que.push(val);
      cost[val] = 0;
    }
  }
  // ... rest of the code
}

// ... Similar optimizations for bfs2(), bfs3(), and bfs4()

int main(void) {
  scanf("%d%d%d", &n, &m, &k);
  for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    int x, y;
    scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);
    obstacles.push_back(y * n + x); // Store obstacle positions directly in the vector
  }
  sort(obstacles.begin(), obstacles.end()); // Sort the vector for binary search
  // ... rest of the code
}
```

In this optimized code:
1. Replaced the `map` with a `vector` named `obstacles` to directly store the obstacle positions. This eliminates the need for the `x` and `y` arrays and the `g` map.
2. Used binary search (`binary_search`) to check if an obstacle exists
