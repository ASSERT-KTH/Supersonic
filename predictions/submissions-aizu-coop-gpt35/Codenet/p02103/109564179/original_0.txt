The given code appears to solve a graph traversal problem. It uses a series of BFS (Breadth-First Search) calls to explore different starting points in the graph and find the shortest path from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant BFS Calls: The code currently calls the BFS function (`bfs`, `bfs2`, `bfs3`, and `bfs4`) four times, each with a different starting point. However, the logic in these functions is almost identical, with minor variations based on the starting point. This repetitive code can be optimized to avoid redundant computations.

2. Data Structure: The code uses a `map` to store the graph. However, since the graph is represented as a 2D grid, a more efficient data structure can be used. A 2D array or a 1D array with appropriate indexing calculations would be more memory-efficient and faster.

3. Memory Allocation: The code uses an array `cost` to store the cost of each node. However, the `memset` function is used to initialize the array to -1 at the beginning of each BFS call. This is unnecessary since the array is immediately filled with actual values during the BFS. The initialization can be avoided to save memory and improve performance.

4. Loop Optimization: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the neighbors of each node in the graph. Loop unrolling or loop optimizations can be applied to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.

5. Compiler Optimizations: The code can benefit from using compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler for better performance. This may include enabling vectorization, loop unrolling, or other optimization flags specific to the compiler being used.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Merge the four `bfs` functions into a single function that takes the starting point as an argument.
2. Replace the `map` with a 2D array or a 1D array for more efficient graph representation.
3. Remove the redundant `memset` calls for the `cost` array.
4. Optimize the nested loops by reducing loop overhead and improving memory locality.
5. Apply compiler optimizations and pragma directives to improve performance.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization and provide the optimized code.
