The given code is a C++ program that performs a breadth-first search (BFS) on a grid. The goal of the program is to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid from the top-left corner, while avoiding certain obstacles specified by the input.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. The code uses a `map` to store the coordinates of the obstacles. However, a `map` has a time complexity of O(log n) for insertions and lookups. Since the `map` is used in the BFS algorithm, which requires frequent lookups and insertions, using a more efficient data structure, such as a `vector` or a `unordered_map`, can significantly improve the performance.

2. The `memset` function is used to initialize the `cost` array with -1. However, this can be optimized by using `std::fill` or `std::fill_n` functions, which are generally more efficient for initializing arrays.

3. The BFS algorithm is implemented in four separate functions (`bfs`, `bfs2`, `bfs3`, and `bfs4`), each performing a slightly different traversal of the grid. This code duplication can be eliminated by refactoring the code to use a single function with parameters to handle the different starting points.

4. There are multiple conditions with `continue` statements inside the nested loops. These conditions can be simplified to reduce the number of iterations and improve the efficiency of the loops.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the `map` data structure with a more efficient data structure, such as a `vector` or an `unordered_map`, to improve the performance of lookups and insertions.

2. Replace the `memset` function with `std::fill` or `std::fill_n` functions to initialize the `cost` array more efficiently.

3. Refactor the code to use a single function for the BFS algorithm and pass parameters to handle different starting points.

4. Simplify the conditions inside the nested loops to reduce the number of iterations.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step explanation and implementation of these optimizations.
