First, let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The code uses four separate functions (`bfs`, `bfs2`, `bfs3`, `bfs4`) that perform similar operations with minor differences. This could be refactored into a single function with parameters to eliminate code duplication.

2. The code uses two separate queues (`que` and `que2`) to store nodes. However, both queues are used in a similar way, and it is not clear why two separate queues are necessary. This could be simplified to use a single queue.

3. The code uses a map `g` to store the coordinates of nodes. However, the map is not efficiently used since it performs a lookup operation for every node in the graph. This could be replaced with a more efficient data structure, such as a 2D array or a vector of pairs.

4. The code uses a nested loop to iterate over neighboring nodes. However, the loop iterates over a fixed range of -2 to 2, and only a subset of these values are actually used. This could be optimized to iterate over a smaller range or use a more efficient loop construct, such as loop unrolling.

5. The code uses `memset` to initialize the `cost` array. However, since `cost` is an array of integers, it can be initialized using a loop instead of `memset`.

Based on these observations, we can formulate an optimization strategy:

1. Refactor the code to use a single function `bfs` with parameters to eliminate code duplication.

2. Simplify the use of queues by using a single queue instead of `que` and `que2`.

3. Replace the `map` data structure `g` with a more efficient data structure, such as a 2D array or a vector of pairs.

4. Optimize the nested loops to iterate over a smaller range or use loop unrolling.

5. Initialize the `cost` array using a loop instead of `memset`.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step explanation and implementation of these optimizations.
