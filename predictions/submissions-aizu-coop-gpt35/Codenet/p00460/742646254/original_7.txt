The provided code calculates the number of ways to make a sum `S` using exactly `N*N` numbers, where each number can be any value from 1 to `M`. The code uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas of optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant Memory Allocation: The code uses a 2D array `dp` of size 55x3030 to store the dynamic programming table. However, the actual required size for the table is only (N*N+1)x(S+1). Therefore, the memory allocation for the `dp` array can be optimized.

2. Unnecessary Initialization: The code initializes the `dp` array with zeros using the `memset` function. However, the dynamic programming algorithm only updates a subset of the `dp` array. Therefore, the initialization step can be skipped to improve efficiency.

3. Inefficient Loop Order: The innermost loop iterates over `currIndex` from `N*N` to 1, and the middle loop iterates over `currSum` from `add` to `S`. This loop order can be reversed to improve cache locality and reduce cache misses.

4. Unused Macros and Functions: There are several macros and functions defined in the code (`REP`, `rep`, `all`, `zero`, `minus`, `watch`, `minimize`, `maximize`). However, they are not used in the provided code and can be removed to reduce code complexity and improve readability.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the `dp` array declaration with the correct size.
2. Remove the `memset` function call to initialize the `dp` array.
3. Reverse the loop order of the inner two loops to improve cache locality.
4. Remove the unused macros and functions.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and provide the optimized code.
