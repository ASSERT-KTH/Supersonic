The given code appears to implement various geometric algorithms, including convex hull construction, line intersection detection, and convex polygon arrangement. To optimize this code, we will focus on the following aspects:

1. Reduce memory usage by minimizing unnecessary data structures and variables.
2. Optimize loop structures by reducing redundant computations and unnecessary iterations.
3. Use appropriate data types and data structures to improve performance.
4. Apply compiler optimizations and pragmas to hint the compiler for further optimization.

Now let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of the optimizations.

Step 1: Reduce memory usage
- Remove unnecessary include directive `<bits/stdc++.h>`.
- Remove unnecessary typedefs and replace them with their actual types.
- Remove unnecessary namespace `std` declaration.
- Remove unnecessary variables and parameters, such as `const D EPS`, as they are not used in the code.

Step 2: Optimize loop structures
- Replace the range-based for loop `rep(i, n)` with a traditional for loop to reduce function call overhead.
- Replace the range-based for loop `rep(j, m)` with a traditional for loop inside the input section to avoid unnecessary function calls.

Step 3: Use appropriate data types and structures
- Replace the `double` data type with `float` where possible to reduce memory usage.
- Replace the `vector` data structures with fixed-size arrays where the size is known at compile time to improve performance.

Step 4: Apply compiler optimizations
- Add appropriate compiler optimization flags to enable optimization during compilation.
- Use `#pragma` directives to provide hints to the compiler for loop unrolling or other optimizations.

Now let's proceed with the optimized code block.
