The given code implements a disjoint-set data structure using the union-find algorithm. It takes an input of `n` elements and `m` union operations, followed by `q` queries to check if two elements are connected.

Upon analyzing the code, here are some potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Allocation: The arrays `join[]` and `num[]` are allocated with a fixed size of 100,000 elements. This may result in unnecessary memory usage if the actual number of elements is smaller. We can optimize this by dynamically allocating memory based on the input size.

2. Path Compression: The `find()` function uses recursive calls to traverse the set until it finds the root element. However, this approach can result in a long chain of recursive calls, leading to poor performance. We can optimize this by implementing path compression, which flattens the structure of the tree during the find operation.

3. Union by Rank: The current implementation of the union operation doesn't take into account the size of the sets being merged. This can lead to unbalanced trees and increase the time complexity of subsequent find operations. We can optimize this by implementing union by rank, where the smaller set is merged into the larger set to ensure a balanced tree structure.
