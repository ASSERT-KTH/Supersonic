This is an implementation of the disjoint-set data structure, commonly used for solving problems involving connected components or unions of sets. The code takes as input the number of elements `n`, the number of union operations `m`, and the number of queries `q`. It then performs the union operations and answers the queries based on whether two elements belong to the same connected component.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage: The arrays `join` and `num` are allocated with a fixed size of 100000. This might be excessive for smaller inputs and can result in unnecessary memory usage. We can optimize memory usage by dynamically allocating these arrays based on the input size.

2. Path Compression: The `find` function performs path compression to optimize the time complexity of subsequent `find` operations. However, the implementation is not efficient as it uses recursion, which can lead to stack overflow for larger inputs. We can improve this by replacing the recursive call with a loop.

3. Union by Rank: The `join` array is used to represent the disjoint-set forest. The current implementation uses a simple union-by-size strategy to merge trees. We can improve this by using union-by-rank instead, which takes into account the height of the trees to optimize the union operation.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code, such as loop unrolling or vectorization. However, the effectiveness of these optimizations can vary depending on the compiler and hardware.
