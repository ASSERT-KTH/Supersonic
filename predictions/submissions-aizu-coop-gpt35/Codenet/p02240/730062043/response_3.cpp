Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant find() function calls: The find() function is being called multiple times within the same iteration of the loop. This can result in redundant computations and can be optimized.

2. Inefficient data structures: The join[] array is being used to represent disjoint sets, and the num[] array is used to store the size of each set. However, the current implementation is not efficient and can be improved.

3. Lack of input validation: The code does not check for invalid input values, such as negative values or values outside the range of the arrays. Adding input validation can improve the robustness of the code.

To optimize the code, I propose the following steps:

1. Replace the find() function calls with a single find() function call per iteration of the loop. By storing the results of the find() function in variables, we can avoid redundant computations.

2. Use a more efficient data structure to represent disjoint sets. Instead of using the join[] array, we can use a union-find data structure, such as the weighted quick-union algorithm. This algorithm improves the time complexity of the union operation.

3. Add input validation to check for invalid input values. This will prevent potential errors or crashes due to incorrect input.
