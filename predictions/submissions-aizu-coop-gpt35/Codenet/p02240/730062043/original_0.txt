Upon analyzing the given code, a potential performance bottleneck can be identified in the `find` function. This function is implemented using a recursive approach, which can lead to excessive function calls and unnecessary stack usage. Additionally, the code uses two arrays, `join` and `num`, to keep track of the join sets and their respective sizes. This can result in inefficient memory usage.

To optimize the code, the following steps can be taken:

1. Replace Recursive `find` Function:
   - The recursive `find` function can be replaced with an iterative approach using path compression.
   - In the iterative approach, each node is directly linked to its root during the find operation, reducing the number of function calls and improving performance.
   - This can be achieved by traversing the join array iteratively until the root is reached.
   - Along the traversal path, each node can be directly linked to the root, reducing future find operations.
   - This optimization reduces the time complexity from O(log n) to approximately O(1) for each find operation.

2. Union by Rank:
   - To further optimize the code, the union operation can be improved using the union-by-rank heuristic.
   - The rank of a set is determined by the height of its corresponding tree.
   - During union, the set with the lower rank is attached to the set with the higher rank, reducing the overall tree height.
   - This optimization ensures that the tree remains balanced, leading to efficient find operations.
   - The rank can be stored in the `num` array instead of the size of the set to facilitate this optimization.

3. Compiler Optimizations:
   - The code can be compiled with optimization flags to enable compiler optimizations.
   - For example, using `-O3` optimization flag with GCC or Clang can enable aggressive optimizations, including loop unrolling and function inlining.
   - Compiler optimizations can significantly improve the performance of the code without any manual code changes.

Taking these optimization steps into consideration, the optimized code is as follows:
