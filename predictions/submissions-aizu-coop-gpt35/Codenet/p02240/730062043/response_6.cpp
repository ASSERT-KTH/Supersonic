The provided code seems to be implementing a disjoint set data structure using the "union-find" algorithm. The purpose of the code is to determine if two elements belong to the same set or not.

Upon analyzing the code, a few potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Recursive find function: The `find` function is implemented recursively. This can lead to stack overflow errors or stack frame allocations for large inputs. It would be more efficient to implement an iterative version of the `find` function.

2. Redundant find calls: The code calls the `find` function multiple times for the same elements. It would be more efficient to store the results of the `find` function in variables and reuse them where needed.

3. Large array sizes: The code declares two arrays (`join` and `num`) with a fixed size of 100000. This can lead to excessive memory usage, especially if the input values are much smaller. Instead, we can dynamically allocate these arrays based on the actual input size.

4. Unoptimized union operation: The `union` operation in the code checks the `num` array for equality and performs unnecessary assignments. This can be optimized by using a rank-based union strategy, where the root with the smaller rank is attached to the root with the larger rank.

Now, let's outline the optimization strategy step-by-step:

1. Replace the recursive `find` function with an iterative version to avoid stack overflow errors and reduce stack frame allocations.

2. Store the results of the `find` function in variables `s_root` and `t_root` to avoid redundant calls to the `find` function.

3. Update the array sizes for `join` and `num` dynamically based on the input size.

4. Optimize the `union` operation using a rank-based strategy to reduce unnecessary assignments.

5. Apply compiler optimizations and pragma directives to guide the compiler in optimizing the code further.
