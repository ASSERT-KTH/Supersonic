The given code implements a disjoint-set data structure using the union-find algorithm to determine whether two elements belong to the same set. The goal is to optimize the code for efficiency, focusing on reducing running time and memory usage. 

Let's perform a step-by-step analysis of the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The `find` function performs a recursive call to find the root of the set containing the given element. This recursive call can be optimized by using path compression, which flattens the tree structure by making every visited node directly point to the root. This optimization reduces the time complexity of the `find` operation.

2. The variables `join` and `num` are arrays of size 100000. However, the input guarantees that the maximum value of `n` (the number of elements) is at most 1000. Therefore, we can reduce the size of these arrays to `n`. This optimization reduces memory usage.

3. The `num` array is used to store the size of each set. However, we can eliminate the need for this array by using a rank-based union optimization. Instead of storing the size of each set, we can store the rank of each root node, representing the height of the tree. The rank-based union optimization ensures that the smaller tree is always attached to the larger tree, reducing the overall height of the tree. This optimization improves the efficiency of the union operation.

4. The main loop iterates over the `m` number of edges and performs union-find operations. However, the code does not apply any optimizations to reduce the number of union-find operations. We can optimize this loop by skipping the union-find operation when the two elements already belong to the same set. This optimization reduces the number of union-find operations.

5. The code uses the `iostream` library for input and output operations. This library is known for its slower performance compared to other input/output libraries like `stdio.h`. We can improve the I/O performance by using the `stdio.h` library instead.

Based on the above analysis, let's formulate the optimization strategy and explain each step in detail:
