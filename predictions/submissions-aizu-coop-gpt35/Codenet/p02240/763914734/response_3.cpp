Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Allocation: The `Relation` class currently uses dynamic memory allocation for the `V`, `num_of_each`, and `group` arrays. However, since the size of these arrays is known at compile time, it would be more efficient to use static arrays instead of dynamically allocating memory.

2. Queue Size Check: The `makeGroup` function uses a nested loop to iterate over all the nodes in the graph. However, since the number of nodes is known, we can avoid the inner loop and use a simple counter to keep track of the number of nodes processed.

3. Loop Optimization: The inner loop in the `makeGroup` function can be optimized by using a range-based for loop instead of indexing into the `V` array. This can improve both code readability and performance.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Enabling compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or auto-vectorization, can potentially improve the performance of the code. Adding compiler directives, such as `#pragma`, can provide hints to the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
