This code appears to implement a graph data structure and a function to check if two nodes in the graph are in the same connected component. The graph is represented using an adjacency list, where each node is a vector of integers representing its neighbors.

Here are some potential optimizations for this code:

1. Use `std::array` instead of `std::vector` for the adjacency list: Since the number of vertices is fixed, we can use `std::array` instead of `std::vector` for the adjacency list. This will eliminate the dynamic memory allocation and deallocation overhead of `std::vector`. Additionally, using `std::array` will allow the compiler to optimize memory access patterns more effectively.

2. Avoid storing the number of neighbors explicitly: Instead of storing the number of neighbors for each node, we can use the `size()` function of `std::array` to get the number of neighbors dynamically. This will avoid the need to update the count whenever a new edge is added or removed.

3. Use a `std::queue` to avoid unnecessary memory allocations: Instead of creating a new `std::queue` for each iteration of the outer loop in the `makeGroup()` function, we can reuse the same `std::queue` object. This will eliminate unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations, improving performance.

4. Use a `std::vector<bool>` instead of `int*` for the `group` array: Since the `group` array is used to represent a binary state (either 0 or non-zero), we can use a `std::vector<bool>` instead of an `int*`. This will reduce memory usage and potentially improve cache locality.

5. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: It is generally not recommended to use `using namespace std;` as it can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, use the `std::` prefix for standard library classes and functions.

Now let's implement these optimizations step by step.
