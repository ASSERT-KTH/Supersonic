Analysis:
- The code defines a class called `Relation` which represents a graph and provides methods for adding edges and checking if two nodes are in the same connected component.
- The `push` method adds an edge between two nodes and updates the adjacency list and the number of edges for each node.
- The `makeGroup` method performs a breadth-first search to label each node with a group number, indicating which connected component it belongs to.
- The `canAccess` method checks if two nodes are in the same connected component.
- The main function reads input, constructs the `Relation` object, calls `makeGroup`, and then answers queries using `canAccess`.

Potential optimizations:
1. Memory allocation: The code uses dynamic memory allocation for the adjacency list, number of edges, and group arrays. This can be optimized by using standard containers like `std::vector` and `std::array` which handle memory management automatically.
2. Breadth-first search: The `makeGroup` method performs a breadth-first search, but it can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm like Tarjan's algorithm for finding strongly connected components. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).
3. Input/output: The code uses `scanf` and `printf` for input/output operations, which can be slow for large inputs. Using `std::cin` and `std::cout` with appropriate optimizations like disabling synchronization with C I/O can improve performance.
4. Compiler optimizations: Enabling compiler optimizations like loop unrolling and function inlining can improve the performance of the code.

Optimization strategy:
1. Replace dynamic memory allocation with `std::vector` and `std::array` to handle memory management automatically and improve cache locality.
2. Replace the breadth-first search with Tarjan's algorithm for finding strongly connected components to improve the time complexity.
3. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `std::cin` and `std::cout` and enable optimizations like disabling synchronization with C I/O.
4. Enable compiler optimizations like loop unrolling and function inlining.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Replace dynamic memory allocation:
   - Replace the `V` member variable with `vector<vector<int>> V`.
   - Replace the `num_of_each` member variable with `vector<int> num_of_each`.
   - Replace the `group` member variable with `vector<int> group`.

2. Replace breadth-first search:
   - Replace the `makeGroup` method with a new method called `findStronglyConnectedComponents`, which implements Tarjan's algorithm.
   - In the `findStronglyConnectedComponents` method, initialize a new vector called `low` with the same size as the number of nodes.
   - In the `findStronglyConnectedComponents` method, initialize a new vector called `inStack` with the same size as the number of nodes.
   - In the `findStronglyConnectedComponents` method, initialize a new vector called `stack` to store the nodes in the current strongly connected component.
   - In the `findStronglyConnectedComponents` method, use a helper function called `tarjanDFS` to perform the depth-first search and update the `group` vector.
   - In the `tarjanDFS` function, update the `low` vector to keep track of the lowest node reachable from the current node.
   - In the `tarjanDFS` function, update the `inStack` vector to keep track of whether a node is in the current strongly connected component.
   - In the `tarjanDFS` function, use a static variable called `index` to keep track of the order in which nodes are visited.
   - In the `tarjanDFS` function, update the `stack` vector to store the nodes in the current strongly connected component.
   - After the `tarjanDFS` function finishes, increment the `group_number` variable.

3. Replace input/output operations:
   - Replace the `scanf` calls with `std::cin` calls.
   - Replace the `printf` calls with `std::cout` calls.
   - Add `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` at the beginning of the `main` function to disable synchronization with C I/O.

4. Enable compiler optimizations:
   - Add compiler-specific pragmas or flags to enable loop unrolling and function inlining. This depends on the specific compiler being used.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>

    group.resize(n);
    group_number = 1;
  }
  void push(int s, int t) {
    V[s].push_back(t);
    V[t].push_back(s);
    num_of_each[s]++;
    num_of_each[t]++;

  void findStronglyConnectedComponents() {

        tarjanDFS(i, low, inStack, stack, index, currentIndex);
      }
    }
  }
  bool canAccess(int s, int t) { return group[s] == group[t]; }

private:
  void tarjanDFS(int node, std::vector<int>& low, std::vector<bool>& inStack, std::vector<int>& stack, std::vector<int>& index, int& currentIndex) {
    index[node] = ++currentIndex;
    low[node] = currentIndex;
    stack.push_back(node);
    inStack[node] = true;

    for (int k = 0; k < num_of_each[node]; k++) {
      int neighbor = V[node][k];
      if (index[neighbor] == 0) {
        tarjanDFS(neighbor, low, inStack, stack, index, currentIndex);
        low[node] = std::min(low[node], low[neighbor]);
      } else if (inStack[neighbor]) {
        low[node] = std::min(low[node], index[neighbor]);
      }
    }

    if (low[node] == index[node]) {
      while (true) {
        int top = stack.back();
        stack.pop_back();
        inStack[top] = false;
        group[top] = group_number;
        if (top == node) {
          break;
        }
      }
      group_number++;
    }
  }

  std::vector<std::vector<int>> V;
  std::array<int, n> num_of_each;
  std::array<int, n> group;
  int group_number;
  int n, m;
};

int main() {
  int n, m, s, t, q;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  Relation relation(n, m);
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    std::cin >> s >> t;
    relation.push(s, t);
  }
  relation.findStronglyConnectedComponents();
  std::cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    std::cin >> s >> t;
    if (relation.canAccess(s, t)) {
      std::cout << "yes\n";
    } else {
      std::cout << "no\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:
- The optimized code may be slightly more complex due to the use of additional data structures and algorithms.
- The optimized code may require more memory due to the use of `std::vector` and `std::array` instead of dynamically allocated arrays.
- The optimized code may have improved running time and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
