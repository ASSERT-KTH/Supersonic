The given code represents a program that checks whether two nodes in a graph are in the same connected component. The program first creates a graph using the `push` function, where each node is connected to its adjacent nodes. Then, it determines the connected components by assigning a unique group number to each component using the `makeGroup` function. Finally, it checks whether two given nodes belong to the same connected component using the `canAccess` function.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Memory Allocation: The current implementation uses dynamic memory allocation for storing the graph and related data structures. This can lead to memory fragmentation and additional overhead. We can replace the dynamic arrays with fixed-size arrays to minimize memory allocation and deallocation.

2. Graph Traversal: The current implementation uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the graph and assign group numbers. BFS with a queue is a suitable choice for this task, but there are some optimizations we can apply to improve its efficiency.

3. Input/Output Operations: The current implementation uses the `scanf` and `printf` functions for input and output operations. These functions are known to be slower compared to other I/O methods like `std::cin` and `std::cout`. We can switch to these faster alternatives to improve I/O performance.
