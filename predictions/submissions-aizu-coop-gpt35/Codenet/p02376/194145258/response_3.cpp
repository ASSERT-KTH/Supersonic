The given code appears to be an implementation of the maximum flow algorithm using the push-relabel method. The main optimization opportunities in this code include:

1. Memory Allocation: The code dynamically creates a large number of `node_t` objects using the `new` operator. This can lead to a significant amount of memory allocation and deallocation overhead. To optimize this, we can pre-allocate a fixed-size array of `node_t` objects and reuse them throughout the algorithm.

2. Data Structures: The code uses a vector of vectors (`vector<edge> g[max_n]`) to represent the graph. This can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and cache locality. We can optimize this by using a single vector of edges and maintaining additional data structures to represent the adjacency list.

3. Loop Unrolling: The code uses a nested loop to iterate over the edges of each node in the main algorithm. By unrolling this loop, we can reduce the number of iterations and potentially improve performance.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations and pragmas to guide the compiler in generating optimized code. For example, loop optimizations and vectorization can be enabled using appropriate pragmas.
