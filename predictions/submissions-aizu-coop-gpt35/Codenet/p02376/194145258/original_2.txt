Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. The `vector<edge> g[max_n]` data structure: This is used to represent the graph, where `g[i]` contains the edges of node `i`. However, this representation is not efficient for finding the reverse edge when updating the flow. Instead, we can use an adjacency list representation, where each edge is stored twice - once in the forward direction and once in the reverse direction. This will eliminate the need for searching for the reverse edge.

2. The `node_t` structure: This structure is used to represent the nodes of the splay tree. However, the current implementation uses a lot of pointers and function calls, which can be costly in terms of both time and memory. We can simplify the structure and the operations on it to improve performance.

3. The `expose` function: This function is used to bring a node to the root of the splay tree. However, the current implementation uses a loop to traverse the tree, splaying each node along the way. This can be optimized by using a recursive approach to splay the node in a single pass.

4. The `find_root` function: This function is used to find the root of a node in the splay tree. However, the current implementation also uses a loop to traverse the tree, which can be optimized by using a recursive approach.

5. The `pour` function: This function is used to update the flow when pouring water between nodes. However, the current implementation uses a lot of function calls and checks, which can be simplified to improve performance.

6. The `max_flow` function: This function is used to calculate the maximum flow in the graph. However, the current implementation has several unnecessary loops and function calls, which can be optimized to improve performance.

Based on these observations, I will now provide a step-by-step optimization strategy to improve the efficiency of the given code.
