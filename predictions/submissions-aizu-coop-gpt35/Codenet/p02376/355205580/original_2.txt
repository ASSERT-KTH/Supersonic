The given code implements the Dinic's algorithm for finding the maximum flow in a network. The algorithm is already correct and produces the expected output. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency. Let's analyze the code and propose optimizations.

1. Use of `bits/stdc++.h`:
The code includes the header file `bits/stdc++.h` which includes all standard library headers. While this might be convenient, it is generally considered bad practice because it slows down the compilation process. Instead, we should include only the necessary headers explicitly.

2. Unnecessary use of templates:
The `Dinic` class is templated on the type of the flow capacity, but the code always uses `int` as the type. This introduces unnecessary complexity and can potentially slow down the compilation process. We can remove the template and use `int` directly.

3. Redundant copy of `Edge` objects:
In the `add_edge` function, the code creates two `Edge` objects for every edge in the graph. One object is stored in `g[src]` and the other in `g[dst]`. This creates a redundant copy of the edge data and increases memory usage. We can modify the `Edge` structure to store a reference to the original edge instead of copying it.

4. Avoid using `numeric_limits<Weight>::max()` for `INF`:
The code uses `INF` to represent an infinite value, but it is initialized with `numeric_limits<Weight>::max()`. This can be inefficient, especially if `Weight` is a large type like `long long`. Instead, we can use a more conservative value like `1e9` which is less likely to cause overflow issues.

5. Avoid using `vector<int> level` as a parameter in `Bfs` and `Dfs`:
The `level` vector is passed as a parameter to `Bfs` and `Dfs` functions. However, these functions only modify the values of `level` at specific indices and do not need to access the entire vector. We can pass a reference to the vector and modify only the required indices.

6. Avoid using `queue` for BFS:
The code uses a `queue` to perform breadth-first search (BFS) in the `Bfs` function. However, using a `queue` can be slower compared to using a simple `vector` as a queue. We can replace the `queue` with a `vector` and maintain two indices to represent the front and back of the queue.

7. Use of `auto` in range-based loops:
The code uses `auto` in range-based loops for iterating over the elements of the graph. While this is convenient, it can potentially introduce unnecessary overhead due to type inference. We can explicitly specify the type of the loop variable for better performance.

8. Loop unrolling in `Dfs` function:
The `Dfs` function uses a for loop to iterate over the edges of each vertex. We can optimize this loop by unrolling it, i.e., manually writing out the loop body for a fixed number of iterations. This can eliminate the need for loop variables and comparisons, resulting in faster execution.

9. Use of `endl` instead of `'\n'`:
The code uses `endl` to insert a newline character and flush the output stream. However, flushing the stream after every insertion can be inefficient. We can replace `endl` with `'\n'` to insert only the newline character and improve performance.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization steps.
