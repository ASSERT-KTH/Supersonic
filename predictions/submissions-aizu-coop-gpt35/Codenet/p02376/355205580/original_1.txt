The provided code implements the Dinic's algorithm for finding the maximum flow in a flow network. The algorithm itself is already efficient, but there are a few areas where we can optimize the code further:

1. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This line is generally considered bad practice as it pollutes the global namespace. Instead, it's better to explicitly specify the namespace for each identifier (e.g., `std::cin`, `std::cout`, etc.).

2. Avoid including the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header: This header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can significantly increase compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary headers explicitly (e.g., `<iostream>`).

3. Reserve space for the `g` vector: The `g` vector is used to represent the graph as an adjacency list. By reserving space for each vertex's adjacency list before adding edges, we can avoid unnecessary reallocations and improve performance.

4. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: The `emplace_back` function constructs the object in place, avoiding a potentially expensive copy or move operation. This can improve performance when adding edges to the graph.

5. Avoid unnecessary copying in the `Bfs` function: The `Bfs` function currently takes the `level` vector by reference. However, the `level` vector is modified only within the function and is not needed outside. To avoid unnecessary copying, we can pass the `level` vector by value and return the modified vector.

6. Use a `deque` instead of a `queue` in the `Bfs` function: The `queue` container uses a `deque` internally, but the `deque` provides more flexibility and can be faster in some cases. Changing the `Bfs` function to use a `deque` instead of a `queue` might improve performance slightly.

7. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment in the `Dfs` function: The `Dfs` function currently uses post-increment (`i++`) when iterating over the edges. Pre-increment (`++i`) can be slightly faster in some cases, as it avoids unnecessary copy of the iterator.

8. Use `reserve` for the `level` and `iter` vectors in the `Dfs` function: The `level` and `iter` vectors are resized to the size of the graph in each call to the `Dfs` function. By reserving space for these vectors before the loop, we can avoid unnecessary reallocations and improve performance.

Now let's incorporate these optimizations into the code:
