Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The `Dinic` class uses a `vector<vector<Edge>>` to represent the graph. This data structure is not the most memory-efficient choice, as it requires additional memory for storing each edge object. We can optimize this by using an adjacency list representation instead, where only the necessary information (e.g., destination vertex and weight) is stored.

2. The `Bfs` function uses a `queue` for breadth-first search. While this is a valid approach, it can be improved by using a more memory-efficient data structure, such as a deque or a custom queue implementation.

3. The `Dfs` function uses recursion to traverse the graph. Recursive function calls can introduce additional overhead and may lead to stack overflow errors for large input sizes. We can optimize this by using an iterative approach instead.

4. The `Dfs` function uses a linear search to find the next available edge. This can be improved by using an iterator or an index-based approach to directly access the next edge.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `vector<vector<Edge>>` with an adjacency list representation for the graph. This will reduce the memory footprint of the program.

2. Replace the `queue` in the `Bfs` function with a more memory-efficient data structure, such as a deque or a custom queue implementation.

3. Refactor the `Dfs` function to use an iterative approach instead of recursion. This will eliminate the overhead of function calls and reduce the risk of stack overflow errors.

4. Replace the linear search in the `Dfs` function with an iterator or an index-based approach to directly access the next edge. This will improve the efficiency of finding the next available edge.
