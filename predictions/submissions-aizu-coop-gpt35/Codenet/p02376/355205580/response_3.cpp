The code provided is an implementation of the Dinic's algorithm for finding the maximum flow in a flow network. The algorithm uses a graph data structure to represent the flow network and performs multiple iterations of the BFS (breadth-first search) and DFS (depth-first search) algorithms to find augmenting paths and update the flow.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Use a more efficient data structure for the graph representation: The current implementation uses a vector of vectors to represent the graph, which can be inefficient for large graphs. We can use an adjacency list representation instead, where each vertex stores a list of outgoing edges. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.

2. Avoid unnecessary copies and pass by reference: The functions `Bfs` and `Dfs` currently take the `level` and `iter` vectors by value, resulting in unnecessary copies of these vectors on each call. We can change the function signatures to take these vectors by reference, which will eliminate the copies.

3. Optimize the flow update: In the `Dfs` function, the flow update is performed by subtracting the flow from the current edge and adding the flow to the reverse edge. This can be optimized by using a single update step that subtracts the flow from the current edge and adds it to the reverse edge. This avoids the need for multiple assignments and improves performance.

4. Use compiler optimizations: We can enable compiler optimizations by adding appropriate `pragma` directives or compiler-specific flags. These optimizations can include loop unrolling, function inlining, and other optimizations that the compiler can perform.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail:

**Step 1: Use an adjacency list representation**

The current implementation uses a vector of vectors to represent the graph. We can change this to use an adjacency list representation, where each vertex stores a list of outgoing edges. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.

**Step 2: Pass vectors by reference**

The `Bfs` and `Dfs` functions currently take the `level` and `iter` vectors by value, resulting in unnecessary copies of these vectors on each call. We can change the function signatures to take these vectors by reference, which will eliminate the copies.

**Step 3: Optimize the flow update**

In the `Dfs` function, the flow update is performed by subtracting the flow from the current edge and adding the flow to the reverse edge. This can be optimized by using a single update step that subtracts the flow from the current edge and adds it to the reverse edge. This avoids the need for multiple assignments and improves performance.

**Step 4: Enable compiler optimizations**

We can enable compiler optimizations by adding appropriate `pragma` directives or compiler-specific flags. These optimizations can include loop unrolling, function inlining, and other optimizations that the compiler can perform.
