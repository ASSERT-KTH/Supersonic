Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is a non-standard header file and includes a large number of standard library headers. We can remove this include and only include the necessary headers.

2. Use of `std::queue` for BFS: The code currently uses `std::queue` for implementing the BFS algorithm. While this is a valid approach, using a `std::deque` instead of `std::queue` may provide better performance due to more efficient memory allocation.

3. Redundant checks in BFS and DFS: The code checks for `e.weight > 0` multiple times in both the `Bfs` and `Dfs` functions. We can optimize this by combining the check with the loop condition.

4. Loop optimization: The loop in the `Dfs` function can be optimized by using a range-based for loop instead of a regular for loop with an index.

5. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations like loop unrolling and function inlining to improve performance. We can also use compiler-specific pragma directives to provide hints to the compiler for further optimization.

Let's now apply these optimizations step-by-step and provide a detailed explanation for each optimization.
