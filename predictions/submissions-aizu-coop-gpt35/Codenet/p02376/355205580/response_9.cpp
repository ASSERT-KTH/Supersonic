The given code implements the Dinic's algorithm for finding the maximum flow in a flow network. The algorithm uses a graph representation and performs a series of breadth-first searches (BFS) and depth-first searches (DFS) to find augmenting paths and update the flow.

Here are some potential optimizations that can be applied to improve the efficiency of the code:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. Since only a few headers are actually used in the code, it is better to include only those specific headers.

2. Use `vector.reserve()` to optimize memory allocation: The `vector` container is used extensively in the code. By using `reserve()` function before adding elements to the vector, we can pre-allocate memory and avoid reallocations.

3. Use `vector` instead of `deque` for the queue: The `queue` container used in the `Bfs()` function is implemented as a `deque` by default. However, `vector` provides better cache locality and can be faster in practice for small to medium-sized queues.

4. Replace the `Weight` type with a more efficient type: The `Weight` template parameter is used to represent the capacity of the edges and the flow. Depending on the problem constraints, it may be possible to use a more efficient data type, such as `int` or `long long`, instead of the default `typename Weight`.

5. Optimize the BFS and DFS loops: The loops in the `Bfs()` and `Dfs()` functions can be optimized by using range-based for loops instead of index-based loops. This can improve readability and potentially lead to better compiler optimizations.

6. Apply compiler optimizations: Use compiler-specific optimization flags or directives to enable additional optimizations, such as loop unrolling, vectorization, or inlining. These optimizations can vary depending on the compiler used.
