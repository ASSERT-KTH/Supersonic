The provided code implements the Dinic's algorithm for finding the maximum flow in a flow network. The algorithm itself is already efficient, but there are some potential areas for optimization:

1. Use `std::vector` instead of `std::queue` for the BFS:
   - Currently, a `std::queue` is used for the BFS traversal. However, `std::vector` can be used instead, which will be faster due to better cache locality.
   - To implement this, replace `queue<int> que;` with `vector<int> que;` and change `que.push(s);` to `que.push_back(s);`. Similarly, change `que.front();` to `que.back();` and `que.pop();` to `que.pop_back();`.

2. Avoid unnecessary copying of edges:
   - In the `Dfs` function, the line `Edge &e = g[v][i];` makes a copy of the edge, which is not necessary. Instead, we can use a reference to avoid the copy.
   - To implement this, change `Edge &e = g[v][i];` to `Edge& e = g[v][i];`.

3. Use `reserve` to preallocate memory for vectors:
   - The vectors `level` and `iter` are resized multiple times during the algorithm execution. However, we can avoid these resizings by using `reserve` to preallocate memory for these vectors.
   - To implement this, add the following lines before the `while` loop in the `MaximumFlow` function:
     ```
     level.reserve(n);
     iter.reserve(n);
     ```

4. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back` for adding edges:
   - The `add_edge` function uses `push_back` to add edges to the adjacency list. However, `emplace_back` can be used instead to construct the edge directly in the vector, avoiding an unnecessary copy.
   - To implement this, change `g[src].push_back(Edge(src, dst, cap, g[dst].size()));` to `g[src].emplace_back(src, dst, cap, g[dst].size());` and `g[dst].push_back(Edge(dst, src, 0, g[src].size() - 1));` to `g[dst].emplace_back(dst, src, 0, g[src].size() - 1);`.

5. Use `const` reference for the `Dinic` constructor parameter:
   - The `n` parameter of the `Dinic` constructor is passed by value. However, since it is not modified, it can be passed by `const` reference to avoid unnecessary copying.
   - To implement this, change `Dinic(const int n)` to `Dinic(const int& n)`.

6. Remove unnecessary `const` qualifier for `Weight` template parameter:
   - The `const` qualifier for the `Weight` template parameter is not necessary and can be removed.
   - To implement this, change `template <typename Weight> class Dinic {` to `template <typename Weight> class Dinic {`.

7. Use `std::size_t` for vector sizes and indices:
   - The vector sizes and indices in the code are currently of type `int`. However, it would be more appropriate to use `std::size_t` for these, as it is the type returned by `std::vector`'s `size` function and the type expected by its indexing operator.
   - To implement this, change the type of the `n` member variable to `std::size_t`. Similarly, change the types of `level`, `iter`, `i`, and `N` to `std::size_t`.
