The provided code calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D plane using complex numbers. However, there are a few optimizations that can be made to improve its performance and memory usage.

1. Remove Unused Headers: The code includes unnecessary headers such as `<cmath>` and `<iostream>`. Since we are not using any functions from these headers, we can remove them.

2. Avoid Using `using namespace std;`: It is considered good practice to avoid using the `using namespace std;` directive. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix to explicitly specify the namespace when using standard library functions.

3. Replace `printf` with `cout`: The code currently uses `printf` from the `<cstdio>` header to print the result. We can replace it with `cout` from the `<iostream>` header for better consistency.

4. Avoid Unnecessary Complex Number Operations: The code converts the input coordinates to complex numbers and then calculates the absolute difference. We can avoid using complex numbers altogether and directly calculate the Euclidean distance using the formula `sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)`. This will eliminate the overhead of complex number operations.

5. Use `std::pow` Instead of `^` Operator: The code uses the `^` operator to calculate the square of the differences. However, this operator performs bitwise XOR, not exponentiation. We can use the `std::pow` function from the `<cmath>` header to correctly calculate the square of the differences.

Based on these observations, the optimized code can be written as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  double x1, y1, x2, y2;
  std::cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
  
  double distance = std::sqrt(std::pow(x2 - x1, 2) + std::pow(y2 - y1, 2));
  std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(5) << distance << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates the unnecessary overhead of complex number operations and uses standard arithmetic operations to calculate the Euclidean distance. It also correctly calculates the square of the differences using the `std::pow` function. The result is then printed using `std::cout` with fixed precision of 5 decimal places.
