The provided code calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D plane using the `abs` function from the `<cmath>` library. While the code is correct and produces the expected output, there are a few areas where performance improvements can be made:

1. Avoiding unnecessary library includes: The code includes the `<cmath>` and `<complex>` libraries, but only uses a single function from `<cmath>` and a single class from `<complex>`. We can remove the unnecessary includes to reduce compilation time and improve build performance.

2. Minimizing I/O operations: The code uses `cin` and `printf` for input and output. However, using `cin` for multiple inputs can be slower than using `scanf` in a single call. Similarly, `printf` can be slower than using `cout`. We can optimize the I/O operations to improve performance.

3. Avoiding unnecessary function calls: The `abs` function from `<cmath>` is used to calculate the distance between two complex numbers. However, since we are working with real numbers, we can directly calculate the distance using the Pythagorean theorem, avoiding the overhead of complex number operations.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps.
