The provided code is a simple program that calculates the absolute difference between two complex numbers. However, there are several areas of improvement that can be made to optimize its performance and memory usage.

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes unnecessary headers such as `<cmath>` and `<iostream>`. Since the code only requires a few functions from the `<complex>` header, we can remove the unnecessary includes to improve compilation time.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: The `using namespace std;` statement brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can cause naming conflicts and make the code less readable. It is better to explicitly specify the namespace for the used entities.

3. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `printf` and `cin`: The code uses a mix of C-style `printf` and C++ `cin` for input and output operations. It is better to use consistent C++ style input/output operations with `std::cin` and `std::cout`, which are typically faster and more type-safe.

4. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The code calls `P1.real()`, `P1.imag()`, `P2.real()`, and `P2.imag()` to read the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers. Instead, we can directly use the `real()` and `imag()` member functions of `std::complex` without the function call syntax.

5. Remove unnecessary precision specifier in `printf`: The code specifies a precision of `5` in the `printf` statement. Since the code doesn't perform any floating-point operations, we can remove the precision specifier.
