The provided code calculates the distance between two points in a 2D space using complex numbers. However, there are several areas where this code can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Avoiding unnecessary header file inclusions: The code includes unnecessary header files, such as `<cmath>`, `<cstdio>`, and `<iostream>`. Since these headers are not used in the code, they can be removed.

2. Avoiding the use of `using namespace std;`: The `using namespace std;` statement is considered bad practice as it pollutes the global namespace. Instead, we can qualify the usage of `complex`, `cin`, and `cout` with the `std` namespace.

3. Avoiding repeated calculations: The code calculates the absolute difference between two complex numbers using the `abs` function. However, the `abs` function computes the magnitude of a complex number, which involves a square root calculation. Since we are only interested in the distance between two points, we can avoid the square root calculation by computing the squared magnitude instead.

4. Using a more efficient output method: The code uses `printf` to output the result with 5 decimal places. However, since we are using C++, it is more efficient to use `cout` with the `std::fixed` and `std::setprecision` manipulators to achieve the same result.

Considering these optimizations, let's modify the code accordingly:
