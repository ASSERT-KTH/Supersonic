The given code calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D space using the `complex` class from the C++ Standard Library. The code reads the coordinates of the two points from the user and then computes the distance using the `abs` function from the `<cmath>` library. Finally, it prints the result.

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes the `<complex>` header file, but it only uses a single function from `<cmath>`. We can remove the `<complex>` header file since it is not needed.

2. Minimize namespace usage: The code currently uses the `using namespace std;` directive, which brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to potential naming conflicts and make the code harder to understand. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix to explicitly specify the namespace for the required functions and objects.

3. Avoid using `printf` for output: The code uses `printf` from the `<cstdio>` library to print the result. However, using `cout` from the `<iostream>` library is more idiomatic in C++. We can replace the `printf` statement with `cout` to improve readability.

4. Optimize the calculation: The code uses the `abs` function to calculate the distance between two points. However, since we are working with complex numbers, we can use the `std::norm` function to calculate the square of the distance, which is more efficient. We can then use `std::sqrt` to calculate the square root of the squared distance.

With these optimizations in mind, let's modify the code accordingly:
