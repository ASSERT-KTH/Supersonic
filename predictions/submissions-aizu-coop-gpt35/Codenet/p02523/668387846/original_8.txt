The given code calculates the absolute value of the difference between two complex numbers using the `abs()` function from the `<cmath>` library. The code then prints the result with a precision of 5 decimal places.

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes `<cstdio>` and `<iostream>` headers, which are not needed for the current implementation. We can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce unnecessary dependencies.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: While using the `std` namespace can make the code more concise, it is generally considered a bad practice as it can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix to explicitly indicate the namespace for standard library functions and types.

3. Optimize input and output operations:
   - Instead of using `cin` and `printf`, we can use `scanf` and `printf` for faster input and output operations. This is because the `scanf` and `printf` functions are generally faster than their C++ counterparts due to their simpler nature.
   - We can also remove the precision specifier from the `printf` function since it is not required in the problem statement.

4. Avoid unnecessary computation:
   - The `abs()` function is being used to calculate the absolute value of the difference between two complex numbers. However, the `abs()` function is designed to work with real numbers and not complex numbers. Instead, we can use the `std::abs()` function from the `<complex>` library to calculate the magnitude of the difference between two complex numbers.
   - Since we are only interested in the magnitude of the difference, we can avoid the computation of the actual difference by directly calculating the magnitude using the formula `sqrt((P1.real() - P2.real())*(P1.real() - P2.real()) + (P1.imag() - P2.imag())*(P1.imag() - P2.imag()))`. This eliminates the need for creating intermediate complex numbers and performing complex arithmetic.

Taking these optimization steps into consideration, the optimized code can be written as follows:
