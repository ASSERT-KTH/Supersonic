The given code calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in the complex plane. However, there are a few areas where we can optimize the code for efficiency:

1. Avoiding unnecessary headers: The code includes unnecessary headers such as `<cmath>` and `<complex>`. Since we only need the `complex` class from the `<complex>` header, we can remove the `<cmath>` header.

2. Using `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The code uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations, respectively. However, using `std::cin` and `std::cout` from the `<iostream>` header is generally more efficient and provides type safety.

3. Avoiding the `using namespace std;` directive: The `using namespace std;` directive is considered bad practice because it pollutes the global namespace. Instead, we can prefix the `cin` and `cout` objects with `std::` to specify the namespace explicitly.

4. Using `double` instead of `complex<double>` for point representation: Since we are only interested in the real and imaginary parts of the points, using the `complex` class is unnecessary overhead. We can replace the `complex<double>` objects `P1` and `P2` with `double` variables.

5. Avoiding unnecessary function calls: The code unnecessarily calls the `real()` and `imag()` functions on the `P1` and `P2` objects to read their real and imaginary parts. Instead, we can directly read the real and imaginary parts into separate variables.

6. Calculating the Euclidean distance without using complex subtraction: The code calculates the Euclidean distance by subtracting `P2` from `P1` using the `-` operator and then taking the absolute value using the `abs()` function. However, we can directly calculate the distance using the formula `sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)` without using complex subtraction.
