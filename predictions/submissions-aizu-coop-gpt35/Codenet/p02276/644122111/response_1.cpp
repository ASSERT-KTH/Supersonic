The provided code appears to implement the QuickSort algorithm to partition an array of integers. The `partition` function selects a pivot element and arranges the array elements such that all elements smaller than the pivot are placed before it, and all elements larger than the pivot are placed after it. The `print_partition_ints` function simply prints the partitioned array.

To optimize this code for efficiency, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The current code allocates an array of size `n` to store the input integers. However, using variable-length arrays (VLAs) is not recommended for performance-critical code as it can lead to stack overflow for large input sizes. Instead, we can dynamically allocate memory using `new` to avoid any potential issues.

2. Minimize unnecessary copies: The current implementation of the `partition` function performs unnecessary swaps by swapping elements with themselves. We can optimize this by avoiding swaps when the element is already in the correct position.

3. Improve loop efficiency: The `print_partition_ints` function uses a loop to iterate over the array elements and print them. We can optimize this by using a more efficient loop structure.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler-specific optimizations and pragmas to guide the compiler in optimizing certain parts of the code.
