The provided code performs a partitioning operation on an array of integers. It takes an input array, partitions it based on a pivot element, and prints the resulting partitioned array. 

Here is the analysis of the code:

1. The `print_partition_ints` function iterates over the array and prints the elements with appropriate formatting. It uses `std::printf` to print each element individually, resulting in multiple system calls. This can be improved by using a more efficient method to print the elements.

2. The `partition` function takes an array and two indices (`first` and `last`), and partitions the array based on the element at the `last` index. It uses the Lomuto partition scheme to partition the array. While this scheme is simple to understand, it is not the most efficient partitioning scheme. There are other partitioning schemes, like the Hoare partition scheme, which can be more efficient.

3. The `main` function reads the input size `n` and the array elements. It then calls the `partition` function and prints the partitioned array using the `print_partition_ints` function.

Now, let's formulate an optimization strategy to improve the performance and memory usage of the code.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Improve Printing Efficiency:
   - Instead of using multiple calls to `std::printf`, we can construct a formatted string and print it in a single call. This reduces the system call overhead.
   - We can use `std::string` to construct the formatted string and then print it using `std::printf`.

2. Optimize Partitioning Algorithm:
   - The Lomuto partition scheme used in the `partition` function can be replaced with a more efficient partitioning scheme, such as the Hoare partition scheme. This can significantly improve the performance of the partitioning operation.

3. Avoid Variable-Length Arrays:
   - Variable-length arrays are not part of the standard C++ language and can cause issues in terms of memory allocation and deallocation. We can replace the variable-length array `int as[n]` with a dynamically allocated array using `new` and `delete[]`.

4. Use Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. Compiler optimizations can include options like `-O2` or `-O3` for GCC or Clang, or `/O2` or `/Ox` for MSVC. These optimizations can perform various transformations on the code to improve its efficiency.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step by step.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <string>
using uint = unsigned int;

static void print_partition_ints(const int as[], const uint q, const uint n) {
  std::string formattedStr;
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    formattedStr += (i != q ? "%d " : "[%d] ");
  }
  formattedStr.pop_back(); // Remove trailing space
  std::printf((formattedStr + "\n").c_str(), as, as[n-1]);
}

static uint partition(int as[], const uint first, const uint last) {
  auto pivot = as[first];
  auto i = first - 1;
  auto j = last + 1;
  while (true) {
    do {
      ++i;
    } while (as[i] < pivot);
    do {
      --j;
    } while (as[j] > pivot);
    if (i >= j) {
      return j;
    }
    std::swap(as[i], as[j]);
  }
}

int main() {
  uint n;
  std::scanf("%u", &n);
  int* as = new int[n];
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    std::scanf("%d", &as[i]);
  }
  auto q = partition(as, 0, n - 1);
  print_partition_ints(as, q, n);
  delete[] as;
}
```

Explanation of Optimizations:

1. Improve Printing Efficiency:
   - Instead of using multiple calls to `std::printf`, we construct a formatted string using `std::string`. The formatted string is built by appending the appropriate format specifier based on the index of the element being printed. This way, we can print the entire formatted string in a single call to `std::printf`, reducing system call overhead.

2. Optimize Partitioning Algorithm:
   - We replace the Lomuto partition scheme with the Hoare partition scheme. In the Hoare scheme, instead of starting with the last element as the pivot, we choose the first element as the pivot and maintain two indices (`i` and `j`). The `i` index moves from left to right until it finds an element greater than the pivot, and the `j` index moves from right to left until it finds an element smaller than the pivot. When `i` and `j` cross each other, the partitioning is complete. This scheme is generally more efficient than the Lomuto scheme.

3. Avoid Variable-Length Arrays:
   - Variable-length arrays (`int as[n]`) are not part of the standard C++ language and can cause issues in terms of memory allocation and deallocation. We replace the variable-length array with a dynamically allocated array using `new` and `delete[]`. This ensures proper memory allocation and deallocation of the array.

4. Use Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. Compiler optimizations can perform various transformations on the code to improve its efficiency. The specific compiler optimization flags depend on the compiler being used.
