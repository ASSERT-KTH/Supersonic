The provided code is a C++ program that reads an integer `n` from the user, followed by `n` integers. It then performs a partitioning operation on the array of integers based on the last element, and finally prints the partitioned array.

Upon analyzing the code, here are the potential areas of optimization:

1. Input Handling: The code uses `std::scanf` to read the input integers. This function is known to be slower compared to other input methods. Switching to a faster input method, such as `std::cin`, can improve the overall performance.

2. Dynamic Array Allocation: The code uses a variable-length array `int as[n]` to store the input integers. Variable-length arrays are not part of the C++ standard and can be inefficient. Allocating a fixed-size array or using a `std::vector` can be more efficient.

3. `print_partition_ints` Function: The function iterates over the array and prints each element. This can be optimized by using `std::cout` for output instead of `std::printf`, as `std::cout` is generally faster.

4. `partition` Function: The function performs the partitioning operation using the last element as the pivot. This is a naive implementation of the partitioning algorithm and can be further optimized.

To optimize the provided code, we will follow the following steps:

1. Replace `std::scanf` with `std::cin` for input handling.
2. Replace the variable-length array `int as[n]` with a `std::vector<int>`.
3. Update the `print_partition_ints` function to use `std::cout` for output.
4. Optimize the `partition` function to use the Hoare partition scheme instead of the naive implementation.

Now let's proceed with the optimization steps one by one.
