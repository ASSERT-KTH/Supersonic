The given code is a C++ program that performs topological sorting on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and checks if the sorted order forms a Hamiltonian path. The code uses several macros and data structures to simplify the implementation.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Remove unnecessary macros: The code uses several macros to define common operations. However, these macros add unnecessary overhead and can be replaced with inline functions or simple code snippets.

2. Optimize the topological sorting algorithm: The current implementation uses a stack-based approach to perform topological sorting. While this approach is correct, it can be optimized for performance by reducing unnecessary operations and improving memory usage.

3. Simplify data structures: The code uses a map to store the edges of the graph, but this adds additional memory overhead. We can simplify the data structure to use a simple 2D array or a vector of pairs.

4. Improve I/O operations: The code uses the `scanf` function for input and `printf` for output. These functions are slower than their C++ counterparts (`cin` and `cout`). We can replace these functions to improve I/O performance.
