Code Analysis:
- The code starts by including the entire "bits/stdc++.h" library, which is not recommended. It is better to include only the specific headers that are required.
- The code heavily relies on macros for various operations like adding, subtracting, multiplying, etc. While macros can improve code readability, they can also hinder performance due to multiple evaluations of the same arguments. It would be better to replace these macros with inline functions or regular code.
- The code uses a custom class called "t_sort" to perform topological sorting. The class maintains a graph, calculates the in-degree of each vertex, and performs the sorting using a stack. However, the implementation of the class can be improved to optimize memory usage and reduce unnecessary operations.
- The code uses a map called "mp" to store information about the edges of the graph. This map is unnecessary as the information can be stored directly in the graph data structure.
- The code prints the answer in two parts: first, it prints the topological sorting order, and then it checks if the sorting order forms a valid path in the graph. This check can be performed during the topological sorting itself, eliminating the need for a separate loop.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: Replace the "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" with the specific headers required for the program, such as <iostream>, <vector>, <algorithm>, etc.
2. Replace macros with inline functions: Replace the macros ADD, SUB, MUL, chmin, chmax with inline functions to avoid multiple evaluations and improve code readability.
3. Optimize the t_sort class:
    - Replace the "vector<vector<int>> G" with a more memory-efficient data structure such as a vector of sets or a vector of vectors with pre-allocated memory.
    - Remove the "deg" vector and calculate the in-degree of each vertex during the graph construction.
    - Modify the "tsort" function to check for the validity of the sorting order during the topological sorting itself, eliminating the need for a separate loop.
4. Remove the map "mp" and store the edge information directly in the graph data structure.
5. Replace the use of "scanf" and "printf" with the more efficient "cin" and "cout" for input/output operations.
6. Add appropriate comments to document the changes made and improve code readability.
