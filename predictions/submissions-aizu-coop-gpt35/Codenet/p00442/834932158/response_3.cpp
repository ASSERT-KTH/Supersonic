The given code appears to be a C++ program that performs a topological sort on a directed graph and checks if the resulting ordering is a Hamiltonian path. The code uses several macros and data structures to simplify the implementation. However, there are several areas where this code can be further optimized for efficiency. 

Here is the step-by-step optimization strategy for the given code:

1. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros `UNIQUE(v)` and `ZIP(v)` are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Replace `vector` with `array` for fixed-size data: The `deg` and `G` vectors in the `t_sort` class have a fixed size determined by the input `n`. Therefore, it is more efficient to use `array` instead of `vector` for these data structures.

3. Use `reserve` to avoid frequent reallocation: Since the size of the `G` vector is known in advance, we can use the `reserve` function to allocate memory for all elements at once. This avoids frequent reallocation when adding edges.

4. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back` for performance: The `emplace_back` function can be used instead of `push_back` in the `add_edge` function. This avoids unnecessary copying or moving of elements.

5. Avoid unnecessary calls to `size` function: The `rep(i, G[v].size())` loop in the `tsort` function calls the `size` function multiple times. Instead, we can store the size in a variable before the loop to avoid the function call overhead.

6. Use a `vector` instead of a `stack` for topological sort: The `stack` data structure used in the `tsort` function can be replaced with a `vector` to improve performance. The `vector` can be used as a stack by using the `back` and `pop_back` functions.

7. Use `unordered_map` instead of `map` for better performance: The `map<P, int> mp` data structure can be replaced with `unordered_map<P, int>` to improve performance. This is because `unordered_map` has constant-time average complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups.

8. Optimize the Hamiltonian path check: The current implementation checks each pair of consecutive vertices in the topological order to see if there is an edge between them. This can be optimized by checking the existence of edges during the topological sort itself.
