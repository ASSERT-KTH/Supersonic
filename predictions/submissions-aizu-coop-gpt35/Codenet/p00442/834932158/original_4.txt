The given code is a C++ program that performs topological sorting on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and checks if the sorted order forms a Hamiltonian path. The code uses a custom class `t_sort` to perform the topological sorting. However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized for better performance and memory usage. 

Here is the optimization strategy for the given code:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary headers. We can replace it with the specific headers that are actually needed for the code, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<deque>`, and `<map>`. 

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The code defines several macros that are not used in the code or can be replaced with standard C++ functions. We can remove the macros `UNIQUE`, `ZIP`, `ADD`, `SUB`, and `MUL`, as they are not used.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The code defines several typedefs that are not used in the code. We can remove the typedefs `P`, `PP`, `vi`, and `dq`.

4. Replace `vector` with `array` for fixed-size arrays: The code uses `vector` for arrays with a fixed size, such as `ans` and `deg`. We can replace them with `array` for better memory efficiency.

5. Replace `stack` with `vector` for topological sorting: The code uses a `stack` to perform topological sorting. However, using a `vector` instead of a `stack` can provide better performance, as it avoids the overhead of push and pop operations.

6. Use `emplace_back` instead of `pb` for performance: The code uses `pb` to add elements to vectors. However, using `emplace_back` instead of `pb` can provide better performance, as it avoids the overhead of creating temporary objects.

7. Avoid unnecessary map lookups: The code uses a map `mp` to check if an edge exists between two nodes. However, we can avoid the map lookups by using a 2D boolean array to store the edge information.

8. Optimize the Hamiltonian path check: The code checks if the sorted order forms a Hamiltonian path by comparing each pair of consecutive nodes. Instead of checking each pair, we can optimize it by checking if the last node in the sorted order has an edge to the first node.

9. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The code uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output. However, using `std::cin` and `std::cout` can provide better performance and type safety.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step:
