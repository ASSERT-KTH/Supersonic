The given code appears to be a topological sorting algorithm that finds a linear ordering of the vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before vertex v in the ordering. There are several potential areas for optimization in this code:

1. Using `vector<int>` for the `edge` array: The `edge` array is currently defined as an array of vectors. This can lead to inefficient memory allocation and deallocation when the size of vectors change. We can consider using a more efficient data structure to store the edges.

2. Using `vector<int>` for the `cnt` array: The `cnt` array is used to keep track of the number of incoming edges for each vertex. We can optimize this by using a more efficient data structure or by eliminating the need for this array altogether.

3. Removing unnecessary checks: The code uses a flag variable `flag` to check if there are any remaining vertices. This flag is only used to print "1" or "0" at the end. We can eliminate this flag by checking the size of the `next` vector directly.

4. Avoiding unnecessary function calls: The code uses `next.erase(next.end() - 1)` to remove the last element from the `next` vector. This operation has a time complexity of O(n) as it requires shifting all the elements after the removed element. We can optimize this by using `next.pop_back()` instead.

5. Reducing the number of vector resizes: The code uses `next.push_back()` to add elements to the `next` vector. This can lead to multiple resizes if the vector needs to be expanded. We can optimize this by preallocating the required size for the `next` vector.

6. Reducing the number of vector lookups: The code uses `next[next.size() - 1]` to get the last element of the `next` vector. This lookup has a time complexity of O(1), but the code does this multiple times in a loop. We can optimize this by storing the last element in a separate variable and updating it when necessary.

7. Using `printf` instead of `cout`: The code uses `printf` for printing integers. While this may not have a significant impact on performance, using `printf` can be slightly faster than using `cout` for large numbers of print statements.

8. Compiler optimizations: We can consider enabling compiler optimizations to allow the compiler to perform various optimizations automatically. This can be achieved by adding appropriate compiler flags or pragma directives.
