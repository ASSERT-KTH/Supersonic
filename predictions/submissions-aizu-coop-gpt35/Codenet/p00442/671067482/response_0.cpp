The given code is a program that performs a topological sort on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) represented by its edges. The program takes two inputs: `n`, the number of nodes in the graph, and `m`, the number of edges. The edges are then read from standard input, and the program outputs the topological order of the nodes.

Upon a closer look, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage:
   - The `edge` vector is an array of vectors, where each vector represents the outgoing edges from a node. This approach requires memory for both the vector and its internal storage capacity, which can be inefficient. We can optimize this by using a more memory-efficient data structure.
   - The `cnt` array keeps track of the number of incoming edges for each node. Since the maximum number of nodes is 5000, the array can be quite large. We can optimize this by using a more memory-efficient data structure.

2. Loop Optimization:
   - The loop `REP(i, n)` is used to initialize the `next` vector with nodes that have no incoming edges. However, we can optimize this loop by iterating over the edges directly and removing the need for the `cnt` array.

3. Compiler Optimizations:
   - The program does not currently have any specific compiler optimizations enabled. We can explore potential compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or enabling optimization flags, to improve performance.
