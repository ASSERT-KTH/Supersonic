The given code appears to be a program that performs a topological sort on a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The program reads in the number of nodes (`n`) and the number of edges (`m`) in the graph, followed by the pairs of nodes that are connected by edges. The program then performs a topological sort and prints the sorted order of the nodes.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structures: The program uses a vector of vectors (`vector<int> edge[5000]`) to represent the adjacency list of the graph. This can be inefficient in terms of memory usage, especially if the graph is sparse. Additionally, the program uses a vector (`vector<int> next`) to store the next nodes to be processed in the topological sort. The use of this vector for removal and addition of elements can be time-consuming.

2. Redundant computations: The program checks if `next.size() > 0` in each iteration of the outer loop. This check is unnecessary since the loop can only continue if there are elements in `next`.

3. Inefficient loop traversal: The program uses a loop to iterate over the elements of `next` to find the index of the element to be processed (`int tar = next[next.size() - 1]`). This can be optimized by using `next.back()` instead.

4. Inefficient memory access: The program uses `next.erase(next.end() - 1)` to remove the last element from `next`. This can be optimized by using `next.pop_back()` instead.
