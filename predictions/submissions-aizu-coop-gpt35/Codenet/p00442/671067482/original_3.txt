The given code is a C++ program that reads in a directed graph, represented as a list of edges, and performs a topological sort on the graph. The program then outputs the sorted order of the vertices and whether or not the graph has a cycle.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Improve memory usage: The program uses a vector of vectors (`edge`) to represent the graph, which may result in inefficient memory allocation. Consider using a more efficient data structure to represent the graph, such as an adjacency list.

2. Avoid unnecessary computations: The program uses a vector (`cnt`) to count the number of incoming edges for each vertex. However, this information can be derived from the graph representation itself, eliminating the need for the `cnt` vector.

3. Simplify loop iterations: The program uses nested loops to iterate over the vertices and their outgoing edges. Consider simplifying these loops to improve efficiency.

4. Optimize vector resizing: The program uses the `erase` function to remove elements from the `next` vector. However, this operation may result in unnecessary reallocations and copies. Consider using a different data structure or a more efficient way to remove elements from the vector.

5. Use `printf` instead of `cout`: The program uses `cout` for output, which may be slower compared to `printf`. Consider using `printf` instead for better performance.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the vector of vectors (`edge`) with an adjacency list to improve memory usage and reduce memory allocations.

2. Eliminate the `cnt` vector and derive the count of incoming edges from the adjacency list.

3. Simplify the loops by using range-based loops and iterator-based loops when iterating over the vertices and their outgoing edges.

4. Use a more efficient data structure or a different approach to remove elements from the `next` vector.

5. Replace `cout` with `printf` for output.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step.
