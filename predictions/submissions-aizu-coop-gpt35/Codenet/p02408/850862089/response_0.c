Code Analysis:
- The code initializes a 2D array `Cards` with 4 rows and 14 columns to represent a deck of cards.
- It reads an integer `n` from the user.
- It then reads `2*n` lines, each consisting of a character `Mark` and an integer `Num`.
- Based on the value of `Mark`, it marks the corresponding card in the `Cards` array.
- Finally, it loops over the `Cards` array and prints the missing cards for each suit.

Potential optimizations:
1. Improve input parsing: The code currently reads `Mark` and `Num` separately. This can be combined into a single `scanf` statement to avoid unnecessary function calls.
2. Use a more compact data structure: The `Cards` array can be optimized to use a single-dimensional array instead of a 2D array. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache efficiency.
3. Eliminate redundant checks: The loop that prints the missing cards can be optimized to eliminate redundant checks by iterating only over the valid range of cards.
4. Use compiler optimizations: The code can benefit from enabling compiler optimizations to allow the compiler to perform various optimizations automatically.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Combine input parsing: Modify the `scanf` statement to read `Mark` and `Num` in a single call, eliminating the need for an additional `scanf` call.
2. Compact data structure: Replace the 2D array `Cards` with a 1D array to represent the deck of cards. This can be achieved by using a single array of size 52 (4 suits * 13 ranks).
3. Optimize missing card printing: Instead of iterating over the entire range of cards, iterate only over the valid range of cards for each suit.
4. Enable compiler optimizations: Add compiler optimization flags to the build process to allow the compiler to perform automatic optimizations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Combine input parsing:
   - Modify the line `scanf("%c ", &Mark)` to `scanf(" %c%d", &Mark, &Num)`.
   - The space before `%c` is added to consume any leading whitespace characters.
   - This change allows `Mark` and `Num` to be read in a single call to `scanf`, eliminating the need for an additional `scanf` call.

2. Compact data structure:
   - Replace the 2D array `Cards` with a 1D array.
   - Declare a new array `Cards` of size 52.
   - Modify the indexing logic to calculate the index based on the suit and rank of the card.
   - Update the initialization of `Cards` and the marking of cards accordingly.

3. Optimize missing card printing:
   - Modify the loops that print the missing cards for each suit.
   - Instead of iterating from 1 to 14, iterate from 0 to 13.
   - This change allows direct indexing into the `Cards` array, eliminating the need for the `j - 1` index adjustment.
   - Print the suit character along with the rank to match the format of the original program.

4. Enable compiler optimizations:
   - Add appropriate compiler optimization flags to the build process, such as `-O2` for GCC or Clang.
   - This allows the compiler to perform automatic optimizations, such as loop unrolling or inline function expansion, to improve performance.
