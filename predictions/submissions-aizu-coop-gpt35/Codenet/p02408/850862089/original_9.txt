Code Analysis:
- The program reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of sets of playing cards.
- It then reads `2n` lines, each containing a character `Mark` and an integer `Num`, representing the suit and number of a playing card.
- The program stores the presence of each card in a 2D array `Cards`, where each row represents a suit (Spades, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds) and each column represents a card number (1-13).
- Finally, the program loops through each suit in `Cards` and prints the missing cards.

Potential optimizations:
1. The `Cards` array can be optimized to use less memory by using a 1D array instead of a 2D array. Since each suit has only 13 cards, we can use a single array of size 52 to represent all the cards.
2. The loops that print the missing cards can be combined into a single loop to avoid code duplication.
3. The `scanf` calls can be optimized to read the input more efficiently.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the 2D `Cards` array with a 1D array.
2. Modify the input reading code to skip leading whitespace before reading the character `Mark`.
3. Combine the loops that print the missing cards into a single loop.
4. Use the `%*c` format specifier in `scanf` to skip the newline character after reading `Num`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the 2D `Cards` array with a 1D array:
   - The original code uses a 2D array `Cards[4][14]` to represent the presence of each card. However, since each suit has only 13 cards, we can use a 1D array of size 52 (`Cards[52]`) to represent all the cards.
   - This optimization reduces memory usage and improves cache locality, as the cards of each suit are stored consecutively in memory.
   - To access the presence of a card `Num` in suit `Mark`, we can use the formula `Cards[(Mark - 'S') * 13 + (Num - 1)]`.

2. Modify the input reading code:
   - The original code reads the character `Mark` using `scanf("%c", &Mark)`, but it does not consume the newline character after reading `Num`. This can cause issues with the subsequent `scanf` calls.
   - To fix this, we can modify the format string to skip leading whitespace before reading `Mark` by using a space before `%c` in the format string: `scanf(" %c", &Mark)`.
   - Additionally, we need to modify the format string for reading `Num` to skip the newline character after it: `scanf("%d%*c", &Num)`.

3. Combine the loops that print the missing cards:
   - The original code has four separate loops to print the missing cards for each suit, which is redundant.
   - We can combine these loops into a single loop that iterates over the suits and prints the missing cards for each suit.
   - This reduces code duplication and improves code readability.

4. Use the `%*c` format specifier in `scanf`:
   - The modified format string for reading `Num` is `"%d%*c"`. The `%*c` format specifier tells `scanf` to read a character and discard it.
   - This allows us to skip the newline character after reading `Num` and prevents it from interfering with subsequent `scanf` calls.

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int Cards[52] = {0}; // Optimized for memory usage
  int i, j, n, Num;
  char Mark;

  scanf("%d", &n);

  for (i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
    scanf(" %c%d%*c", &Mark, &Num); // Modified input reading code

    int suit = (Mark - 'S') * 13;
    Cards[suit + Num - 1] = 1;
  }

  char suits[] = {'S', 'H', 'C', 'D'};

  for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < 13; j++) {
      int suit = i * 13;
      if (Cards[suit + j] != 1) {
        printf("%c %d\n", suits[i], j + 1);
      }
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces memory usage by using a 1D array to represent the presence of each card, combines the loops that print the missing cards, and modifies the input reading code to handle leading whitespace and newline characters correctly. It preserves the functionality and output of the original code while improving efficiency.
