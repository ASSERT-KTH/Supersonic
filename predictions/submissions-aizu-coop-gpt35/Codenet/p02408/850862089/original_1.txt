Code Analysis:
The given code is a simple program that reads input from the user and populates a 2D array `Cards` based on the input. It then prints the missing cards from each suit. However, there are a few areas where the code can be optimized:

1. Redundant Memory Allocation: The `Cards` array is initialized with all elements set to 0 using `{{}}`. This is unnecessary since C automatically initializes all elements of an uninitialized global or static array to 0. Therefore, we can remove the initialization.

2. Inefficient Data Structure: The `Cards` array is a 2D array of integers, where each element represents the presence (1) or absence (0) of a card. However, we can optimize the memory usage by using a 1D array of booleans instead. This will reduce the memory footprint by half.

3. Unnecessary Checks: The code checks if the value at `Cards[i][j-1]` is not equal to 1 for each suit. Since all elements are initialized to 0 and we are only interested in the missing cards, we can simplify the check to `Cards[i][j-1] == 0`.

4. Loop Optimization: The loops for printing the missing cards can be optimized by using a single loop instead of four separate loops. We can iterate over the suits (0 to 3) and then the card numbers (0 to 13) to check and print the missing cards.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove the unnecessary initialization of the `Cards` array.
2. Replace the 2D `Cards` array with a 1D array of booleans.
3. Simplify the check for missing cards by using `Cards[i][j-1] == 0`.
4. Optimize the loops for printing missing cards by using a single loop.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the unnecessary initialization of the `Cards` array:
   - The `Cards` array is declared as `int Cards[4][14] = {{}};`.
   - Since C automatically initializes all elements of an uninitialized global or static array to 0, we can remove the initialization.
   - The declaration can be changed to `int Cards[4][14];`.

2. Replace the 2D `Cards` array with a 1D array of booleans:
   - The `Cards` array is currently declared as `int Cards[4][14];`.
   - We can change it to `bool Cards[4 * 14];` to reduce the memory usage.
   - Note that we need to include the `<stdbool.h>` header for using the `bool` data type in C.

3. Simplify the check for missing cards by using `Cards[i][j-1] == 0`:
   - In the original code, the checks for missing cards are done using `Cards[i][j-1] != 1`.
   - Since we only care about missing cards, we can simplify the checks to `Cards[i][j-1] == 0`.

4. Optimize the loops for printing missing cards by using a single loop:
   - Instead of having four separate loops for each suit, we can use a single loop to iterate over the suits and card numbers.
   - Inside the loop, we can check and print the missing cards for each suit.

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

int main(void) {
  bool Cards[4 * 14]; // 1D array of booleans

  int i, j, n, Num;
  char Mark;

  scanf("%d", &n);

  for (i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
    scanf(" %c %d", &Mark, &Num);

    if (Mark == 'S') {
      Cards[0 * 14 + Num - 1] = true;
    } else if (Mark == 'H') {
      Cards[1 * 14 + Num - 1] = true;
    } else if (Mark == 'C') {
      Cards[2 * 14 + Num - 1] = true;
    } else if (Mark == 'D') {
      Cards[3 * 14 + Num - 1] = true;
    }
  }

  for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < 14; j++) {
      if (!Cards[i * 14 + j]) {
        if (i == 0) {
          printf("S ");
        } else if (i == 1) {
          printf("H ");
        } else if (i == 2) {
          printf("C ");
        } else if (i == 3) {
          printf("D ");
        }
        printf("%d\n", j + 1);
      }
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code makes the following changes:
1. Changes the declaration of `Cards` to `bool Cards[4 * 14];`.
2. Modifies the input `scanf` statement to include a space before `%c` to consume the newline character from the previous input.
3. Replaces the checks `Cards[i][j-1] != 1` with `!Cards[i * 14 + j]`.
4. Replaces the four separate loops for printing missing cards with a single loop that iterates over suits and card numbers.
