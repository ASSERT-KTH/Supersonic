The given code is a C++ program that takes an integer `Q` as input, followed by `Q` integers. For each integer, the program performs a series of calculations until it reaches a repeating number or a number less than 10, and then prints the number of calculations performed.

Upon analysis, I have identified several potential areas for optimization in the code:

1. Unnecessary Memory Allocation: The code allocates a boolean array `table` of size 1000001 using `new`. However, this array is only used within the scope of the loop and does not need to persist outside of it. Therefore, we can allocate the array within the loop to avoid unnecessary memory allocation.

2. Redundant Initialization: Inside the loop, the code initializes the `table` array with `false` values for each iteration. However, this initialization can be moved outside the loop and performed only once before the loop starts.

3. Inefficient Loop Condition: The loop condition `N/10 == 0` is used to check if `N` is less than 10. However, this condition can be simplified to `N < 10` for a more efficient check.

4. Inefficient Loop Iteration: The loop `for (S = 10; N / S != 0; S *= 10)` is used to iterate through the digits of `N`. However, this loop can be optimized by using the `log10` function to calculate the number of digits in `N` and using a variable to store the power of 10 instead of calculating it repeatedly.

5. Inefficient Maximum Calculation: The code calculates the maximum value `max` in each iteration by comparing it with the previous maximum value `tmp`. This can be optimized by using `max = std::max(max, tmp)`.

6. Unnecessary Boolean Comparison: Instead of checking `table[N] == true`, we can directly use `if (table[N])` to improve readability and efficiency.

To optimize the code, I will take the following steps:
