Code Analysis:
- The code uses unnecessary header files, such as `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<queue>`, `<stack>`, and `<vector>`.
- It uses the `namespace std` directive, which is generally considered bad practice.
- The code dynamically allocates memory for the `table` array using `new`, but it never deallocates it using `delete[]`.
- The code initializes the `table` array to `false` in each iteration of the outer loop, which is unnecessary. The initialization can be done outside the loop.
- The code uses a nested loop to calculate the maximum value, which can be optimized.
- The code uses a boolean flag `FLG` to check if a cycle is found, but it can be simplified.
- The code uses an unnecessary check `if (table[N] == true)` inside the loop.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary header files `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<queue>`, `<stack>`, and `<vector>`.
2. Avoid `using namespace std`: Remove the `using namespace std` directive and explicitly prefix standard library functions and types with `std::`.
3. Use a more efficient data structure: Instead of using a dynamically allocated boolean array, use a `std::vector<bool>` to store the table. This will reduce memory usage.
4. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: Move the memory allocation for the `table` array outside the loop to avoid unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation in each iteration.
5. Optimize the maximum value calculation: Instead of using a nested loop, calculate the maximum value using a single loop. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.
6. Simplify the cycle detection: Remove the boolean flag `FLG` and simplify the cycle detection logic.
7. Remove unnecessary check: Remove the unnecessary check `if (table[N] == true)` inside the loop.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the lines `#include <algorithm>`, `#include <cmath>`, `#include <queue>`, `#include <stack>`, and `#include <vector>`.
2. Avoid `using namespace std`: Remove the line `using namespace std` and replace all occurrences of standard library functions and types with `std::`.
3. Use a more efficient data structure: Replace the line `bool *table = new bool[1000001];` with `std::vector<bool> table(1000001)`.
4. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: Move the line `std::vector<bool> table(1000001);` outside the outer loop.
5. Optimize the maximum value calculation: Replace the nested loop with a single loop to calculate the maximum value. Replace the block of code starting from `max = 0;` and ending with `N = max;` with the following optimized code:
   ```
   max = 0;
   for (S = 10; N >= S; S *= 10) {
     tmp = (N / S) * (N % S);
     max = std::max(max, tmp);
   }
   N = max;
   ```
6. Simplify the cycle detection: Remove the line `FLG = false;` and simplify the cycle detection logic. Replace the block of code starting from `if (table[N] == true) {` and ending with `break;` with the following optimized code:
   ```
   if (table[N]) {
     N = -1;
     break;
   }
   table[N] = true;
   count++;
   ```
7. Remove unnecessary check: Remove the line `if (table[N] == true) {` inside the loop. Replace the block of code starting from `if (FLG) {` and ending with `}` with the following optimized code:
   ```
   if (N == -1) {
     printf("-1\n");
   } else {
     printf("%d\n", count);
   }
   ```

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int Q, N, count, tmp, max, S;
  scanf("%d", &Q);
  std::vector<bool> table(1000001);
  for (int loop = 0; loop < Q; loop++) {
    count = 0;
    scanf("%d", &N);
    table.assign(1000001, false);
    table[N] = true;
    while (N >= 10) {
      max = 0;
      for (S = 10; N >= S; S *= 10) {
        tmp = (N / S) * (N % S);
        max = std::max(max, tmp);
      }
      N = max;
      if (table[N]) {
        N = -1;
        break;
      }
      table[N] = true;
      count++;
    }
    if (N == -1) {
      printf("-1\n");
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", count);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:
- The optimized code is more efficient in terms of memory usage and computation time.
- The code complexity remains the same, but the optimized code improves performance by reducing unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation, and optimizing the maximum value calculation.
- The use of `std::vector<bool>` instead of a dynamically allocated boolean array may introduce a small overhead due to memory fragmentation, but the overall memory usage is reduced.
