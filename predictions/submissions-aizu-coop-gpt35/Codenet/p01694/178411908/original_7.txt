The given code seems to solve a problem related to counting certain pairs of strings. The code reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` pairs of strings. For each pair, it checks if the current string `now` is followed by a specific string `next`, and increments a counter `ans` if the condition is met. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of unnecessary header files. We should only include the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<string>`, to reduce compile time and memory usage.

2. Replace macros with inline functions: The macros `rep`, `REP`, `rer`, and `each` can be replaced with inline functions to improve code readability and avoid potential macro-related issues. 

3. Avoid unnecessary string comparison: Instead of comparing strings using multiple if-else conditions, we can use integer variables to represent the strings and compare them directly. This will avoid the overhead of string comparison and improve performance.

4. Use a more efficient data structure for storing the pairs of strings: The current code does not require storing the pairs of strings. We can directly compare the current string with the next string without storing them, which will reduce memory usage.

5. Optimize the input/output process: The current code uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output, which can be slow for large inputs. Instead, we can use `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output.

Taking these optimizations into account, the optimized code is as follows:
