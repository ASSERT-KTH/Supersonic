The provided code appears to be a program that reads a sequence of strings from the input and counts the number of occurrences where the current string and the next string form a specific pattern. The pattern being checked is whether the current string is one of four possible values ("lu", "ru", "ld", "rd") and the next string is the opposite value.

To optimize this code, we can start by addressing the following areas of improvement:

1. Avoid unnecessary string comparisons: The current code compares the current string and the next string using multiple if-else statements. Instead of comparing the strings, we can assign integer values to each string and compare the integers. This will reduce the overhead of string comparisons and improve performance.

2. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard include and can potentially slow down the compilation process. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers for the code to function properly.

3. Simplify loop definitions: The code uses macros to define loops, such as `rep`, `REP`, and `rer`. Instead, we can use standard for-loops to make the code easier to understand and potentially improve performance.

With these improvements in mind, let's optimize the code step by step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    int ans = 0;
    string now = "", next;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> next;
      int nowCode = 0, nextCode = 0;
      
      // Assign integer codes to strings
      if (now == "lu") nowCode = 1;
      else if (now == "ru") nowCode = 2;
      else if (now == "ld") nowCode = 3;
      else if (now == "rd") nowCode = 4;
      
      if (next == "lu") nextCode = 1;
      else if (next == "ru") nextCode = 2;
      else if (next == "ld") nextCode = 3;
      else if (next == "rd") nextCode = 4;
      
      // Check for pattern match using integer codes
      if ((nowCode == 1 && nextCode == 2) ||
          (nowCode == 2 && nextCode == 1) ||
          (nowCode == 3 && nextCode == 4) ||
          (nowCode == 4 && nextCode == 3)) {
        ans++;
      }
      
      now = next;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we have replaced the macros with standard for-loops, removed unnecessary includes, and replaced string comparisons with integer codes. These changes should improve both the performance and memory usage of the code.

The trade-off in this optimization is a slightly increased code complexity due to the added logic for assigning integer codes to strings and comparing the codes. However, the performance gain from avoiding string comparisons and using simple for-loops will likely outweigh the added complexity.
