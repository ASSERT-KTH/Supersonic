Code Analysis:
- The code imports a number of libraries, but only the `<iostream>` library is used for input/output operations.
- The code defines several macros and type aliases, but they are not used in the main program.
- The code uses a while loop to repeatedly read an integer `n` from the input until it is zero.
- Inside the while loop, the code initializes an integer `ans` to zero and a string `now` to an empty string.
- The code then enters a for loop that iterates `n` times. In each iteration, it reads a string `next` from the input.
- Inside the for loop, the code checks the values of `now` and `next` to determine if they form a pair of diagonal directions.
- If a pair of diagonal directions is found, the code increments `ans` by one.
- Finally, the code prints the value of `ans` and continues to the next iteration of the while loop.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header that includes all standard headers. This can lead to unnecessary code bloat and slower compilation times. Instead, only `<iostream>` is needed for input/output operations.

2. Remove unused macros and type aliases: The code defines several macros and type aliases that are not used in the main program. These can be safely removed.

3. Avoid string comparison: The code currently uses multiple string comparisons to determine if two strings form a pair of diagonal directions. String comparisons can be costly, especially if the strings are long. Instead, we can assign numeric values to each direction (e.g., "lu" -> 0, "ru" -> 1, "ld" -> 2, "rd" -> 3) and compare the numeric values directly.

4. Use a single loop: The code currently uses a while loop to repeatedly read `n` and a for loop to iterate `n` times. We can simplify the code by using a single for loop to iterate `n` times and read `next` directly.

5. Use an integer variable for direction comparison: Instead of using a string variable `now` to store the current direction, we can use an integer variable `now` to store the numeric value of the current direction. This will eliminate the need for string comparisons and improve performance.

6. Use a bitset for counting pairs: Instead of incrementing `ans` by one for each pair of diagonal directions, we can use a `std::bitset` to count the number of occurrences of each pair. This will eliminate the need for repeated additions and improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary headers:
   - Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`

2. Remove unused macros and type aliases:
   - Remove the lines `#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (int)n; ++i)`, `#define REP(i, a, b) for (int i = (int)a; i < (int)b; ++i)`, `#define rer(i, a, b) for (int i = (int)a; i <= (int)b; ++i)`, `#define each(i, c) for (__typeof((c).begin()) i = (c).begin(); i != (c).end(); ++i)`, `typedef long long ll`, `typedef unsigned long long ull`, `typedef vector<int> vi`, `typedef vector<string> vs`, `typedef vector<vector<int>> vvi`, `typedef vector<pair<int, int>> vpii`, `typedef pair<int, int> pii`, `typedef pair<long long, long long> pll`

3. Avoid string comparison:
   - Replace the if-else if chain with a switch statement to compare the numeric values of `now` and `next`.
   - Replace the string values "lu", "ru", "ld", and "rd" with the corresponding numeric values 0, 1, 2, and 3.

4. Use a single loop:
   - Replace the while loop with a for loop that iterates `n` times.
   - Remove the line `while (cin >> n, n) {` and replace it with `for (int t = 0; t < n; ++t) {`

5. Use an integer variable for direction comparison:
   - Replace the string variable `now` with an integer variable `now` and initialize it to -1.
   - Instead of assigning `now = next`, assign the numeric value of `next` to `now`.
   - Update the switch statement in step 3 to use integer values instead of string values.

6. Use a bitset for counting pairs:
   - Declare a `std::bitset` variable `pairs` with size 4 and initialize it to zero.
   - Inside the switch statement, use the numeric values of `now` and `next` to set the corresponding bits in `pairs`.
   - After the for loop, use the `count` function of `pairs` to count the number of set bits and assign the result to `ans`.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    int ans = 0;
    int now = -1;
    bitset<4> pairs;
    for (int t = 0; t < n; ++t) {
      string next;
      cin >> next;
      int nextValue;
      switch (next[0]) {
        case 'l':
          if (next[1] == 'u') {
            nextValue = 0;
          } else {
            nextValue = 2;
          }
          break;
        case 'r':
          if (next[1] == 'u') {
            nextValue = 1;
          } else {
            nextValue = 3;
          }
          break;
      }
      if (now != -1) {
        pairs.set(now * 4 + nextValue);
      }
      now = nextValue;
    }
    ans = pairs.count();
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:
- The optimized code reduces the number of string comparisons and uses an integer variable and a `std::bitset` for more efficient comparisons and counting.
- The code complexity is slightly increased due to the additional switch statement and bitset operations.
- The optimized code is expected to have improved running time and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
