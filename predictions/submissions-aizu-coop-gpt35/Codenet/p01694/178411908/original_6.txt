Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it can significantly increase compilation time. Instead, we should include only the necessary headers.

2. Macros: The code uses macros for loop iteration, which can lead to performance overhead due to multiple evaluations. It is better to replace these macros with simple for loops.

3. String comparison: The code uses multiple if-else statements to compare strings. This can be optimized by using a more efficient data structure or algorithm to avoid string comparison altogether.

4. Input/Output: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, respectively. These operations can be slow, especially when dealing with large input/output. Using a faster input/output method, such as `scanf` and `printf`, can improve performance.

5. Data Structures: The code uses a string variable to store the current and next strings. This can be optimized by using integer variables to represent the different states instead of strings.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Replace the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary standard library headers.

2. Replace macros with for loops: Replace the macros `rep`, `REP`, `rer`, and `each` with simple for loops.

3. Optimize string comparison: Instead of comparing strings, use integer variables to represent the different states and compare them directly.

4. Use faster input/output methods: Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output operations.

5. Simplify data structures: Replace the string variable `now` with an integer variable to represent the current state.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step by step in the code:
