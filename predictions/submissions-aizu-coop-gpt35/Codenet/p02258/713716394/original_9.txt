Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `n` from the user and then reads `n` integers into a vector `R`.
- It then iterates over the elements of `R` to find the maximum profit and the minimum value.
- The maximum profit is calculated as the difference between the current element and the minimum value.
- Finally, the maximum profit is printed.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary `using namespace std` directive, as it is considered bad practice.
2. Replace `vector<int>::iterator` with `auto` to simplify the code and improve readability.
3. Use `reserve` to allocate memory for the vector `R` upfront, avoiding reallocation during the `push_back` operations.
4. Initialize `maxProfit` with a more reasonable initial value, such as the minimum value of an `int`.
5. Use a range-based for loop instead of manually managing iterators.
6. Use `std::min` and `std::max` functions to simplify the logic and improve readability.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the `using namespace std` directive, as it is considered bad practice and can lead to naming conflicts.
2. Replace `vector<int>::iterator` with `auto` to simplify the code and improve readability. For example, replace:
   ```cpp
   vector<int>::iterator itr = R.begin();
   vector<int>::iterator itrE = R.end();
   ```
   with:
   ```cpp
   auto itr = R.begin();
   auto itrE = R.end();
   ```
3. Use `reserve` to allocate memory for the vector `R` upfront. Since we know the size of the vector (`n`), we can reserve memory to avoid reallocation during the `push_back` operations. Add the following line before the `for` loop:
   ```cpp
   R.reserve(n);
   ```
4. Initialize `maxProfit` with a more reasonable initial value, such as the minimum value of an `int` (`INT_MIN`). Change the line:
   ```cpp
   int maxProfit = 1 - 1000000000;
   ```
   to:
   ```cpp
   int maxProfit = INT_MIN;
   ```
5. Use a range-based for loop instead of manually managing iterators. Replace the first `for` loop with:
   ```cpp
   for (auto& r : R) {
     cin >> r;
   }
   ```
   Replace the second `for` loop with:
   ```cpp
   for (const auto& r : R) {
     maxProfit = max(maxProfit, r - Ri);
     Ri = min(Ri, r);
   }
   ```
6. Finally, add necessary includes for `limits` and `algorithm`:
   ```cpp
   #include <limits>
   #include <algorithm>
   ```

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int n;
  int maxProfit = std::numeric_limits<int>::min();
  int Ri = 2000000000;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> R;
  R.reserve(n);
  for (auto& r : R) {
    std::cin >> r;
  }
  for (const auto& r : R) {
    maxProfit = std::max(maxProfit, r - Ri);
    Ri = std::min(Ri, r);
  }
  std::cout << maxProfit << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code reduces unnecessary iterator handling, preallocates memory for the vector, uses more meaningful initial values, and simplifies the logic using standard library functions. These changes improve code readability and potentially reduce memory allocations and unnecessary computations.
