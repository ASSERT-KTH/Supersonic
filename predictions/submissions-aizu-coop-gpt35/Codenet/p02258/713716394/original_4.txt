Code Analysis:

1. The code reads an integer `n` from the user and then reads `n` integers into a vector `R`.
2. It calculates the maximum profit by finding the maximum difference between the current element of `R` and the minimum element encountered so far.
3. The maximum profit is printed as the output.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. The code uses iterators to iterate over the vector `R`. This can be inefficient compared to using indices for accessing elements.
2. The code has two separate loops for finding the maximum profit and the minimum element. These can be combined into a single loop, reducing the number of iterations.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the use of iterators with indices for accessing elements in the vector `R`.
2. Combine the two separate loops into a single loop to find the maximum profit and the minimum element simultaneously.
3. Use compiler optimization flags to enable additional optimizations during compilation.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the iterator declaration and initialization:
   - Replace `vector<int>::iterator itr = R.begin();` with `int i = 0;`.
   - Replace `vector<int>::iterator itrE = R.end();` with `int n = R.size();`.
   - This change eliminates the use of iterators and instead uses indices for accessing elements in the vector `R`.

2. Combine the two loops:
   - Replace the second loop with a single loop that finds the maximum profit and the minimum element simultaneously.
   - Initialize `maxProfit` and `Ri` to the first element of the vector `R`.
   - Iterate from the second element of the vector `R` to the last element.
   - Update `maxProfit` if the current element minus `Ri` is greater than `maxProfit`.
   - Update `Ri` if the current element is less than `Ri`.
   - This change reduces the number of iterations and eliminates the need for a second loop.

3. Enable compiler optimizations:
   - Add compiler-specific optimization flags or pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize the code further.
   - This step depends on the compiler being used and its available optimization options.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  int maxProfit = 1 - 1000000000;
  int Ri = 2000000000;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> R(n);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> R[i];
  }

  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (maxProfit < R[i] - Ri) {
      maxProfit = R[i] - Ri;
    }
    if (R[i] < Ri) {
      Ri = R[i];
    }
  }

  cout << maxProfit << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces the number of iterations and eliminates the use of iterators, improving the efficiency of the program. Compiler optimizations can be added as per the specific compiler being used.
