Code Analysis:
The given code reads an integer value `n` from the input, followed by `n` integer values representing an array `R`. The code then calculates the maximum difference between any two elements of `R` such that the larger element appears after the smaller element in the array.

The current implementation uses an array `R` to store the input values and two variables `maxv` and `minv` to keep track of the maximum difference and the current minimum value encountered in the array. The code then iterates over the array, updating `maxv` and `minv` accordingly.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The current implementation uses an array `R` of size `MAX` to store the input values. However, the maximum size of `R` is determined by the input value `n`. Therefore, we can optimize memory usage by dynamically allocating the array `R` with the appropriate size.

2. Optimize the loop: The current loop iterates over the array `R` to calculate the maximum difference and the minimum value. We can optimize this loop by combining the calculation of `maxv` and `minv` into a single loop iteration, reducing the number of iterations by half.

3. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The current code includes the `<algorithm>` header, which is not required for the given implementation. We can remove this unnecessary inclusion.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the static array `R[MAX]` with a dynamically allocated array `R` of size `n` to optimize memory usage.

2. Combine the calculation of `maxv` and `minv` into a single loop iteration. Instead of initializing `maxv` with `R[1] - R[0]`, initialize it with `R[1] - R[0]` if `R[1]` is greater than `R[0]`, otherwise initialize it with `0`. This eliminates the need for the separate initialization of `minv`.

3. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<algorithm>` header.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  int* R = new int[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> R[i];

  int maxv = (R[1] > R[0]) ? (R[1] - R[0]) : 0;
  
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (R[i] - R[i-1] > 0) {
      maxv = max(maxv, R[i] - R[i-1]);
    }
  }

  cout << maxv << endl;

  delete[] R;
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have replaced the static array `R[MAX]` with a dynamically allocated array `R` of size `n` to optimize memory usage. We have also combined the calculation of `maxv` and `minv` into a single loop iteration, reducing unnecessary iterations. Additionally, we have removed the unnecessary inclusion of the `<algorithm>` header.
