The given code is a simple program that reads an array of integers and finds the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. The code works correctly, but there are several areas where it can be optimized for efficiency.

1. Memory Usage:
   - The array `R` is declared with a fixed size of `MAX`, which is set to 200,000. However, the actual size of the array is determined by the user input value `n`. This can lead to unnecessary memory usage if `n` is smaller than `MAX`. It would be better to dynamically allocate memory for the array based on the value of `n`.
   - The array `R` is not required after calculating the maximum difference. We can avoid unnecessary memory usage by releasing the memory allocated for the array immediately after finding the maximum difference.

2. Unnecessary Computation:
   - The for loop that reads the input values can be optimized by using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` before reading the input. This disables the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, resulting in faster input/output operations.
   - The initial value of `maxv` is set to `R[1] - R[0]`, which assumes that `n` is at least 2. However, the code does not check for this condition. If `n` is 1, the behavior is undefined. To handle this case, we can initialize `maxv` to a minimum negative value and ensure that `n` is at least 2 before entering the loop.

3. Compiler Optimizations:
   - The code can benefit from compiler optimizations. We can enable compiler optimizations by using the `-O2` flag during compilation.

With these optimizations in mind, let's modify the code accordingly.
