Analysis:

1. The code uses a list to store the prime numbers. However, a vector would be more efficient since it allows for constant time access to elements and has better cache locality compared to a list.

2. The code uses a list to store the input numbers. Since the input numbers are not modified after being stored, a vector would be more efficient in terms of both memory usage and performance.

3. The code uses a nested loop to check if each input number is prime. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the maximum input number. This can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm to check if a number is prime.

4. The code uses a list to store the prime numbers. However, the sieve algorithm used to generate the prime numbers can be modified to directly store the prime numbers in a vector, eliminating the need to copy them to a list later.

5. The code uses a nested loop to find the count of prime numbers less than or equal to each input number. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the maximum input number. This can be optimized by using binary search or a more efficient algorithm to find the count.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the list with a vector to store the prime numbers.

2. Replace the list with a vector to store the input numbers.

3. Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate the prime numbers directly into the vector.

4. Use binary search to find the count of prime numbers less than or equal to each input number.

5. Use compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling and vectorization to improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the list with a vector to store the prime numbers:
   - Change the declaration of the `primes` variable in the `main` function from `list<int> primes;` to `vector<int> primes;`.

2. Replace the list with a vector to store the input numbers:
   - Change the declaration of the `inputs` variable in the `main` function from `vector<int> inputs;` to `vector<int> inputs;`.

3. Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate the prime numbers directly into the vector:
   - Replace the `sieve` function with an optimized version that generates the prime numbers directly into the `primes` vector.
   - Remove the line `primes.push_back(2);`.
   - Change the loop condition in the modified `sieve` function to `for (int i = 3, end = sqrt(n); i <= n; i += 2)`.
   - Inside the loop, add `primes.push_back(i);` after `v[j] = false;`.

4. Use binary search to find the count of prime numbers less than or equal to each input number:
   - Replace the inner loop in the `main` function with a binary search using the `lower_bound` function to find the position of `x` in the `primes` vector.
   - Replace the `count` variable with the difference between the position of `x` and the beginning of the `primes` vector, plus 1 if `x` is present in the `primes` vector.

5. Use compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling and vectorization to improve performance:
   - Add appropriate compiler optimizations or pragma directives to enable loop unrolling and vectorization, if supported by the compiler.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void sieve(int n, vector<int>& primes) {
  vector<bool> v(n + 1, true);
  for (int i = 3, end = sqrt(n); i <= n; i += 2) {
    if (!v[i])
      continue;
    primes.push_back(i);
    for (int j = i * i, skip = i * 2; j <= n; j += skip)
      v[j] = false;
  }
}

int main() {
  vector<int> primes;
  vector<int> inputs;
  for (int x; cin >> x;)
    inputs.push_back(x);
  sieve(*max_element(inputs.begin(), inputs.end()), primes);
  for (auto x : inputs) {
    int count = lower_bound(primes.begin(), primes.end(), x) - primes.begin();
    if (count < primes.size() && primes[count] == x)
      count++;
    cout << count << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code uses a vector instead of a list to store both the prime numbers and the input numbers. It also generates the prime numbers directly into the vector using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The count of prime numbers less than or equal to each input number is found using binary search.
