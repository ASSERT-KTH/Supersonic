The provided code calculates the number of prime numbers less than or equal to each input number. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a list of prime numbers up to a given limit, and then counts the number of primes less than or equal to each input number by iterating through the list of primes.

While the code seems to be correct and produces the desired output, there are several areas where it can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Inefficient data structure: The current code uses a `list` to store the prime numbers and a `vector` of booleans to mark the non-prime numbers. However, a `vector` is more memory-efficient than a `list` and provides better cache locality for faster access.

2. Redundant computation: The code checks for divisibility of numbers by all the primes in the list, even after finding a prime greater than the input number. This is unnecessary as we can stop checking further primes once we find a prime greater than the input number.

3. Loop optimization: The inner loop in the `sieve` function can be optimized by starting from `i * i` instead of `i * 2`. Additionally, we can increment `j` by `i` instead of `skip` to improve efficiency.

4. Compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, or vectorization can be enabled to let the compiler optimize the code further.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step optimization process.
