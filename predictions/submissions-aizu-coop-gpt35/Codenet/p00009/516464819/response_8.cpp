The provided code calculates the number of prime numbers less than or equal to each input number. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a list of prime numbers up to a given limit, and then iterates through the input numbers to count the primes.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Inefficient Data Structure:
   - The use of `list<int>` for storing prime numbers is inefficient. Since the size of the list is known in advance, using a `vector<int>` would be more efficient in terms of memory and iteration performance.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The code checks if a number is prime by iterating through the entire list of primes. However, since the list is in ascending order, the moment a prime number exceeds the given input number, there is no need to continue the iteration. This check can be optimized to break the loop early.

3. Compiler Optimization Hints:
   - The code can benefit from compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling and auto-vectorization to improve performance. By providing appropriate compiler optimization flags or pragma directives, these optimizations can be enabled.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be proposed:

1. Change the data structure from `list<int>` to `vector<int>` for storing prime numbers.
2. Optimize the prime number generation loop to break early when a prime exceeds the given input number.
3. Add appropriate compiler optimization hints to enable loop unrolling and auto-vectorization.
