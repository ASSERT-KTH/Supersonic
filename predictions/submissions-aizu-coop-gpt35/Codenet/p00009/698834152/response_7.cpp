The given code calculates the number of prime numbers up to a given number `n`. It uses an array `not_prime_flag` to mark non-prime numbers and an array `num_prime` to store the number of prime numbers up to each index.

Upon analysis, the following potential optimizations can be made:

1. Efficient Data Structures:
   - The array `not_prime_flag` is of size `MAX + 1`, which is unnecessary. It can be reduced to `n + 1`, where `n` is the maximum number up to which we want to calculate prime numbers.
   - The array `num_prime` can also be reduced to `n + 1` since we only need to calculate the number of primes up to `n`.
   - Instead of using an array to store the number of prime numbers, a single integer variable can be used to keep track of the count. This will reduce memory usage.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The loop `for (int j = 2; i * j < MAX + 1; ++j)` in the inner loop can be optimized to start from `i` instead of `2` since all the multiples of `i` up to `i * i` have already been marked as non-prime. This will reduce unnecessary iterations.
   - The `!not_prime_flag[i]` calculation in the line `num_prime[i] = num_prime[i - 1] + !not_prime_flag[i];` can be simplified to `1 - not_prime_flag[i]` since `not_prime_flag[i]` will be either `true` or `false`.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The outer loop for calculating prime numbers can be optimized to start from `2` instead of `1` since `num_prime[1]` will always be `0`.
   - The inner loop for marking multiples of `i` as non-prime can be optimized by incrementing `j` by `i` in each iteration instead of `1`. This will effectively unroll the loop.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations to allow the compiler to apply its own set of optimizations. This can be done by using compiler-specific pragmas or command-line options.
