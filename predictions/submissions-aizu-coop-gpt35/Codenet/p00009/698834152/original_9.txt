Code Analysis:
The given code calculates the number of prime numbers up to a given limit. It uses the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to identify prime numbers. The program initializes an array `not_prime_flag` to mark non-prime numbers, and another array `num_prime` to store the cumulative count of prime numbers.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoiding redundant computations: The code currently checks every number from 2 to `MAX` to determine if it is a prime number. This includes numbers that have already been marked as non-prime. We can optimize this by only checking numbers that have not been marked as non-prime.

2. Efficient data structure: The current implementation uses an array `not_prime_flag` to mark non-prime numbers. However, we can save memory by using a bitset instead, as each number only needs one bit to represent its primality.

3. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations and pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the `not_prime_flag` array with a `bitset` data structure to save memory.
2. Modify the loop in the main function to only check numbers that have not been marked as non-prime.
3. Add compiler optimizations and pragmas to enhance performance.
4. Provide a step-by-step explanation of each optimization.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `not_prime_flag` array with a `bitset` data structure:
   - Instead of using an array of `bool` to mark non-prime numbers, we can use a `bitset` to store a single bit for each number.
   - This change reduces the memory usage significantly, as each bit in the `bitset` represents primality for a single number.
   - The `bitset` can be initialized with all bits set to 0, indicating that all numbers are prime by default.

2. Modify the loop in the main function:
   - Instead of iterating over all numbers from 2 to `MAX`, we can iterate only over numbers that have not been marked as non-prime.
   - This optimization reduces the number of iterations and thus improves the running time of the program.

3. Add compiler optimizations and pragmas:
   - We can add compiler optimizations and pragmas to help the compiler optimize the code further.
   - For example, we can enable compiler optimizations like loop unrolling, inline functions, and auto-vectorization.
   - We can also use pragmas to provide hints to the compiler, such as loop-level optimizations and vectorization directives.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#define MAX 999999
using namespace std;

bitset<MAX + 1> not_prime_flag;
int num_prime[MAX + 1];

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  for (int i = 2; i * i <= MAX; ++i) {
    if (!not_prime_flag[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= MAX; j += i) {
        not_prime_flag[j] = true;
      }
    }
  }

  num_prime[0] = num_prime[1] = 0;
  for (int i = 2; i <= MAX; ++i) {
    num_prime[i] = num_prime[i - 1] + !not_prime_flag[i];
  }

  int n;
  while (cin >> n) {
    cout << num_prime[n] << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code:
- The `not_prime_flag` array is replaced with a `bitset` called `not_prime_flag` to save memory.
- The loop in the main function is modified to only iterate over numbers that have not been marked as non-prime.
- Compiler optimizations and pragmas are not explicitly included in the code, but they can be added based on the specific compiler and optimization flags used.
