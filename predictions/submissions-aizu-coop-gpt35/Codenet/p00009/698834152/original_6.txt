The provided code is a program that calculates the number of prime numbers up to a given input `n`. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently calculate all prime numbers up to `MAX`.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Memory Usage: The code uses two arrays, `num_prime` and `not_prime_flag`, both with a size of `MAX+1`. This results in a large amount of memory being allocated, even if the input value `n` is relatively small. It would be more efficient to dynamically allocate memory based on the input value `n`.

2. Loop Optimization: The nested loops in the code can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations. For example, the inner loop can start from `i` instead of `2`, since all numbers before `i` have already been marked as not prime. Additionally, the inner loop can increment by `i` instead of `1`, as all multiples of `i` have already been marked as not prime.

3. Compiler Optimizations: The code can benefit from compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling, to reduce loop overhead.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Use dynamic memory allocation to allocate memory for the `num_prime` and `not_prime_flag` arrays based on the input value `n`.

2. Optimize the nested loops to reduce the number of iterations and improve cache locality.

3. Use compiler optimization flags, such as loop unrolling, to improve performance.

Let's now optimize the code step by step.
