Code Analysis:
The given code calculates the number of prime numbers up to a given number `n`. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark composite numbers as not prime and counts the number of primes encountered so far.

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:
1. The `not_prime_flag` array of size `MAX + 1` is used to mark composite numbers. However, the array is of type `bool`, which consumes 1 byte of memory for each element. Since the array can have up to `MAX + 1` elements, it requires a significant amount of memory. We can optimize this by using a bitset or a boolean array with each element representing multiple numbers.
2. The `num_prime` array of size `MAX + 1` is used to store the count of prime numbers encountered so far. However, only the count of prime numbers up to `n` is required. We can optimize this by calculating the count on the fly instead of storing it in an array.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the `not_prime_flag` array with a bitset or a boolean array with each element representing multiple numbers. This reduces memory consumption.
2. Calculate the count of prime numbers on the fly instead of storing it in the `num_prime` array. This eliminates the need for the `num_prime` array and reduces memory consumption.
3. Use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and pragma directives, to hint the compiler to optimize the code further.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `not_prime_flag` array with a bitset or a boolean array with each element representing multiple numbers:
   - Bitset optimization: A bitset uses 1 bit per element, so it reduces memory consumption compared to a boolean array. We can use the C++ `std::bitset` class to represent the `not_prime_flag` array. The size of the bitset should be `MAX + 1` bits.
   - Boolean array optimization: If using a bitset is not possible, we can use a boolean array with each element representing multiple numbers. For example, if each element represents 8 numbers, the array size should be `(MAX + 1) / 8 + 1`. When marking a number as not prime, we can update the corresponding element of the boolean array and the bit corresponding to the number within that element.

2. Calculate the count of prime numbers on the fly instead of storing it in the `num_prime` array:
   - Remove the `num_prime` array declaration and initialization.
   - While printing the count of prime numbers up to `n`, iterate from `i = 2` to `n` and count the number of prime numbers encountered using the `not_prime_flag` array/bitset.

3. Use compiler optimizations and pragma directives:
   - Add compiler optimizations flags, such as `-O3`, to enable aggressive optimizations during compilation.
   - Use the `#pragma` directive to provide hints to the compiler for further optimizations. For example, `#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")` hints the compiler to unroll loops, which can improve performance.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#define MAX 999999
using namespace std;

bitset<MAX + 1> not_prime_flag;

int main() {
  int n;

  // Calculate the count of prime numbers on the fly
  int prime_count = 0;
  for (int i = 2; i < MAX + 1; ++i) {
    if (!not_prime_flag[i]) {
      for (int j = 2; i * j < MAX + 1; ++j) {
        not_prime_flag[i * j] = true;
      }
      prime_count++;
    }
  }

  // Enable compiler optimizations
  #pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")

  while (cin >> n) {
    // Print the count of prime numbers up to n
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
      if (!not_prime_flag[i]) {
        count++;
      }
    }
    cout << count << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces memory consumption by using a bitset or a boolean array to represent the `not_prime_flag` array. It also eliminates the need for the `num_prime` array and calculates the count of prime numbers on the fly. Compiler optimizations and pragma directives are added to hint the compiler for further optimizations.
