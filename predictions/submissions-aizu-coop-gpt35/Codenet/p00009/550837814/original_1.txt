Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The array `num` is unnecessarily large. We only need to check prime numbers up to the square root of 1,000,000, so we can reduce the size of `num` to `sqrt(1000000)`.
2. The loop that initializes `num` can be optimized by using `memset` instead of a for loop.
3. The loop that checks for prime numbers can be optimized by using the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm instead of checking divisibility.
4. The loop that calculates the cumulative sum of prime numbers can be optimized by removing the need for an additional loop.

Now, let's go step by step and optimize the code:

1. We will reduce the size of the `num` array to `sqrt(1000000)`:

```c
int num[(int)sqrt(1000000)];
```

2. We will optimize the loop that initializes `num` by using the `memset` function:

```c
memset(num, 1, sizeof(num));
```

3. We will optimize the loop that checks for prime numbers by using the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. This algorithm marks all non-prime numbers as `0` and only checks numbers up to the square root of the maximum limit:

```c
for (i = 2; i * i < sqrt(1000000); i++) {
  if (num[i] == 1) {
    for (j = i * i; j < sqrt(1000000); j += i)
      num[j] = 0;
  }
}
```

4. We will optimize the loop that calculates the cumulative sum of prime numbers by removing the need for an additional loop. We will change the loop to start from `2` and calculate the cumulative sum directly:

```c
for (i = 2; i < sizeof(num) / sizeof(num[0]); i++) {
  num[i] += num[i - 1];
}
```

5. Finally, we will add comments to explain the optimizations made:

```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  int i, j;
  int n;
  int num[(int)sqrt(1000000)];

  // Initialize `num` array using `memset`
  memset(num, 1, sizeof(num));

  // Use the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers
  for (i = 2; i * i < sqrt(1000000); i++) {
    if (num[i] == 1) {
      for (j = i * i; j < sqrt(1000000); j += i)
        num[j] = 0;
    }
  }

  // Calculate cumulative sum of prime numbers
  for (i = 2; i < sizeof(num) / sizeof(num[0]); i++) {
    num[i] += num[i - 1];
  }

  // Read input and print cumulative sum of prime numbers
  for (; scanf("%d", &n) != EOF;) {
    printf("%d\n", num[n]);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

By implementing these optimizations, we have reduced the size of the `num` array, used a more efficient initialization method, and optimized the loops for finding prime numbers and calculating the cumulative sum. These changes should result in improved performance and reduced memory usage.
