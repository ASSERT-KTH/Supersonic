The given code performs the task of counting the number of prime numbers less than or equal to a given number. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized:

1. Inefficient Data Structure: The current code uses an array of size 1,000,000 to store the prime number flags. This consumes a significant amount of memory. Instead, we can use a bitset to store the flags, which requires much less memory.

2. Redundant Computations: The code computes the square root of 1,000,000 multiple times in the loop condition. This computation can be moved outside the loop and stored in a variable.

3. Unnecessary Loop Iterations: The loop that sums up the prime numbers can be optimized to start from index 2 instead of 1, as num[1] is always zero.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling and enabling vectorization to improve performance. We can also use the `__builtin_expect` function to provide branch prediction hints to the compiler.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step:

```cpp
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <bitset>

constexpr int MAX_NUM = 1000000;

int main() {
  int i, j;
  int n;
  std::bitset<MAX_NUM> prime_flags;
  
  // Mark all numbers as prime initially
  prime_flags.set();
  
  // Mark 0 and 1 as non-prime
  prime_flags[0] = prime_flags[1] = 0;
  
  int sqrt_limit = sqrt(MAX_NUM);
  for (i = 2; i <= sqrt_limit; i++) {
    if (prime_flags[i] == 1) {
      for (j = i * i; j < MAX_NUM; j += i)
        prime_flags[j] = 0;
    }
  }
  
  // Sum up the prime flags
  for (i = 2; i < MAX_NUM; i++) {
    prime_flags[i] += prime_flags[i - 1];
  }
  
  for (; scanf("%d", &n) != EOF;) {
    printf("%d\n", prime_flags[n]);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Data Structure Optimization:
   - Replaced the integer array `num` with a `std::bitset` called `prime_flags`.
   - `std::bitset` uses a single bit to represent each number, resulting in a significant reduction in memory usage.
   - The `set()` function is used to initialize all bits to 1 (prime) initially.

2. Redundant Computations Optimization:
   - Moved the computation of `sqrt(1000000)` outside the loop and stored it in the variable `sqrt_limit`.
   - This avoids computing the square root multiple times in the loop condition.

3. Unnecessary Loop Iterations Optimization:
   - Changed the starting index of the summing loop from 1 to 2, as `num[1]` is always zero.
   - This avoids an unnecessary addition operation.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - No specific compiler optimizations or pragma directives are suggested in this case. However, you can experiment with compiler optimizations, loop unrolling, or vectorization flags to further improve performance.

Trade-offs:
- The optimized code trades memory usage for performance by using a `std::bitset` instead of an integer array.
- The use of `std::bitset` may introduce some additional complexity and require changes to the code that interacts with it. However, the overall readability and maintainability of the code should not be significantly impacted.

By implementing these optimizations, the code should run more efficiently and use less memory, while still producing the same output as the original code.
