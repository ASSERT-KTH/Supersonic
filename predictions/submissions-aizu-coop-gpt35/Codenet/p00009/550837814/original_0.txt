The given code is a program that uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers up to a given limit. It then calculates the cumulative sum of the prime numbers and outputs the sum for a given input.

Upon analyzing the code, there are a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The `num` array has a fixed size of 1000000, but the actual number of elements needed is much smaller. We can optimize memory usage by dynamically allocating memory for the `num` array based on the input limit `n`.

2. The outer loop in the sieve algorithm iterates up to the square root of the limit. However, since the `num` array is dynamically allocated, we can replace the loop condition with `i * i <= n` instead of `i < sqrt(n)` for improved efficiency.

3. The cumulative sum calculation can be optimized by using a prefix sum approach. Instead of iterating over the entire array to calculate the sum at each index, we can calculate the sum incrementally as we iterate through the array.

4. We can add compiler optimizations like loop unrolling and pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize the code further.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization steps.
