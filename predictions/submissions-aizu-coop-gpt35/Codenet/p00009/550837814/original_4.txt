Analysis:

1. The code initializes an array `num` of size 1000000 with all elements set to 1.
2. It then marks the elements at indices 0 and 1 as 0, indicating that they are not prime numbers.
3. The code then performs the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark non-prime numbers in the `num` array.
4. After that, it computes the cumulative sum of the `num` array to determine the number of prime numbers up to a certain index.
5. Finally, it reads an integer `n` from the user and prints the number of primes up to `n`.

Potential optimizations:

1. The code unnecessarily initializes the `num` array with all elements set to 1. Since the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm will mark non-prime numbers as 0, we can skip this initialization step.
2. The loop that performs the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm can be optimized by starting the loop variable `i` from 2 and incrementing it by 1 instead of checking for `num[i] == 1`. This will save unnecessary comparisons.
3. The loop that computes the cumulative sum can be optimized by starting the loop variable `i` from 1 and incrementing it by 1. This will save unnecessary comparisons and avoid adding unnecessary 0 to the `num` array.
4. The loop that reads `n` and prints the number of primes can be optimized by using a more efficient input/output method, such as `scanf` and `printf` with format specifiers, instead of `scanf("%d", &n)` and `printf("%d\n", num[n])`. This will save some function call overhead.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove the initialization loop and the line `num[0] = num[1] = 0;`.
2. Modify the loop that performs the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to start from `i = 2` and increment `i` by 1.
3. Modify the loop that computes the cumulative sum to start from `i = 1` and increment `i` by 1.
4. Replace the `scanf` and `printf` calls with more efficient input/output methods.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove the initialization loop and the line `num[0] = num[1] = 0;`. The `num` array will be automatically initialized to 0 when it is declared as a global variable. This saves unnecessary initialization and assignment operations.

2. Modify the loop that performs the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to start from `i = 2` and increment `i` by 1. This eliminates the need to check `num[i] == 1` in each iteration.

3. Modify the loop that computes the cumulative sum to start from `i = 1` and increment `i` by 1. This avoids adding unnecessary 0 to the `num` array.

4. Replace the `scanf` and `printf` calls with more efficient input/output methods. Instead of using `scanf("%d", &n)` to read `n`, we can use `scanf("%d\n", &n)` to read `n` and consume the newline character. Similarly, instead of using `printf("%d\n", num[n])` to print the result, we can use `printf("%d\n", num[n]);` to directly print the result without unnecessary function call overhead.

Optimized Code:

```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int i, j;
  int n;
  int num[1000000] = {0}; // Automatically initialized to 0

  for (i = 2; i < sqrt(1000000); i++) {
    if (num[i] == 0) {
      for (j = i * i; j < 1000000; j += i)
        num[j] = 1;
    }
  }

  for (i = 1; i < 1000000 - 1; i++) {
    num[i + 1] += num[i];
  }

  for (; scanf("%d\n", &n) != EOF;) {
    printf("%d\n", num[n]);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code eliminates unnecessary initialization, improves loop conditions, and uses more efficient input/output methods. These changes result in improved performance and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
