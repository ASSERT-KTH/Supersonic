The given code is a C program that reads an input string `s` and performs a series of operations on it based on the input queries `q`. The goal is to optimize the code for efficiency, focusing on reducing running time and minimizing memory usage.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas of optimization can be identified:

1. Use of `long long` data type: The program uses `long long` data type for various variables and arrays (`a`, `M`, `d`, `k`, `R`, `C`, `H`, `N`, `h`). However, it is not necessary to use `long long` for these variables unless there is a requirement for very large numbers. Switching to a smaller data type like `int` or `unsigned int` can save memory.

2. Redundant calculations in `hyouka` function: The `hyouka` function compares two values `N[H[a]]` and `N[H[b]]` along with `h[H[a]]` and `h[H[b]]` to return a result. However, the same values are calculated multiple times in the comparison. We can optimize this by calculating the values only once and storing them in variables.

3. Inefficient memory allocation in `hin` function: The `hin` function expands the `H` array by incrementing `C` and copying elements. This approach has a time complexity of O(log N) for each insertion. We can use a more efficient data structure like a binary heap or priority queue to achieve a time complexity of O(log N) for both insertion and deletion.

4. Redundant calculations in `init` function: The `init` function calculates the values of `d[i][j + 1]` and `k[i][j + 1]` based on the values of `d[i][j]` and `k[i][j]`. This can be optimized by calculating the values incrementally without storing the intermediate values.

5. Inefficient calculation of `getlr` function: The `getlr` function performs the calculation `(M[i] * M[i] + d[i][r] - d[i][l] * k[i][r - l]) % M[i]` for `i` in the range [0, 1]. However, the calculation can be simplified by first calculating `(d[i][r] - d[i][l] * k[i][r - l]) % M[i]` and then adding `M[i]` to ensure the result is positive.

6. Inefficient calculation of `match` function: The `match` function multiplies the results of `getlr` for both `i = 0` and `i = 1` and checks if the result is non-zero. This can be optimized by using a single variable to store the multiplication result and checking if it is non-zero.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace `long long` data type with `int` or `unsigned int` where possible.
2. Calculate the values of `N[H[a]]`, `N[H[b]]`, `h[H[a]]`, and `h[H[b]]` only once in the `hyouka` function.
3. Replace the `H` array with a binary heap or priority queue in the `hin` function.
4. Calculate the values of `d[i][j + 1]` and `k[i][j + 1]` incrementally in the `init` function.
5. Simplify the calculation in the `getlr` function.
6. Optimize the `match` function by using a single variable for multiplication result.
