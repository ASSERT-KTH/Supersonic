After analyzing the provided code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary memory usage: The arrays `d`, `k`, `H`, and `N` are allocated with a fixed size of 300010 and 2000010 respectively. However, the actual size required may be smaller than the allocated size, resulting in unnecessary memory usage.

2. Inefficient data structures: The code uses an array-based heap structure to implement a priority queue. However, this implementation can be improved by using a more efficient data structure such as a binary heap or a Fibonacci heap.

3. Redundant computations: The function `getlr` computes the value `(M[i] * M[i] + d[i][r] - d[i][l] * k[i][r - l]) % M[i]` repeatedly in the `match` function. This computation can be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations.

4. Inefficient string handling: The function `gets` converts a character string to an integer value by multiplying each character by a power of the base `a[i]`. This can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm for string to integer conversion, such as the Horner's method.

5. Suboptimal loop structure: The loop in the `main` function iterates over the characters of the string `s` to initialize the arrays `d` and `k`. This loop can be optimized by using a more efficient loop structure, such as a loop with a precomputed length instead of checking for the null character at each iteration.
