The given code is a C program that performs string matching on a given string. It uses two different hash functions to calculate the hash values of substrings of the input string and compares them to a set of precomputed hash values. The program reads an integer `m` and a string `s` from the input, and then reads `m` queries. Each query is a string `q` which represents a left or right movement in the string. The program calculates the hash value of the substring defined by the left and right indices and checks if it matches any of the precomputed hash values. Finally, it prints the number of matches found.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. The code uses two 2D arrays `d` and `k` to store precomputed values for each hash function. These arrays have fixed sizes of `2` and `300010`, which is wasteful if the input string is shorter than that. We can optimize this by dynamically allocating memory for these arrays based on the length of the input string.

2. The code uses a custom priority queue implemented as a binary heap to store the precomputed hash values. However, the implementation is not efficient, as it uses an array of integers to represent the heap and performs linear search operations to insert and remove elements. This can be optimized by using a more efficient priority queue implementation, such as a binary heap or a Fibonacci heap.

3. The `getlr` function calculates the hash value of a substring using the precomputed values. However, it performs unnecessary calculations by multiplying and subtracting the hash values. We can optimize this by using a more efficient formula for calculating the hash value.

4. The `match` function checks if two hash values are equal. However, it uses a loop to iterate over both hash values and performs unnecessary calculations inside the loop. We can optimize this by using a more efficient comparison method.

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following optimization strategy:

1. Optimize memory usage by dynamically allocating memory for the `d` and `k` arrays based on the length of the input string.

2. Replace the custom priority queue implementation with a more efficient priority queue data structure, such as a binary heap or a Fibonacci heap.

3. Optimize the `getlr` function by using a more efficient formula for calculating the hash value.

4. Optimize the `match` function by using a more efficient comparison method.
