The given code appears to be a program that processes a sequence of queries on a string. The main part of the code involves calculating hash values for substrings of the string and performing comparisons on these hash values to determine matches.

Upon initial analysis, a few potential areas for optimization are identified:

1. Inefficient data structures: The program uses arrays `d` and `k` to store hash values and powers of `a` respectively. However, these arrays are declared with fixed sizes based on the maximum possible length of the string. This can lead to unnecessary memory usage for shorter strings.

2. Redundant computations: The code calculates the hash values for all possible substrings in the `init` function. However, for each query, only a subset of the substrings is used. This can result in redundant calculations and wasted computation time.

3. Inefficient hash value calculation: The code uses a loop to calculate the hash values for each substring. This can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the rolling hash algorithm, which allows for constant-time updates to hash values.

4. Inefficient comparison: The code uses multiple comparisons to determine if two hash values match. This can be optimized by using a bitwise comparison instead of multiple individual comparisons.

5. Use of global variables: The code uses multiple global variables, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain. Consider encapsulating these variables in a struct or class to improve code organization.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the fixed-size arrays `d` and `k` with dynamically allocated memory based on the actual length of the string.

2. Modify the `init` function to calculate hash values only for the substrings that are required for each query.

3. Replace the current hash value calculation method with a more efficient algorithm, such as the rolling hash algorithm.

4. Optimize the comparison step to use a bitwise comparison instead of multiple individual comparisons.

5. Encapsulate the global variables in a struct or class for better code organization.
