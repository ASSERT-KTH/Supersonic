The given code is a simple program that takes input from the user and performs some calculations based on that input. The program follows these steps:

1. Initialize variables `h`, `s`, `n`, `k`, and `t` to 0.
2. Enter an infinite loop.
3. Reset the flag variable `flg` to 0.
4. Read an integer `n` from the user.
5. If `n` is equal to 0, break out of the loop.
6. Set `s` to the value of `n`.
7. Enter a loop that iterates `n` times.
8. Read an integer `k` from the user.
9. If `k` is equal to 0, decrement `s` by 1.
10. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, set `flg` to 1.
11. If `flg` is equal to 1, print the value of `s + 1`, otherwise print "NA".
12. Set `t` to 0.
