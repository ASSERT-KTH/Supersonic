The given code is a C program that takes input from the user and performs some calculations based on the input. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance:

1. Redundant variables: The variables `t` and `flg` are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Unnecessary subtraction: Instead of subtracting 1 from `s` whenever `k` is 0, we can initialize `s` as `n` and decrement it only when `k` is 0. This eliminates the need for the subtraction operation inside the loop.

3. Unnecessary loop: The loop that checks if any value of `k` is greater than or equal to 2 can be replaced with a single conditional statement. We can keep a flag variable to track if such a value is encountered.

4. Avoiding multiple `printf` calls: Instead of printing the result inside the loop, we can store the result in a variable and print it after the loop ends. This reduces the number of `printf` calls.

Taking these optimizations into account, the optimized code is as follows:
