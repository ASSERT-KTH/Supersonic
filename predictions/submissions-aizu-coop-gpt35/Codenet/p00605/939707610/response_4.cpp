The provided code appears to be a program that reads input from the user and checks if a given condition is satisfied. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance and memory usage. 

1. Efficient Data Structures: The code currently uses a dynamic array `S` to store the values read from input. However, the use of dynamic memory allocation (`new` and `delete`) can be avoided by using a fixed-size array, as the size of `S` is known at compile-time.

2. Redundant Computations: The code performs unnecessary computations by subtracting each input value from the corresponding element of `S` and then checking if it becomes negative. This can be optimized by combining the subtraction and comparison steps into a single operation.

3. Loop Optimization: The nested loops can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and improve cache locality. This can be achieved by reversing the order of the loops, iterating over `S` first and then iterating over the input values.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and vectorization, can be applied to further improve the performance of the code. Additionally, using appropriate compiler pragmas or directives can hint the compiler to optimize specific parts of the code.
