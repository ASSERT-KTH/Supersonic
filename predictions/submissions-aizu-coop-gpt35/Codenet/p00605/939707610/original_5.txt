The given code is a C++ program that reads input values for `N` and `K` and then reads `K` integers into an array `S`. It then loops `N` times, reading `K` integers into `B` and subtracts each `B` from the corresponding element in `S`. Finally, it checks if any element in `S` is negative and outputs "Yes" if all elements are non-negative, and "No" otherwise.

To optimize this code for efficiency, we can make the following improvements:

1. Eliminate unnecessary variables: The variable `a` is used to track if all elements in `S` are non-negative. However, it is not needed since we can directly output the result based on the value of `S[j]`. We can remove the variable `a` and modify the output statement accordingly.

2. Use `std::vector` instead of dynamic arrays: Instead of using a dynamic array `S` with `new` and `delete`, we can use the `std::vector` container from the C++ Standard Library. `std::vector` provides automatic memory management and is generally more efficient and safe to use compared to manual memory allocation.

3. Optimize variable declarations: The variable `i` and `j` are declared outside the loops, which unnecessarily increases their scope. We can move the declaration of `i` inside the outer loop and the declaration of `j` inside the inner loop.

4. Use prefix increment/decrement operators: Instead of using the postfix increment/decrement operators (`++i` and `i--`), we can use the more efficient prefix increment/decrement operators (`++i` and `--i`) in the loops.

5. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` with synchronization: By default, `std::cin` and `std::cout` are synchronized with the C standard library I/O functions, which can cause a significant overhead. We can disable this synchronization by adding the following line at the beginning of the `main()` function:
   ```cpp
   ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
   ```

6. Disable dynamic memory allocation/deallocation: If the size of `S` is known at compile-time, we can use a fixed-size array instead of dynamically allocating memory with `new` and `delete`. This can reduce the overhead of dynamic memory allocation/deallocation.

7. Use range-based `for` loop: Instead of using a traditional `for` loop with an index variable, we can use a range-based `for` loop to iterate over the elements of `S`. This can simplify the code and potentially improve performance.

Taking these optimizations into account, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

  int N, K;
  while (cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    vector<int> S(K);
    for (int& s : S)
      cin >> s;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      for (int& s : S) {
        int B;
        cin >> B;
        s -= B;
        if (s < 0) {
          cout << "No\n";
          goto next_case;
        }
      }
    }

    cout << "Yes\n";

  next_case:
    continue;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Eliminate unnecessary variables: The variable `a` is not needed since we can directly output the result based on the value of `S[j]`. This eliminates the need for an additional variable and simplifies the code.

2. Use `std::vector` instead of dynamic arrays: By using `std::vector`, we can eliminate the manual memory allocation and deallocation with `new` and `delete`. `std::vector` provides automatic memory management and is generally more efficient and safe to use.

3. Optimize variable declarations: The variables `i` and `j` are now declared inside the loops where they are used. This reduces their scope and makes the code more readable.

4. Use prefix increment/decrement operators: Using the prefix increment/decrement operators (`++i` and `--i`) instead of the postfix operators (`i++` and `i--`) can be more efficient as it avoids creating temporary copies of the variables.

5. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` with synchronization: Disabling the synchronization between `std::cin` and `std::cout` with the C standard library I/O functions can improve performance, especially when reading large inputs.

6. Disable dynamic memory allocation/deallocation: If the size of `S` is known at compile-time, we can use a fixed-size array instead of dynamically allocating memory with `new` and `delete`. This can reduce the overhead of dynamic memory allocation/deallocation.

7. Use range-based `for` loop: The range-based `for` loop simplifies the code by automatically iterating over the elements of `S`. This eliminates the need for an index variable and makes the code more concise.
