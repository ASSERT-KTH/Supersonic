The given code is a program that reads input values for `N` and `K`, followed by an array `S` of size `K`. It then reads `N` sets of `K` integers and subtracts them from the corresponding elements in the array `S`. Finally, it checks if all elements in array `S` are non-negative and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Memory Usage:
   - The code currently uses a dynamic array `S` of size `K`. We can replace this with a static array to avoid the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. Since `K` is a constant value, we can declare `S` as `int S[K]` instead of using `new int[K]`.
   - Furthermore, the use of a pointer (`int *S`) can be avoided by directly using the array `S`.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The code uses a nested loop to iterate over `N` sets of `K` integers. However, it unnecessarily subtracts the same values from array `S` multiple times. We can optimize this by calculating the cumulative sum of each set of `K` integers and subtracting it from array `S` only once per set.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The inner loop `for (j = K; j--;)` can be optimized by starting the loop from `K-1` and using a post-decrement operator (`j--`) instead of pre-decrement (`--j`).

4. Compiler Optimization:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations by adding appropriate compiler flags or pragma directives. However, the specific optimizations may depend on the compiler being used.

Now, let's incorporate these optimizations step by step in the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, K, i, j, S[K], B, a;
  while (a = 1, cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    for (i = K; i--;) {
      cin >> S[i];
    }
    for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      int sum = 0;
      for (j = K - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
        cin >> B;
        sum += B;
      }
      for (j = K - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
        S[j] -= sum;
        if (S[j] < 0) {
          a = 0;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
  }
}
```

In this optimized code, we have made the following changes:

1. Replaced the dynamic array `S` with a static array `int S[K]`.
2. Removed the use of a pointer and directly used the array `S`.
3. Modified the inner loop to start from `K-1` and use a post-decrement operator.
4. Added a variable `sum` to calculate the cumulative sum of each set of `K` integers and subtract it from array `S` only once per set.

These optimizations aim to improve memory usage, reduce redundant computations, and optimize the loops. The changes made are minimal and effective in improving the performance of the code.

Please note that enabling compiler optimizations may vary depending on the compiler being used. Compiler-specific flags or pragma directives can be added to further optimize the code.
