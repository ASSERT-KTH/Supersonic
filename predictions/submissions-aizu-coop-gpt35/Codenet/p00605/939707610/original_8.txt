The given code is a C++ program that reads in a series of test cases consisting of two integers, N and K, followed by K more integers. It then reads in N more integers and subtracts them from the corresponding K integers. If all the resulting K integers are non-negative, it outputs "Yes"; otherwise, it outputs "No".

Upon analyzing the code, there are several potential optimizations that can be made to improve its efficiency:

1. Unnecessary Memory Allocation: The code dynamically allocates memory for the array `S` using the `new` operator. However, this is unnecessary since the size of the array is known at compile time. Instead, we can declare `S` as a static array of size K.

2. Redundant Variable Initialization: The variable `a` is initialized to 1 in each iteration of the while loop. This is unnecessary since it is immediately overwritten on the next line. We can remove this redundant initialization.

3. Loop Optimization: The inner loop iterates K times and performs two operations on each iteration: subtracting an element from `B` and checking if the result is negative. We can optimize this by combining the subtraction and comparison into a single operation using an if statement. Additionally, we can use a pre-decrement operator in the loop condition to avoid a separate decrement operation.

4. Avoiding Division: The `cout` statement uses a ternary operator to output "Yes" or "No" based on the value of `a`. Instead of using division and modulus operations to determine the correct string, we can use an array of string literals and index it with `a`.

Taking these optimizations into consideration, we can rewrite the code as follows:
