The provided code reads an integer `N` and `K`, followed by `K` integers into array `S`. It then reads `N` sets of `K` integers into array `B`, subtracts each element of `B` from the corresponding element of `S`, and checks if any element of `S` becomes negative. Finally, it prints "Yes" if all elements of `S` are non-negative, and "No" otherwise.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Memory Allocation: The code uses dynamic memory allocation (`new`) to create array `S` for each test case. This can be inefficient and lead to memory fragmentation. We can instead use a fixed-size array for `S` to avoid repeated memory allocation.

2. Redundant Computation: The code unnecessarily checks if `S[j] < 0` for each element of `B` in every iteration. We can optimize this by using a flag variable `a` to keep track of whether any element of `S` becomes negative. If `S[j]` becomes negative, we can set `a` to 0 and break out of the inner loop.

3. Compiler Optimization: We can use pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. For example, we can use `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")` at the beginning of the code to enable aggressive optimization.

Let's now implement these optimizations step by step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  #pragma GCC optimize("O3") // Enable aggressive compiler optimization

  int N, K, i, j, S[100], B, a; // Use fixed-size array for S
  while (a = 1, cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    for (i = K; i--;)
      cin >> S[i];
    for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      for (j = K; j--;) {
        cin >> B;
        S[j] -= B;
        if (S[j] < 0) { // Check if S[j] becomes negative
          a = 0;
          break; // Break out of the inner loop
        }
      }
      if (a == 0) // Check if any element of S became negative
        break; // Break out of the outer loop
    }
    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
  }
}
```

In the optimized code:
- We have replaced the dynamic memory allocation for array `S` with a fixed-size array `S[100]`. You can adjust the size based on your requirements.
- We have added a `break` statement inside the inner loop to break out of the loop if any element of `S` becomes negative.
- We have added a check after the inner loop to break out of the outer loop if any element of `S` becomes negative.
- We have added `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")` to enable aggressive compiler optimization.

These optimizations improve performance by avoiding repeated dynamic memory allocation and reducing redundant computations. The code complexity remains the same, and the output of the original code is preserved.
