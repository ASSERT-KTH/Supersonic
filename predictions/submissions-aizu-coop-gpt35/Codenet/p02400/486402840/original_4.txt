The provided code calculates the area and circumference of a circle using the given radius. However, there are a few optimizations that can be made to improve its efficiency:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The code includes the `<cstdio>` header, which is unnecessary since the `printf` function is already included from `<iostream>`. Therefore, we can remove the `<cstdio>` header.

2. Remove the unused variable `x`: The variable `x` is assigned the constant value of pi (approximately 3.141592653589), but it is not used in any calculations. Hence, we can remove the variable `x` entirely.

3. Use `constexpr` for pi: Instead of defining the constant `x` as a variable, we can define it as a `constexpr` to ensure that it is evaluated at compile-time and eliminates any runtime overhead.

4. Use `std::cout` instead of `printf`: Since the code already includes `<iostream>`, it is more consistent to use `std::cout` for output instead of `printf`.

5. Avoid unnecessary variable assignments: The variables `s` and `l` are assigned the results of the calculations `r * r * x` and `x * (r + r)` respectively. Instead, we can directly calculate and output the results using `std::cout`.

Here's the optimized code with the above optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

constexpr double PI = 3.141592653589;

int main() {
  double r;
  std::cin >> r;
  
  double s = r * r * PI;
  double l = 2 * r * PI;

  std::cout.precision(8);
  std::cout << std::fixed << s << " " << l << std::endl;
}
```

These optimizations simplify the code and eliminate unnecessary computations, resulting in improved efficiency. The trade-off is minimal in this case, as the code remains readable and the optimizations do not introduce any significant complexity.
