The provided code calculates the area and perimeter of a circle using the formulae s = πr^2 and l = 2πr. The code reads the radius of the circle from the user and then calculates the area (s) and perimeter (l) of the circle using the given formulae. Finally, it prints the values of s and l with 8 decimal places using `printf`.

To optimize this code, we can focus on improving the calculation of the area and perimeter, as well as eliminating unnecessary code.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `cstdio` header is not needed since we are using `printf` from the `iostream` library. We can remove the `cstdio` include statement.

2. Remove unnecessary variable: The variable `x` is not needed since we can directly use the constant value of π (pi) in the calculations.

3. Use a more accurate value for π: The code uses an approximation of pi with 15 decimal places. We can use a more accurate value of pi by using the `M_PI` constant from the `cmath` library.

4. Use `std::cout` instead of `printf`: The code currently uses `printf` for printing the output. We can use `std::cout` for improved performance and simplicity.

5. Use `std::setprecision` for precision control: Instead of formatting the output with a fixed number of decimal places, we can use `std::setprecision` to control the precision of the output.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <iomanip>

int main() {
  double r, s, l;
  std::cin >> r;
  s = M_PI * r * r;
  l = 2 * M_PI * r;
  std::cout << std::setprecision(8) << s << " " << l << std::endl;
}
```

Explanation:
1. We removed the unnecessary `cstdio` include since we are using `printf` from the `iostream` library.

2. We removed the unnecessary variable `x` since we can directly use the constant value of π (pi) in the calculations.

3. We replaced the approximation of pi with a more accurate value by using the `M_PI` constant from the `cmath` library.

4. We replaced the `printf` statement with `std::cout` for improved performance and simplicity.

5. We used `std::setprecision` to control the precision of the output. In this case, we set it to 8 decimal places.

Trade-offs:
- The optimized code is more concise and eliminates unnecessary computations, resulting in improved performance.
- However, the optimized code relies on the `M_PI` constant from the `cmath` library, which may not be available in some implementations. In such cases, you can define your own constant for pi or use an approximation if the accuracy is not critical.
