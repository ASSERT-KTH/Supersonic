The provided code calculates the area and circumference of a circle given its radius. However, there are a few areas where this code can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Avoid using the `using namespace std;` directive: This directive brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can cause name clashes and increase compilation time. Instead, explicitly specify the names from the `std` namespace that are required, such as `std::cin`, `std::cout`, and `std::printf`.

2. Use `const` qualifier for the constant value of π: The value of π is being assigned to the variable `x`, but it is not going to change throughout the execution of the program. Therefore, it can be declared as a constant using the `const` qualifier.

3. Use `std::cout` instead of `printf`: The code is using `printf` from the C standard library to print the output. However, since C++ provides its own I/O library, it is more efficient to use `std::cout` for output.

4. Use `std::setprecision` to control the precision of the output: The code is using `printf` with the `%.8lf` format specifier to print the output with 8 decimal places. In C++, you can achieve the same result using `std::cout` and the `std::setprecision` function from the `<iomanip>` library.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step by step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

int main() {
  const double pi = 3.141592653589;
  double r, s, l;
  
  std::cin >> r;
  s = r * r * pi;
  l = 2 * r * pi;

  std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(8) << s << " " << l << std::endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code:
- The unnecessary `cstdio` header is removed since it is not used.
- The `using namespace std;` directive is removed to avoid polluting the global namespace.
- The constant value of π is declared as `const double pi = 3.141592653589;` to make it a compile-time constant.
- `std::printf` is replaced with `std::cout` for output.
- `std::setprecision(8)` is used to set the precision of the output to 8 decimal places.
- `std::fixed` is used to ensure that the output is displayed in fixed-point notation.

These optimizations improve the efficiency of the code by reducing unnecessary header inclusions, avoiding namespace pollution, and utilizing the C++ standard library for input and output operations. The code complexity is not significantly increased, and the output remains the same.
