The provided code calculates the area and circumference of a circle based on the input radius. While the code is simple and straightforward, there are a few potential areas for optimization.

1. Reducing unnecessary precision:
    - The constant `PI` is defined with a very high precision, but for most practical purposes, a lower precision would suffice. Reducing the precision of `PI` can save memory and improve performance.

2. Eliminating redundant calculations:
    - The value of `PI * r * r` is calculated twice: once for the area and again for the circumference. Since `PI` and `r` are constant within the scope of the program, it is unnecessary to calculate the same value twice. Instead, we can calculate `PI * r * r` once and reuse it to calculate the circumference.

3. Avoiding unnecessary I/O operations:
    - The code currently reads the radius from the input stream using `cin`. However, if the radius is known at compile-time, we can eliminate the need for user input and hardcode the value directly in the program. This avoids the need for user interaction and can speed up the program.

4. Compiler optimizations:
    - The compiler can perform various optimizations to improve the performance of the code. We can enable optimization flags, such as `-O2` or `-O3`, to instruct the compiler to optimize the code during compilation.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step.
