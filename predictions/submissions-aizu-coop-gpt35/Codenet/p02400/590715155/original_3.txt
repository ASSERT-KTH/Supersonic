The given code calculates the area and circumference of a circle using the formulae A = π * r * r and C = 2 * π * r, where r is the radius of the circle. 

Upon analysis, I have identified the following potential optimizations in the code:

1. Avoiding the use of `using namespace std;`: The line `using namespace std;` brings all the names in the std namespace into the current scope. While this may be convenient, it can also lead to naming conflicts. It's generally considered a good practice to avoid this line and explicitly use the std namespace where required.

2. Using `const` for the variable PI: Since the value of PI is a constant, it can be declared as `const double PI = 3.141592653589;`. This allows the compiler to perform optimizations by replacing the PI variable with its constant value during compilation.

3. Using the `iostream` library instead of `cstdio`: The `iostream` library provides a more modern and flexible way of handling input and output in C++. The `printf` function from the `cstdio` library can be replaced with `cout` from the `iostream` library to improve code readability.

4. Avoiding unnecessary memory usage: The variable `r` is only used to store the user input, so we can directly use it in the calculations without storing it in a separate variable.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed to modify the code.
