The provided code calculates the area and circumference of a circle given the radius. While the code is correct and produces the expected output, there are several areas where it can be optimized for better performance and memory usage.

Here is a step-by-step optimization strategy for the given code:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `<cstdio>` header is not required in this code, so we can remove it.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: While it is convenient to use this statement, it can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less maintainable. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions.

3. Use `const` for constant values: The `PI` variable is a constant, so we can declare it as `const double PI = 3.141592653589;` to indicate its immutability.

4. Replace `printf()` with `cout`: The `printf()` function is a C-style output function, and using `cout` from the `<iostream>` header is more idiomatic in C++. We can replace the `printf()` statement with `cout` for better code readability.

5. Avoid unnecessary multiplication: Instead of calculating `2 * PI * r` twice, we can calculate it once and store it in a variable. This reduces redundant computations.

6. Use fixed-point precision for output: The default output precision for `cout` is quite high, which can result in unnecessary digits after the decimal point. We can set the output precision to a fixed number of decimal places using the `setprecision()` function from the `<iomanip>` header.

7. Optimize input: By default, `cin` and `cout` are synchronized with the standard C I/O streams, which can slow down input/output operations. We can improve the input performance by disabling the synchronization with `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`.

Now, let's optimize the code based on the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

int main() {
  const double PI = 3.141592653589;
  double r;
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  
  std::cin >> r;
  
  double area = PI * r * r;
  double circumference = 2 * PI * r;
  
  std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(6); // Output precision set to 6 decimal places
  std::cout << area << " " << circumference << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have reduced unnecessary computations, improved input performance, and made the output more precise with fixed-point precision. The code is also more readable and maintainable without sacrificing its functionality.
