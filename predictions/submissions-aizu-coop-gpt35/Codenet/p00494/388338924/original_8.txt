The given code appears to be counting the maximum number of consecutive 'JOI' substrings in a given string. However, the code is not efficient and can be optimized to improve its runtime and memory usage. 

Here is the proposed optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<cstdio>`, and `<string>`. Since these headers are not used in the code, they can be removed to reduce unnecessary compilation time.

2. Remove unnecessary variable declarations: Variables `e`, `f`, `i`, `j`, `k` are declared but not used in the code. These variables can be safely removed.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: The statement `using namespace std;` is generally considered bad practice as it pollutes the global namespace. Instead, we should use the `std::` prefix for the standard library functions and types.

4. Replace C-style array with std::string: The code uses a C-style character array `x` to store the input string. Instead, we can use `std::string` which provides more flexibility and better memory management.

5. Avoid unnecessary string copying: The code uses `strlen` to determine the length of the input string, and then copies the string into `x` using `scanf`. This is an unnecessary step as we can directly read the input into a `std::string` using `std::cin`.

6. Optimize the counting loop: The loop that counts the maximum number of 'JOI' substrings can be optimized. Instead of using multiple nested loops, we can use a single loop to iterate through the characters of the input string. We can keep track of the counts of 'J', 'O', and 'I' using separate variables, and update the maximum count whenever we encounter 'J'. This approach eliminates the need for multiple nested loops.

7. Use `std::max` instead of `max`: The code currently uses `max` from the standard library without the `std::` prefix. We should change it to `std::max` to ensure correct usage.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::string x;
  std::cin >> x;

  int b = 0, c = 0, d = 0;
  int maxi = 0;

  for (char ch : x) {
    if (ch == 'J') {
      b++;
    } else if (ch == 'O') {
      c++;
    } else if (ch == 'I') {
      d++;
    }

    if (b >= c && c <= d) {
      maxi = std::max(maxi, c);
    }
  }

  std::cout << maxi << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code is more efficient as it eliminates unnecessary operations, reduces memory usage, and improves the readability of the code.
