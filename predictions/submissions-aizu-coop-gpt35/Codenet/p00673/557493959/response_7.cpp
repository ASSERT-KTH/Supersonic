Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a vector of maps (`f[100][2]`) to store and access data. This can be inefficient for large datasets, as searching and inserting elements in a map has a complexity of O(log n). 

2. Redundant computations: The code calculates the size of the vector `G[u]` multiple times in the same loop. This can be avoided by storing the size in a variable and reusing it.

3. Inefficient loop structure: The nested loops used to iterate over the elements of `f[i][0]` and `f[i][1]` can be optimized by using iterators instead of indices.

4. Compiler optimization: The code does not have any compiler optimization flags or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. Adding appropriate optimization flags or pragmas can help the compiler generate more efficient code.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization steps:

1. Replace the vector of maps (`f[100][2]`) with a 2-dimensional array. This will provide constant-time access to elements and eliminate the overhead of searching and inserting elements in a map.

2. Store the size of `G[u]` in a variable and reuse it instead of calculating it multiple times in the same loop.

3. Replace the nested loops used to iterate over `f[i][0]` and `f[i][1]` with iterators.

4. Add compiler optimization flags or pragma directives to enable compiler optimizations.
