The provided code is a C++ program that solves a graph problem using the primal-dual algorithm. The main function reads input from standard input, constructs a graph, and then calls the `primal_dual` function to find the maximum flow and minimum cost in the graph. The final result is printed to standard output.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. The use of `map` data structures for storing vertices and their corresponding indices. This can be replaced with a more efficient data structure, such as an array or a hash table.

2. The use of a `vector` of `edge` structures to represent the graph. This can be replaced with a more memory-efficient data structure, such as an adjacency list.

3. The use of a `priority_queue` for implementing Dijkstra's algorithm. This can be replaced with a more efficient data structure, such as a binary heap.

4. The use of a static array for the `pre` and `d` variables in the `augment` function. These variables can be declared locally within the function to reduce memory usage.

5. The use of the `rep` macro for iterating over a range. This can be replaced with a more efficient loop construct, such as a traditional `for` loop.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization strategy step-by-step.

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - Replace the `map` data structures `f` with more efficient data structures, such as arrays or hash tables. This will eliminate the need for searching and inserting elements in the `map` during graph construction.
   - Replace the `vector` of `edge` structures `G` with an adjacency list representation for the graph. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache efficiency during graph traversal.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - Avoid redundant computations of `f[i][0][t]` by storing it in a variable before the loop.
   - Avoid repeated calls to `f[i][0].begin()` and `f[i][0].end()` in the first loop by storing them in variables before the loop.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - Replace the use of the `rep` macro with traditional `for` loops for improved readability and performance.
   - Loop unrolling can be considered for nested loops to reduce loop overhead and improve cache efficiency.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Enable compiler optimizations, such as `-O2` or `-O3`, to let the compiler automatically apply various optimization techniques, including loop unrolling, function inlining, and constant propagation.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the code.
