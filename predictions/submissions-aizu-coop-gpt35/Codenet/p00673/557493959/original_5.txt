The provided code is a C++ program that solves a transportation problem using the primal-dual algorithm. The program takes inputs representing train schedules and calculates the minimum cost required to transport a given number of passengers from the source station to the destination station.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Data Structures: The current code uses nested maps to store the train schedule, which can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and lookup time. We can replace the maps with more efficient data structures, such as arrays or vectors, to improve performance.

2. Loop Optimization: The code contains nested loops that iterate over the train schedule data. We can optimize these loops by removing redundant computations or using loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead.

3. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. This can include using compiler flags like -O3 to enable aggressive optimizations or using pragmas like #pragma GCC optimize("O3") to optimize specific functions or loops.

Now let's go step by step and apply these optimizations to the code.
