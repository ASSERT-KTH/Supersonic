The provided code is an implementation of the "primal-dual algorithm" for solving the minimum cost flow problem. The algorithm finds the maximum flow in a directed graph while minimizing the total cost of the flow. The code reads input from the standard input and outputs the maximum flow and the total cost of the flow for each test case.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations.
2. Reduce the number of iterations and operations in loops.
3. Minimize the use of STL containers and algorithms.
4. Utilize compiler optimizations and pragmas.

Let's go step by step to optimize the code:

Step 1: Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations

The code currently uses `vector` and `map` extensively, which can lead to a significant overhead in terms of memory allocation and deallocation. To avoid this, we can replace some of the data structures with more efficient alternatives.

1. Replace `vector<edge<T, U>> *G` with a dynamically allocated 2D array. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation for each test case. We can use the `new` and `delete` operators to allocate and deallocate the memory.

```cpp
edge<T, U>** G = new edge<T, U>*[V_MAX];
for (int u = 0; u < V_MAX; u++) {
    G[u] = new edge<T, U>[V_MAX];
}
```

2. Replace the `map` data structure with a fixed-size array. Since the maximum number of vertices is known in advance, we can use a 2D array to store the mapping between time values and vertices. This will eliminate the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation for each time value.

```cpp
int f[100][2][100000]; // Assuming the maximum time value is 100000
```

Step 2: Reduce the number of iterations and operations in loops

1. In the `add_directed_edge` function, the line `G[v].push_back((edge<T, U>){u, G[u].size() - 1, 0, -cost, 0});` can be optimized by pre-calculating the value of `G[u].size() - 1` outside the loop.

```cpp
int rev = G[u].size() - 1;
G[u].push_back((edge<T, U>){v, rev, capa, cost, 0});
```

2. In the `augment` function, the line `if (u == t) ok = true;` can be optimized by breaking the loop when `u == t` is true. This will eliminate unnecessary iterations.

```cpp
if (u == t) {
    ok = true;
    break;
}
```

3. In the `primal_dual` function, the line `if (tmp.first == 0) break;` can be optimized by breaking the loop using a flag `bool done` instead of directly using `break`. This will allow us to perform some additional operations before exiting the loop.

```cpp
bool done = false;
while (!done) {
    pair<T, U> tmp = augment(n, G, s, t, pot);
    if (tmp.first == 0) {
        done = true;
    } else {
        ans1 += tmp.first;
        ans2 += tmp.second;
    }
}
```

Step 3: Minimize the use of STL containers and algorithms

1. Avoid using `std::pair` for the return type of the `augment` function. Instead, pass the variables `water` and `cost` by reference and modify them directly inside the function.

```cpp
void augment(int n, edge<T, U> **G, int s, int t, U *pot, T& water, U& cost) {
    // ...
}
```

2. Replace the use of `std::priority_queue` with a more efficient priority queue implementation. Since the maximum number of vertices is known in advance, we can use a binary heap-based priority queue implementation, which has better performance characteristics than the `std::priority_queue` implementation.

```cpp
template <class T, class U>
struct BinaryHeap {
    // ...
};
```

Step 4: Utilize compiler optimizations and pragmas

1. Enable compiler optimizations by passing the appropriate flags to the compiler. For example, using `-O3` flag with GCC or Clang will enable aggressive optimizations.

2. Use compiler-specific pragmas to provide hints to the compiler for better optimization. For example, using `#pragma GCC optimize` or `#pragma clang optimize` to enable specific optimizations for certain functions or loops.

With these optimizations in place, the optimized code will look as follows:
