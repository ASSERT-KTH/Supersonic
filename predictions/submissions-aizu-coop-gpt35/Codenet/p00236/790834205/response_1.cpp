The provided code is a C++ program that solves a grid-based puzzle. The main goal of the program is to determine if it is possible to navigate through the grid by visiting each non-blocked cell exactly once and returning to the starting cell.

Upon analyzing the code, several potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Inefficient data structures:
   - The `bitset` data structure is used to track visited cells. However, the size of the `bitset` is fixed at compile-time and set to `N = 49`. This limits the program's flexibility to handle grids of different sizes.
   - The use of a 2D vector (`vector<vector<int>>`) for the `field`, `vertex`, and `edge` data structures can result in inefficient memory usage, especially for large grids.
   - The `set` data structure is used to store the visited states (`memo`). However, the use of a set can lead to slow lookup times, especially when the number of elements in the set becomes large.

2. Redundant computations:
   - The `make_graph` function is called every time before solving the puzzle, even though the grid does not change. This leads to unnecessary computations and memory allocations.

3. Recursive function:
   - The `dfs` function is implemented recursively, which can potentially lead to stack overflow errors for large grids.

4. Lack of compiler optimizations:
   - The code does not utilize any compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

To optimize the code, the following steps can be taken:

1. Replace `bitset` with a more efficient data structure:
   - Instead of using a fixed-size `bitset`, we can use a `vector<bool>` to track visited cells. This allows for more flexible grid sizes and reduces memory usage compared to `bitset<N>`.
   - Additionally, using a `vector<bool>` allows for more efficient bitwise operations compared to `bitset`.

2. Replace 2D vectors with 1D vectors:
   - Instead of using a 2D vector (`vector<vector<int>>`), we can use a 1D vector (`vector<int>`) to represent the `field`, `vertex`, and `edge` data structures.
   - We can then use index calculations to access the appropriate elements in the 1D vector, reducing memory usage and improving cache locality.

3. Avoid redundant computations:
   - The `make_graph` function can be called once before solving the puzzle, and the resulting `vertex` and `edge` vectors can be reused for subsequent puzzle solving iterations.

4. Optimize the recursive function:
   - The `dfs` function can be optimized by implementing it iteratively using a stack or by using tail recursion.

5. Utilize compiler optimizations:
   - Enabling compiler optimizations (`-O2` or higher) can help the compiler generate more efficient code by applying various optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and constant propagation.
