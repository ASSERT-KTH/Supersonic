Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The `vector<vector<int>>` data structure is used to represent the field, vertex, and edge. However, this can be improved by using a more space-efficient data structure, such as a 1-dimensional vector or a dynamically allocated 2-dimensional array.
   - The `bitset<N>` data structure is used to represent the visited nodes. However, since `N` is a constant value and relatively small (49 in this case), using a bitset might not provide significant memory savings. We can consider using a boolean array instead.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `make_graph()` function is called repeatedly within the `solve()` function, even though the field does not change. This can be optimized by moving the `make_graph()` call outside the loop in the `main()` function.

3. Optimization Strategies:
   - Use a more space-efficient data structure, such as a 1-dimensional vector or a dynamically allocated 2-dimensional array, to represent the field, vertex, and edge.
   - Replace the `bitset<N>` data structure with a boolean array to represent the visited nodes.
   - Move the `make_graph()` function call outside the loop in the `main()` function to avoid redundant computations.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of the optimizations and provide the optimized code.
