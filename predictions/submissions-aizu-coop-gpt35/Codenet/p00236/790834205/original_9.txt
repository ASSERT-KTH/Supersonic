The given code is a C++ program that solves a puzzle involving a grid of cells. The goal is to determine if it is possible to visit all the cells by moving horizontally or vertically, without crossing any blocked cells.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The `vector<vector<int>>` data structure is used to represent the grid (`field`), vertices (`vertex`), and edges (`edge`). This can result in inefficient memory usage and slower access times.
   - The `bitset<N>` data structure is used to represent visited cells. While it provides a compact representation, it may not be the most efficient choice for this problem.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `make_graph` function is called every time the `solve` function is invoked. This results in redundant computations to create the graph representation of the grid.

3. Inefficient Recursive Calls:
   - The `reachability` function is implemented recursively, which can lead to excessive function call overhead.
   - The `dfs` function is also implemented recursively, which can result in a large number of function calls.

4. Lack of Compiler Optimizations:
   - The code does not utilize any compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler for potential optimizations.

To optimize the given code, we can follow the following steps:

1. Replace the `vector<vector<int>>` data structure with a more efficient alternative for representing the grid, vertices, and edges.
2. Modify the `make_graph` function to only compute the graph representation of the grid once.
3. Replace the recursive implementation of `reachability` and `dfs` with iterative alternatives to minimize function call overhead.
4. Utilize compiler optimizations or pragma directives to optimize the code further.

Let's implement these optimizations step by step.
