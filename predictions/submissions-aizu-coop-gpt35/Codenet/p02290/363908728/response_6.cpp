The provided code seems to be a program that takes input for a line `L` and a set of points `p`, and for each point `p`, it calculates the projection of `p` onto the line `L` and prints the result.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Use more efficient data structures: The code currently uses the `complex` type to represent points. However, we can optimize memory usage by using a more lightweight structure, such as a pair of doubles to represent the x and y coordinates of a point.

2. Avoid unnecessary computations: The code computes the dot product and cross product of points, but these computations are not needed for the given task. We can remove these computations to improve performance.

3. Optimize loops: The code uses a loop to iterate over the input points. We can optimize this loop by using a range-based loop instead of a while loop. Additionally, we can use the `reserve` function to allocate memory for the output points in advance, instead of resizing the vector dynamically.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and vectorization, to further improve the performance of the code. We can enable these optimizations using compiler-specific pragmas or flags.
