The provided code calculates the projection of a point `P(cx, cy)` onto the line segment defined by points `P(ax, ay)` and `P(bx, by)`. The program takes input for the coordinates of `ax`, `ay`, `bx`, `by`, and `n`, where `n` is the number of points to project onto the line segment. It then reads the coordinates of each point `cx` and `cy`, calculates the projection, and prints the result.

To optimize this code for performance and memory usage, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary library inclusion: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove this line and include only the necessary libraries.

2. Optimize the `project` function: The `project` function currently uses complex numbers to perform calculations. However, using complex numbers for this simple projection operation is unnecessary and adds overhead. We can optimize this function to perform the projection using only basic arithmetic operations.

3. Improve input/output operations: The code currently uses `cin` and `printf` for input and output operations, respectively. These operations can be slow, especially when reading or writing a large number of points. We can use faster I/O methods such as `scanf` and `printf` with appropriate format specifiers to speed up the input/output.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step.
