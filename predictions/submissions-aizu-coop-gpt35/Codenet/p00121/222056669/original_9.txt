The given code is a C++ program that solves a puzzle known as "8 Puzzle" using a breadth-first search algorithm. The goal of the puzzle is to rearrange a 3x3 grid of numbered tiles in ascending order from left to right, top to bottom, with one empty space.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage: The program uses a large array called `vis` to keep track of visited states. However, the size of this array is excessive and can be reduced to improve memory usage.

2. Loop Unrolling: The loop in the `bfs` function can be optimized by unrolling it, which can lead to improved performance.

3. Redundant Computations: There are some redundant computations within the loop that can be eliminated to reduce unnecessary overhead.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest the use of compiler optimizations, such as loop optimizations and enabling aggressive function inlining, to further enhance performance.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps in a step-by-step manner.
