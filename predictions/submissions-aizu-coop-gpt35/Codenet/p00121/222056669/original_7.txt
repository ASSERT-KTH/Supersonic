This code appears to be a program that solves a puzzle involving a 3x3 grid of numbers. The goal is to transform the initial grid into a specific target grid by swapping adjacent numbers.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The `char bj[8]` array is used to store the 8 numbers in the grid. However, using characters to represent numbers is not memory-efficient. We can use integers instead.
   - The `char vis[80000000 / 8]` array is used to represent visited states. However, this array is excessively large, occupying a significant amount of memory. We can reduce its size by using a bitset instead.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `ddd` array is used to calculate powers of 10. However, these calculations can be avoided by using a precomputed lookup table.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The loop that checks for valid moves can be optimized by unrolling the loop and avoiding unnecessary iterations.
   - The loop that reads input can be optimized by using `getchar_unlocked()` instead of `getchar()`, which is faster but not thread-safe.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can use compiler-specific optimizations, such as loop vectorization or function inlining, to improve performance further.
   - We can use compiler pragmas or directives to provide hints to the compiler for optimizing specific sections of the code.

Now, let's optimize the code step-by-step.
