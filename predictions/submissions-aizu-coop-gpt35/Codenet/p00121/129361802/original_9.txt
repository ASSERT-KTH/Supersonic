The given code is an implementation of a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to solve a sliding puzzle problem. The goal is to find the minimum number of steps required to transform a given configuration of the puzzle into a target configuration.

Upon analysis, the following potential areas of improvement can be identified:

1. Memory Usage: The code uses a `bitset` of size 80000000 to track visited states, which can be quite memory-intensive. We can explore more memory-efficient alternatives.

2. Integer to String Conversion: The code converts the puzzle state from an integer to a string representation using division and modulus operations repeatedly. This can be optimized by using bitwise operations.

3. Loop Optimization: There are multiple nested loops in the code, which can potentially be optimized to reduce the number of iterations.

4. Input Handling: The code reads input character by character using `scanf`, which can be slow. We can optimize the input handling process.

Now, I will propose a step-by-step optimization strategy to improve the efficiency of the given code.
