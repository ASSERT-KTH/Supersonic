First, let's analyze the code to identify potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. The `bitset` named `vis` is used to track visited states. However, the current implementation uses a `bitset` with a size of 80000000 bits, which is excessive for the problem's constraints. The maximum possible number of states is 8! = 40320. We can use a boolean array of size 40320 to track visited states instead.

2. The `struct pt` is used to represent a state. However, it contains unnecessary fields. We only need to store the current state and the number of steps taken to reach that state. The `lwz` field is used to store the position of the '0' digit, but we can calculate it on the fly instead.

3. The `dl` array is used as a queue for the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. It is currently implemented as a fixed-size array, but it should be dynamically resized as needed to avoid running out of space.

4. The `strchr` function is called multiple times in the code, which is inefficient. We can calculate the position of the '0' digit directly instead of using `strchr`.

5. The `atoi` function is used to convert the `bj` array to an integer. However, this conversion can be done more efficiently by manually calculating the integer value.

6. The swapping of digits in the `sss` array can be optimized. Instead of using a temporary variable `t` and swapping back the digits, we can use a single swap operation to restore the original state.

7. The input reading code could be improved. Currently, each character is read individually using `scanf`, which is not efficient. We can read the entire line and parse the characters from the string.
