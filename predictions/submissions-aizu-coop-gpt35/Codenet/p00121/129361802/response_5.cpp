The provided code appears to be a C++ program that solves a puzzle called "Eight Puzzle". The program uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state of the puzzle to the goal state. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance and reduced memory usage.

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The `bitset<80000000> vis` is used to keep track of visited puzzle states. However, the size of this bitset is much larger than necessary. Since the puzzle has 8 cells, each with 4 possible values, the total number of unique puzzle states is 8! = 40320. Therefore, a bitset of size 40320 can be used instead, which significantly reduces memory usage.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `atoi(bj)` function is called multiple times within the `bfs()` function to convert the puzzle state from a character array to an integer. This conversion can be done once before the BFS loop and stored in a variable for reuse, eliminating the need for repeated conversions.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The loop that converts the puzzle state from an integer to a character array (`sss[]`) is currently using a division and modulo operation. These operations can be replaced with a series of bitwise operations to improve efficiency.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Compiler-specific optimizations, such as loop unrolling or using pragma directives, can be applied to optimize the code further. However, the specific optimizations will depend on the compiler being used.
