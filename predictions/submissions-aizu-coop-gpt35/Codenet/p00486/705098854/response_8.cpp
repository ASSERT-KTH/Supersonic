The provided code calculates the optimal coordinates (x, y) for a given width (w) and height (h), such that the sum of distances between these coordinates and a set of points is minimized. The code uses a brute-force approach to iterate through all possible combinations of coordinates and calculates the sum of distances for each combination.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Memory Usage:
   - The code currently uses a 2D array, `LXY`, to store the input coordinates. However, we can avoid using a 2D array and instead use two separate arrays, `X` and `Y`, to store the x and y coordinates, respectively. This will reduce the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and improve cache locality.
   - Instead of using a vector of vectors, `XY`, to store the coordinates, we can use a single vector and store the x and y coordinates in separate parts of the vector. This will reduce the memory overhead and improve cache efficiency.

2. Loop Optimization:
   - The code currently uses nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of coordinates. We can optimize this by using a single loop and calculating the x and y coordinates using the loop index. This will eliminate the need for nested loops and improve the performance.

3. Redundant Computations:
   - The code currently calculates the sum of distances for each combination of coordinates twice: once inside the loop and again outside the loop to find the maximum distance. We can optimize this by calculating the sum of distances only once inside the loop and updating the maximum distance as we iterate through the coordinates.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. For example, we can use the `-O3` flag to enable aggressive optimizations.
