The provided code calculates the minimum total distance between two points in a grid. The code reads the width and height of the grid, the number of points, and the coordinates of each point. It then sorts the x and y coordinates separately, calculates the median coordinates, and iterates over all possible combinations of these median points to find the minimum total distance.

Here are some potential optimizations for this code:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The code currently allocates memory for two arrays, `XY[0]` and `XY[1]`, and two arrays of arrays, `LXY[0]` and `LXY[1]`. These arrays are used to store and sort the x and y coordinates of the points. Instead of using separate arrays, we can directly sort the x and y coordinates in the `LXY` arrays themselves, which eliminates the need for additional memory allocation.

2. Use `std::sort` instead of `std::stable_sort`: The code currently uses `std::stable_sort` to sort the x and y coordinates. Since stability is not a requirement in this case, we can use `std::sort` instead, which generally has better performance.

3. Remove unnecessary calculations and conditions: The code calculates `dx` and `dy` based on the equality of certain coordinates. However, these calculations are not necessary for finding the minimum total distance. We can remove these calculations and simplify the code.

4. Minimize the number of iterations: The code currently iterates over all possible combinations of the median points, resulting in `dx * dy` iterations. However, we can optimize this by iterating only over the two possible combinations: (0, 0) and (1, 1).

5. Optimize the distance calculation: The code currently calculates the Manhattan distance using the `abs` function. Instead, we can calculate the absolute difference between the coordinates directly, which should be slightly faster.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code.
