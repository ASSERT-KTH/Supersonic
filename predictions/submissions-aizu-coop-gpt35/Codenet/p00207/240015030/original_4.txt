The given code is an implementation of a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to solve a maze problem. The program takes input for the dimensions of the maze, the starting and ending positions, and the obstacles within the maze. It then performs a DFS traversal to check if there exists a path from the starting position to the ending position. The program outputs "OK" if a path exists and "NG" otherwise.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory usage: The `Board` array has a fixed size of 102x102, which is much larger than required for most test cases. We can reduce the memory usage by resizing the `Board` array to the actual dimensions of the maze.

2. Remove redundant computations: The DFS function currently checks if `x == xg` and `y == yg` in every recursive call. We can optimize this by adding an additional base case at the beginning of the DFS function to check if `x` and `y` are already equal to `xg` and `yg`, respectively. This avoids unnecessary recursive calls.

3. Optimize the DFS traversal: The current implementation of the DFS traversal checks all four adjacent cells in each recursive call, even if some of them are outside the bounds of the maze. We can optimize this by first checking if the adjacent cells are within the bounds of the maze before making the recursive call.

4. Utilize compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to further improve the performance of the code. By enabling optimization flags or using pragma directives, we can hint the compiler to perform various optimizations, such as loop unrolling or function inlining.

Here's the optimized code with explanations of the optimization steps:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isOK;
int xs, ys, xg, yg;
int** Board;

void DFS(int c, int x, int y) {
  if (x == xg && y == yg) {
    isOK = true;
    return;
  } else if (Board[x][y] != c) {
    return;
  }
  Board[x][y] = 0;

  // Check if adjacent cells are within bounds before making recursive calls
  if (x + 1 < xs && Board[x + 1][y] == c) {
    DFS(c, x + 1, y);
  }
  if (y + 1 < ys && Board[x][y + 1] == c) {
    DFS(c, x, y + 1);
  }
  if (x > 0 && Board[x - 1][y] == c) {
    DFS(c, x - 1, y);
  }
  if (y > 0 && Board[x][y - 1] == c) {
    DFS(c, x, y - 1);
  }
}

int main() {
  int w, h;
  while (true) {
    cin >> w >> h;
    if (w == 0 && h == 0)
      break;
    isOK = false;

    // Resize the Board array to the actual dimensions of the maze
    Board = new int*[w];
    for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
      Board[i] = new int[h];
      for (int j = 0; j < h; j++) {
        Board[i][j] = -1;
      }
    }

    cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;
    int n, c, d, x, y;
    cin >> n;
    for (int t = 0; t < n; t++) {
      cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
      int wb = 2 + (!d * 2);
      int hb = 2 + (d * 2);
      for (int i = 0; i < hb; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < wb; j++) {
          if (x + j < w && y + i < h) {
            Board[x + j][y + i] = c;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    DFS(Board[xs][ys], xs, ys);
    if (isOK)
      cout << "OK" << endl;
    else
      cout << "NG" << endl;

    // Deallocate memory for the Board array
    for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
      delete[] Board[i];
    }
    delete[] Board;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

By resizing the `Board` array to the actual dimensions of the maze, we significantly reduce memory usage. Additionally, by avoiding redundant computations and optimizing the DFS traversal, we improve the efficiency of the program. Finally, we deallocate the dynamically allocated memory for the `Board` array to avoid memory leaks.

The trade-off in this optimization is a slight increase in code complexity due to the additional checks for boundary conditions and the resizing of the `Board` array. However, the performance gain from these optimizations outweighs the complexity increase.
