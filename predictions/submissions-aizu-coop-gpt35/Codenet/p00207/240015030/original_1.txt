Code Analysis:
- The code uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to check if a path exists from a starting point (xs, ys) to a goal point (xg, yg) on a 2D board.
- The board is represented by a 2D array named "Board".
- The DFS function recursively explores adjacent cells and marks them as visited by setting their value to 0.
- The main function reads input values, initializes the board, calls the DFS function, and outputs the result.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid using a global variable: The use of the global variable "isOK" can lead to bugs and makes the code less readable. Instead, we can modify the DFS function to return a boolean value indicating whether a path was found.
2. Use a more efficient data structure for the board: The current implementation uses a 2D array that has a fixed size of 102x102. This wastes memory and can lead to cache misses. We can use a dynamically allocated 2D array to reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.
3. Use a more efficient representation for the board cells: The board cells are currently represented by integers. We can use a boolean array to represent visited cells, reducing memory usage.
4. Optimize the DFS function:
   - Avoid unnecessary recursion: The DFS function currently makes recursive calls in all four directions, even if a path has already been found. We can optimize this by checking if "isOK" is true before making a recursive call.
   - Optimize the loop bounds in the DFS function: The DFS function currently explores adjacent cells even if they are outside the board boundaries. We can optimize this by adjusting the loop bounds based on the board size.
5. Use compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to further improve the performance of the code. This can be done by enabling optimization flags or using pragma directives to guide the compiler's optimization decisions.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the global variable "isOK" and modify the DFS function to return a boolean value indicating whether a path was found. This improves code clarity and eliminates the need for a global variable.
2. Replace the fixed-size 2D array "Board" with a dynamically allocated 2D array. This reduces memory usage and improves cache locality. We will use the "vector" class in C++ to achieve this.
3. Replace the integer values in the board with a boolean array to represent visited cells. This further reduces memory usage.
4. Modify the DFS function to check if "isOK" is true before making a recursive call. This avoids unnecessary recursion when a path has already been found.
5. Adjust the loop bounds in the DFS function to avoid exploring cells outside the board boundaries. This improves efficiency.
6. Add compiler optimizations by enabling optimization flags or using pragma directives. This allows the compiler to perform additional optimizations.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool DFS(const vector<vector<bool>>& board, int c, int x, int y, int xg, int yg) {
  if (board[x][y] || x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= board.size() || y >= board[0].size()) {
    return false;
  } else if (x == xg && y == yg) {
    return true;
  }
  board[x][y] = true;
  if (DFS(board, c, x + 1, y, xg, yg) || DFS(board, c, x, y + 1, xg, yg) || DFS(board, c, x - 1, y, xg, yg) || DFS(board, c, x, y - 1, xg, yg)) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}

int main() {
  int w, h;
  while (true) {
    cin >> w >> h;
    if (w == 0 && h == 0)
      break;
    vector<vector<bool>> board(w, vector<bool>(h, false));
    int xs, ys, xg, yg;
    cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;
    int n, c, d, x, y;
    cin >> n;
    for (int t = 0; t < n; t++) {
      cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
      int wb = 2 + (!d * 2);
      int hb = 2 + (d * 2);
      for (int i = 0; i < hb; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < wb; j++)
          board[x + j][y + i] = true;
      }
    }
    if (DFS(board, board[xs][ys], xs, ys, xg, yg))
      cout << "OK" << endl;
    else
      cout << "NG" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the code improves performance and reduces memory usage by using a more efficient data structure for the board and optimizing the DFS function. Compiler optimizations can also be applied to further enhance the performance.
