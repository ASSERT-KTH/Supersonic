The provided code is a C++ program that takes inputs for a grid, starting and ending coordinates, and a series of rectangles on the grid. It then performs a depth-first search (DFS) to determine if there is a valid path from the starting coordinate to the ending coordinate, avoiding the rectangles.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified the following potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Data Structure: The current implementation uses a 2D array (`Board`) to represent the grid. However, this array has a fixed size of 102x102, which is much larger than the actual grid size. This inefficiently uses memory and can lead to cache misses during traversal.

2. Unnecessary Recomputation: The `DFS` function is called recursively for each adjacent cell, which can result in redundant computations. Additionally, the `DFS` function modifies the `Board` array, which is not necessary for determining the validity of the path.

3. Memory Initialization: The `Board` array is initialized to -1 for each element before reading the inputs. Since the `Board` array is only used within the grid boundaries, this initialization step is unnecessary and wastes computation time.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The code does not have any compiler optimizations enabled. Adding appropriate compiler flags or pragmas can help the compiler optimize the code.

Based on these observations, I propose the following steps for optimizing the code:

Step 1: Remove Unnecessary Memory Initialization
- Remove the nested for loop that initializes the `Board` array to -1. Since the `Board` array is only used within the grid boundaries, there is no need to initialize the entire array.

Step 2: Use a Dynamic Data Structure for the Grid
- Instead of using a fixed-size 2D array, use a dynamic data structure such as a vector of vectors to represent the grid. This will allow us to allocate memory only for the required grid size, resulting in reduced memory usage.

Step 3: Optimize the DFS Algorithm
- Instead of modifying the `Board` array during the DFS traversal, we can pass a separate visited array to keep track of visited cells. This will allow us to avoid modifying the `Board` array and simplify the DFS function.
- Modify the DFS function to use a loop instead of recursion. This will eliminate the overhead of recursive function calls and improve performance.
- Optimize the order of DFS traversal by considering adjacent cells in a specific order (e.g., left, right, up, down). This can help improve cache locality and reduce the number of cache misses.

Step 4: Enable Compiler Optimizations
- Enable compiler optimizations by adding appropriate compiler flags or pragmas. This will allow the compiler to apply various optimization techniques to the code, such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and constant propagation.
