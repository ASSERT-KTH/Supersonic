The given code implements a maze solving algorithm using a recursive function `meiro()`. The goal is to find a path from the starting point `(xs, ys)` to the goal point `(xg, yg)` in a maze represented by a 2D array `C[][]`. The maze contains obstacles represented by different values of `c`. The function `meiro()` recursively explores the maze starting from `(W, H)` and marks visited cells with `-1`. If the goal cell is marked as `-1`, it means a path from the starting point to the goal point exists.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Inefficient Memory Usage: The maze array `C[][]` is defined as a 102x102 2D array, even though the dimensions are not mentioned in the problem statement. This leads to unnecessary memory consumption.

2. Redundant Computations: The first optimization step is to avoid redundant computations within the `meiro()` function. Currently, the function is called recursively in all four directions without checking boundary conditions or whether the cell has already been visited. This can lead to unnecessary recursive calls and redundant computations.

3. Compiler Optimizations: The code does not have any compiler optimizations or pragma directives. Adding suitable compiler optimizations can potentially improve the performance of the code.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Reduce Memory Usage: Determine the actual dimensions of the maze based on the input and define the `C[][]` array accordingly.

2. Optimize Recursive Calls: Modify the `meiro()` function to avoid redundant recursive calls. Check boundary conditions and whether the cell has already been visited before making a recursive call.

3. Add Compiler Optimizations: Add compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize the code further.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization:

1. Reduce Memory Usage:
   - Instead of defining the maze array `C[][]` as a fixed 102x102 size, determine the actual dimensions of the maze based on the input. Update the `C[][]` definition accordingly.

2. Optimize Recursive Calls:
   - Inside the `meiro()` function, add boundary condition checks before making recursive calls. This will prevent unnecessary recursive calls when trying to explore outside the maze boundaries.
   - Add a base case to stop the recursion when the cell being explored is not equal to the initial value `c`. This will prevent further exploration in cells that are not part of the path.

3. Add Compiler Optimizations:
   - Add suitable compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler about potential optimizations. For example, depending on the compiler, adding `-O3` optimization flag can enable aggressive optimizations like loop unrolling and inline function expansion.
