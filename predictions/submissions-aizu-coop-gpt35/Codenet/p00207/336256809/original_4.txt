The provided code is a maze-solving program that takes input for the maze size, starting and ending positions, and obstacle positions, and determines if there is a path from the starting position to the ending position.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas of improvement can be identified:

1. Recursive Calls: The `meiro` function is implemented using recursive calls, which can lead to excessive function calls and stack memory usage. This can be improved by implementing an iterative solution instead.

2. Memory Usage: The `C` array is a 2D array of size 102x102, which is larger than necessary for the given problem constraints. The array can be resized to optimize memory usage.

3. Redundant Computations: The `C` array is initialized with a value of 10 for every cell in every iteration of the main loop. This initialization is unnecessary and can be performed outside the loop.

4. Inefficient Data Structure: The `C` array is used to store the maze cells, but it is currently implemented as a 2D array. Using a 1D array with appropriate indexing can be more efficient.

To optimize the code, we can follow the following steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary memory initialization inside the main loop. The `C` array can be initialized once outside the loop.

2. Optimize the memory usage by resizing the `C` array to the actual maze size.

3. Implement an iterative solution for the `meiro` function to eliminate recursive calls.

Let's optimize the code step by step.
