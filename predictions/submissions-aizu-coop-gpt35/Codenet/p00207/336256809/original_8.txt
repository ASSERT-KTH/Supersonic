Code Analysis:
- The main function reads inputs for the maze dimensions, starting and ending positions, and the number of obstacles.
- It then initializes a 2D array `C` with dimensions 102x102, where the value at each cell represents the color of the cell.
- Next, it reads the coordinates and color of each obstacle and updates the corresponding cells in the array.
- Finally, it calls the `meiro` function with the starting position and color, and checks if the ending position is reachable.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary initialization of the `C` array:
   - The current code initializes the entire `C` array to a value of 10 before processing each test case. This is unnecessary because only a portion of the array will be modified for each test case.
   - Instead, we can initialize only the cells that will be modified for each test case, and leave the rest of the array uninitialized.

2. Use a more efficient data structure for the maze:
   - The current implementation uses a 2D array `C` to represent the maze. However, this data structure is inefficient in terms of memory usage because it allocates a large fixed-size array.
   - We can use a more compact representation of the maze, such as a 1D array, which would require less memory and potentially improve cache locality.

3. Optimize the recursive calls in the `meiro` function:
   - The current implementation uses recursive calls to explore all possible paths in the maze. However, this can lead to a large number of function calls and stack usage, especially for large mazes.
   - We can optimize the `meiro` function using an iterative approach, such as a stack-based depth-first search (DFS), to avoid the overhead of recursive function calls.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary initialization of the `C` array:
   - Remove the nested loops in the `main` function that initialize the `C` array to a value of 10. This will save unnecessary computations and memory writes.

2. Use a more efficient data structure for the maze:
   - Replace the 2D array `C` with a 1D array `maze` of size (W+2)*(H+2).
   - Calculate the index of a cell at position (x, y) in the maze as: `index = x * (H+2) + y`.
   - Update the code to use `maze[index]` instead of `C[x][y]` to access and modify cells in the maze.

3. Optimize the `meiro` function:
   - Replace the recursive calls in the `meiro` function with an iterative approach using a stack.
   - Create an empty stack to store the positions to be visited.
   - Push the starting position onto the stack.
   - While the stack is not empty:
     - Pop a position from the stack.
     - If the popped position is the ending position, return.
     - If the color of the popped position is not equal to the target color, continue to the next iteration.
     - Mark the popped position as visited by setting its color to -1.
     - Push the neighboring positions onto the stack if they are within the maze boundaries and have the same color as the starting position.

4. Update the `main` function to use the optimized `meiro` function:
   - Replace the call to `meiro` with the optimized version.
   - Update the condition to check if the ending position is reachable using `maze[xg * (H+2) + yg]`.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

void meiro(int W, int H, int c, int* maze) {
  stack<pair<int, int>> positions;
  positions.push({W, H});

  int width = H + 2;
  int targetColor = maze[W * width + H];

  while (!positions.empty()) {
    auto [x, y] = positions.top();
    positions.pop();

    if (x < 0 || x >= W || y < 0 || y >= H) {
      continue;
    }

    if (maze[x * width + y] != targetColor) {
      continue;
    }

    maze[x * width + y] = -1;

    positions.push({x - 1, y});
    positions.push({x, y + 1});
    positions.push({x + 1, y});
    positions.push({x, y - 1});
  }
}

int main() {
  while (true) {
    int w, h;
    cin >> w >> h;
    if (w == 0 && h == 0) {
      break;
    }

    int* maze = new int[(w + 2) * (h + 2)]();

    int xs, ys, xg, yg;
    cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int c, d, x, y;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
      if (d == 0) {
        for (int j = x; j < x + 4; j++) {
          for (int k = y; k < y + 2; k++) {
            maze[j * (h + 2) + k] = c;
          }
        }
      } else {
        for (int j = x; j < x + 2; j++) {
          for (int k = y; k < y + 4; k++) {
            maze[j * (h + 2) + k] = c;
          }
        }
      }
    }

    meiro(xs, ys, maze[xs * (h + 2) + ys], maze);

    if (maze[xg * (h + 2) + yg] == -1) {
      cout << "OK" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "NG" << endl;
    }

    delete[] maze;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimized code has been modified to use dynamic memory allocation for the `maze` array to avoid stack overflow for large maze sizes. The memory is freed using `delete[]` at the end of each test case.
