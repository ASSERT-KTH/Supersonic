The given code appears to be solving a maze problem. It uses a recursive function `meiro` to explore the maze and mark visited cells with a value of -1. The goal is to determine if the destination cell is reachable from the starting cell.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Memory Usage: The array `C` has a fixed size of 102x102, but the actual maze dimensions are much smaller. This leads to inefficient memory usage and unnecessary computations.

2. Redundant Computations: The recursive function `meiro` is called multiple times for the same cell. This can lead to redundant computations and unnecessary function calls.

3. Lack of Compiler Optimizations: The code does not utilize any compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler for potential optimizations.

Now, let's define an optimization strategy to address these issues and improve the performance of the code.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use Dynamic Memory Allocation: Instead of using a fixed-size array `C`, allocate memory dynamically based on the maze dimensions provided as input. This will reduce memory usage and eliminate unnecessary computations.

2. Optimize Recursive Function: Modify the `meiro` function to avoid redundant computations and unnecessary function calls. This can be achieved by adding a base case to terminate the recursion when the current cell has already been visited. Additionally, we can use a loop instead of recursion to explore neighboring cells.

3. Compiler Optimizations: Enable compiler optimizations by using the appropriate compiler flags or pragma directives. This will allow the compiler to apply various optimizations, such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and instruction reordering.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step by step.
