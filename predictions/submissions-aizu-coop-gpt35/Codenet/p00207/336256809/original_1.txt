Code Analysis:
- The code is solving a maze problem using recursive backtracking.
- The maze is represented by a 2D array `C`, where each cell stores a color value.
- The function `meiro` is used to recursively explore the maze and change the color of cells.
- The main function reads the maze dimensions, the starting and ending positions, and the color values of cells.
- The code initializes the maze with a color value of 10.
- The code then checks if the ending position is reachable from the starting position by recursively exploring the maze and changing the color of cells.
- Finally, the code outputs "OK" if the ending position is reachable and "NG" otherwise.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. Recursive Backtracking: The recursive backtracking algorithm used in the `meiro` function can be inefficient for large mazes. Each recursive call creates a new stack frame, which can consume a significant amount of memory and slow down the program.
2. Unnecessary Initialization: The code initializes the entire `C` array with a color value of 10 before processing each test case. This is unnecessary since the array is immediately overwritten with the actual color values of cells.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace Recursive Backtracking with an Iterative Approach: Instead of using recursion, we can use an iterative approach to explore the maze. This will eliminate the overhead of recursive function calls and improve performance.
2. Remove Unnecessary Array Initialization: We can remove the unnecessary initialization of the `C` array since it is immediately overwritten with the actual color values.
3. Optimize Loop Bounds: The loops used to iterate over the `C` array have fixed bounds of 102. We can optimize these bounds to match the actual size of the maze, reducing unnecessary iterations.
4. Use Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and inline functions, to further improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace Recursive Backtracking with an Iterative Approach:
   - Instead of using recursion, we can use a stack-based iterative approach to explore the maze.
   - We can create a stack to store the positions to be explored.
   - We start by pushing the starting position onto the stack.
   - While the stack is not empty, we pop a position from the stack and explore its neighbors.
   - If a neighbor has the same color as the starting position, we push it onto the stack and mark it as visited by changing its color.
   - We repeat this process until the stack is empty or we reach the ending position.
   - This iterative approach eliminates the overhead of recursive function calls and improves performance.
   
2. Remove Unnecessary Array Initialization:
   - We can remove the loop that initializes the `C` array with a color value of 10.
   - Since the array is immediately overwritten with the actual color values, this initialization is unnecessary and can be safely removed.
   
3. Optimize Loop Bounds:
   - The loops used to iterate over the `C` array have fixed bounds of 102.
   - We can optimize these bounds by using the actual size of the maze.
   - We can modify the loop bounds to match the dimensions of the maze, reducing unnecessary iterations and improving performance.
   
4. Use Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations to further improve performance.
   - We can enable loop unrolling and inline functions using compiler flags or pragma directives.
   - Loop unrolling can reduce loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.
   - Inlining functions can eliminate function call overhead and enable additional compiler optimizations.

        meiro(xs, ys, C[xs][ys]);
