The provided code is a recursive implementation of a maze-solving algorithm. It takes input for the width and height of the maze, the starting and ending points, and the number of obstacles in the maze. It then marks the cells in the maze where obstacles are present and attempts to find a path from the starting point to the ending point. If a path is found, it outputs "OK"; otherwise, it outputs "NG".

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Inefficient memory usage: The maze is represented using a 2D array `C` of size 102x102. However, the actual maze size is determined by the input values of `w` and `h`. Using a fixed-size array wastes memory and may lead to out-of-bounds access if the input values exceed 102. It would be more efficient to dynamically allocate memory for the maze based on the input dimensions.

2. Redundant computations: The recursive `meiro` function performs redundant computations by repeatedly visiting cells that have already been visited. This can be optimized by introducing a visited array to keep track of the visited cells and avoid revisiting them.

3. Compiler optimizations: The code can benefit from compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling and inline function expansion. By providing hints to the compiler, we can potentially achieve better performance.
