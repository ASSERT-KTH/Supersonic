Analysis:
- The program reads an integer `e` from the input until `e` becomes zero.
- For each value of `e`, the program calculates the minimum sum of three numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` such that `x^2 + y^2 + z^3 = e`.
- The program uses a brute force approach to find the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` that satisfy the equation.
- The program calculates the sum `x + y + z` for each combination of `x`, `y`, and `z` and keeps track of the minimum sum found so far.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program currently calculates `z * z * z` multiple times in the inner loop. This calculation can be moved outside the loop since the value of `z` remains constant within the loop.
2. Reduce the number of iterations: The program currently iterates over all possible values of `x`, `y`, and `z` from 0 to `e`. However, it can be observed that `x` will always be positive, so we can start the loop for `x` from 1 instead of 0.
3. Avoid unnecessary variable assignments: The program assigns the value of `e - (y * y + z * z * z)` to `x` in every iteration of the inner loop. This assignment can be moved outside the loop since the value of `x` remains constant within the loop.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Move the calculation of `z * z * z` outside the inner loop.
2. Start the loop for `x` from 1 instead of 0.
3. Move the assignment of `x` outside the inner loop.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Move the calculation of `z * z * z` outside the inner loop:
   - Replace the calculation `y * y + z * z * z` with a variable `sum` before the inner loop.
   - Replace the condition `y * y + z * z * z <= e` in the inner loop with `sum <= e`.
   - Update the `ans` calculation to use `sum` instead of `y * y + z * z * z`.

2. Start the loop for `x` from 1 instead of 0:
   - Change the initialization of `x` in the inner loop from `int x = e - (y * y + z * z * z);` to `int x = e - sum;`.
   - Update the condition for the inner loop to `x >= 0`.

3. Move the assignment of `x` outside the inner loop:
   - Move the line `int x = e - sum;` before the inner loop.

Optimized Code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int inf = 1000000000;

int main() {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int ans = inf;
    for (int z = 0; z * z * z <= e; ++z) {
      int sum = z * z * z;
      for (int y = 0; sum <= e; ++y) {
        int x = e - sum;
        ans = min(ans, x + y + z);
        sum += y * y + 3 * z * z;
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates unnecessary calculations and reduces the number of iterations, resulting in improved performance. The changes made are minimal and preserve the functionality and output of the original code.
