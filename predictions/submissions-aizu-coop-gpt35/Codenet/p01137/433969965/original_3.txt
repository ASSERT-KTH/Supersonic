Code Analysis:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files. The inclusion of `<bits/stdc++.h>` pulls in the entire C++ standard library, which can significantly increase compilation times. It is better to include only the necessary header files.

2. The code uses macros for looping (`rep`, `REP`, `rer`, `each`). While macros can be convenient for shortening code, they can also make the code more difficult to read and debug. It is better to replace these macros with standard loop constructs.

3. The code uses the `pow` function to calculate the cube of `z`. However, `pow` is a generic function that works for floating-point numbers and may be slower compared to a simple multiplication. Since `z` is an integer, it is more efficient to use `z*z*z` instead.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the inclusion of `<bits/stdc++.h>` and include only the necessary header files (`<iostream>` and `<vector>`).

2. Replace macros with standard loop constructs: Replace the macros `rep`, `REP`, `rer`, and `each` with standard loop constructs (`for` loop and range-based `for` loop).

3. Replace `pow` with multiplication: Replace `pow(z, 3)` with `z*z*z`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and include only the necessary header files (`<iostream>` and `<vector>`).

2. Replace macros with standard loop constructs:
   - Replace `rep(i, n)` with `for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)`.
   - Replace `REP(i, a, b)` with `for (int i = a; i < b; ++i)`.
   - Replace `rer(i, a, b)` with `for (int i = a; i <= b; ++i)`.
   - Replace `each(i, c)` with `for (auto i = c.begin(); i != c.end(); ++i)`.

3. Replace `pow` with multiplication:
   - Replace `z = pow(z, 3)` with `z = z * z * z`.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef vector<int> vi;

int main() {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int ans = inf;
    for (int z = 0; z * z * z <= e; ++z) {
      for (int y = 0; y * y + z * z * z <= e; ++y) {
        int x = e - (y * y + z * z * z);
        ans = min(ans, x + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: Since the original code does not define the constant `inf`, it is not clear where it is coming from. You may need to provide the definition of `inf` or modify the code accordingly.
