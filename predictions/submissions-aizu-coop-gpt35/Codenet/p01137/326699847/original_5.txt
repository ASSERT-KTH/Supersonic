The given code calculates the minimum number of operations required to express a given number `e` as the sum of cubes of three non-negative integers (`x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = e`). The code uses nested loops to iterate through possible values of `z`, `y`, and `x`, and calculates the sum of cubes for each combination. It then finds the minimum value of `m` that satisfies the given condition.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary calculations by identifying redundant computations.
2. Optimize the loops to reduce the number of iterations.
3. Optimize the data structures used to store intermediate values.
4. Use compiler optimizations to improve performance.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step optimization process.
