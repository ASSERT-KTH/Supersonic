The given code calculates the minimum number of steps required to reach a given number `e` by adding cubes and squares of numbers. The code uses nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of `z`, `y`, and `x` values to find the minimum number of steps.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. The use of the `sqrt` function inside the loop for `y` calculation can be computationally expensive. Since the value of `e - val` remains constant within each iteration of the outer loop, we can calculate it outside the loop and store it in a variable.

2. The `min` function is called multiple times within the inner loop, which can be avoided by using a temporary variable to track the minimum value.

3. The use of the `continue` statement can be avoided by restructuring the loops.

4. The inclusion of unnecessary headers can be removed to reduce compile time and memory usage.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Calculate `e - val` outside the inner loop and store it in a variable `diff`.

2. Initialize `m` with a large value outside the outer loop.

3. Instead of using the `continue` statement, restructure the loops to avoid unnecessary iterations.

4. Remove unnecessary headers.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail and update the code accordingly.
