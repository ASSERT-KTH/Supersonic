Code Analysis:

1. The code includes a lot of unnecessary header files. Only the necessary header files should be included to reduce compilation time and improve performance.

2. The code includes several typedefs and defines, which can make the code harder to read and understand. It would be better to avoid excessive use of typedef and defines and use explicit types and constants instead.

3. The code defines a class `P` which represents a point in 2D space. However, the class does not have any methods or member variables. It would be more efficient to use a simple struct instead of a class for representing points.

4. The code defines several functions that operate on points and vectors, such as `dot`, `cross`, and `ccw`. These functions are currently defined as standalone functions. It would be more efficient to define them as member functions of the `P` struct, as this would reduce the number of function calls and improve cache locality.

5. The code uses a lot of unnecessary copying of objects, such as passing points and vectors by value instead of by const reference. This can lead to unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations, resulting in decreased performance. It would be more efficient to pass objects by const reference to avoid unnecessary copying.

6. The code uses a vector to represent a polygon. However, the code does not make use of any of the vector's dynamic resizing capabilities. It would be more efficient to use a fixed-size array to represent the polygon, as the size of the polygon is known at compile time.

7. The code uses a brute-force approach to check if a polygon is simple, which has a time complexity of O(n^3). This can be optimized to O(n^2) by avoiding unnecessary checks.

8. The code uses a brute-force approach to check if a point is inside a polygon, which has a time complexity of O(n). This can be optimized to O(log n) using a binary search algorithm.

9. The code uses a sorting algorithm to find the points with the smallest x-coordinate. This can be optimized to O(n) using a linear scan algorithm.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary header files `bits/stdc++.h` and `cassert`.

2. Replace typedefs and defines: Replace the typedefs and defines with explicit types and constants.

3. Replace class with struct: Replace the class `P` with a struct.

4. Define member functions for point operations: Define member functions for point operations such as `dot`, `cross`, and `ccw`.

5. Pass objects by const reference: Modify function signatures to pass objects by const reference instead of by value.

6. Use a fixed-size array for the polygon: Replace the vector with a fixed-size array to represent the polygon.

7. Optimize the isSimple function: Optimize the isSimple function to reduce the time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2).

8. Optimize the isPointInsidePolygon function: Optimize the isPointInsidePolygon function to reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

9. Optimize the convex_hull function: Optimize the convex_hull function to reduce the time complexity from O(n log n) to O(n).

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary header files `bits/stdc++.h` and `cassert`. These headers are not needed in the code.

2. Replace typedefs and defines: Replace the typedefs and defines with explicit types and constants. For example, replace `typedef long long ll;` with `using ll = long long;` and replace `#define rep(i, n) for (ll i = 0; i < (ll)(n); i++)` with `#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(n); i++)`.

3. Replace class with struct: Replace the class `P` with a struct. Since the class does not have any methods or member variables, it can be replaced with a simpler struct.

4. Define member functions for point operations: Define member functions for point operations such as `dot`, `cross`, and `ccw`. For example, add the following member functions to the `P` struct:

```cpp
double dot(const P& p) const {
  return x * p.x + y * p.y;
}

double cross(const P& p) const {
  return x * p.y - y * p.x;
}

int ccw(const P& p1, const P& p2) const {
  double c = cross(p1, p2);
  if (c > EPS) return 1;
  if (c < -EPS) return -1;
  if (dot(p1, p2) < -EPS) return 2;
  if (norm() < p2.norm()) return -2;
  return 0;
}
```

5. Pass objects by const reference: Modify function signatures to pass objects by const reference instead of by value. For example, modify the `distance_l_p` function signature to `double distance_l_p(const L& l, const P& p)`.

6. Use a fixed-size array for the polygon: Replace the vector with a fixed-size array to represent the polygon. Replace the line `typedef vector<P> Polygon;` with `using Polygon = array<P, MAX_N>;`. Replace all instances of `vector<P>` with `Polygon`.

7. Optimize the isSimple function: Optimize the isSimple function to reduce the time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2). The current implementation checks for intersection between all pairs of line segments, leading to unnecessary checks. Instead, we can iterate over all pairs of consecutive line segments and check for intersection. If any intersection is found, the polygon is not simple. Modify the isSimple function as follows:

```cpp
bool isSimple(const Polygon& pol) {
  int pol_size = pol.size() - 1;
  rep(i, pol_size) {
    int j = (i + 1) % pol_size;
    for (int k = i + 2; k < pol_size; k++) {
      int l = (k + 1) % pol_size;
      if (intersect(pol[i], pol[j], pol[k], pol[l]))
        return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```

8. Optimize the isPointInsidePolygon function: Optimize the isPointInsidePolygon function to reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n). The current implementation checks the cross product between each line segment and the point, and counts the number of positive cross products. Instead, we can use a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first line segment that the point is to the right of. If the index is even, the point is inside the polygon. Modify the isPointInsidePolygon function as follows:

```cpp
bool isPointInsidePolygon(const vector<L>& side, const P& p) {
  int low = 0, high = side.size();
  while (high - low > 1) {
    int mid = (low + high) / 2;
    if (cross(side[mid].p2 - side[mid].p1, p - side[mid].p1) > 0)
      low = mid;
    else
      high = mid;
  }
  return low % side.size() == 0;
}
```

9. Optimize the convex_hull function: Optimize the convex_hull function to reduce the time complexity from O(n log n) to O(n). The current implementation uses the Graham's scan algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). Instead, we can use a linear scan algorithm to find the points with the smallest x-coordinate and construct the convex hull in a single pass. Modify the convex_hull function as follows:

```cpp
Polygon convex_hull(const P* ps, int n) {
  int k = 0;
  Polygon qs;
  rep(i, n) {
    while (k > 1 && (qs[k - 1] - qs[k - 2]).cross(ps[i] - qs[k - 1]) <= 0)
      k--;
    qs[k++] = ps[i];
  }
  for (int i = n - 2, t = k; i >= 0; i--) {
    while (k > t && (qs[k - 1] - qs[k - 2]).cross(ps[i] - qs[k - 1]) <= 0)
      k--;
    qs[k++] = ps[i];
  }
  qs.resize(k - 1);
  return qs;
}
```
