### Code Analysis

The code is an implementation of the Graham's scan algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points. The algorithm takes a set of `N` points as input and outputs the number of points that are not on the convex hull.

The code defines several data structures and functions for performing geometric calculations, such as computing the cross product, checking if two line segments intersect, checking if a point is inside a polygon, and finding the distance between a line and a point.

The main function reads the number of points `N` from the input, then reads `N` points and stores them in an array of `P` objects. It then calls the `convex_hull` function to compute the convex hull of the points, and finally prints the difference between `N` and the number of points in the convex hull.

### Optimization Strategy

To optimize the code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and copies.
2. Reduce the number of function calls and calculations.
3. Use more efficient algorithms and data structures where applicable.
4. Enable compiler optimizations.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes unnecessary headers such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<cassert>`. We can remove these includes as they are not used in the code.

2. Replace `typedef` with `using` aliases: Instead of using `typedef` to define type aliases, we can use the simpler and more readable `using` syntax. For example, `typedef long long ll;` can be replaced with `using ll = long long;`.

3. Remove unnecessary functions and data structures: The code defines several data structures and functions that are not used. We can remove the unused structures such as `C` and `L` and the unused functions such as `isSimple` and `isPointInsidePolygon`.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations in `ccw` function: The `ccw` function calculates the cross product and dot product of vectors `a` and `b` multiple times. We can optimize this by calculating these values only once and storing them in variables.

5. Use more efficient algorithms for sorting and convex hull computation: The code currently uses `std::sort` for sorting the points and the Graham's scan algorithm for computing the convex hull. We can replace these with more efficient algorithms such as quicksort for sorting and the Jarvis march algorithm for computing the convex hull.

6. Enable compiler optimizations: We can enable compiler optimizations by using appropriate compiler flags or pragma directives. This can help the compiler generate more efficient machine code.
