After analyzing the provided code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant calculations: There are a few instances where the same calculations are being performed multiple times, such as in the `distance_l_p` and `isPointInsidePolygon` functions. These calculations can be optimized by storing the results in variables and reusing them instead of recalculating each time.

2. Inefficient data structures: The code currently uses a vector to store the convex hull points. However, the size of the vector is initialized to `n * 2`, which is much larger than needed. This can lead to unnecessary memory usage. We can optimize this by resizing the vector to the correct size after constructing the convex hull.

3. Inefficient loop iteration: The `isSimple` function contains a nested loop that iterates over the polygon points. This can be optimized by changing the loop conditions to avoid unnecessary iterations.

4. Unused header files: The code includes the `<cassert>` header file, but there are no assertions being used in the code. This header file can be removed to improve compilation time.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace redundant calculations with variable assignments to avoid unnecessary computations.
2. Optimize the data structure by resizing the vector to the correct size after constructing the convex hull.
3. Optimize the loop conditions in the `isSimple` function to avoid unnecessary iterations.
4. Remove the unused `<cassert>` header file.

I will now provide a step-by-step explanation of each optimization and present the optimized code block.
