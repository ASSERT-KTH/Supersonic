Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage:
   - The `Mat` variable is a 2D vector that stores integers. However, since the values are only accessed individually, it would be more memory-efficient to use a 1D vector instead.
   - The `used` variable is a 2D vector that stores boolean values. However, since the values are only accessed individually, it would be more memory-efficient to use a 1D vector instead.

2. Redundant Computation:
   - The `dx` and `dy` arrays are used to calculate the next coordinates in the DFS algorithm. Since the values in these arrays are constant, they can be declared as `const` to improve code clarity and potentially enable compiler optimizations.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The `starts` vector is sorted in descending order using `std::sort`. However, we can optimize this sorting step by using a partial sort with a custom comparator. This will only sort the necessary elements, which can potentially save time.

4. Compiler Optimization:
   - Adding compiler optimizations can improve the performance of the code. For example, using compiler-specific pragma directives such as `#pragma GCC optimize` or `#pragma clang optimize` can hint the compiler to optimize the critical sections of the code.

Now, let's proceed with step-by-step optimization of the code.
