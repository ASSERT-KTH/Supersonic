The provided code calculates the number of permutations that can be made from a given set of words, after a certain number of swaps. The code uses a factorial array to calculate factorials modulo a large number, and a map to keep track of the number of "bubbles" in the sorted word array.

However, there are several areas of improvement in the code that can lead to better performance and reduced memory usage:

1. Redundant Factorial Calculation: The code calculates the factorial of each number from 1 to 100,000. However, this is unnecessary because the factorial array is only used up to N-1, where N is the number of words. We can optimize this by calculating the factorial for only the required numbers (from 1 to N-1) instead of 1 to 100,000.

2. Unnecessary Memory Allocation: The code allocates memory for the `word` array with a fixed size of 100,000. However, the actual size required is determined by the value of N. Allocating memory for a larger array than necessary wastes memory.

3. Inefficient Swap Operation: The code uses a temporary variable to swap two elements in the `word` array. However, this can be optimized by using the `std::swap` function, which is more efficient.

4. Inefficient Map Usage: The code uses a map to store the number of bubbles for each word. However, since the words are sorted, we can optimize this by using a simple array to store the bubble count for each word.

5. Redundant Modulo Operation: The code uses the modulo operator `%` in each iteration of the factorial calculation. Instead, we can optimize this by performing the modulo operation only after the entire factorial calculation is complete.
