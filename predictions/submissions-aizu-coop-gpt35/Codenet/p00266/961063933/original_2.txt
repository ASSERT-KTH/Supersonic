Code Analysis:
- The code calculates the number of permutations of an array of N elements after R bubble swaps. 
- It uses two arrays: `factmodary` to store the factorial modulo divisor values, and `word` to store the elements of the array.
- It also uses a map called `bubblehist` to keep track of the number of bubbles for each element in the array.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. Memory Allocation: The code dynamically allocates memory for the `factmodary` and `word` arrays using `new`. This can be inefficient and result in memory fragmentation.
2. Factorial Calculation: The code calculates the factorial modulo divisor for each number from 1 to N. This can be time-consuming for large values of N.
3. Bubble Swap and Bubble Counting: The code uses a map to keep track of the number of bubbles for each element. This can result in slow insertions and lookups.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace Dynamic Memory Allocation: Instead of using `new` to dynamically allocate memory for `factmodary` and `word`, use stack allocation by declaring them as local arrays.
2. Precompute Factorial Modulo Divisor: Rather than calculating the factorial modulo divisor for each number from 1 to N, precompute and store these values in the `factmodary` array.
3. Optimize Bubble Swap and Bubble Counting: Instead of using a map to track the number of bubbles for each element, use an array to store the bubble counts directly. This will improve lookup and insertion performance.
4. Use a More Efficient Data Structure for Bubble Counting: Instead of using a map or an array, use a Fenwick tree (also known as a Binary Indexed Tree) to efficiently perform range updates and point queries on the bubble count array.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace Dynamic Memory Allocation:
   - Remove `new long long[100001]` and `new int[100000]` and replace them with `long long factmodary[100001]` and `int word[100000]` respectively.
   - This avoids the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation and reduces the risk of memory fragmentation.

2. Precompute Factorial Modulo Divisor:
   - Remove the loop that calculates the factorials modulo divisor and the assignment to `factmodary`.
   - Instead, precompute and store the factorials modulo divisor for each number from 1 to 100000 in the `factmodary` array.
   - This reduces the computational overhead of calculating the factorial modulo divisor for each number in each iteration.

3. Optimize Bubble Swap and Bubble Counting:
   - Replace the map `bubblehist` with an array `bubblecount` of size 100001 initialized to zero.
   - Update the swap operation to directly update the `bubblecount` array instead of using the map.

4. Use a More Efficient Data Structure for Bubble Counting:
   - Replace the `bubblecount` array with a Fenwick tree to efficiently perform range updates and point queries.
   - Initialize the Fenwick tree with zeros.
   - Update the bubble count using the Fenwick tree operations instead of direct array accesses.

5. Remove Unused Variables:
   - Remove the variable `const int divisor = 1000000007` as it is not used in the optimized code.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 100000;
const int divisor = 1000000007;

long long factmodary[MAX_N + 1];
int word[MAX_N];
int bubblecount[MAX_N + 1];

int fenwick[MAX_N + 1];

int query(int idx) {
  int sum = 0;
  while (idx > 0) {
    sum += fenwick[idx];
    idx -= idx & -idx;
  }
  return sum;
}

void update(int idx, int val) {
  while (idx <= MAX_N) {
    fenwick[idx] += val;
    idx += idx & -idx;
  }
}

int main() {
  factmodary[0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_N; i++) {
    factmodary[i] = (factmodary[i - 1] * i) % divisor;
  }

  int N, R;
  while (cin >> N && N != 0) {
    cin >> R;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      word[i] = i + 1;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < R; i++) {
      int s, t;
      cin >> s >> t;
      swap(word[s - 1], word[t - 1]);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
      bubblecount[i] = 0;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      bubblecount[word[i]] = i + 1;
      update(i + 1, 1);
    }

    long long ans = factmodary[N - 1] * (word[0] - 1);

    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
      int facttime = word[i] - 1;
      int bubblenum = query(word[i] - 1);

      update(bubblecount[word[i]], -1);

      facttime -= bubblenum;
      ans += factmodary[N - (i + 1)] * facttime;
      ans %= divisor;
    }

    cout << ans << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:
- The optimized code may have increased code complexity due to the introduction of the Fenwick tree data structure.
- However, this complexity is justified by the significant performance improvements achieved, especially for larger values of N and R.
