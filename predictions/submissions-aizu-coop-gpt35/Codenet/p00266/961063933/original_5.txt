This code calculates a specific value for each input case using the Bubble Sort algorithm. The algorithm is used to count the number of inversions in an array. The code stores the factorial modulo divisor values in an array and uses them to calculate the final result.

Here are some potential optimizations that can be made to improve the performance of this code:

1. Remove unnecessary memory allocations: The code allocates memory for two arrays, `factmodary` and `word`, using the `new` operator. However, the size of these arrays (`100001` and `100000`, respectively) is constant. Instead of dynamically allocating memory, we can use static arrays or stack-allocated arrays.

2. Pre-compute and store the factorial modulo divisor values: The code calculates the factorial modulo divisor values for each iteration of the outer loop. This can be optimized by pre-computing these values and storing them in an array before the loop. This way, we can access the pre-computed values directly, eliminating the need for repeated calculations.

3. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code calculates the factorial modulo divisor values for `N - 1` and `N - (i + 1)` in each iteration of the loop. However, these values can be calculated only once and stored in variables before the loop. This avoids redundant calculations and improves performance.

4. Optimize the inner loop: The inner loop is used to update the `bubblehist` map and increment the values. However, instead of using a map, we can use an array to store the values. This avoids the overhead of map operations and improves performance.

5. Use a more efficient modulo operation: The code uses the modulo operator `%` to calculate the factorial modulo divisor values. However, the modulo operation can be expensive. We can use a more efficient approach, such as using bitwise operations for powers of 2 or dividing by a constant divisor.

6. Utilize compiler optimizations: We can use compiler-specific optimizations, such as loop unrolling, vectorization, or pragma directives, to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. These optimizations can vary depending on the compiler being used.

Now, let's apply these optimizations step by step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
using namespace std;

const int divisor = 1000000007;
const int maxN = 100000;

// Pre-compute and store the factorial modulo divisor values
array<long long, maxN + 1> factmodary;

// Pre-compute and store the values for N - 1 and N - (i + 1)
array<long long, maxN + 1> factmodaryNMinus1;
array<long long, maxN + 1> factmodaryNMinusIPlus1;

void precomputeFactorialModulo() {
  long long fact = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= maxN; i++) {
    fact *= i;
    fact %= divisor;
    factmodary[i] = fact;
    factmodaryNMinus1[i] = factmodary[i - 1];
    factmodaryNMinusIPlus1[i] = factmodary[maxN - i];
  }
}

int main() {
  precomputeFactorialModulo();

  // Use stack-allocated arrays instead of dynamic allocation
  int word[maxN]{0};

  for (;;) {
    int N, R;
    cin >> N;
    if (N == 0)
      break;
    cin >> R;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
      word[i] = i + 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < R; i++) {
      int s, t;
      cin >> s >> t;
      int tmp = word[s - 1];
      word[s - 1] = word[t - 1];
      word[t - 1] = tmp;
    }

    // Use a stack-allocated array instead of a map
    array<int, maxN> bubblehist{};
    bubblehist[word[0]] = 0;

    long long ans = factmodaryNMinus1[N - 1] * (word[0] - 1) % divisor;

    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
      int facttime = word[i] - 1;
      int bubblenum = 0;
      for (int j = 1; j < word[i]; j++) {
        bubblenum += bubblehist[j];
      }
      bubblehist[word[i]]++;
      for (int j = word[i] + 1; j <= N; j++) {
        bubblehist[j]++;
      }
      facttime -= bubblenum;
      ans += factmodaryNMinusIPlus1[i] * facttime % divisor;
      ans %= divisor;
    }
    cout << static_cast<int>(ans) << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have made several changes:

1. Pre-computed the factorial modulo divisor values and stored them in `factmodary`. We also pre-computed the values for `N - 1` and `N - (i + 1)` and stored them in `factmodaryNMinus1` and `factmodaryNMinusIPlus1`, respectively.

2. Replaced the dynamic memory allocation with stack-allocated arrays for `word` and `bubblehist`.

3. Removed the map `bubblehist` and replaced it with a stack-allocated array `bubblehist` to store the values. We calculate the `bubblenum` by iterating through the elements before `word[i]`.

4. Removed the unnecessary modulo operation in the factorial calculation by using `% divisor` only once.

These optimizations aim to improve performance by reducing unnecessary memory allocations, eliminating redundant calculations, and using more efficient data structures.
