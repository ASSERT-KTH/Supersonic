Code Analysis:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files. The `map` container is not used, so the `<map>` header can be removed.

2. The code uses dynamic memory allocation with `new` to create arrays `factmodary` and `word`. However, there is no corresponding `delete` statement to free the allocated memory. This can lead to memory leaks.

3. The code calculates factorials and stores them in the `factmodary` array. However, it doesn't make use of the pre-calculated factorials and recalculates them in each iteration of the main loop. This is inefficient and can be optimized.

4. The code uses a `map` to maintain a histogram of bubble positions. However, it is not necessary to use a `map` for this purpose. A simpler data structure can be used to achieve the same functionality.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `<map>` header is not required and can be removed.

2. Fix memory leaks: Add `delete[]` statements to free the memory allocated for `factmodary` and `word` arrays.

3. Optimize factorial calculations: Instead of calculating factorials in each iteration, we can pre-calculate them once and store them in the `factmodary` array.

4. Replace `map` with a simpler data structure: Instead of using a `map` to maintain a histogram of bubble positions, we can use a simple array to achieve the same functionality.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the line `#include <map>` since the `map` container is not used.

2. Fix memory leaks: Add `delete[]` statements before the `return 0;` statement to free the memory allocated for `factmodary` and `word` arrays.

3. Optimize factorial calculations: Before the main loop, calculate the factorials and store them in the `factmodary` array. This eliminates the need to calculate factorials in each iteration.

4. Replace `map` with a simpler data structure: Replace the `map<int, int> bubblehist` declaration with an `int` array `bubblehist` of size `N+1`. Initialize all elements of `bubblehist` to 0 before the main loop. Instead of using `bubblehist[word[i]]`, use `bubblehist[word[i]-1]` to access and update the histogram.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
const int divisor = 1000000007;

int main() {
  long long *factmodary = new long long[100001];
  long long fact = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 100000; i++) {
    fact *= i;
    fact %= divisor;
    factmodary[i] = fact;
  }

  int *word = new int[100000]{0};
  for (;;) {
    int N, R;
    cin >> N;
    if (N == 0)
      break;
    cin >> R;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
      word[i] = i + 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < R; i++) {
      int s, t;
      cin >> s >> t;
      int tmp = word[s - 1];
      word[s - 1] = word[t - 1];
      word[t - 1] = tmp;
    }
    int *bubblehist = new int[N + 1]{0};
    long long ans = factmodary[N - 1] * (word[0] - 1);
    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
      int facttime = word[i] - 1;
      int bubblenum = bubblehist[word[i] - 1];
      bubblehist[word[i] - 1]++;
      for (int j = word[i]; j <= N; j++)
        bubblehist[j]++;
      facttime -= bubblenum;
      ans += factmodary[N - (i + 1)] * facttime;
      ans %= divisor;
    }
    cout << (int)ans << "\n";
    delete[] bubblehist;
  }
  delete[] word;
  delete[] factmodary;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates unnecessary header files, fixes memory leaks, pre-calculates factorials, and replaces the `map` with a simpler data structure. It preserves the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance and reducing memory usage.
