Code Analysis:
1. The code calculates factorial modulo divisor for numbers from 1 to 100000.
2. It then reads input values for N and R in a loop until N is 0.
3. For each input, it initializes an array `word` with values from 1 to N.
4. It then performs R swaps on the `word` array based on input values.
5. It uses a map `bubblehist` to keep track of the number of inversions in the `word` array.
6. It calculates the answer by iterating over the `word` array and updating the answer based on the number of inversions and the factorial modulo values.
7. Finally, it prints the answer.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid unnecessary modulo operations during factorial calculation.
2. Use a more efficient data structure instead of the `map` to keep track of inversions.
3. Optimize the swapping of elements in the `word` array.
4. Use integer arithmetic instead of floating-point arithmetic for modulo operations.
5. Use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the answer.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use an array instead of a map to keep track of inversions.
2. Calculate the factorial modulo divisor directly without performing modulo at each step.
3. Optimize the swapping of elements in the `word` array by using a temporary variable.
4. Use integer arithmetic for modulo operations.
5. Optimize the calculation of the answer by using a more efficient algorithm.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `map<int, int> bubblehist` with an array `bubblehist` of size 100001 to keep track of inversions. Initialize all elements of `bubblehist` to 0 before each input case.
   - Rationale: Using an array instead of a map reduces memory usage and improves access time.
   - Trade-off: The array assumes that the maximum value of `word[i]` will be less than or equal to 100000. If this assumption is not valid, a different data structure may be required.

2. Calculate the factorial modulo divisor directly without performing modulo at each step.
   - Replace `fact *= i; fact %= divisor;` with `fact = (fact * i) % divisor;` in the factorial calculation loop.
   - Rationale: Performing modulo at each step reduces the risk of integer overflow and improves efficiency.
   - Trade-off: None.

3. Optimize the swapping of elements in the `word` array by using a temporary variable.
   - Replace the swapping code `int tmp = word[s - 1]; word[s - 1] = word[t - 1]; word[t - 1] = tmp;` with `std::swap(word[s - 1], word[t - 1]);`.
   - Rationale: Using `std::swap` is more efficient and readable.
   - Trade-off: None.

4. Use integer arithmetic for modulo operations.
   - Replace `(int)ans` with `ans % divisor` in the `cout` statement.
   - Rationale: Using integer arithmetic avoids unnecessary type casting and improves efficiency.
   - Trade-off: None.

5. Optimize the calculation of the answer by using a more efficient algorithm.
   - Replace the calculation loop with the following code:
   ```cpp
   long long ans = (factmodary[N - 1] * (word[0] - 1)) % divisor;
   for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
     ans += (factmodary[N - (i + 1)] * (word[i] - 1 - bubblehist[word[i]])) % divisor;
     ans %= divisor;
     bubblehist[word[i]]++;
   }
   ```
   - Rationale: By precalculating the number of inversions for each element in the `word` array, we can directly calculate the contribution of each element to the answer without iterating over the `bubblehist` map.
   - Trade-off: None.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
const int divisor = 1000000007;
int main() {
  long long *factmodary = new long long[100001];
  long long fact = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 100000; i++) {
    fact = (fact * i) % divisor;
    factmodary[i] = fact;
  }
  int *word = new int[100000]{0};
  for (;;) {
    int N, R;
    cin >> N;
    if (N == 0)
      break;
    cin >> R;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
      word[i] = i + 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < R; i++) {
      int s, t;
      cin >> s >> t;
      std::swap(word[s - 1], word[t - 1]);
    }
    int *bubblehist = new int[100001]{0};
    long long ans = (factmodary[N - 1] * (word[0] - 1)) % divisor;
    bubblehist[word[0]] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
      ans += (factmodary[N - (i + 1)] * (word[i] - 1 - bubblehist[word[i]])) % divisor;
      ans %= divisor;
      bubblehist[word[i]]++;
    }
    cout << ans << "\n";
    delete[] bubblehist;
  }
  delete[] word;
  delete[] factmodary;
  return 0;
}
```
