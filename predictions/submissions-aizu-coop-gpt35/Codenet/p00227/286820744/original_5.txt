The given code reads a sequence of input values consisting of the number of vegetables, the capacity of each bag, and the prices of the vegetables. It then sorts the prices in descending order and calculates the sum of prices, excluding every `cap`-th element. The code repeats this process until it encounters a case where the number of vegetables and the capacity are both zero.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Memory Allocation: The code creates a new vector `vegetables` in each iteration of the while loop. This incurs unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation overhead. We can avoid this by moving the `vegetables` vector outside the while loop and reusing it for each iteration.

2. Sorting: The code uses the `std::sort` function to sort the vegetables in descending order. However, the problem does not require a full sort; it only needs the highest prices. We can optimize the sorting by using a partial sort, which is more efficient.

3. Loop Optimization: The while loop that calculates the sum can be optimized. The current implementation uses the `at()` function and checks the index against the number of vegetables (`num`) in each iteration. This results in unnecessary bounds checking. We can replace `at()` with direct indexing (`[]`), and optimize the loop further.

4. Compiler Optimization: We can use compiler optimizations and pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now let's go through each optimization step in detail.

Optimization Steps:

1. Memory Allocation:
   - Move the `std::vector<int> vegetables;` declaration outside the while loop.
   - Remove the line `vegetables.clear();` as it is no longer needed.

2. Sorting:
   - Replace the line `sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());` with `std::partial_sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.begin() + cap, vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());`. This will perform a partial sort up to the `cap`-th element in descending order.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - Replace the line `sum += vegetables.at(i);` with `sum += vegetables[i];`. This avoids the bounds checking overhead of the `at()` function.
   - Replace the while loop with a for loop: `for (i = 0; i < num; i += cap + 1)`. This eliminates the need for the `(i + 1) % cap != 0` check and simplifies the loop logic.
   - Inside the for loop, update the calculation of `sum` to `sum += vegetables[i];`.

4. Compiler Optimization:
   - Add the optimization flag `-O3` when compiling the code. This enables aggressive optimization by the compiler.
   - Add the pragma directive `#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")` before the main function. This hints the compiler to unroll loops if possible.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")

int main() {
  int num, cap, price, i;
  std::vector<int> vegetables;
  
  while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }

    vegetables.resize(num);

    for (i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      std::cin >> price;
      vegetables[i] = price;
    }

    std::partial_sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.begin() + cap, vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());

    int sum = 0;

    for (i = 0; i < num; i += cap + 1) {
      sum += vegetables[i];
    }

    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  }
}
```

With these optimizations, we have reduced unnecessary memory allocations, optimized the sorting process, simplified and optimized the loop logic, and hinted the compiler to perform aggressive optimizations. These changes should result in improved performance and reduced memory usage.
