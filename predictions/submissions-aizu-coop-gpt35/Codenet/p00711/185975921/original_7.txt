The code provided is a C++ program that reads in a grid of characters and performs a depth-first search (DFS) to count the number of connected empty spaces (' ') starting from a given position marked by '@'. The program continues reading and processing grids until it encounters a grid with both height (H) and width (W) equal to zero.

Upon analyzing the code, the following optimizations can be applied:

1. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: The `using namespace std;` statement is considered bad practice as it pollutes the global namespace. Instead, it is recommended to explicitly qualify the standard library entities used in the code, e.g., `std::printf`, `std::scanf`, etc.

2. Avoid using macros: The macro `rep(i, x)` is used to define a loop with an index `i` that iterates from 0 to `x`. It is better to replace this macro with a function or a lambda expression to avoid the potential issues associated with macros.

3. Remove unnecessary or redundant variables: The variable `cnt` is used to count the number of empty spaces in the grid, but it can be eliminated by directly printing the count within the nested loop.

4. Optimize the DFS implementation: The current DFS implementation uses recursion, which can be replaced with an iterative approach using a stack. This change will reduce the function call overhead and potentially improve performance.

5. Optimize input and output operations: The current code uses `std::scanf` and `std::printf` for input and output operations. These functions are relatively slower compared to their counterparts from the `<iostream>` library. By using `std::cin` and `std::cout`, we can potentially improve the I/O performance.

6. Consider compiler optimizations: We can suggest using compiler optimization flags like `-O2` to enable level 2 optimization and `-march=native` to generate code specifically for the host machine's architecture. These optimizations can help the compiler generate more efficient machine code.

Now, let's proceed with implementing these optimizations step by step.
