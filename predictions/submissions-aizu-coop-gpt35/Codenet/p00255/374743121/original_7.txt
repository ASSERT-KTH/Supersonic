The given code appears to be a program that takes in multiple sets of input and performs some calculations on each set. However, the code is not very efficient and can be optimized in several ways. Let's analyze the code to identify potential optimizations.

1. Inefficient data structures:
   - The array `j` of size 99999 is used to store the input values, but the actual number of elements used is determined by the variable `n`. This leads to inefficient memory usage when `n` is small.
   - The variable `j` is sorted using the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` library. Since only a portion of the array `j` is used, it would be more efficient to use a different data structure.

2. Redundant computations:
   - The sum of the elements in the array `j` is calculated twice: once in the first loop and again in the second loop. This can be avoided by calculating the sum only once.

3. Optimization strategy:
   - Replace the array `j` with a more efficient data structure, such as a priority queue or a min-heap, to store the input values.
   - Calculate the sum of the elements in the input array `j` only once.
   - Use loop unrolling to optimize the loops.
   - Use compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of the optimizations.
