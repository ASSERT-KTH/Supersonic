The provided code is a C++ program that takes input from the user and performs some calculations based on the input. However, the code lacks proper variable naming and comments, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose of each section.

To optimize this code, we will focus on improving the following aspects:

1. Variable Naming and Readability: Improve the variable naming to make the code more readable and understandable.

2. Memory Usage: Reduce unnecessary memory usage by avoiding large arrays and dynamically allocating memory only when required.

3. Loop Optimization: Simplify and optimize loops to reduce redundant computations and improve performance.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Suggest compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler for better optimization.
