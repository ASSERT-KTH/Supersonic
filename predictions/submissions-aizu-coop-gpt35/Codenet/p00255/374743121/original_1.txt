The given code is a C++ program that reads multiple test cases from the standard input and performs some calculations for each test case. However, the code is not optimized and can be improved for efficiency. Let's analyze the code and identify potential areas of optimization.

1. Code Analysis:
   - There is no function declaration or return type specified for the `main` function. This should be fixed by declaring `int main()`.
   - The variable `i` is not initialized, which can lead to undefined behavior. It should be initialized to 0.
   - The array `j` has a fixed size of 99999, which may be excessive and wasteful in terms of memory usage. We can optimize this by using a dynamic array or a vector.
   - The loop `for (i = s = 0; i++ < n; s += a)` can be optimized to calculate the sum of all elements in a more efficient way.
   - The loop `for (i = n; i > 1; cin >> j[--i])` can be optimized to read elements into the array `j` directly.
   - The loop `for (sort(j + 1, j + n); n > 0; s += j[n])` can be optimized by moving the sorting operation outside the loop.
   - The variable `a` is assigned the maximum value between `n-- * s` and `a` in each iteration. This logic can be simplified and optimized.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. Replace the fixed-size array `j` with a vector to dynamically allocate memory based on the input size.
   2. Optimize the calculation of the sum of all elements in the array.
   3. Optimize the reading of elements into the array.
   4. Move the sorting operation outside the loop.
   5. Simplify and optimize the logic for updating the maximum value.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Replace the fixed-size array `j` with a vector:
      - Declare a vector `j` to replace the array `j`:
        ```cpp
        vector<long long> j(n);
        ```
   2. Optimize the calculation of the sum of all elements:
      - Replace the loop `for (i = s = 0; i++ < n; s += a)` with a single calculation:
        ```cpp
        s = accumulate(j.begin(), j.end(), 0LL);
        ```
   3. Optimize the reading of elements into the array:
      - Replace the loop `for (i = n; i > 1; cin >> j[--i])` with a loop that directly reads elements into the vector `j`:
        ```cpp
        for (i = 1; i < n; ++i)
          cin >> j[i];
        ```
   4. Move the sorting operation outside the loop:
      - Move the sorting operation `sort(j + 1, j + n);` outside the loop to avoid unnecessary sorting in each iteration.
   5. Simplify and optimize the logic for updating the maximum value:
      - Simplify the logic for updating the maximum value `a`:
        ```cpp
        a = max(n * s, a);
        ```

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  for (long long i, n, s, a; cin >> n && n != 0; cout << a << endl) {
    vector<long long> j(n);
    for (i = 1, s = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> j[i];
      s += j[i];
    }
    sort(j.begin() + 1, j.end());
    a = n * s;
    for (i = n; i > 0; --i)
      a = max(i * s + j[i], a);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code reduces memory usage by dynamically allocating memory for the array `j` based on the input size. It optimizes the sum calculation and reading of elements into the array. The sorting operation is moved outside the loop to avoid unnecessary sorting. The logic for updating the maximum value `a` is simplified and optimized.

Overall, these optimizations improve the efficiency of the code by reducing unnecessary operations and improving memory usage.
