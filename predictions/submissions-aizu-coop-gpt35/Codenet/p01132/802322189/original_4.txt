The given code appears to be a program that calculates the number of coins needed to make a certain payment amount and then determines the optimal way to give change for a given amount. The code uses nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of coins and checks if the change given is optimal based on certain conditions.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant computations: The code repeatedly computes the sum of the `c` vector and the sum of the `pay` and `ch` vectors using the `accumulate` function. These computations can be moved outside the loops to avoid redundancy.

2. Unnecessary vector copies: The `_minus` and `_plus` functions create new vectors for the results. However, these functions can be modified to directly modify the input vectors, eliminating the need for creating new vectors.

3. Inefficient data structure: The code uses a vector to represent the payment and change amounts. However, using a simpler data structure, such as an array, can potentially improve performance.

4. Inefficient loop structure: The nested loops can be optimized by using a more efficient loop structure, such as a single loop using recursion or loop unrolling.

To optimize the code, we will perform the following steps:

1. Remove redundant computations by calculating the sums of `c`, `pay`, and `ch` vectors outside the loops.

2. Modify the `_minus` and `_plus` functions to directly modify the input vectors instead of creating new vectors.

3. Replace the vector data structure with an array for the `c`, `f`, `pay`, `ans`, and `ch` variables.

4. Optimize the nested loops by using a single loop with recursion.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step by step.
