Code Analysis:
- The `payment` function calculates the total payment based on the number of each type of currency.
- The `charge` function calculates the number of each type of currency needed to make a certain amount of payment.
- The `_minus` function subtracts two vectors element-wise.
- The `_plus` function adds two vectors element-wise.
- The `judge` function checks if it is possible to make a certain amount of payment with a given number of each type of currency.
- The main function takes input for `N`, which represents the desired amount of payment, and then enters a loop.
- Inside the loop, it takes input for the number of each type of currency available (`c` vector) and calculates the total sum of available currency.
- It initializes some variables (`f`, `mini`, `pay`, `ans`) and then enters nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of payments.
- It calculates the total payment and the total number of coins used for payment.
- If the total payment is greater than or equal to `N`, it calculates the number of coins needed for change and the total number of coins in the change.
- If this combination of payment and change results in a lower total number of coins used, it updates the `ans` vector and the minimum number of coins.
- Finally, it prints the payment and change for the minimum number of coins used, updates `N` with new input, and breaks out of the loop if `N` is zero.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. The nested loops in the main function iterate over all possible combinations of payments. This can be very inefficient, especially if the number of available coins is large.
2. The `charge` function uses repeated division to calculate the number of coins needed for change. This can be time-consuming for large amounts.
3. The `payment` function and the `accumulate` function are called multiple times within the nested loops, which can be redundant and slow down the program.
4. The `judge` function is called within the nested loops, which adds additional computational overhead.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the use of `vector<int>` with a fixed-size array for the `charge`, `minus`, `plus`, `judge`, and `ans` variables. This will reduce the memory overhead of creating and copying vectors.
2. Use a more efficient algorithm for calculating the number of coins needed for change in the `charge` function. Instead of repeated division, use a loop to iterate over the available coin denominations and calculate the number of coins needed for each denomination.
3. Calculate the total payment and the total number of coins used only once before entering the nested loops. Store these values in variables to avoid redundant calculations.
4. Use a more efficient algorithm for iterating over all possible combinations of payments in the nested loops. Instead of nested loops, use a recursive function with a backtracking algorithm to generate all possible combinations.
5. Use a single loop to iterate over the `ans` vector and print the payment and change, instead of using multiple if statements.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `vector<int>` data type with a fixed-size array for the `charge`, `minus`, `plus`, `judge`, and `ans` variables. This will reduce the memory overhead of creating and copying vectors.

```cpp
int charge[4];
int minus[4];
int plus[4];
int ans[4];
```

2. Modify the `charge` function to use a more efficient algorithm for calculating the number of coins needed for change. Instead of repeated division, use a loop to iterate over the available coin denominations and calculate the number of coins needed for each denomination. This will reduce the number of divisions required.

```cpp
void charge(int m) {
  charge[3] = m / 500;
  m %= 500;
  charge[2] = m / 100;
  m %= 100;
  charge[1] = m / 50;
  m %= 50;
  charge[0] = m / 10;
}
```

3. Calculate the total payment and the total number of coins used only once before entering the nested loops. Store these values in variables to avoid redundant calculations.

```cpp
int total_payment = payment(c);
int total_coins_used = accumulate(c.begin(), c.end(), 0);
```

4. Modify the nested loops to use a recursive function with a backtracking algorithm to generate all possible combinations of payments. This will be more efficient than nested loops, especially if the number of available coins is large.

```cpp
void generatePayments(int i, int N, vector<int>& c, vector<int>& payment, int& mini, int& total_coins_used) {
  if (i == 4) {
    int m_payment = payment(payment);
    int n_payment = accumulate(payment.begin(), payment.end(), 0);
    if (m_payment >= N) {
      charge(m_payment - N);
      int n_charge = accumulate(charge, charge + 4, 0);
      if (mini > total_coins_used - n_payment + n_charge) {
        if (judge(payment, charge)) {
          copy(payment.begin(), payment.end(), ans);
          mini = total_coins_used - n_payment + n_charge;
        }
      }
    }
    return;
  }
  for (int p = 0; p <= c[i]; p++) {
    if (p > 0)
      total_coins_used++;
    payment[i] = p;
    generatePayments(i + 1, N, c, payment, mini, total_coins_used);
    total_coins_used--;
  }
}
```

5. Modify the printing of payments and change to use a single loop instead of multiple if statements.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
  if (ans[i] > 0) {
    cout << (i == 0 ? 10 : (i == 1 ? 50 : (i == 2 ? 100 : 500))) << " " << ans[i] << endl;
  }
}
```

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
using namespace std;

int payment(vector<int> p) {
  return 10 * p[0] + 50 * p[1] + 100 * p[2] + 500 * p[3];
}

void charge(int m) {
  int denominations[] = {500, 100, 50, 10};
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    charge[i] = m / denominations[i];
    m %= denominations[i];
  }
}

void generatePayments(int i, int N, vector<int>& c, vector<int>& payment, int& mini, int& total_coins_used) {
  if (i == 4) {
    int m_payment = payment(payment);
    int n_payment = accumulate(payment.begin(), payment.end(), 0);
    if (m_payment >= N) {
      charge(m_payment - N);
      int n_charge = accumulate(charge, charge + 4, 0);
      if (mini > total_coins_used - n_payment + n_charge) {
        if (judge(payment, charge)) {
          copy(payment.begin(), payment.end(), ans);
          mini = total_coins_used - n_payment + n_charge;
        }
      }
    }
    return;
  }
  for (int p = 0; p <= c[i]; p++) {
    if (p > 0)
      total_coins_used++;
    payment[i] = p;
    generatePayments(i + 1, N, c, payment, mini, total_coins_used);
    total_coins_used--;
  }
}

int main() {
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  while (1) {
    vector<int> c(4);
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      cin >> c[i];
    }
    int total_payment = payment(c);
    int total_coins_used = accumulate(c.begin(), c.end(), 0);
    int mini = 1e+9;
    vector<int> payment(4);
    generatePayments(0, N, c, payment, mini, total_coins_used);

    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      if (ans[i] > 0) {
        cout << (i == 0 ? 10 : (i == 1 ? 50 : (i == 2 ? 100 : 500))) << " " << ans[i] << endl;
      }
    }

    cin >> N;
    if (!N)
      break;
    cout << endl;
  }
}
```

The optimized code aims to improve the efficiency of the original code by addressing the potential performance bottlenecks and implementing the proposed optimization strategies.
