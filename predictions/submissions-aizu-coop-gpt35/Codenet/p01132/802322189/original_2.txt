This code appears to be solving a problem related to making payments and giving change using different denominations. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance:

1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage. Instead, include only the necessary headers such as `iostream`, `vector`, and `algorithm`.

2. Use pass-by-reference for function parameters: The `payment`, `charge`, `_minus`, and `_plus` functions currently take vector parameters by value. This means that the entire vector is copied each time the function is called, which can be inefficient for large vectors. To avoid this, pass the vectors by reference to avoid unnecessary copies.

3. Use iterators instead of indexing: The code currently uses indexing to access elements of vectors. However, using iterators can be more efficient, especially if the vectors are large. 

4. Use prefix increment operator: The code currently uses the postfix increment operator (`i++`) in the loops. However, the prefix increment operator (`++i`) can be more efficient in certain cases, as it avoids creating a temporary copy of the variable.

5. Use `reserve` for vector sizes: The code initializes vectors without specifying their sizes, which can lead to frequent reallocations and copying as elements are added. To avoid this, use the `reserve` function to preallocate memory for the vectors based on their expected sizes.

6. Avoid unnecessary computations: The code performs some unnecessary computations, such as calculating the sum of the `pay` vector multiple times within the innermost loop. Instead, calculate it once and store the result in a variable.

7. Use `constexpr` for constant values: The code uses some constants, such as `1e+9`, multiple times. Instead of recalculating the value each time, declare them as `constexpr` variables to allow the compiler to evaluate them at compile-time.

8. Use range-based for loops: The code uses nested for loops to iterate over the elements of vectors. It can be more concise and efficient to use range-based for loops, which automatically iterate over the elements of a container.

9. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The code makes unnecessary function calls, such as `accumulate` for summing the elements of vectors. Instead, use a simple loop to calculate the sum directly.

10. Use a more efficient algorithm: The current algorithm has a time complexity of O(N^4), which can be improved. Consider using a more efficient algorithm, such as dynamic programming, to reduce the time complexity.

Taking these factors into account, let's optimize the code step by step.
