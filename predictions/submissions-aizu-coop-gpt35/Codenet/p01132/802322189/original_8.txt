The given code is a program that calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount `N`. The program takes input in the following format:

```
N
c[0] c[1] c[2] c[3]
```

where `N` is the target amount and `c[0]`, `c[1]`, `c[2]`, and `c[3]` are the available quantities of coins with denominations 10, 50, 100, and 500, respectively.

The program then calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for `N` and outputs the number of coins required for each denomination.

However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized for better performance and reduced memory usage. These optimizations are discussed in the following sections.
