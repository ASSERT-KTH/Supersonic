The provided code calculates the maximum number of people that can attend a conference, given their availability for morning, lunch, and dinner sessions. However, the code can be optimized in several ways:

1. Avoid unnecessary data structures: The code currently uses three separate vectors (MORNING, LUNCH, and DINNER) to store the start and end times of each session. This is not necessary and can be replaced with a single vector to store all the session times.

2. Sort the session times: The code currently sorts the MORNING, LUNCH, and DINNER vectors separately. Instead, we can combine all the session times into a single vector and sort it once. This will reduce the number of sorting operations and improve efficiency.

3. Use binary search instead of linear search: The code currently uses a nested loop to iterate through all the session times for each combination of MORNING, LUNCH, and DINNER. Instead, we can use binary search to find the range of session times that overlap with each combination, and then count the number of attendees within that range.

4. Remove unnecessary calculations: The code currently calculates the start and end times of each session for each attendee in the loop. These calculations can be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant computations.

5. Use const references instead of passing by value: The vectors MORNING, LUNCH, and DINNER are currently passed to the sort function by value. This creates unnecessary copies of the vectors. Instead, we can pass them as const references to avoid the overhead of copying.

6. Use size_t for loop iterators: The loop iterators (a, b, c) can be changed to size_t type to avoid warnings and potential issues with negative values.
