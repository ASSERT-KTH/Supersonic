The given code is a C++ program that calculates the maximum number of people who can attend a conference given their availability for morning, lunch, and dinner sessions. The program takes the number of people attending the conference as input, followed by their availability timings. The program then calculates the maximum number of people who can attend the conference in any given session.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory usage: The current code uses a vector to store the start and end times of each session (morning, lunch, and dinner) for each person. Instead of storing the start and end times separately and sorting them individually, we can use a single data structure to store the availability intervals.

2. Avoid redundant computations: The current code uses nested loops to iterate over each possible combination of morning, lunch, and dinner timings. This results in redundant computations as the same availability intervals are checked multiple times. We can optimize this by using a more efficient algorithm.

3. Use more efficient data structures: The current code uses nested loops to iterate over the availability intervals. This results in a time complexity of O(N^3), where N is the number of people attending the conference. We can use more efficient data structures like sets or maps to reduce the time complexity.

4. Use compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and pragmas, to further improve the performance of the code.

Now, let's go through the optimization steps one by one.

Step 1: Avoid unnecessary memory usage
- Remove the vectors MORNING, LUNCH, and DINNER.
- Instead, create three sets: morningSet, lunchSet, and dinnerSet. These sets will store the unique availability intervals for each session.

Step 2: Avoid redundant computations
- Instead of using nested loops to iterate over each combination of morning, lunch, and dinner timings, we can use a more efficient algorithm.
- Initialize a variable 'ans' to 0.
- Iterate over each person's availability intervals.
  - Count the number of people whose availability intervals intersect with the current person's intervals.
  - If the count is greater than 'ans', update 'ans' with the new count.

Step 3: Use more efficient data structures
- Instead of using nested loops and linear search to find the intersecting availability intervals, we can use sets or maps for faster lookup.
- Create three maps: morningMap, lunchMap, and dinnerMap. These maps will store the availability intervals as keys and the count of people with that interval as values.

Step 4: Use compiler optimizations
- Use compiler optimizations like loop unrolling and pragmas to improve the performance of the code. This step is optional and depends on the compiler and platform.
