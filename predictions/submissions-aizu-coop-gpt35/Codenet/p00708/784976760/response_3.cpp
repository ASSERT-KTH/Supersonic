The given code appears to solve a problem related to finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency.

1. Unnecessary Data Structures: The code uses the `vector<vector<double>> v` to store the input data. However, this data structure is not necessary for solving the problem. Instead, we can use a simple array of structures to store the points and their radii.

2. Redundant Computations: The code computes the distance between two points using the Euclidean distance formula `(v[i][k] - v[j][k]) * (v[i][k] - v[j][k])`. This computation is performed twice for each pair of points, which is redundant. We can compute the distance once and store it in an array for later use.

3. Inefficient Union-Find Implementation: The current implementation of the union-find algorithm is not efficient. The `root` function uses path compression, but it does not perform union by rank. This can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) for the union operation. We can improve this by using union by rank to ensure that the smaller tree is always attached to the larger tree.

4. Sorting Optimization: The code uses the `sort` function to sort the `node` array based on the first element of each pair. However, we can optimize this by using a partial sort algorithm like `std::partial_sort` to only sort the first `n-1` elements, which is sufficient for our purposes.

5. Compiler Optimizations: We can enable compiler optimizations to help the compiler generate more efficient code. For example, we can use compiler-specific pragmas or directives to provide hints to the compiler about loop unrolling or vectorization.
