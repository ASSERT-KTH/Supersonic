The given code is an implementation of a program that calculates the minimum cost to connect all nodes in a graph. The graph consists of nodes with coordinates (x, y, z) and radii. The cost of connecting two nodes is the Euclidean distance between them minus the sum of their radii. The program uses the union-find algorithm to efficiently merge connected nodes and calculate the minimum cost.

Upon analyzing the code, here are some potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage: The program uses a large array `parent` with size M to store the parent of each node. The value of M is set to 9999, which is a fixed maximum number of nodes. However, the actual number of nodes in each test case is given by the variable `n`. Allocating a large fixed-sized array for each test case is inefficient and wastes memory.

2. Vector of Vectors: The program uses a vector of vectors `v` to store the coordinates and radii of each node. This nested data structure can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and cache performance. It would be more efficient to use a flat array or a struct to store the node data in a contiguous memory block.

3. Redundant Computation: The program calculates the Euclidean distance between pairs of nodes multiple times. This computation can be expensive, especially with the square root operation. We can optimize this by storing the squared distances instead and avoid the square root operation until necessary.

4. Unnecessary Sort: The program sorts the `node` array based on the minimum cost. However, the sorting is unnecessary for finding the minimum cost. We can optimize this by using a priority queue or a min-heap instead.

5. Compiler Optimizations: The program does not have any compiler optimizations enabled. We can suggest enabling compiler optimizations, such as optimization flags (`-O2`, `-O3`), to let the compiler perform various optimizations, including loop unrolling, inline expansion, and constant folding.

Based on these observations, here is an optimization strategy with step-by-step explanations:

1. Replace the fixed-sized array `parent` with a dynamically allocated array of size `n`. This change reduces memory usage for each test case.

2. Replace the vector of vectors `v` with a struct or a flat array to store the node data in a contiguous memory block. This change improves cache performance and reduces memory overhead.

3. Calculate and store the squared distances between pairs of nodes instead of the actual distances. This change avoids the costly square root operation until necessary.

4. Use a priority queue or a min-heap data structure instead of sorting the `node` array. This change reduces the time complexity of finding the minimum cost from O(n log n) to O(n log k), where k is the number of edges.

5. Enable compiler optimizations to leverage the compiler's capabilities in optimizing the code further.

Now, let's implement these optimizations in the code:
