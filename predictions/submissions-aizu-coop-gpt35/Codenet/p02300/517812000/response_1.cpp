The given code implements the Convex Hull algorithm using the Graham's scan method. The algorithm takes a set of points as input and computes the smallest convex polygon that encloses all the points.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Allocation: The code uses dynamic memory allocation (`new`) to create arrays `P` and `H`. This can be optimized by using `std::vector` instead, which provides automatic memory management and avoids the need for manual memory deallocation.

2. Loop Optimization: The code uses two separate loops to compute the upper and lower hulls. These loops can be combined into a single loop, thereby reducing redundant code and improving efficiency.

3. Input Validation: The code does not validate the input values. Adding input validation checks can improve the robustness of the code.

4. Unnecessary Variable Assignment: The constructor of the `Point` class assigns the parameter values to local variables `x` and `y`. This is unnecessary and can be removed.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace dynamic memory allocation with `std::vector` for `P` and `H` arrays.
2. Combine the upper and lower hull computation loops into a single loop.
3. Add input validation checks for `n` and coordinate values.
4. Remove unnecessary variable assignments in the `Point` constructor.
