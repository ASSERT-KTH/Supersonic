Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structures:
   - The code is using dynamic arrays (`Point *P` and `Point *H`) to store the input points and the convex hull, respectively. However, dynamic arrays can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and can lead to memory fragmentation. It would be more efficient to use `std::vector` instead, which provides dynamic resizing and automatic memory management.
   
2. Redundant computations:
   - In the `Point` class constructor, there are redundant assignments to the `x` and `y` variables. The constructor should directly initialize the class members, rather than creating new local variables with the same names.
   - The `direct` function is called multiple times within the inner loops. It would be more efficient to calculate the values of `(a.x - base.x)` and `(b.y - base.y)` once and store them in variables, rather than recomputing them each time the function is called.
   
3. Loop optimization:
   - The outer loop in the `main` function iterates from `i = 0` to `n-2`, while the inner loop in the same function iterates from `i = n` to `3`. These loops can be combined into a single loop that iterates from `i = 0` to `n-2` and `i = n` to `3` simultaneously, reducing the number of iterations and improving efficiency.
   
4. Compiler optimizations:
   - Using compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and inline function expansion, can potentially improve the performance of the code. Adding appropriate compiler directives, such as `#pragma`, can help the compiler optimize the code more effectively.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Inefficient data structures:
   - Replace the dynamic arrays `Point *P` and `Point *H` with `std::vector<Point> P` and `std::vector<Point> H`, respectively. This will provide automatic memory management and improve efficiency.

2. Redundant computations:
   - Modify the `Point` class constructor to directly initialize the `x` and `y` members, rather than creating new local variables with the same names. Replace the constructor implementation with the following:
     ```cpp
     Point(int a = 0, int b = 0) : x(a), y(b) {}
     ```

   - In the `direct` function, calculate the values of `(a.x - base.x)` and `(b.y - base.y)` once and store them in variables. Modify the function implementation as follows:
     ```cpp
     inline bool direct(const Point &base, const Point &a, const Point &b) {
       int dx1 = a.x - base.x;
       int dy1 = b.y - base.y;
       int dx2 = b.x - base.x;
       int dy2 = a.y - base.y;
       return dx1 * dy1 - dy2 * dx2 < 0;
     }
     ```

3. Loop optimization:
   - Combine the two loops in the `main` function into a single loop that iterates from `i = 0` to `n-2` and `i = n` to `3` simultaneously. This can be achieved by modifying the loop condition and the loop body as follows:
     ```cpp
     for (i = 0; i < n - 2 || i >= 3; ++i) {
       if (i < n - 2) {
         while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i + 2]))
           k--;
         H[k++] = P[i + 2];
       } else {
         while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i - 3]))
           k--;
         H[k++] = P[i - 3];
       }
     }
     ```

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - Add compiler directives, such as `#pragma`, to enable specific optimizations. For example, you can use `#pragma GCC optimize` to enable loop unrolling and inline function expansion. Add the following line at the top of the code:
     ```cpp
     #pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")
     ```

With these optimization steps in mind, here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Point {
public:
  int x, y;
  Point(int a = 0, int b = 0) : x(a), y(b) {}
  bool operator<(const Point &p) const {
    return y < p.y || (y == p.y && x < p.x);
  }
};

inline bool direct(const Point &base, const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  int dx1 = a.x - base.x;
  int dy1 = b.y - base.y;
  int dx2 = b.x - base.x;
  int dy2 = a.y - base.y;
  return dx1 * dy1 - dy2 * dx2 < 0;
}

int main() {
  int n, i;
  int k = 2;
  vector<Point> P;
  vector<Point> H;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  P.resize(n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d%d", &P[i].x, &P[i].y);
  }
  sort(P.begin(), P.end());
  H.resize(2 * n);
  H[0] = P[0];
  H[1] = P[1];
  for (i = 0; i < n - 2 || i >= 3; ++i) {
    if (i < n - 2) {
      while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i + 2]))
        k--;
      H[k++] = P[i + 2];
    } else {
      while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i - 3]))
        k--;
      H[k++] = P[i - 3];
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", k - 1);
  for (i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i) {
    printf("%d %d\n", H[i].x, H[i].y);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the performance and memory usage of the code while preserving its functionality and output.
