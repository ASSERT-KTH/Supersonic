The given code is an implementation of the Graham's scan algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points. The algorithm first sorts the points based on their y-coordinates and then iteratively adds points to the convex hull by checking if the current point makes a left turn with the last two points on the hull.

Here are the potential optimization opportunities in the code:

1. Memory Allocation: The code uses dynamic memory allocation to create two arrays `P` and `H` to store the points. However, since the number of points is known beforehand, we can use static arrays instead. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

2. Sorting: The code uses the `std::sort` function to sort the points based on their y-coordinates. However, the sorting can be optimized by using a more efficient sorting algorithm such as quicksort or mergesort, specifically tailored for the given problem. This will reduce the time complexity of the sorting operation.

3. Loop Optimization: The code uses two separate loops to add points to the convex hull. These loops can be combined into a single loop to eliminate code duplication and improve readability.

4. Redundant Variables: The constructor of the `Point` class initializes local variables `x` and `y` instead of the class member variables. This results in redundant variables and can be removed to improve memory usage and code clarity.

5. Input Validation: The code does not validate the input values of `n` and the points. Adding input validation can improve the robustness of the program.

6. Compiler Optimizations: The code can benefit from compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling, inline function expansion, and optimization flags.
