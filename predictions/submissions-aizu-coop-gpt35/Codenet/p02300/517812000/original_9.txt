Code Analysis:
1. The `Point` class represents a point in a 2D coordinate system. It has two integer variables `x` and `y`.
2. The `direct` function calculates the cross product between two vectors (`base` to `a` and `base` to `b`) to determine if the angle between them is counter-clockwise or clockwise.
3. The `main` function reads an integer `n` and then reads `n` pairs of integers representing the `x` and `y` coordinates of the points. It sorts the points based on their `y` coordinates and then constructs the convex hull using the Graham's scan algorithm. Finally, it prints the number of points in the convex hull and the coordinates of the points.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations. Instead of dynamically allocating memory for `P` and `H` using `new`, use `std::vector` which automatically manages memory.
2. Remove unnecessary code. The constructor of the `Point` class initializes `x` and `y` variables with the same values as the input parameters. However, it also declares and initializes two new variables with the same names, which hides the class member variables. Remove the declaration and initialization of the new variables in the constructor.
3. Use pass-by-reference instead of pass-by-value for the `direct` function arguments to avoid unnecessary copying of `Point` objects.
4. Use pre-increment (`++i`) instead of post-increment (`i++`) in the for loops to avoid unnecessary copies of the loop variable.
5. Consider using compiler optimizations like loop unrolling or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the raw arrays `Point *P` and `Point *H` with `std::vector<Point> P` and `std::vector<Point> H` respectively. This will automatically handle memory management and eliminate the need for manual memory allocation and deallocation.
2. Remove the unnecessary declaration and initialization of `x` and `y` variables in the constructor of the `Point` class. The corrected constructor should be:
```cpp
Point(int a = 0, int b = 0) {
  x = a;
  y = b;
};
```
3. Change the `direct` function to use pass-by-reference for the arguments:
```cpp
inline bool direct(const Point &base, const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  return (a.x - base.x) * (b.y - base.y) - (a.y - base.y) * (b.x - base.x) < 0;
}
```
4. Replace post-increment (`i++`) with pre-increment (`++i`) in the for loops to avoid unnecessary copies of the loop variable:
```cpp
for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
```
and
```cpp
for (i = n; i > 2; --i)
```
5. No specific compiler optimizations or pragma directives are necessary for this code.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
class Point {
public:
  int x, y;
  Point(int a = 0, int b = 0) {
    x = a;
    y = b;
  };
  bool operator<(const Point &p) const {
    return y < p.y || (y == p.y && x < p.x);
  }
};
inline bool direct(const Point &base, const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  return (a.x - base.x) * (b.y - base.y) - (a.y - base.y) * (b.x - base.x) < 0;
}
int main() {
  int n, i;
  int k = 2;
  vector<Point> P;
  vector<Point> H;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  P.resize(n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d %d", &P[i].x, &P[i].y);
  }
  sort(P.begin(), P.end());
  H.resize(2 * n);
  H[0] = P[0];
  H[1] = P[1];
  for (i = 0; i < n - 2; ++i) {
    while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i + 2]))
      k--;
    H[k++] = P[i + 2];
  }
  H[k++] = P[n - 2];
  for (i = n; i > 2; --i) {
    while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i - 3]))
      k--;
    H[k++] = P[i - 3];
  }
  printf("%d\n", k - 1);
  for (i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i) {
    printf("%d %d\n", H[i].x, H[i].y);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations, removes redundant code, and uses pass-by-reference to avoid unnecessary copying of `Point` objects. The changes made are minimal yet effective, preserving the functionality and output of the original code.
