The provided code implements the QuickFind data structure along with some additional logic. The main goal of the code is to calculate the minimum cost of merging elements in an array. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance and memory usage. 

Let's analyze the code and identify potential optimization opportunities:

1. The `QuickFind` struct uses a vector of vectors (`v`) to store the elements. This approach introduces unnecessary memory overhead. It would be more efficient to use a single vector to store the elements and their parent indices.

2. The `same()` function in the `QuickFind` struct is not used in the provided code. It can be safely removed to eliminate unnecessary function calls.

3. The `unite()` function in the `QuickFind` struct performs a loop over all the elements in `v[y]` to update their parent indices. This loop can be avoided by using a more efficient union-by-rank heuristic.

4. The `init()` function in the `QuickFind` struct can be optimized to avoid unnecessary memory allocations when resizing the vectors. Instead of resizing each vector individually, we can allocate the required memory upfront using `reserve()`.

5. The `map<int, int>` objects `p` and `q` are used to store the indices of elements in `a` and `b` respectively. However, these maps are not necessary as we can directly access the indices using the values in `a` and `b`.

6. The `sort()` function is used to sort the `b` vector. This sorting operation can be avoided by using a more efficient alternative, such as the `partial_sort()` function or a custom sorting algorithm.

7. The last loop in the code calculates the minimum cost using multiple array accesses and redundant calculations. We can optimize this loop by reducing the number of array accesses and minimizing the number of calculations.

Based on these observations, let's formulate an optimization strategy and explain each step in detail.
