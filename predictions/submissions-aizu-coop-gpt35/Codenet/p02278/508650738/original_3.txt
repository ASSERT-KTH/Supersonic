The given code appears to implement a variation of the Union-Find data structure, known as QuickFind, and uses it to solve a specific problem. The code first reads an integer `n` from the input, followed by `n` integers into a vector `a`. It then creates a sorted copy of `a` called `b`, and creates two maps `p` and `q` to store the positions of the elements in `a` and `b`, respectively.

Next, the QuickFind data structure is initialized with size `n`, and a union operation is performed for each element in `b`. Finally, the code calculates the answer by iterating over each component in the QuickFind structure and computing the minimum cost to make all elements in the component equal.

To optimize this code, we will focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations: The current implementation uses vectors to store the components of the QuickFind structure. However, these vectors are resized multiple times during the execution. We can optimize this by pre-allocating the required memory for all vectors.

2. Simplify the union-find operation: The current implementation uses a nested loop to perform the union operation for each element. This can be simplified by using a more efficient union operation that avoids unnecessary iterations.

3. Optimize the calculation of the answer: The current implementation computes the answer by iterating over each component of the QuickFind structure and calculating the minimum cost. We can optimize this calculation by avoiding redundant computations and simplifying the logic.

Now let's proceed with the step-by-step optimization process.
