The provided code calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle based on user input values for its length and width. 

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage: The code declares several unnecessary variables. For example, the variable `area` can be eliminated by directly printing `a * b` in the `printf` statement.

2. Redundant Computations: The variable `c` is calculated by adding `a * 2` and `b * 2`. Since both of these calculations are used only once, we can directly calculate the value of `c` in the `printf` statement to avoid the need for an additional variable.

To optimize the code, we will make the following changes:

1. Remove the declaration of the `area` variable and directly calculate `a * b` in the `printf` statement.
2. Remove the declaration of the `c` variable and calculate `a * 2 + b * 2` directly in the `printf` statement.
