The given code calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using the values entered by the user. However, there are a few areas where the code can be optimized for better performance and memory usage.

1. Avoid unnecessary variables: The variables `area` and `c` are not necessary. We can directly print the values `a * b` and `a * 2 + b * 2` using `printf` without storing them in separate variables.

2. Remove unnecessary header files: Since we are only using `printf` and `scanf` functions, we can remove the `stdio.h` header file as it is not required.

Here's the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  
  printf("%d %d\n", a * b, a * 2 + b * 2);
}
```

This optimized code reduces the number of variables used and avoids unnecessary calculations, resulting in improved performance and reduced memory usage.
