The provided code calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. However, there are a few areas where we can optimize the code for efficiency:

1. Unnecessary variable: The variable `area` is not required. We can directly print `a * b` in the `printf` statement.

2. Redundant calculations: The variable `c` is calculated as `a * 2 + b * 2`. We can simplify this to `(a + b) * 2` to avoid redundant multiplications.

3. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to further improve the performance of the code.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

  // Calculate the area
  printf("%d ", a * b);

  // Calculate the perimeter
  printf("%d\n", (a + b) * 2);

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have eliminated the unnecessary variable `area` and simplified the calculation of `c`. Additionally, we have removed the newline character from the first `printf` statement to ensure the output matches the original code.

The trade-offs in this optimization are minimal. We have reduced the number of variables and simplified the calculations, resulting in slightly improved performance. The code complexity remains the same, and the output remains identical to the original code.
