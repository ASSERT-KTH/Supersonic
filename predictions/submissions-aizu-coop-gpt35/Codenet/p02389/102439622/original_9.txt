The given code is a simple program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. However, there are a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Data Types: The variables `a`, `b`, `area`, and `c` are all declared as integers. Since the input values are read using `%d` format specifier, which expects integers, this is fine. However, if the input values are expected to be decimal numbers, using `float` or `double` data types would be more appropriate.

2. Redundant Computation: The area and perimeter of the rectangle are calculated using the formulas `area = a * b` and `c = a * 2 + b * 2` respectively. These computations are correct but can be optimized.

3. I/O Operations: The program uses `scanf` to read the input values and `printf` to print the results. These functions are simple and efficient, but it's worth mentioning that they can be a performance bottleneck when dealing with large inputs or outputs.

Now, let's go through the optimization steps one by one:

1. Data Types: Since the input values are expected to be integers, the current use of `int` data type is appropriate.

2. Redundant Computation: The computation of `c` can be optimized by using the formula `c = (a + b) * 2`. This eliminates one multiplication operation and reduces the number of arithmetic operations.

3. I/O Operations: There is no need for any optimization in this area since the program only performs two I/O operations, which are minimal in terms of performance impact.

Based on the above analysis, here's the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

  int area = a * b;
  int c = (a + b) * 2;

  printf("%d %d\n", area, c);
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the code remains almost the same, except for the change in the calculation of `c`. The optimized code reduces the number of arithmetic operations and eliminates one multiplication, resulting in improved performance.
