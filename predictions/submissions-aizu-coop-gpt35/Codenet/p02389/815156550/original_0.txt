The provided code is a simple program that takes two integer inputs from the user, multiplies them together, and then outputs the product and the sum of the two numbers multiplied by 2. 

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary I/O operations: The code currently performs two I/O operations to read the input and write the output. We can reduce this to a single I/O operation by calculating the required values first and then outputting them.

2. Minimize unnecessary computations: The code currently calculates the product and the sum of the two numbers twice. We can eliminate the redundant calculations by storing the results in variables and reusing them.

3. Improve data types: The code uses the `int` data type for the input and output variables, which can be inefficient for large numbers. We can use a larger data type, such as `long long`, to accommodate larger values.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  long long a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;

  long long product = a * b;
  long long sum = (a + b) * 2;

  std::cout << product << " " << sum << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code:

1. We have changed the data type of `a` and `b` to `long long` to handle larger inputs efficiently.

2. We calculate the product of `a` and `b` and store it in the variable `product`. Similarly, we calculate the sum of `a` and `b` multiplied by 2 and store it in the variable `sum`. This avoids redundant calculations.

3. We output the calculated values `product` and `sum` in a single `std::cout` statement, reducing the number of I/O operations.

By making these optimizations, we have reduced the number of calculations and I/O operations, resulting in improved efficiency and reduced running time.
