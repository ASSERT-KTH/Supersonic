The provided code is a simple program that takes two integer inputs, multiplies them, and then calculates the sum of twice the first input and twice the second input. The result is then printed to the console.

Upon analyzing the code, there are a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Input Validation: The code currently does not validate the inputs. It assumes that the inputs are valid integers. Adding input validation will improve the robustness of the program.

2. Redundant Computations: The code performs the multiplication operation twice. We can optimize this by storing the result of the multiplication in a variable and reusing it in the second computation.

3. Compiler Optimizations: We can also consider enabling compiler optimizations to allow the compiler to automatically optimize the code. This can be done by adding compiler-specific pragmas or flags.

Now, let's optimize the code step-by-step while preserving its functionality and output.
