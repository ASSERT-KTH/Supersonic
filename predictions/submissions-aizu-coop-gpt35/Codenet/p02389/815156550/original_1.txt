The provided code is a simple program that takes two integers as input, multiplies them, and then calculates the sum of twice the first integer and twice the second integer. The result is then printed to the console.

To optimize this code, we need to focus on improving its running time and minimizing memory usage. Let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization.

1. Code Analysis:
   - The code is straightforward and doesn't contain any complex algorithms or data structures.
   - However, there are a few areas we can optimize:
     - The input and output operations: `std::cin` and `std::cout` can be slow when used repeatedly, especially in a loop.
     - The multiplication operations: Multiplication can be an expensive operation, and we are performing it twice.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - We can optimize the input and output operations by reducing the number of calls to `std::cin` and `std::cout`, respectively.
   - We can optimize the multiplication operations by reducing the number of multiplications performed.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. We can optimize the input and output operations by reading both integers at once and storing them in variables.
   2. Instead of using `std::cout` twice to print the results, we can calculate the results first and then print them together.
   3. To reduce the number of multiplication operations, we can store the results of `a * 2` and `b * 2` in variables and reuse them.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;

  int result1 = a * b;
  int result2 = a * 2 + b * 2;

  std::cout << result1 << " " << result2 << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code:
- We read both integers `a` and `b` in a single line using `std::cin`.
- We calculate the results `result1` and `result2` using the stored values of `a` and `b`.
- We print the results using a single call to `std::cout`.

This optimized code reduces the number of input and output operations and minimizes the number of multiplication operations, resulting in improved performance. The changes made are minimal, preserving the functionality and output of the original code.
