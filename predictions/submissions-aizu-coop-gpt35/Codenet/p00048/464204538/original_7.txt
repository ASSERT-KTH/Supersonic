The given code is a simple program that reads a floating-point number from the user and prints a corresponding weight class based on the input value.

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Eliminate the unnecessary use of the `puts` function: Currently, the code uses the `puts` function to print the weight class. However, since we are only printing a single string, we can use `printf` instead, which will be more efficient.

2. Replace the nested ternary operators with a switch statement: The code uses nested ternary operators to determine the weight class based on the input value. This can be simplified and made more readable by using a switch statement instead.

3. Avoid repetitive comparisons: The current code makes multiple comparisons for each weight class. We can optimize this by rearranging the order of the comparisons and using a single if-else chain.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  float f;
  while (~scanf("%f", &f)) {
    if (f > 91)
      printf("heavy\n");
    else if (f > 81)
      printf("light heavy\n");
    else if (f > 75)
      printf("middle\n");
    else if (f > 69)
      printf("light middle\n");
    else if (f > 64)
      printf("welter\n");
    else if (f > 60)
      printf("light welter\n");
    else if (f > 57)
      printf("light\n");
    else if (f > 54)
      printf("feather\n");
    else if (f > 51)
      printf("bantam\n");
    else if (f > 48)
      printf("fly\n");
    else
      printf("light fly\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have replaced the nested ternary operators with a switch-like if-else chain. This improves readability and reduces the number of comparisons required. Additionally, we have replaced the use of `puts` with `printf` for better efficiency when printing the weight class.
