Code Analysis:
1. The code includes a large number of unnecessary header files. Many of these header files are not used in the program and can be removed to reduce compilation time and improve efficiency.
2. The program uses a two-dimensional array `dp` to store intermediate results. However, the size of this array is much larger than necessary, resulting in inefficient memory usage.
3. The `compute` function is called multiple times within the nested loops. This function performs repeated calculations that could be optimized to improve performance.
4. The `sum` array is used to store cumulative sums of the `beauty` array. However, the current implementation of the cumulative sum calculation can be improved for better efficiency.
5. The program uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations. While these functions are commonly used, they can be slower compared to more efficient alternatives like `cin` and `cout`.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove unnecessary header files that are not used in the program, such as `<bitset>`, `<deque>`, `<limits>`, `<list>`, `<map>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<sstream>`, and `<stack>`.
2. Optimize memory usage: Reduce the size of the `dp` array to the minimum required size. The array can be resized to `num_of_notes` x `num_of_notes` instead of the current size of `2001` x `2001`.
3. Optimize the `compute` function: Instead of repeatedly calculating the same values in the nested loops, precalculate the values and store them in a 2D array. This will eliminate the need for repeated calculations and improve performance.
4. Optimize the calculation of cumulative sums: Instead of using a loop to calculate cumulative sums, use the `partial_sum` algorithm from the `<numeric>` header to improve efficiency.
5. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. This will provide better performance compared to the C-style input/output functions.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary header files that are not used in the program. Update the code to remove the include statements for these header files.
2. Optimize memory usage: Replace the declaration of the `dp` array with a new declaration that uses the minimum required size. Update the code to resize the `dp` array accordingly.
3. Optimize the `compute` function:
    a. Create a new 2D array called `computed` to store the precalculated values of the `compute` function.
    b. In the main function, before the nested loops, calculate and store the values of the `compute` function in the `computed` array.
    c. Inside the nested loops, replace the calls to the `compute` function with direct access to the `computed` array to retrieve the precalculated values.
4. Optimize the calculation of cumulative sums:
    a. Include the `<numeric>` header to use the `partial_sum` algorithm.
    b. Replace the loop that calculates the cumulative sums with a call to the `partial_sum` algorithm, passing the `beauty` array as the input range and the `sum` array as the output range.
5. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`:
    a. Replace the `scanf` statement with a `cin` statement to read the input values.
    b. Replace the `printf` statement with a `cout` statement to print the output value.

This optimized code improves the performance and memory usage of the original code by removing unnecessary header files, optimizing memory usage, precalculating values, and using more efficient input/output operations. The changes made are minimal yet effective, preserving the functionality and output of the original code while improving efficiency.
