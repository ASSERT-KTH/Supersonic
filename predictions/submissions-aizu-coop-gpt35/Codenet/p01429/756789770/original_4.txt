Code Analysis:
1. The code includes several unnecessary header files that are not used in the program. These can be removed to reduce unnecessary compile time.
2. The code uses the `using namespace std` directive, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less readable. It is better to explicitly specify the namespace for each identifier.
3. The code uses global variables for various arrays and variables. It is better to localize the scope of these variables to avoid potential issues and improve code maintainability.
4. The code uses a 2D array `dp` to store the intermediate results. This array can be optimized to use less memory, as it currently has a size of `2001 x 2001`, which is much larger than necessary.
5. The code uses a `reverse` function to reverse the `notes` array. This operation can be avoided by iterating in reverse order instead.
6. The `compute` function is called multiple times in the inner loop of the main algorithm. This function can be optimized to avoid redundant calculations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes several unnecessary header files. We can remove the headers that are not used in the program to reduce unnecessary compile time.

2. Remove `using namespace std`: Instead of using the `using namespace std` directive, we should explicitly specify the namespace for each identifier. This improves code readability and avoids potential naming conflicts.

3. Localize the scope of variables: The code uses global variables for various arrays and variables. We should localize the scope of these variables to avoid potential issues and improve code maintainability.

4. Optimize memory usage of `dp` array: The `dp` array is currently using a size of `2001 x 2001`, which is much larger than necessary. We can optimize it by using a 1D array of size `2001` and use appropriate indexing to access the elements.

5. Reverse `notes` array without using `reverse` function: The `reverse` function is not necessary to reverse the `notes` array. We can iterate over the array in reverse order instead.

6. Optimize the `compute` function: The `compute` function is called multiple times in the inner loop of the main algorithm. We can optimize it by calculating the values once and storing them in variables for reuse.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - Remove the unnecessary header files `#include <deque>`, `#include <limits>`, `#include <list>`, `#include <map>`, `#include <queue>`, `#include <set>`, `#include <sstream>`, `#include <stack>`, `#include <utility>`.
   - These headers are not used in the program and including them unnecessarily increases compile time.

2. Remove `using namespace std`:
   - Replace the `using namespace std` directive with explicit namespace specification for each identifier.
   - For example, replace `typedef pair<int, int> P;` with `typedef std::pair<int, int> P;`.

3. Localize the scope of variables:
   - Move the declarations of `num_of_notes`, `num_of_beauty`, and `force_of_repulsion` inside the `while` loop, as they are only used within the loop.
   - Move the declarations of `sum` and `dp` inside the loop, as they are only used within each iteration of the loop.

4. Optimize memory usage of `dp` array:
   - Replace the declaration `ll dp[2001][2001];` with `ll dp[2001];`. This reduces the memory usage from `2001 x 2001` to `2001`.

5. Reverse `notes` array without using `reverse` function:
   - Instead of using the `reverse` function, iterate over the `notes` array in reverse order in the main algorithm.
   - Change the for loop from `for (int i = 0; i < num_of_notes; i++)` to `for (int i = num_of_notes - 1; i >= 0; i--)`.

6. Optimize the `compute` function:
   - Instead of calculating `lhs` and `rhs` in each iteration of the inner loop, calculate them once and store the values in variables for reuse.
   - Move the calculation of `lhs` and `rhs` outside the inner loop and store them in variables.
   - Replace the computation in the return statement with the precalculated values.

The optimized code makes the following changes:
- Removes unnecessary header files to reduce compile time.
- Replaces `using namespace std` with explicit namespace specification.
- Localizes the scope of variables to improve code maintainability.
- Optimizes memory usage of the `dp` array.
- Reverses the `notes` array by iterating in reverse order.
- Optimizes the `compute` function by calculating `lhs` and `rhs` once and storing them in variables for reuse.
