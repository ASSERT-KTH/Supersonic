Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The inclusion of `<bits/stdc++.h>` header: This header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can significantly increase the compilation time and memory usage. We can replace it with the specific headers that are actually required.

2. The use of `scanf` and `printf` functions: These functions are slower compared to their counterparts `std::cin` and `std::cout` from the iostream library. We can replace `scanf` and `printf` with `std::cin` and `std::cout` for better performance.

3. The calculation `n - m - 1` is performed directly in the `printf` statement. We can separate this calculation into a separate variable to improve code readability and potentially gain a small performance improvement.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header with specific headers that are actually required. In this case, we only need `<iostream>` and `<cstdio>`.

2. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `std::cin` and `std::cout` respectively.

3. Separate the calculation `n - m - 1` into a separate variable for improved code readability.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  int result = n - m - 1;
  std::cout << result << "\n";
}
```

In this optimized code, we have made the following changes:

1. Replaced the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header with specific headers `<iostream>` and `<cstdio>`.

2. Replaced `scanf` with `std::cin` and `printf` with `std::cout`.

3. Separated the calculation `n - m - 1` into a separate variable `result` for improved code readability.

These changes result in a more efficient and readable code, with improved memory usage and potentially faster execution time.
