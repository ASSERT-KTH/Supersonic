The given code is a simple program that takes two integers as input (n and m) and calculates the difference between them (n - m - 1). The result is then printed to the console.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:
1. Improve input/output operations.
2. Simplify the arithmetic expression.
3. Optimize memory usage.
