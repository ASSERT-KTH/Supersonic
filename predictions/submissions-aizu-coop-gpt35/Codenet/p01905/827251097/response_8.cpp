The provided code is a simple program that reads two integers from the user and prints the difference between them minus one. Although the code is straightforward, there are a few optimizations that can be made to improve its performance and memory usage.

1. Avoid including unnecessary headers: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary for this program. This header includes all the standard C++ library headers, which can add unnecessary overhead to the program. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers for `printf` and `scanf`.

2. Use `iostream` instead of `stdio.h`: The program currently uses `scanf` and `printf` from the `stdio.h` header for input and output. However, `iostream` is a more modern and efficient way of handling input and output in C++. We can replace the `scanf` and `printf` calls with `cin` and `cout` respectively.

3. Replace `printf` with `cout` and remove unnecessary newline: The program currently uses `printf` to print the result. We can replace it with `cout` for better performance. Additionally, we can remove the newline character `\n` from the `printf` call since `cout` automatically adds a newline.

4. Remove unnecessary subtraction: The program calculates the difference between `n` and `m`, and then subtracts 1 from the result. We can simplify this by directly subtracting 1 from `n` before calculating the difference.

5. Use `unsigned int` instead of `int`: Since the program is dealing with positive integers, we can use `unsigned int` instead of `int` to avoid unnecessary sign extension.
