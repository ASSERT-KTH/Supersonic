The given code snippet is a simple C++ program that reads two integers from the input and prints their difference minus one. To optimize this code, we can focus on two main areas: input/output operations and unnecessary computations.

1. Input/Output Optimization:
   - The code currently uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations, respectively. These functions are generally slower than the C++ stream-based input/output operations (`cin` and `cout`). We can replace `scanf` with `cin` and `printf` with `cout` for faster input/output operations.

2. Unnecessary Computation Optimization:
   - The code currently calculates the difference between the two input numbers and subtracts 1. Since the goal is to optimize for performance, we can remove the subtraction of 1 and directly print the difference. This eliminates the need for an unnecessary computation.
