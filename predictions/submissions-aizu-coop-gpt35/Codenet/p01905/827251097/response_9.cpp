The provided code is a simple program that reads two integers `n` and `m` from the user and then calculates and prints the value of `n - m - 1`. 

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary library inclusion: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove it to reduce unnecessary overhead.

2. Improve input/output operations: Instead of using `scanf` and `printf`, we can use the `std::cin` and `std::cout` functions provided by the `<iostream>` library, respectively. These functions are generally faster and more type-safe than their C counterparts.

3. Minimize memory usage: The original code does not use any unnecessary memory, so there is no significant opportunity for optimization in this regard.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can enable compiler optimizations to allow the compiler to perform additional optimizations at compile-time. This can include techniques like loop unrolling or function inlining.
