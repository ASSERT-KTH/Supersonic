After analyzing the provided code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary Includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of standard library headers. It is better to include only the necessary headers explicitly.

2. Vector Initialization: The code uses `fill()` to initialize vectors. Instead, we can use the constructor of `vector` to initialize vectors with a specific size and value.

3. Redundant Variable Copies: The code makes multiple unnecessary copies of vectors. We can avoid these copies to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

4. Unnecessary Sorting: The code uses `sort()` to sort the suffix array, which is not required. We can optimize the sorting algorithm to improve performance.

5. Unoptimized Loop: The code uses a loop to calculate the minimum value in a range, which can be optimized by using a sparse table data structure.

Based on these observations, I have formulated the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `<bits/stdc++.h>` include directive with the necessary standard library headers.

2. Initialize vectors using the constructor instead of `fill()`.

3. Avoid unnecessary copies of vectors by passing them by reference.

4. Optimize the sorting algorithm for the suffix array.

5. Implement a sparse table data structure to optimize the calculation of the minimum value in a range.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization and provide the optimized code.
