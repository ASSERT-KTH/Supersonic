Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified the following potential optimizations:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended. It is better to include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, and `<string>`.

2. Redundant vector initialization: The `create_begin_bucket` and `create_end_bucket` functions initialize the `bucket` vector with zeros in every call. This is unnecessary since the vector is already initialized with zeros at the beginning of each function. We can remove the `fill(bucket.begin(), bucket.end(), 0)` line from both functions.

3. Unoptimized loops: There are some loops that can be optimized. For example, in the `induced_sort` and `invert_induced_sort` functions, the loops iterate over the entire `v` vector, which can be optimized to iterate only up to `v.size() - 1`. Similarly, in the `sa_is` function, the loop `for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++)` can be optimized to `for (int i = 0; i < v.size() - 1; i++)` since the last element of the `v` vector is not used.

4. Unnecessary vector copies: The `sa_is` function takes a vector `v` as input and creates a copy of it before calling the recursive `sa_is` function. This results in unnecessary memory usage. We can modify the `sa_is` function to take the vector by reference instead of by value.

5. Inefficient string comparison: The `contain` function uses the `string::compare` function to compare substrings of `s` and `t`. This can be optimized by using the `string::substr` function to extract the substring from `s` and then using the `==` operator to compare the substrings.

6. Missing return statement: The `sa_is` function should return the computed suffix array `sa`. Add a `return sa;` statement at the end of the function.
