The provided code is an implementation of a suffix array data structure along with a function to check if a given string is a substring of the original string. The main function takes an input string, constructs the suffix array, and then performs multiple queries to check if different strings are substrings of the original string.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas of improvement can be identified:

1. Redundant Memory Allocation: The `sa_is` function takes a vector `v` as input and returns a vector `sa` as output. However, the vector `sa` is already declared outside the function and passed as a reference. Therefore, there is no need to allocate a new vector `sa` inside the function. Instead, the function should directly modify the existing `sa` vector.

2. Unnecessary Vector Copies: In the `sa_is` function, the input vector `v` is copied to a new vector `next_v` using the `cur` variable to keep track of the number of distinct elements. However, this copying can be avoided by directly modifying the `v` vector in place.

3. Unnecessary Function Overload: The `sa_is` function is overloaded to take both a vector and a string as input. However, the implementation for the string version is missing, which results in a compilation error. To fix this, either the string version should be implemented or the overload should be removed if not needed.

4. Inefficient Loop: The loop in the `construct_lcp` function iterates from 0 to `n`, where `n` is the size of the input string. However, the rank of `sa[i] - 1` is only used when `i > 0`. Therefore, the loop can be optimized to iterate from 1 to `n`.

5. Inefficient Binary Search: The `contain` function uses a binary search to find the position of the given string in the suffix array. However, the binary search implementation is not optimal. It would be more efficient to use the `lower_bound` function from the standard library to perform the binary search.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Modify the `sa_is` function to directly modify the existing `sa` vector instead of allocating a new vector.
2. Refactor the `sa_is` function to avoid unnecessary vector copies.
3. Implement the missing string version of the `sa_is` function or remove the unnecessary function overload.
4. Optimize the loop in the `construct_lcp` function to iterate from 1 to `n`.
5. Replace the binary search in the `contain` function with the `lower_bound` function.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization and provide the optimized code.
