The given code appears to be solving a dynamic programming problem. However, there are several areas that can be optimized for better performance:

1. Memory Allocation: The code allocates a 2D boolean array `dp` of size `MAX x MAX x 2`, which is unnecessary. Since the values of `input` array are limited to the range [0, 149], the `dp` array can be reduced to a 2D boolean array of size `150 x 150`. This will save memory and improve cache locality.

2. Unnecessary Loop Conditions: The loops `rep(i, MAX)` and `rep(j, MAX)` can be optimized because the `dp` array is initialized to `false` before these loops. Therefore, these loops can be changed to iterate only up to the maximum values present in the `input` array, i.e., `rep(i, N)` and `rep(j, N)` respectively.

3. Loop Ordering: The nested loops `rep(L, MAX)` and `rep(M, MAX)` can be optimized by swapping their order. This will improve cache locality and reduce cache misses.

4. Loop Unrolling: The innermost loop inside the `REP(cur, 1, N - 1)` loop can be unrolled to process multiple iterations at once. This can be achieved by processing two iterations of the loop per iteration, and updating the loop control variable `cur` accordingly.

5. Compiler Optimization: Enabling compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and auto-vectorization, can potentially improve the performance of the code. This can be achieved by using compiler-specific pragmas or flags.
