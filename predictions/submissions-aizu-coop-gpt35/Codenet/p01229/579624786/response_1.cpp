The given code appears to be solving a dynamic programming problem. However, there are several opportunities for optimization:

1. **Use a more efficient data structure**: The current implementation uses a 3D boolean array `dp[MAX][MAX][2]` to store the intermediate results. This approach requires a large amount of memory, especially considering the maximum value of `MAX` is set to 150. We can optimize this by using a 2D boolean array of size `MAX * MAX` and introduce a new variable to keep track of the current iteration.

2. **Avoid unnecessary computations**: The current implementation performs unnecessary computations by iterating over all possible values of `L` and `M` in each iteration. We can optimize this by only considering the possible values of `L` and `M` that have been set to `true` in the previous iteration.

3. **Eliminate redundant assignments**: The current implementation repeatedly assigns `false` to all elements of `dp` in each iteration. We can optimize this by initializing `dp` only once before the outer loop.

4. **Use compiler optimizations**: We can suggest the compiler to optimize the code further by using compiler-specific directives or flags. For example, we can use `-O3` optimization flag to enable aggressive optimization.
