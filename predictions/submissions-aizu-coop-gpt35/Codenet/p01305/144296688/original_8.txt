The given code calculates the win rate for a game based on a series of permutations. It takes an input value 'n' and then for each iteration, it takes two sets of numbers 'a' and calculates the win rate by permuting the numbers in 'a' and comparing the sums of the permutations.

However, the code has a few areas that can be optimized:

1. Redundant array initialization: The arrays `num[2][9]` and `a[2][9]` are initialized inside the loop for each iteration. Since they are only used within the loop, we can move their initialization outside the loop to avoid unnecessary reinitialization.

2. Loop unrolling: The code has nested loops that iterate over the numbers in `a` and calculate the win rate. These nested loops can be unrolled to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance. 

3. Avoiding unnecessary computations: The code checks for permutations where the indices are the same and skips those iterations. However, this check is not necessary since the code already skips those iterations using the `continue` statement. We can remove the unnecessary check.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to further improve performance. For example, using optimization flags like `-O3` can help the compiler optimize the code for performance.

Now, let's apply these optimizations step by step:
