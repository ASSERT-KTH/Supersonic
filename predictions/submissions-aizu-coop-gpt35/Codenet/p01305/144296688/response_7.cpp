The provided code calculates the winrate for two players, Geitu and Jacky, in a game. The code uses nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of outcomes, calculating the winrate for each combination.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant computations: The code recalculates the winrate for each combination of outcomes, even though the winrate calculation can be done outside the innermost loop.

2. Inefficient memory usage: The code declares and initializes the `num` array inside the innermost loop, resulting in unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations. Additionally, the `num` array is reset to zero in each iteration of the outermost loop, even though it can be initialized once before the loop starts.

3. Inefficient loops: The code uses multiple nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of outcomes. This can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm to generate the combinations.

4. Lack of compiler optimizations: The code does not include any compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler about potential optimizations.
