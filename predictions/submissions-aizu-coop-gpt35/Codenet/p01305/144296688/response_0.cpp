The given code calculates the win rates for two players, Geitu and Jacky, playing a game with 9 rounds. The code uses nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of moves for both players and calculates the win rates based on the total scores of each player.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Remove unnecessary array allocations: The arrays `num[2][9]` and `a[2][9]` are allocated inside the loop for each iteration. Since their sizes do not change, it would be more efficient to allocate them outside the loop before starting the iterations.

2. Simplify win rate calculation: The win rates are calculated by dividing the number of wins by the total number of combinations. Instead of dividing by the fixed value 362880 (9 factorial), we can calculate it once outside the loop and reuse the value for each iteration.

3. Optimize loop iterations: The nested loops iterate over all possible combinations of moves for both players. This results in a high number of iterations (9 factorial = 362880). We can optimize this by using a recursive approach or by employing a more efficient algorithm.

4. Use more efficient data structures: The current code uses a 2D array to store the scores of Geitu and Jacky for each round. Instead, we can use a single array to store the scores and calculate the scores for each round on the fly.

5. Enable compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. This can be done by using suitable compiler flags or pragma directives.
