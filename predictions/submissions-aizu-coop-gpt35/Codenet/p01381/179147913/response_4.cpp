This code generates a sequence of pairs of integers based on the input values `n` and `k`. It prints the pairs to the standard output. The code uses two nested loops to generate the pairs, and it also performs some calculations to compute the values of `a` and `b`.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified a few areas where optimizations can be made:

1. The code uses an array `p` to store the generated values. However, the array is initialized with a size of `n + 2`, which is unnecessary since the maximum size needed is `n`. This can be optimized to reduce memory usage.

2. The `printf` function is called multiple times within the loops to print the pairs. This can be inefficient, especially when `n` and `k` are large. Instead, we can store the pairs in a buffer and print the buffer once after the loops.

3. The calculations for `a` and `b` involve modulo operations, which can be expensive. We can optimize this by using precomputed values or by rearranging the calculations to avoid the modulo operations.

4. The code does not make use of any compiler optimizations or pragma directives. We can explore these options to further optimize the code.
