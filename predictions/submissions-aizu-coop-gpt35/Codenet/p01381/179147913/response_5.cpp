The provided code generates pairs of numbers based on the input values `n` and `k`. The goal is to optimize this code for efficiency.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory usage: The code currently uses an array `p` of size `n + 2`. However, we can optimize this by using a smaller array or even eliminating the need for an array altogether.
2. Redundant computations: The code performs some calculations repeatedly that could be computed once and reused.
3. Inner loop optimization: The inner loop that prints the pairs of numbers can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and eliminate the need for the `%` operator.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization strategy:

1. Memory usage optimization:
   - Instead of using an array `p` of size `n + 2`, we can use two variables `a` and `b` to store the numbers to be printed. This eliminates the need for an array and reduces memory usage.
   - We can also eliminate the first element `p[0]` of the array `p` since it is always 0 and not used in the calculations.

2. Redundant computations optimization:
   - The calculation `(p[j] + i) % n + 1` and `(p[j + 1] + i) % n + 1` are repeated in the inner loop. We can compute these values once before the inner loop and reuse them.

3. Inner loop optimization:
   - The inner loop currently iterates `n - 1` times. However, we can optimize this by changing the loop condition to `j < n - 1 - k` to reduce the number of iterations.
   - Instead of using the `%` operator to wrap around the indices `p[j]` and `p[j + 1]`, we can use conditional statements to check if the values exceed `n` and adjust them accordingly.
