This code generates a sequence of pairs of integers based on the inputs `n` and `k`. Each pair `(a, b)` is generated according to the following rules:

1. `n` must be an even number and `k` must be less than or equal to `n / 2`. If this condition is not met, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next input.
2. The pairs are generated by taking a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` and splitting it into two halves. Each pair `(a, b)` is formed by taking one number from the first half and one number from the second half. The number of pairs generated is equal to `k`.

Now, let's analyze the code for potential optimizations:

1. Inefficient memory usage: The code uses an array `p` of size `n + 2` to store the sequence of numbers. However, only `n` elements of this array are actually used. This wastes memory and can be optimized.

2. Redundant computation: The code computes the values of `a` and `b` in each iteration of the inner loop. However, these values only depend on the values of `p[j]` and `p[j + 1]`, which remain constant throughout the outer loop. Therefore, these computations can be moved outside the inner loop to improve performance.

3. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations and pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. This can potentially improve performance without making any changes to the code itself.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps:

Step 1: Inefficient memory usage
- The array `p` is currently declared as `int p[n + 2]`, which allocates `n + 2` integers. However, only `n` elements of this array are actually used.
- We can optimize this by declaring `p` as `int p[n]` instead, which will allocate only `n` integers.

Step 2: Redundant computation
- The values of `a` and `b` in each iteration of the inner loop can be pre-computed outside the loop, as they only depend on the values of `p[j]` and `p[j + 1]`.
- We can introduce two variables `a` and `b` before the inner loop and compute their values once before the loop starts.
- Inside the inner loop, we can directly use the pre-computed values of `a` and `b` instead of re-computing them.

Step 3: Compiler optimizations
- We can use compiler optimizations and pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
- For example, we can use the `#pragma GCC optimize` directive to enable optimization flags for the code.
- We can also use the `__builtin_expect` function to provide the compiler with a hint about the likely branch outcome, which can improve performance.

Now, let's proceed to the optimized code block:
