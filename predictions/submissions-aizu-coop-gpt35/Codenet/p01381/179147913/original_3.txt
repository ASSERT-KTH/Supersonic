Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Dynamic memory allocation: The code uses an array `p` of size `n + 2`, which is allocated dynamically for each iteration of the while loop. This can be inefficient in terms of memory usage. 

2. Redundant computation: The expressions `(p[j] + i) % n + 1` and `(p[j + 1] + i) % n + 1` are computed repeatedly inside nested loops. These computations can be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations.

3. Output formatting: The use of `printf()` for each integer output with a new line character can be optimized by using `cout` with the `<<` operator. This can reduce the number of function calls and improve performance.

4. Loop optimization: The loops can be optimized to improve cache locality and reduce branch mispredictions. This can be achieved through loop unrolling and loop reordering.

Based on these observations, I will now provide a step-by-step explanation of each optimization and present the optimized code.
