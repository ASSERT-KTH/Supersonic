The provided code reads an integer `n` from the input, followed by `n` long long integers. It then finds the minimum and maximum values in the vector `a` using `std::min_element` and `std::max_element` functions, and calculates the sum of all the elements in the vector using `std::accumulate`. Finally, it outputs the minimum, maximum, and sum values.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and copies.
2. Optimize the calculation of the minimum, maximum, and sum values.
3. Utilize compiler optimizations.

Let's go through these optimization steps one by one.

Step 1: Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and copies
- The vector `a` is dynamically resized using `push_back` inside the loop. This can result in multiple reallocations and copies, which can be inefficient.
- To avoid this, we can preallocate the vector `a` to the exact size before reading the input.

Step 2: Optimize the calculation of the minimum, maximum, and sum values
- Currently, the minimum and maximum values are found using `std::min_element` and `std::max_element` functions, which iterate over the entire vector.
- We can optimize this by manually iterating over the vector and keeping track of the minimum and maximum values.
- Similarly, the sum of all elements is calculated using `std::accumulate`, which also iterates over the entire vector.
- We can optimize this by manually iterating over the vector and summing the elements.

Step 3: Utilize compiler optimizations
- We can utilize compiler optimizations to further improve the performance of the code.
- Compiler optimizations can include loop unrolling, inline function expansion, and constant folding.
- We can use compiler-specific directives or pragmas to hint the compiler about optimization opportunities.

Now, let's incorporate these optimization steps into the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  // Step 1: Preallocate the vector
  std::vector<long long> a(n);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }

  // Step 2: Optimize calculation of min, max, and sum
  long long min_val = a[0];
  long long max_val = a[0];
  long long sum_val = a[0];

  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (a[i] < min_val) {
      min_val = a[i];
    }
    if (a[i] > max_val) {
      max_val = a[i];
    }
    sum_val += a[i];
  }

  std::cout << min_val << " " << max_val << " " << sum_val << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we have made the following changes:

- Preallocated the vector `a` to the exact size to avoid unnecessary memory allocations and copies.
- Manually calculated the minimum, maximum, and sum values by iterating over the vector, instead of using library functions.
- Removed the `std::accumulate` call and calculated the sum directly in the loop.
- Added comments to clarify the changes made.

These optimizations should improve the performance of the code by reducing memory allocations and improving the efficiency of the calculations.
