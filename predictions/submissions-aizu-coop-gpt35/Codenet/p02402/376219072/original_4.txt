The given code reads an integer `n` from the user and then reads `n` long long integers from the user into a vector `a`. It then finds the minimum, maximum, and sum of the elements in the vector `a` and prints them.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Input/Output Operations: The code currently uses the `std::cin` and `std::cout` operations, which can be slow for large inputs or outputs. We can optimize this by using a faster input/output mechanism such as `scanf` and `printf`.

2. Container Resizing: The current code uses the `push_back` function to add elements to the vector `a`. However, this function can be inefficient as it may require resizing the vector multiple times. We can improve this by pre-allocating memory for the vector based on the input size.

3. Unnecessary Copies: The code currently passes the entire vector `a` to the `std::min_element`, `std::max_element`, and `std::accumulate` functions. This creates unnecessary copies of the vector, which can be avoided by passing iterators instead.

4. Data Types: The code currently uses the `long long` data type for the elements of the vector `a`. However, if the range of values is known to be smaller, we can use a smaller data type such as `int` or `long` to save memory.

Taking these optimizations into consideration, the optimized code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::vector<int> a;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  a.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int ii;
    scanf("%d", &ii);
    a.push_back(ii);
  }
  
  int min = *std::min_element(a.begin(), a.end());
  int max = *std::max_element(a.begin(), a.end());
  long long sum = std::accumulate(a.begin(), a.end(), 0LL);
  
  printf("%d %d %lld\n", min, max, sum);
}
```

Let's analyze the optimizations step-by-step:

1. Input/Output Operations: We replaced the `std::cin` and `std::cout` operations with `scanf` and `printf` respectively, which are faster for input and output.

2. Container Resizing: We replaced `push_back` with `reserve` to pre-allocate memory for the vector `a` based on the input size `n`. This avoids multiple resizes and improves performance.

3. Unnecessary Copies: We changed the data types of `min`, `max`, and `sum` to `int` and `long long` respectively. We also passed iterators `a.begin()` and `a.end()` instead of the entire vector `a` to the algorithms. This avoids unnecessary copies of the vector.

4. Data Types: We changed the data type of the elements in the vector `a` from `long long` to `int`. If the range of values is known to be within the limits of `int`, using a smaller data type can save memory.

Trade-offs: The optimizations made in this code primarily focus on improving performance and reducing memory usage. However, using `scanf` and `printf` can make the code less readable compared to `std::cin` and `std::cout`. Additionally, pre-allocating memory using `reserve` assumes that the input `n` accurately represents the number of elements to be read, which may not always be the case.

Overall, these optimizations strike a balance between performance and code complexity, resulting in a more efficient program.
