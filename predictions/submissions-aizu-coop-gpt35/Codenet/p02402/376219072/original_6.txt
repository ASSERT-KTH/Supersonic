The given code reads an integer `n` from the user and then reads `n` numbers into a vector `a`. It then finds the minimum, maximum, and sum of the elements in `a` using the `min_element`, `max_element`, and `accumulate` functions from the `<algorithm>` library, respectively. Finally, it prints these values to the console.

To optimize this code for efficiency, we can take the following steps:

1. Use `reserve()` to allocate memory for the vector `a` upfront. By reserving the expected size of the vector before inserting elements, we can avoid unnecessary reallocations and improve performance.

2. Replace the `accumulate` function with a loop to calculate the sum of the elements. This will eliminate the overhead of function calls and improve performance.

3. Remove unnecessary headers. The `<algorithm>` header is not needed since we will be replacing the `min_element` and `max_element` functions. The `<numeric>` header is also not needed since we will be removing the `accumulate` function.

4. Replace `min_element` and `max_element` with custom implementations. Instead of using the generic `min_element` and `max_element` functions, we can iterate over the vector manually to find the minimum and maximum elements. This will eliminate the need for comparisons in each iteration and improve performance.

5. Use the `constexpr` keyword for the size of the vector `a`. Since `n` is read from the user and not known at compile-time, we cannot use `constexpr` for the size of the vector. However, we can use it for the loop variable `i` since it is known to be within the range of `n`.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::vector<long long> a;
  a.reserve(n); // Allocate memory upfront
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    long long ii;
    std::cin >> ii;
    a.push_back(ii);
  }
  
  // Find min, max, and sum of elements
  long long min = a[0];
  long long max = a[0];
  long long sum = 0;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    long long current = a[i];
    if (current < min) {
      min = current;
    }
    if (current > max) {
      max = current;
    }
    sum += current;
  }
  
  std::cout << min << " " << max << " " << sum << std::endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code improves performance by avoiding unnecessary memory reallocations, eliminating function call overhead, and reducing the number of comparisons in the loops. The changes made are minimal and preserve the functionality and output of the original code.
