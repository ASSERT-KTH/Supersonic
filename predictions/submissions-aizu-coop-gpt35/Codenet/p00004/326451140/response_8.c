Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified several potential optimizations that can be made to improve performance and reduce memory usage:

1. Inefficient memory usage: The code currently uses a 2D array `double x[N][N+1]` and a pointer array `double *y[N]` to represent a matrix. This results in inefficient memory usage because it requires additional memory for storing pointers and managing memory allocations. Instead, we can use a 1D array to represent the matrix and access elements using a formula.

2. Redundant computation: The code performs the same computation twice in the `matrix()` function. The loops that calculate `su1` and `su2` could be consolidated into a single loop to avoid redundant computations.

3. Magic numbers: The code uses several magic numbers such as `2`, `2 - k`, `1 - k`, `1 - j`, and `2 - j`. These magic numbers make the code less readable and harder to maintain. It is better to define these values as constants to improve code readability.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. This can potentially improve the performance of the code.
