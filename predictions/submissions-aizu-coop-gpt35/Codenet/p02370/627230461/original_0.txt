Code Analysis:
1. The code uses a vector of vectors (`edge`) to represent a directed graph, where each index represents a vertex and the corresponding value is a vector of its adjacent vertices.
2. The code initializes the `state` vector to keep track of the number of incoming edges for each vertex.
3. The code then iterates through the `state` vector to find all the vertices with no incoming edges and adds them to the `ans` vector.
4. Finally, the code iterates through the `ans` vector and updates the `state` vector by decrementing the incoming edge count for each adjacent vertex. If the incoming edge count becomes zero, the adjacent vertex is added to the `ans` vector.
5. The code prints the `ans` vector, which contains the topological ordering of the vertices.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a more memory-efficient data structure to represent the graph.
2. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and copies.
3. Minimize the number of iterations and redundant computations.
4. Utilize compiler optimizations to improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `vector<vector<int>>` with a more memory-efficient data structure, such as an adjacency list representation using a single vector. This can be achieved by representing each edge as a pair of source and target vertices.
2. Instead of initializing the `state` vector with size `V` and setting all elements to zero, initialize it as a vector of size `V` with default value zero. This avoids unnecessary memory allocations and copies.
3. Use range-based loops (`for(auto& i : container)`) instead of index-based loops (`for(int i = 0; i < container.size(); i++)`) to minimize the number of iterations and improve readability.
4. Use a separate variable (`numZeroState`) to keep track of the number of vertices with zero incoming edges instead of iterating through the `state` vector to count them.
5. Use a single loop to process vertices with zero incoming edges and their adjacent vertices. This eliminates the need for a separate loop to update the `state` vector and reduces the number of iterations.
6. Use `reserve()` to preallocate memory for the `ans` vector, based on the expected number of vertices with zero incoming edges.
7. Use compiler optimizations, such as `-O3` optimization level, to enable aggressive optimizations.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int V, E;
  cin >> V >> E;
  vector<pair<int, int>> edge(E);
  vector<int> state(V, 0);
  for (auto& e : edge) {
    cin >> e.first >> e.second;
    state[e.second]++;
  }
  vector<int> ans;
  ans.reserve(V); // Preallocate memory for the ans vector
  int numZeroState = 0; // Number of vertices with zero incoming edges
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
    if (state[i] == 0) {
      ans.push_back(i);
      numZeroState++;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < numZeroState; i++) {
    int v = ans[i];
    for (auto& e : edge) {
      if (e.first == v) {
        int t = e.second;
        state[t]--;
        if (state[t] == 0) {
          ans.push_back(t);
          numZeroState++;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  for (auto& a : ans) {
    cout << a << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code uses an adjacency list representation for the graph using a vector of pairs (`edge`) instead of a vector of vectors. This reduces memory usage by eliminating the need for a separate vector for each vertex.

The code also utilizes range-based loops for improved readability and to minimize the number of iterations. It uses a separate variable (`numZeroState`) to keep track of the number of vertices with zero incoming edges, eliminating the need for iterating through the `state` vector to count them.

The optimizations made in the code minimize memory usage and reduce the number of iterations, resulting in improved performance.
