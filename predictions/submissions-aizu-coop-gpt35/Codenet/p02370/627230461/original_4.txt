The provided code implements a topological sorting algorithm to find a linear ordering of the vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The algorithm uses a vector of vectors (`edge`) to represent the graph, where each index `i` corresponds to a vertex and the vector at index `i` contains the vertices that have an outgoing edge from `i`. The algorithm also maintains a vector `state` to keep track of the number of incoming edges for each vertex.

Here are some potential optimizations that can be applied to improve the performance of the code:

1. Avoid resizing the `edge` vector: The current implementation initializes the `edge` vector with a fixed size of 10001, regardless of the actual number of vertices in the graph. This can lead to wasted memory if the number of vertices is significantly smaller than 10001. Instead, we can resize the `edge` vector after reading the number of vertices (`V`) from the input, reducing the memory footprint.

2. Use an unordered set for `ans`: The `ans` vector is used to store the vertices with no incoming edges. However, the order of the vertices in `ans` is not important, so we can use an unordered set to eliminate the need for a linear search when checking for duplicates. This will improve the performance of adding new vertices to `ans`.

3. Use a queue for processing vertices: The current implementation uses a nested loop to process the vertices in `ans` and update the `state` vector. Instead, we can use a queue data structure to process the vertices in a more efficient manner. This will reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.

4. Avoid unnecessary checks in the loops: The loops that iterate over `ans` and `edge[ans[i]]` perform unnecessary checks on the size of these vectors in every iteration. We can store the sizes in variables before the loops and reuse them, improving performance.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code.
