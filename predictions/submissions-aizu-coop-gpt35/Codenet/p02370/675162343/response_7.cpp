The provided code is a C++ program that performs a topological sort on a given directed acyclic graph (DAG) represented as an adjacency list. It takes as input the number of vertices (V) and edges (E) in the graph, followed by the source and target vertices for each edge. The program then performs the topological sort and outputs the sorted order of the vertices.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:
1. Memory Usage: The code currently uses unnecessary memory by storing the adjacency list as a vector of vectors. We can optimize this by using a more memory-efficient data structure.
2. Loop Optimization: The loops in the code can be optimized for better performance by reducing unnecessary computations and improving cache access patterns.
3. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can improve the performance of the code.
