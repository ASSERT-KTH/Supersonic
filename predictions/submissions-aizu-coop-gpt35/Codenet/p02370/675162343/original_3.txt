After analyzing the provided code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Data Structure: The code currently uses a vector of vectors to represent the adjacency list. However, this data structure is not the most efficient for this use case, as it requires dynamic memory allocation and can lead to cache misses. An alternative data structure that can provide better performance is a vector of arrays, where each array represents the neighbors of a vertex.

2. Redundant Computations: The code computes the `inorder` array, which stores the number of incoming edges for each vertex, twice. This computation can be optimized by merging the two loops into a single loop.

3. Loop Optimization: The inner loop in the topological sort algorithm iterates over the neighbors of a vertex in reverse order. This loop can be optimized by using an index-based loop instead of a range-based loop, as indexing can be more efficient than iterator-based access.

4. Compiler Optimization: Adding compiler optimizations can provide additional performance improvements. The code can benefit from enabling compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and function inlining. Additionally, using appropriate `#pragma` directives can provide hints to the compiler about loop optimizations.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization:

1. Efficient Data Structure:
   - Replace the `Adj_list` type definition with `vector<array<int, MAX_NEIGHBORS>>`, where `MAX_NEIGHBORS` is a predefined constant representing the maximum number of neighbors a vertex can have.
   - Modify the adjacency list initialization in the main function to use the new data structure.
   - This optimization improves memory usage and cache performance by avoiding dynamic memory allocation and reducing cache misses.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - Combine the two loops that compute the `inorder` array into a single loop.
   - Use a range-based loop to iterate over the neighbors of each vertex.
   - Instead of using the `Edge` struct, directly access the target vertex index.
   - Update the `inorder` array in the loop.
   - This optimization eliminates redundant computations and reduces the number of iterations.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - Modify the inner loop in the topological sort algorithm to use an index-based loop instead of a range-based loop.
   - Iterate over the neighbors of a vertex in reverse order by starting the loop index from `G[v].size() - 1` and decrementing it.
   - Replace the range-based loop variable `e` with direct indexing using the loop index.
   - This optimization improves loop performance by avoiding iterator-based access and simplifying the loop logic.

4. Compiler Optimization:
   - Enable compiler optimizations by passing appropriate flags during compilation, such as `-O3` for maximum optimization level.
   - Use `#pragma` directives to provide hints to the compiler about loop optimizations, such as loop unrolling or loop vectorization.
   - For example, you can use `#pragma unroll` before the inner loop in the topological sort algorithm to suggest loop unrolling.
