Code Analysis:
- The code implements a topological sorting algorithm to find the order of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- The graph is represented using an adjacency list, where each vertex is associated with a list of outgoing edges.
- The algorithm starts by calculating the in-degree of each vertex and initializes a stack `S` with all vertices having in-degree 0.
- It then iteratively pops a vertex from `S`, adds it to the topological order, and decreases the in-degree of its neighbors. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, it is pushed into `S`.
- The algorithm ensures that the graph is a DAG by asserting that all in-degrees become 0 after the sorting.

Potential Optimizations:
1. Pass the adjacency list by reference: The `topological_sort` function currently takes `G` (the adjacency list) by value, which creates a copy of the entire list. This can be avoided by passing `G` by reference, which reduces memory usage and improves performance.

2. Use a `set` or a `priority_queue` for `S`: The current implementation uses a `vector` to store the vertices with in-degree 0. However, when a vertex is pushed into `S`, it is not necessarily added at the end of the vector. Using a `set` or a `priority_queue` data structure instead of a `vector` can provide efficient insertion and removal of elements.

3. Use a `queue` for `topological_order`: The current implementation uses a `vector` to store the topological order. However, the order of insertion is not significant, and elements are always removed from the beginning. Using a `queue` data structure instead of a `vector` can provide efficient removal of elements from the front.

4. Use an `unordered_set` instead of `inorder` vector: The `inorder` vector is used to keep track of the in-degree of each vertex. However, accessing and updating elements in a `vector` has a time complexity of O(1), which can be improved to O(1) by using an `unordered_set` instead.

5. Use a range-based for loop for iterating over edges: The current implementation uses a traditional for loop to iterate over the outgoing edges of a vertex. Using a range-based for loop can simplify the code and potentially improve performance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Pass `G` by reference in the `topological_sort` function.
2. Replace the `S` vector with a `set` or `priority_queue`.
3. Replace the `topological_order` vector with a `queue`.
4. Replace the `inorder` vector with an `unordered_set`.
5. Use range-based for loops to iterate over edges.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Pass `G` by reference in the `topological_sort` function:
   - Change the function signature to: `vector<int> topological_sort(const Adj_list& G)`.
   - This avoids creating a copy of the adjacency list when the function is called, reducing memory usage and improving performance.

2. Replace the `S` vector with a `set` or `priority_queue`:
   - Replace `vector<int> S` with `set<int> S` or `priority_queue<int> S`.
   - Update the `push_back` and `pop_back` operations on `S` to `insert` and `erase` operations for `set`, or `push` and `pop` operations for `priority_queue`.
   - Using a `set` or `priority_queue` ensures efficient insertion and removal of elements.

3. Replace the `topological_order` vector with a `queue`:
   - Change the declaration of `topological_order` to `queue<int> topological_order`.
   - Replace the `push_back` operation with `push` and the `topological_order.push_back(v)` with `topological_order.push(v)`.
   - This ensures efficient removal of elements from the front of the queue.

4. Replace the `inorder` vector with an `unordered_set`:
   - Change the declaration of `inorder` to `unordered_set<int> inorder`.
   - Replace `inorder[i]++` with `inorder.insert(i)`.
   - Replace `inorder[i] == 0` with `inorder.count(i) == 0`.
   - Replace `inorder[i]--` with `inorder.erase(i)`.
   - This provides efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations on the in-degree values.

5. Use range-based for loops to iterate over edges:
   - Replace `for (Edge &e : G[i])` with `for (auto &e : G[i])`.
   - Replace `for (int i = G[v].size() - 1; i >= 0; i--)` with `for (auto it = G[v].rbegin(); it != G[v].rend(); ++it)`.
   - This simplifies the code and potentially improves performance by avoiding manual indexing.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct Edge {
  int tgt_;
  Edge(int t) { tgt_ = t; }
};

typedef vector<vector<Edge>> Adj_list;

vector<int> topological_sort(const Adj_list& G) {
  const int V = G.size();
  vector<int> topological_order;
  unordered_set<int> inorder;
  set<int> S;

  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
    for (auto &e : G[i]) {
      inorder.insert(e.tgt_);
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
    if (inorder.count(i) == 0) {
      S.insert(i);
    }
  }

  while (!S.empty()) {
    int v = *S.begin();
    S.erase(S.begin());
    topological_order.push(v);

    for (auto it = G[v].rbegin(); it != G[v].rend(); ++it) {
      Edge e = *it;
      inorder.erase(e.tgt_);
      if (inorder.count(e.tgt_) == 0) {
        S.insert(e.tgt_);
      }
    }
  }

  return topological_order;
}

int main() {
  int V, E;
  cin >> V >> E;
  Adj_list G(V);

  for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
    int s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    G[s].push_back(Edge(t));
  }

  vector<int> ans = topological_sort(G);

  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
    cout << ans[i] << endl;
  }
}
```
