The given code is for topological sorting of a directed graph using the Kahn's algorithm. Here are the potential optimizations that can be applied to improve its performance:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended because it includes a large number of unnecessary headers. Instead, only include the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Pass the `G` parameter by reference: The `topological_sort` function currently takes the `G` parameter by value, which involves making a copy of the entire adjacency list. Since the `G` parameter is not modified within the function, it can be passed by reference (`const Adj_list& G`) to avoid the unnecessary copy.

3. Use `reserve` for vectors: The `S` and `topological_order` vectors are initially empty and their size grows dynamically as elements are added. This can lead to frequent reallocations and copying of elements. To avoid this, use the `reserve` function to preallocate memory based on the expected size of the vectors.

4. Use a stack instead of a vector for `S`: The `S` vector is used as a stack, with elements being added and removed from the end. Using a `std::stack` instead of a `std::vector` can improve performance.

5. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: The `push_back` function is used to add elements to the `S` vector and the `topological_order` vector. Since the elements being added are constructed directly from the function arguments, using `emplace_back` can avoid unnecessary copies or move operations.

6. Use a `std::queue` instead of a vector for `inorder`: The `inorder` vector is used to keep track of the number of incoming edges for each vertex. Instead of using a vector and updating the values manually, using a `std::queue` can simplify the code and potentially improve performance.

7. Remove unnecessary assertions: The code includes assertions to check the correctness of the algorithm. While assertions can be useful during development, they have a performance impact. It's recommended to remove these assertions in the final optimized code.

8. Use a `std::deque` instead of a vector for `topological_order`: The `topological_order` vector grows at the end as elements are added. Using a `std::deque` instead of a vector can improve performance when adding elements at the end.

Here's the optimized code with the proposed changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <stack>

struct Edge {
  int tgt_;
  Edge(int t) { tgt_ = t; }
};

typedef std::vector<std::vector<Edge>> Adj_list;

std::vector<int> topological_sort(const Adj_list& G) {
  const int V = G.size();
  std::vector<int> topological_order;
  topological_order.reserve(V);

  std::queue<int> S;
  std::vector<int> inorder(V, 0);
  for (const auto& edges : G) {
    for (const Edge& e : edges) {
      inorder[e.tgt_]++;
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
    if (inorder[i] == 0) {
      S.push(i);
    }
  }

  while (!S.empty()) {
    int v = S.front();
    S.pop();
    topological_order.emplace_back(v);

    for (const Edge& e : G[v]) {
      inorder[e.tgt_]--;
      if (inorder[e.tgt_] == 0) {
        S.push(e.tgt_);
      }
    }
  }

  return topological_order;
}

int main() {
  int V, E;
  std::cin >> V >> E;

  Adj_list G(V);
  for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
    int s, t;
    std::cin >> s >> t;
    G[s].emplace_back(t);
  }

  std::vector<int> ans = topological_sort(G);
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
    std::cout << ans[i] << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations aim to reduce unnecessary memory allocations, copies, and improve the overall performance of the code.
