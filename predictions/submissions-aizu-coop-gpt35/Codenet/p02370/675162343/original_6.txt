Code Analysis:
1. The code defines a struct `Edge` which represents an edge in a directed graph. It contains a single member `tgt_` which represents the target vertex of the edge.
2. The code defines a type `Adj_list` which is a vector of vectors of `Edge`. It represents an adjacency list representation of a directed graph.
3. The function `topological_sort` takes an adjacency list `G` as input and returns a vector of integers representing the topological order of the vertices in the graph.
4. The main function reads the number of vertices `V` and edges `E` from input, constructs the adjacency list `G` based on the input, and then calls the `topological_sort` function to obtain the topological order of the vertices. Finally, it prints the topological order.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and copies:
   - The `topological_sort` function takes the adjacency list `G` by value, which means a copy of the entire graph is made when the function is called. This can be avoided by passing `G` by const reference instead.
   - The `S` vector is used as a stack to store the vertices with zero indegree. Instead of using a vector as a stack, we can use a `std::stack` container, which is more efficient for stack operations.
   - The `topological_order` vector is used to store the topological order. Instead of repeatedly appending elements to the end of the vector, we can use `std::deque` which provides efficient insertion at both ends.
2. Optimize the loop iterations:
   - The loop `for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)` is used multiple times to iterate over the vertices of the graph. It would be more efficient to store `V` in a variable and reuse it.
   - The loop `for (int i = G[v].size() - 1; i >= 0; i--)` is used to iterate over the edges of a vertex in reverse order. This loop can be optimized by storing `G[v].size()` in a variable and iterating from `size - 1` to `0`.
3. Enable compiler optimizations:
   - Use appropriate compiler flags (`-O2`, `-O3`, etc.) to enable optimization levels during compilation.
   - Add `#pragma` directives to provide hints to the compiler for loop unrolling or other optimizations if necessary.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Pass the adjacency list `G` to the `topological_sort` function by const reference instead of by value. This avoids making a copy of the entire graph when the function is called.
2. Replace the `S` vector with a `std::stack<int>` to improve stack operations.
3. Replace the `topological_order` vector with a `std::deque<int>` to improve insertion at both ends.
4. Store `V` in a variable and reuse it in the loops to avoid repeated calculations.
5. Store `G[v].size()` in a variable and iterate from `size - 1` to `0` in the inner loop.
6. Enable compiler optimizations by using appropriate compiler flags and add `#pragma` directives if necessary.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <deque>
#include <stack>

struct Edge {
  int tgt_;
  Edge(int t) { tgt_ = t; }
};

typedef std::vector<std::vector<Edge>> Adj_list;

std::vector<int> topological_sort(const Adj_list& G) {
  const int V = G.size();
  std::deque<int> topological_order;
  std::vector<int> inorder(V, 0);
  std::stack<int> S;

  for (const auto& edges : G) {
    for (const Edge& e : edges) {
      inorder[e.tgt_]++;
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
    if (inorder[i] == 0) {
      S.push(i);
    }
  }

  while (!S.empty()) {
    int v = S.top();
    S.pop();
    topological_order.push_back(v);

    int size = G[v].size();
    for (int i = size - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      Edge e = G[v][i];
      inorder[e.tgt_]--;
      if (inorder[e.tgt_] == 0) {
        S.push(e.tgt_);
      }
    }
  }

  return std::vector<int>(topological_order.begin(), topological_order.end());
}

int main() {
  int V, E;
  std::cin >> V >> E;
  Adj_list G(V);
  for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
    int s, t;
    std::cin >> s >> t;
    G[s].push_back(Edge(t));
  }
  std::vector<int> ans = topological_sort(G);
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
    std::cout << ans[i] << std::endl;
  }
}
```

The optimized code minimizes memory allocations and copies, optimizes loop iterations, and provides suggestions for enabling compiler optimizations. The changes made preserve the functionality and output of the original code while improving its efficiency.
