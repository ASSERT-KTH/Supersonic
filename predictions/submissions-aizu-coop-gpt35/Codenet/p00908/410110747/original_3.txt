The given code is a C++ program that solves a maze problem. The program takes as input the dimensions of a maze, the maze itself, and the starting and ending positions. It then calculates the minimum number of steps required to navigate from the starting position to the ending position, considering that the player can move in four directions (up, right, down, left) and can also make a jump.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Inefficient data structures: The code extensively uses vectors and queues, which can be quite inefficient for large inputs. It would be more efficient to replace them with arrays.

2. Redundant computations: The code recomputes distances and paths multiple times, resulting in unnecessary calculations. It would be more efficient to store the computed values and reuse them when needed.

3. Loop optimizations: The code contains loops that can be optimized through techniques such as loop unrolling or loop fusion.

4. Compiler optimizations: The code can benefit from compiler optimizations such as loop vectorization or function inlining.

Now, let's go through each of these optimizations step by step.

Optimization 1: Replace vectors and queues with arrays
------------------------------------------------------

In the given code, the vectors and queues are used extensively for storing and manipulating data. However, arrays are more efficient in terms of performance and memory usage. Therefore, we can replace the vectors and queues with arrays.

First, let's replace the `vector<vector<int>>` with a 2D array. Replace the following line:

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> field(H + 2, vector<int>(W + 2, true));
```

with:

```cpp
int field[62][62];
memset(field, true, sizeof(field));
```

Next, replace the `queue<aa>` with an array-based queue. Replace the following lines:

```cpp
queue<aa> que;
```

with:

```cpp
aa que[2500];
int front = 0, rear = 0;
```

Now, update the queue operations to use the array-based queue. Replace the following lines:

```cpp
que.push(aa{fx, fy, atop.turn + 1});
```

with:

```cpp
que[rear++] = aa{fx, fy, atop.turn + 1};
```

Replace the following lines:

```cpp
aa atop(que.front());
que.pop();
```

with:

```cpp
aa atop = que[front++];
```

Finally, replace the `priority_queue<bb>` with an array-based min-heap. Replace the following lines:

```cpp
priority_queue<bb, vector<bb>, Compare> que;
```

with:

```cpp
bb que[2500];
int heapSize = 0;
```

Update the heap operations to use the array-based min-heap. Replace the following lines:

```cpp
que.push(bb{fkx, fky, tway, fturn + amin});
```

with:

```cpp
que[heapSize++] = bb{fkx, fky, tway, fturn + amin};
```

Replace the following lines:

```cpp
bb atop(que.top());
que.pop();
```

with:

```cpp
bb atop = que[0];
std::pop_heap(que, que + heapSize--, Compare());
```

Optimization 2: Store computed values to avoid redundant computations
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In the given code, distances and paths are recomputed multiple times, resulting in redundant calculations. We can optimize this by storing the computed values and reusing them when needed.

First, let's create an array to store the distances. Add the following line before the while loop:

```cpp
int distances[62][62];
memset(distances, 999999, sizeof(distances));
```

Next, replace the distance calculation inside the while loop with a lookup in the `distances` array. Replace the following lines:

```cpp
memo[nexty][nextx] = atop.turn + 1;
```

with:

```cpp
distances[nexty][nextx] = atop.turn + 1;
```

Replace the following lines:

```cpp
atime += getdis(field, fx, fy, gx, gy);
```

with:

```cpp
atime += distances[gx][gy];
```

Finally, let's create an array to store the computed values for `memo2`. Add the following line before the while loop:

```cpp
int memo2[62][62][4];
memset(memo2, 999999, sizeof(memo2));
```

Replace the following lines:

```cpp
memo2[kx][ky][way] = amin;
```

with:

```cpp
memo2[kx][ky][way] = amin;
```

Replace the following lines:

```cpp
memo2[fkx][fky][tway] = fturn + amin;
```

with:

```cpp
memo2[fkx][fky][tway] = fturn + amin;
```

Optimization 3: Loop optimizations
---------------------------------

The given code contains loops that can be optimized for better performance. Let's optimize these loops.

First, let's optimize the loops used to initialize the `field` array. Replace the following lines:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < H; ++i) {
  string st;
  cin >> st;
  for (int j = 0; j < W; ++j) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

with:

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= H; ++i) {
  for (int j = 1; j <= W; ++j) {
    char c;
    cin >> c;
    if (c == 'X') {
      kx = min(kx, j);
      ky = min(ky, i);
      field[i][j] = false;
    } else if (c == 'o') {
      field[i][j] = false;
    } else if (c == '.') {
      field[i][j] = false;
      ox[num] = j;
      oy[num] = i;
      num++;
    }
  }
}
```

Next, let's optimize the loop used to initialize `memo2`. Replace the following lines:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 60; ++i) {
  for (int j = 0; j < 60; ++j) {
    for (int k = 0; k < 4; ++k) {
      memo2[i][j][k] = 999999;
    }
  }
}
```

with:

```cpp
memset(memo2, 999999, sizeof(memo2));
```

Optimization 4: Compiler optimizations
--------------------------------------

We can leverage compiler optimizations to further improve the performance of the code. Compiler optimizations such as loop vectorization or function inlining can significantly improve the execution speed.

To enable compiler optimizations, you can use pragma directives. Add the following line at the beginning of the code:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("O3")
```

This pragma directive will hint the compiler to optimize the code with level 3 optimization.

Here is the complete optimized code:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;
const int dx[4] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
const int dy[4] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
const int dx2[4] = {-1, 0, 2, 1};
const int dy2[4] = {0, 2, 1, -1};
struct aa {
  int x;
  int y;
  int turn;
};
int getdis(const int field[62][62], const int fx, const int fy,
           const int gx, const int gy) {
  int ans = 999999;
  aa que[2500];
  int front = 0, rear = 0;
  int memo[62][62];
  memset(memo, 999999, sizeof(memo));
  que[rear++] = aa{fx, fy, 0};
  while (front < rear) {
    aa atop = que[front++];
    if (atop.x == gx && atop.y == gy) {
      ans = atop.turn;
      break;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
      const int nextx = atop.x + dx[i];
      const int nexty = atop.y + dy[i];
      if (!field[nexty][nextx]) {
        if (atop.turn + 1 < memo[nexty][nextx]) {
          memo[nexty][nextx] = atop.turn + 1;
          que[rear++] = aa{nextx, nexty, atop.turn + 1};
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return ans;
}
struct bb {
  int kx;
  int ky;
  int opway;
  int turn;
};
class Compare {
public:
  bool operator()(const bb &l, const bb &r) { return l.turn > r.turn; }
};
int
