The given code appears to solve a problem involving a maze and finding the shortest path from a start point to an end point. While the logic seems correct, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency. 

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The code uses a 2D vector `field` to represent the maze. However, the vector is of type `vector<vector<int>>`, which is not the most memory-efficient representation. Since the maze only contains boolean values (true/false), it can be represented using a 2D vector of type `vector<vector<bool>>`, which will reduce memory usage.
   - The code uses a priority queue to store the possible paths. However, the priority queue is implemented using a custom comparison operator, which adds unnecessary complexity. Instead, a simpler data structure like a deque or a vector can be used, and the paths can be sorted using `std::sort` when needed.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The code repeatedly recalculates the shortest distance between two points in the maze using the `getdis` function. This function uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to calculate the distance. Instead of recalculating the distance each time, the distances can be precomputed and stored in a lookup table, reducing redundant computations.

3. Unoptimized Loops:
   - The code initializes the `memo2` array with a value of `999999` in a nested loop. Instead, the `memset` function can be used to initialize the array to a specific value, which is faster than using nested loops.
   - The code uses nested loops to iterate over the elements of the `field` vector and set the values to `true` or `false`. Instead, the `std::fill` function can be used to set all elements of the vector to a specific value in a single operation, which is more efficient.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - The code can benefit from compiler optimizations. Adding compiler-specific optimization flags (e.g., `-O2` for GCC) can instruct the compiler to apply various optimization techniques, such as loop unrolling and function inlining, which can improve performance.
