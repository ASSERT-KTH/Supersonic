The given code is a program that solves a maze problem. It takes input from the user to define the maze dimensions, and then reads the maze data. It uses a recursive function called `func` to find the number of paths from the top row to the bottom row. The function `jump` is used to handle jumps in the maze.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify the following potential optimizations:

1. Reducing Memory Usage:
   - The `data` array is used to store the maze data. However, the size of this array is fixed to `N x N`, which is larger than the actual maze size. We can reduce memory usage by dynamically allocating the `data` array based on the input dimensions `X` and `Y`.
   - The `memo` array is used to store the number of paths from each cell. Similar to the `data` array, we can dynamically allocate the `memo` array based on the input dimensions.

2. Eliminating Redundant Computations:
   - The `memo` array is initialized with zeros before each test case. However, we can avoid this initialization by using `memset` to set the entire `memo` array to zero.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The loops that iterate over the maze rows and columns can be optimized by using loop unrolling. This can improve memory access and cache utilization.

4. Compiler Optimization:
   - We can suggest the compiler to optimize the code by using compiler-specific pragma directives, such as `#pragma omp` or `#pragma GCC optimize`.

Let's apply these optimizations step-by-step to the code.
