Code Analysis:
- The code takes input values for X and Y, and then reads a 2D array of size YxX.
- The array represents a grid, with each cell containing either 0, 1, or 2.
- The goal is to count the number of paths from the top row to the bottom row following certain rules:
    - The path must only move downwards, either directly or diagonally.
    - The cells with a value of 1 must be avoided.
    - If a cell has a value of 2, the path can jump to another cell in the same column, skipping the cells with a value of 1.
- The function `func()` is recursively called to count the paths.
- The function `jump()` is used to handle the jumping behavior when a cell has a value of 2.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. Recursion: The function `func()` is called recursively, which can lead to excessive function calls and stack usage.
2. Redundant Computations: The function `func()` performs redundant checks for the same cell multiple times.
3. Inefficient Data Structures: The use of 2D arrays for `data` and `memo` can be improved for better cache performance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace Recursion with Iteration: Replace the recursive calls to `func()` with an iterative solution to improve performance and reduce stack usage.
2. Eliminate Redundant Computations: Avoid redundant computations by storing the results of previous calculations in `memo`.
3. Optimize Data Structures:
   - Use a 1D array instead of a 2D array for `data` to improve cache performance.
   - Use a 1D array instead of a 2D array for `memo` to improve cache performance and reduce memory usage.
4. Compiler Optimization: Use compiler optimizations and pragmas to hint the compiler for potential optimizations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace Recursion with Iteration:
   - The recursive calls to `func()` can be replaced with an iterative solution using a stack.
   - Create a stack to store the positions `(y, x)` that need to be processed.
   - Push the initial position `(0, i)` into the stack for each starting column `i`.
   - Process the stack until it becomes empty, popping positions and updating the `memo` array accordingly.
   - This iterative approach eliminates the overhead of function calls and reduces stack usage.

2. Eliminate Redundant Computations:
   - Instead of checking for the same cell multiple times, store the results of previous calculations in the `memo` array.
   - Before making a recursive call to `func()`, check if the result is already calculated and stored in `memo`.
   - If the result is already present, use it directly instead of making the recursive call.
   - This optimization avoids redundant computations and improves performance.

3. Optimize Data Structures:
   - Replace the 2D array `data[N][N]` with a 1D array `data[N * N]` to improve cache performance.
     - Access to contiguous memory locations in a 1D array is faster than accessing elements in a 2D array.
     - The 1D array can be accessed using the formula `data[y * X + x]` instead of `data[y][x]`.
   - Replace the 2D array `memo[N][N]` with a 1D array `memo[N * N]` to improve cache performance and reduce memory usage.
     - The 1D array can be accessed using the formula `memo[y * X + x]` instead of `memo[y][x]`.
     - Initialize all elements of `memo` to 0 before processing.

4. Compiler Optimization:
   - Enable compiler optimizations to allow the compiler to apply various optimizations.
   - Use pragmas or compiler directives specific to the compiler being used to provide hints for potential optimizations.
   - For example, using `-O3` optimization level with GCC or Clang can significantly improve the performance of the code.
