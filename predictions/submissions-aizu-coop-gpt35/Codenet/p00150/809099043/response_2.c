The given code is a program that finds pairs of prime numbers, where the difference between the two primes is 2. The program takes an input integer `n` and iterates from `n` downwards, checking if each number and the number two less than it are prime. If a pair is found, it is printed, and the program continues to the next iteration until `n` becomes 0.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. `isprime1` function: This function checks whether a given number is prime. The current implementation iterates from 2 to `n-1`, checking if `n` is divisible by any number in that range. This approach is not efficient for large values of `n`. We can optimize this function to reduce the number of iterations.

2. `for` loop in the `main` function: The loop iterates from `n` to 5, checking for pairs of primes. However, there is a mistake in the loop condition (`n >= 5` instead of `i >= 5`). Additionally, the loop starts from `n` and iterates downwards, but it would be more efficient to start from `n-2`, as the difference between the primes is always 2.
