The given code reads three integers from the user and then iterates from `a` to `b`, checking if `c` is divisible by each number in the range. The code keeps count of the number of divisors found and then prints the count.

Here are a few potential optimizations that can be applied to improve the performance and memory usage of the code:

1. Initialize Variables: The variables `s` and `t` are not initialized before being used. It's good practice to initialize variables to a known value to avoid any potential bugs. In this case, `s` should be initialized to `a` and `t` should be initialized to `0`.

2. Reduce Number of Division Operations: Currently, the code performs a division operation (`c % s`) in each iteration of the loop. Division operations can be computationally expensive, especially if they involve large numbers. To optimize this, we can divide `c` by `s` once before the loop and store the result in a temporary variable. Then, we can check if the temporary variable is equal to zero instead of performing the division operation in each iteration. This change will reduce the number of division operations from `b - a + 1` to just one.

3. Efficient Data Types: The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `s`, and `t` are declared as `int` types. However, if the input values are guaranteed to be within a smaller range, we can use more memory-efficient data types like `short int` or `unsigned int` to save memory.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Depending on the compiler being used, there may be specific compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can be applied to improve the performance of the code. For example, using optimization flags like `-O3` can enable aggressive optimizations by the compiler.

Here is the optimized version of the code with the above optimizations applied:
