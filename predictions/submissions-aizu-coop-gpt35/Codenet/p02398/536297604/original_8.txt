The provided code reads three integers from the user and then iterates over all numbers from `a` to `b` (inclusive). For each number `s`, it checks if `c` is divisible by `s` and increments `t` if it is. Finally, it prints the value of `t`.

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Initialize variables: The variable `t` is not initialized before it is used. This can lead to undefined behavior. We should initialize it to zero before the loop.

2. Loop optimization: Instead of iterating over all numbers from `a` to `b`, we can optimize the loop by only considering divisors of `c`. We know that if `c` is divisible by `s`, then there must be a corresponding divisor `d` such that `d * s = c`. So, instead of checking all numbers from `a` to `b`, we can check all numbers from `a` to `sqrt(c)`. This optimization reduces the number of iterations required.

3. Variable declaration: We can declare variables closer to their usage to improve code readability.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can enable compiler optimizations to allow the compiler to optimize the code for us. Compiler optimizations can vary depending on the compiler being used, but common optimization flags include `-O2` or `-O3`. Additionally, we can use the `constexpr` keyword for compile-time evaluation of expressions.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  std::cin >> a >> b >> c;
  
  int t = 0;
  int sqrt_c = std::sqrt(c);

  for (int s = a; s <= sqrt_c; s++) {
    if (c % s == 0) {
      t++;
      
      // Check if the divisor is not repeated
      int d = c / s;
      if (d != s && d >= a && d <= b) {
        t++;
      }
    }
  }

  std::cout << t << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have reduced the number of iterations in the loop from `b - a + 1` to `sqrt(c) - a + 1`, resulting in a significant performance improvement when `b - a` is large. We have also added a check to avoid counting the same divisor twice.

The trade-off for this optimization is increased code complexity due to the additional check for repeated divisors. However, the performance gain is worth the added complexity.
