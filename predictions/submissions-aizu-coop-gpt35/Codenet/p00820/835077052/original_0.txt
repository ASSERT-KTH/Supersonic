Code Analysis:
1. The code uses a multidimensional array `dp` to store the number of ways to represent a number `n` as the sum of squares of `k` integers.
2. The code uses nested loops to calculate the values of `dp`.
3. The code uses the `memset` function to initialize the `dp` array to 0 at the beginning of each test case.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the nested loops with a single loop to reduce the number of iterations.
2. Use a one-dimensional array instead of a two-dimensional array to store the values of `dp`.
3. Use a temporary variable to store the sum of squares instead of calculating it multiple times in the loop.
4. Use the `constexpr` keyword to make the `EPS` variable a compile-time constant.
5. Use the `constexpr` keyword to make the `tx` and `ty` arrays compile-time constants.
6. Use the `constexpr` keyword to make the `INF` constant a compile-time constant.
7. Use the `constexpr` keyword to make the `dp` array size a compile-time constant.
8. Use the `pragma` directive to enable loop unrolling for the inner loop.
9. Use the `pragma` directive to enable vectorization for the inner loop.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the nested loops with a single loop to reduce the number of iterations:
   - Instead of iterating over `i` and `j` separately, we can iterate over the values of `j` directly.
   - This reduces the number of iterations from `O(n^2)` to `O(n)`.
   
2. Use a one-dimensional array instead of a two-dimensional array to store the values of `dp`:
   - Since the values of `k` range from 1 to 4, we can use a one-dimensional array of size 5 instead of a two-dimensional array.
   - This reduces the memory usage and improves cache locality.
   
3. Use a temporary variable to store the sum of squares instead of calculating it multiple times in the loop:
   - Instead of calculating `i * i` multiple times in the inner loop, we can calculate it once and store it in a temporary variable.
   - This reduces the number of multiplications and improves performance.
   
4. Use the `constexpr` keyword to make the `EPS` variable a compile-time constant:
   - The `EPS` variable is a constant and its value does not change during runtime.
   - By making it a compile-time constant, the compiler can optimize the code by replacing the variable with its value directly.
   
5. Use the `constexpr` keyword to make the `tx` and `ty` arrays compile-time constants:
   - The `tx` and `ty` arrays are constants and their values do not change during runtime.
   - By making them compile-time constants, the compiler can optimize the code by replacing the arrays with their values directly.
   
6. Use the `constexpr` keyword to make the `INF` constant a compile-time constant:
   - The `INF` constant is a constant and its value does not change during runtime.
   - By making it a compile-time constant, the compiler can optimize the code by replacing the constant with its value directly.
   
7. Use the `constexpr` keyword to make the `dp` array size a compile-time constant:
   - The size of the `dp` array is a constant and its value does not change during runtime.
   - By making it a compile-time constant, the compiler can optimize the code by allocating the array on the stack instead of the heap.
   
8. Use the `pragma` directive to enable loop unrolling for the inner loop:
   - Loop unrolling is a compiler optimization technique that reduces loop overhead by executing multiple loop iterations in parallel.
   - By enabling loop unrolling, the compiler can generate more efficient code that reduces the number of loop iterations and improves performance.
   
9. Use the `pragma` directive to enable vectorization for the inner loop:
   - Vectorization is a compiler optimization technique that allows the use of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions to perform multiple calculations in parallel.
   - By enabling vectorization, the compiler can generate more efficient code that utilizes the SIMD capabilities of the processor and improves performance.
