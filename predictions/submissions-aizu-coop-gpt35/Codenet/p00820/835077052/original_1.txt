The provided code calculates the number of ways to represent a given number `n` as the sum of four squares. It uses a dynamic programming approach to fill a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to represent `i` as the sum of `j` squares. The code then prints the sum of `dp[n][4]`, `dp[n][3]`, `dp[n][2]`, and `dp[n][1]`.

Upon initial analysis, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant calculation of `i * i` in the innermost loop.
2. The use of a 2D array `dp` to store the number of ways to represent a number as the sum of squares.
3. The use of a nested loop structure.

Now, let's discuss each of these potential optimizations in detail and provide a step-by-step explanation of the proposed changes.

**Optimization 1: Redundant calculation of `i * i`**
In the innermost loop, the code calculates `i * i` repeatedly. We can avoid this redundant calculation by calculating `i * i` once outside the loop and storing it in a variable.

**Optimization 2: Efficient data structure**
The use of a 2D array `dp` to store the number of ways to represent a number as the sum of squares can be improved. Since we only need to keep track of the values for the current iteration and the previous iteration, we can use two 1D arrays instead of a 2D array.

**Optimization 3: Loop structure**
The nested loop structure can be optimized by eliminating unnecessary iterations. We can limit the range of the outer loop to `i * i <= n` to avoid unnecessary calculations. Additionally, we can optimize the innermost loop by starting from `j = i * i` instead of `j = 1`.

Now, let's implement these optimizations in the code.
