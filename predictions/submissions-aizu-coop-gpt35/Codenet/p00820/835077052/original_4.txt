Code Analysis:
- The code uses several unnecessary includes. For example, we don't need the `#include <bitset>` or `#include <deque>` in this program.
- The code defines a large array `dp[1000000][5]`, which may consume a significant amount of memory if `n` is close to 1000000. We can optimize the memory usage by only allocating the necessary amount of memory.
- The code uses a nested loop to compute the values of `dp`. This can be a potential performance bottleneck, especially if `n` is large. We can optimize this loop to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.
- The code uses `memset` to initialize `dp` with zeros. However, since we only need to initialize the first row of `dp`, we can optimize this by initializing only one row at a time.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the unnecessary includes of `<bitset>` and `<deque>`.
2. Optimize memory usage: Instead of allocating a large array `dp[1000000][5]`, we can allocate a 2D array dynamically based on the value of `n`.
3. Optimize the loop for computing `dp`: Instead of using a nested loop, we can optimize the computation of `dp` by using a single loop and updating the values of `dp` in a bottom-up manner.
4. Use `vector` instead of `array`: Instead of using a C-style 2D array, we can use a `vector` of `vector` to store the dynamic 2D array `dp`.
5. Use `reserve` for `vector` capacity: Since we know the size of the dynamic 2D array `dp` in advance, we can use `vector::reserve` to pre-allocate memory and avoid reallocations during the computation.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes:
   - Remove the lines `#include <bitset>` and `#include <deque>`.

2. Optimize memory usage:
   - Replace the line `int dp[1000000][5];` with `vector<vector<int>> dp(5, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));`.
   - This creates a dynamic 2D array `dp` with the necessary size based on the value of `n`.

3. Optimize the loop for computing `dp`:
   - Replace the nested loop with a single loop:
     - Change the loop condition in the outer loop from `i * i <= n` to `i <= n`.
     - Replace the inner loops with a single loop starting from `j = i * i`.
   - Update the values of `dp` in a bottom-up manner:
     - Replace the line `dp[j][k] += dp[j - i * i][k - 1];` with `dp[k][j] += dp[k - 1][j - i * i];`.

4. Use `vector` instead of `array`:
   - Replace the line `int dp[1000000][5];` with `vector<vector<int>> dp(5, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));`.

5. Use `reserve` for `vector` capacity:
   - Add the line `dp.reserve(n + 1);` after the line `memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));`.
   - This pre-allocates memory for the `dp` vector, avoiding reallocations during the computation.

This optimized code reduces unnecessary memory usage by dynamically allocating the `dp` array based on the value of `n`. It also optimizes the computation of `dp` by using a single loop and updating the values in a bottom-up manner. The use of `vector` instead of `array` allows for more efficient memory management. Additionally, the `reserve` function is used to pre-allocate memory for the `dp` vector, avoiding reallocations during the computation. Overall, these optimizations improve the efficiency of the code.
