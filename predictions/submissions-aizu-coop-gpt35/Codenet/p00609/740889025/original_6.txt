The given code calculates the number of points within a given range by comparing the distance between each point and a set of query points. The code uses a vector of vectors to store the points and sorts each sub-vector before performing the calculations. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance:

1. Avoiding unnecessary vector sorting: The code sorts each sub-vector of points before performing the calculations. However, since the code only needs to count the number of points within a range, sorting the sub-vectors is unnecessary. We can remove the sorting step to improve performance.

2. Improving memory usage: The code uses a fixed-size array of vectors to store the points. This can lead to inefficient memory usage when the number of points is small. We can optimize the memory usage by using a map instead of an array. The map will dynamically allocate memory only for the necessary sub-vectors.

3. Reducing function calls: The code calls functions like `upper_bound`, `lower_bound`, and `sqrt` inside nested loops. These function calls can be expensive and may impact performance. We can optimize the code by reducing the number of function calls.

4. Minimizing repeated calculations: The code calculates `D = 4 * R` inside the loop for each query point. This calculation can be moved outside the loop since it remains constant throughout the execution.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code block.
