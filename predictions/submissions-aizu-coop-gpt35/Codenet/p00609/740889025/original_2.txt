Code Analysis:
1. The code reads three inputs: aN, bN, and R.
2. It then enters a while loop that continues until the value of aN becomes zero.
3. Inside the while loop, the code clears the vector v and populates it with values from the input.
4. It then sorts each vector in v.
5. The code calculates D as 4 times R and initializes ans to zero.
6. Inside the next for loop, the code reads inputs and performs a calculation involving the vectors v.
7. Finally, the code prints the value of ans.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a more efficient data structure to store the vectors v.
2. Avoid using the sqrt function, as it is computationally expensive.
3. Replace the upper_bound and lower_bound functions with a binary search algorithm.
4. Use compiler optimizations to improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the vector of vectors v with a map.
   - The current implementation uses a vector of vectors to store the values. However, this results in inefficient memory usage and slower lookup times.
   - By using a map instead, we can directly access each vector using its key, which is the y-coordinate. This will reduce memory usage and improve lookup times.

2. Replace the sqrt function with a squared distance check.
   - The code currently calculates the value of m using the sqrt function, which is computationally expensive.
   - Instead of finding the square root, we can use the squared distance check to compare distances. This will save computation time.

3. Replace the upper_bound and lower_bound functions with a binary search algorithm.
   - The code currently uses the upper_bound and lower_bound functions to find the range of values within each vector.
   - By implementing a binary search algorithm, we can find the range more efficiently, reducing the number of comparisons performed.

4. Use compiler optimizations.
   - We can enable compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code.
   - This can be done by setting appropriate compiler flags or using pragma directives to hint the compiler on specific optimizations.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
map<int, vector<int>> v;

int main() {
  int aN, bN, R;
  while (cin >> aN >> bN >> R, aN) {
    v.clear();
    for (int i = 0; i < aN; i++) {
      int x, y;
      scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);
      v[y].push_back(x);
    }
    for (auto& entry : v) {
      sort(entry.second.begin(), entry.second.end());
    }
    int D = 4 * R, ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < bN; i++) {
      int x, y;
      scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);
      for (int p = -D; p <= D; p++) {
        if (y + p < 0 || y + p >= 10000)
          continue;
        int m = (D - p) * (D + p);
        int left = 0, right = v[y + p].size();
        int low = 0, high = right;
        while (low < high) {
          int mid = (low + high) / 2;
          if (v[y + p][mid] >= x - m) {
            high = mid;
          } else {
            low = mid + 1;
          }
        }
        left = low;
        low = 0, high = right;
        while (low < high) {
          int mid = (low + high) / 2;
          if (v[y + p][mid] > x + m) {
            high = mid;
          } else {
            low = mid + 1;
          }
        }
        right = low;
        ans += right - left;
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

The optimized code makes the following changes:
1. Replaces the vector of vectors v with a map<int, vector<int>> v.
   - This change improves memory usage and lookup times.
2. Replaces the sqrt function with a squared distance check.
   - Instead of calculating m using sqrt, we directly compute the squared distance.
   - This saves computation time by avoiding the expensive sqrt operation.
3. Replaces the upper_bound and lower_bound functions with a binary search algorithm.
   - The binary search algorithm efficiently finds the range of values within each vector.
   - This reduces the number of comparisons performed, improving performance.
4. No changes have been made to enable compiler optimizations.
