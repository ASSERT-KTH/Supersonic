Before diving into the optimization steps, let's first analyze the code and identify potential performance bottlenecks:

1. The code uses a set data structure to store points. However, iterating over the set to find points within a certain range can be inefficient, especially when the set becomes large.

2. The code calculates the distance between two points using the `dist2` function. However, this function uses the `square` function, which involves an unnecessary function call and multiplication.

3. The code uses two nested loops in the `PlaneSweep` function to iterate over the points. This can potentially be optimized to reduce the number of iterations.

Now, let's formulate an optimization strategy to address these issues:

1. Replace the set data structure with a more efficient data structure for storing points. One possible alternative is to use a vector and sort it once instead of using sets.

2. Optimize the distance calculation by directly calculating the squared distance without using the `square` function.

3. Optimize the nested loops in the `PlaneSweep` function by using a single loop and keeping track of the number of points within the specified range.

4. Use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and optimization flags, to improve the performance further.

Now, let's explain each optimization step in detail:

1. Replace the set data structure with a vector: 
   - The set data structure has a logarithmic time complexity for insertion and lookup, which can be slow for large sets.
   - By using a vector and sorting it once, we can achieve a time complexity of O(n log n) for the sorting step and O(n) for the lookup step.
   - This change reduces memory usage and improves the performance of the code.

2. Optimize the distance calculation:
   - Instead of using the `square` function, we can directly calculate the squared distance between two points.
   - This change eliminates the need for a function call and multiplication, resulting in a faster distance calculation.

3. Optimize the nested loops in the `PlaneSweep` function:
   - Instead of using two nested loops to iterate over the points, we can use a single loop and keep track of the number of points within the specified range.
   - This change reduces the number of iterations and improves the overall efficiency of the code.

4. Use compiler optimizations:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and optimization flags, to further improve the performance of the code.
   - Compiler optimizations can help inlining functions, removing unnecessary code, and applying various optimizations at the machine code level.
