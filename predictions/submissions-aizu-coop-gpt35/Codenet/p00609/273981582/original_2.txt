Analysis:

1. The code uses the `set` data structure from the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) to store and manage points. However, using a `set` to store and search for points can be inefficient, especially when the number of points is large. The `set` data structure has a time complexity of O(log n) for insertion, deletion, and search operations.

2. The code sorts the `event` array using the `sort` function from the STL. Sorting an array of `Event` objects can be computationally expensive, especially when the number of events is large. The `sort` function has a time complexity of O(n log n).

3. The code calculates the distance between two points using the `dist2` function, which involves square root calculations. Square root calculations are computationally expensive and can be avoided in some cases.

4. The code uses the `printf` function from the C Standard Library to output the results. However, using `printf` can be slower than using the C++ stream output operator `<<`.

Optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `set` data structure with a more efficient data structure for storing and searching points. One possible alternative is to use a `vector` and perform a linear search instead of using a binary search. This can be faster when the number of points is small.

2. Avoid sorting the `event` array by using a different data structure or algorithm that does not require sorting. One possible alternative is to use a priority queue to process events in the order of their x-coordinates.

3. Improve the distance calculation by avoiding square root calculations. Instead of calculating the distance as the square root of the sum of squared differences, compare the squared distances directly.

4. Replace the use of `printf` with the C++ stream output operator `<<` for better performance.
