To optimize the given code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary header files such as `<algorithm>`, `<assert.h>`, `<math.h>`, and `<string.h>`. These can be removed as they are not used in the code.

2. Avoid unnecessary typedefs: The `typedef long long ll` is not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Avoid unnecessary constant declarations: The constants `EPS` and `PI` are not used in the code and can be removed.

4. Use `constexpr` instead of `#define` for constants: Instead of using `#define` for macros like `REP`, `FOR`, `FOREQ`, and `FORIT`, we can use `constexpr` variables to achieve the same effect. This will allow better type checking and compile-time evaluation.

5. Avoid unnecessary copying of Point objects: The function `dist2` takes its arguments by value, resulting in unnecessary copying of Point objects. We can change its signature to take Point objects by const reference to avoid the copy.

6. Optimize distance calculation: The `dist2` function currently calculates the square of the Euclidean distance between two points using the `square` function. We can optimize this calculation by directly calculating the square of the distance without using a separate function.

7. Optimize the PlaneSweep function: The PlaneSweep function uses a set of Points to store the open points. However, the use of a set requires logarithmic time complexity for insertion and deletion operations. We can optimize this by using a vector instead of a set and sorting it once at the beginning. This will allow us to perform binary search on the sorted vector instead of using lower_bound and upper_bound for every iteration.

8. Remove unnecessary constructor calls: The default constructors for the Point and Event structs are unnecessary as they are immediately overwritten with meaningful values. We can remove these constructor calls to improve performance.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Point {
  int x;
  int y;
  char type;
};

struct Event {
  int x;
  Point p;
  char in;
};

constexpr int square(int x) {
  return x * x;
}

constexpr int dist2(const Point& a, const Point& b) {
  return square(a.x - b.x) + square(a.y - b.y);
}

int PlaneSweep(const std::vector<Event>& events, int n, int r) {
  int ans = 0;
  std::vector<Point> open[2];
  for (const Event& e : events) {
    const Point& p = e.p;
    if (e.in) {
      auto lower = std::lower_bound(open[(int)p.type ^ 1].begin(), open[(int)p.type ^ 1].end(), Point{0, p.y - 4 * r - 1, 0});
      auto upper = std::upper_bound(open[(int)p.type ^ 1].begin(), open[(int)p.type ^ 1].end(), Point{0, p.y + 4 * r + 1, 0});
      for (auto it = lower; it != upper; ++it) {
        if (dist2(*it, p) <= 16 * r * r) {
          ans++;
        }
      }
      open[(int)p.type].push_back(p);
    } else {
      auto it = std::find(open[(int)p.type].begin(), open[(int)p.type].end(), p);
      if (it != open[(int)p.type].end()) {
        open[(int)p.type].erase(it);
      }
    }
  }
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  int an, bn, r;
  while (std::cin >> an >> bn >> r, an | bn) {
    int n = (an + bn) * 2;
    std::vector<Event> events(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < an; ++i) {
      int x, y;
      std::cin >> x >> y;
      events[2 * i + 0] = {x - 2 * r, {x, y, 0}, 1};
      events[2 * i + 1] = {x + 2 * r, {x, y, 0}, 0};
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < bn; ++i) {
      int x, y;
      std::cin >> x >> y;
      events[2 * an + 2 * i + 0] = {x - 2 * r, {x, y, 1}, 1};
      events[2 * an + 2 * i + 1] = {x + 2 * r, {x, y, 1}, 0};
    }
    std::sort(events.begin(), events.end(), [](const Event& a, const Event& b) {
      if (a.x != b.x) {
        return a.x < b.x;
      }
      return a.in > b.in;
    });
    int ans = PlaneSweep(events, n, r);
    std::cout << ans << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations aim to reduce unnecessary computations, improve data structure choices, and minimize memory usage. By avoiding unnecessary includes, typedefs, and constant declarations, we reduce the code's complexity and improve compile-time. Additionally, by optimizing the distance calculation and using a vector instead of a set for storing open points, we reduce the time complexity and memory usage of the PlaneSweep function. Overall, these optimizations should result in improved performance and reduced memory footprint.
