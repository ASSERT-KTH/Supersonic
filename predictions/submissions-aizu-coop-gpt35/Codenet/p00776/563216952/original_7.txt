The given code generates all possible permutations of a given string `s` and prints them in lexicographical order. However, the code can be optimized in several ways to improve its performance and reduce memory usage.

1. Avoid unnecessary includes:
   The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. It is better to include only the required headers.

2. Avoid using macros:
   The macro `rep(i, a, n)` is defined to simplify the iteration loop. However, macros can be error-prone and difficult to debug. It is better to use standard loop constructs instead.

3. Avoid unnecessary global variables:
   The variables `s`, `vs`, and `f` are declared globally but are only used within the `main` function. It is better to declare them within the `main` function to improve code readability and maintainability.

4. Reduce unnecessary memory usage:
   The vector `vs` is used to store all the permutations of the string `s`. However, this can consume a significant amount of memory, especially for large values of `s`. Instead of storing all the permutations, we can count the number of permutations and print only the required ones.

5. Avoid unnecessary string copies:
   The `dfs` function creates a temporary copy of the string `t` for each recursive call. This can be avoided by passing the string by reference.

6. Optimize the permutation generation:
   The current approach generates all possible permutations by recursively iterating through the string `t` and checking if the next character can be incremented. This can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the next_permutation algorithm from the C++ standard library.

7. Optimize the printing of permutations:
   The code prints both the first 5 and last 5 permutations if the total number of permutations is greater than 10. This requires iterating through the `vs` vector twice. Instead, we can print all the permutations in a single loop, avoiding unnecessary iterations.

8. Enable compiler optimizations:
   The code can benefit from enabling compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and vectorization. This can be achieved by using compiler-specific pragmas or flags.

Taking into consideration the above optimization strategies, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and optimized code implementation.
