The given code generates all possible permutations of a given string `s` and prints them in lexicographical order. However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized for better performance and memory usage.

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The `vector<string> vs` is used to store all the permutations. However, using a vector here is not the most efficient choice, as it requires resizing and copying elements whenever a new permutation is added. A more efficient alternative would be to use a `set<string>` to store the permutations, which automatically maintains a sorted order and avoids duplicates.
   - The `bool f[26]` array is used to check if a character has already been used in a permutation. However, this array is not necessary, as the same information can be obtained from the `string t` itself. Removing this array will save memory.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `d` array is used to count the frequency of characters in the prefix of the current permutation `t`. However, this computation can be avoided by using the `t` string itself. Instead of incrementing the count in `d` for each character, we can check if the count in `t` is greater than 0. This will eliminate the need for the `d` array.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The `dfs` function uses recursion to generate permutations. However, this recursive approach can be optimized by converting it into an iterative loop. This will eliminate the overhead of function calls and improve the overall performance.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Adding compiler optimizations can help the compiler generate more efficient code. For example, using the `__attribute__((optimize("O3")))` pragma directive can hint the compiler to apply aggressive optimizations to the code.

With these optimization strategies in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code.
