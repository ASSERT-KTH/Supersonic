The given code generates all permutations of a given string and prints them in lexicographically sorted order. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation time. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Minimize the use of global variables: The variables `s`, `vs`, and `f` are declared as global variables. It is generally better to avoid using global variables as they can make the code harder to understand and maintain. Instead, pass these variables as parameters to functions.

3. Use more efficient data structures: The code uses a `vector<string>` to store the generated permutations. However, this can lead to inefficient memory usage and slow down the program. Instead, we can use an output stream to directly print the permutations, avoiding the need to store them in a data structure.

4. Optimize the permutation generation algorithm: The current algorithm uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach to generate all permutations. However, it can be improved by eliminating redundant computations. Currently, the algorithm counts the occurrence of each character in the prefix of the permutation and checks if the next character is available. This counting can be avoided by using a boolean array to keep track of the availability of each character.

5. Avoid redundant sorting: The code sorts the generated permutations using `std::sort` before printing them. However, sorting is not necessary if we generate the permutations in lexicographically sorted order from the beginning.

6. Use efficient input/output operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, respectively. However, these operations can be slow due to synchronization with C-style input/output operations. By using `scanf` and `printf` functions, we can improve the performance of input/output operations.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and optimized code implementation.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

// Recursive function to generate permutations in lexicographically sorted order
void generatePermutations(string prefix, string remaining, int remainingLen) {
    if (remainingLen == 0) {
        cout << prefix << endl;  // Print the permutation directly
        return;
    }
    
    bool used[26] = { false };  // Array to keep track of character availability
    
    // Count the occurrence of each character in the prefix
    for (char c : prefix) {
        used[c - 'a'] = true;
    }
    
    // Generate permutations by appending each available character to the prefix
    for (char c : remaining) {
        if (!used[c - 'a']) {
            string newPrefix = prefix + c;
            string newRemaining = remaining;
            newRemaining.erase(remove(newRemaining.begin(), newRemaining.end(), c), newRemaining.end());
            generatePermutations(newPrefix, newRemaining, remainingLen - 1);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    
    string s;
    while (true) {
        cin >> s;
        if (s == "#")
            break;
        
        // Generate permutations
        int len = s.length();
        sort(s.begin(), s.end());  // Sort the input string
        generatePermutations("", s, len);
        
        cout << len << endl;
        if (len <= 10) {
            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
                cout << s[i] << endl;
            }
        } else {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                cout << s[i] << endl;
            }
            for (int i = len - 5; i < len; i++) {
                cout << s[i] << endl;
            }
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code follows the proposed optimization strategy and includes the necessary changes to improve the efficiency of the original code. It avoids unnecessary includes, minimizes the use of global variables, uses more efficient data structures, optimizes the permutation generation algorithm, avoids redundant sorting, and uses efficient input/output operations.

The optimized code is well-commented to explain the changes made and improve code readability.
