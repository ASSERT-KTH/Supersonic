The given code generates all possible permutations of a string and prints them in lexicographically sorted order. However, there are several areas of the code that can be optimized.

1. Avoiding unnecessary memory usage:
   - The `vector<string> vs` is used to store all the permutations. However, there is no need to store all the permutations in a vector because we only need to count the number of permutations and print a subset of them.
   - Instead of storing all the permutations, we can keep track of the count and only print the required number of permutations.
   - By avoiding the use of the vector, we can significantly reduce the memory usage.

2. Reducing unnecessary computations:
   - The `d` array is used to count the occurrence of each character in the prefix string `t`. However, we can avoid recomputing this count for each recursive call of the `dfs` function.
   - Instead, we can maintain a separate count array outside the `dfs` function and update it as we iterate through the prefix string.
   - This will eliminate redundant computations and improve the efficiency of the code.

3. Compiler optimization hints:
   - Adding compiler optimization flags or pragma directives can help the compiler optimize the code further.
   - For example, we can use the `__builtin_popcountll` function to count the number of set bits in an integer, which can be faster than manually counting the occurrence of each character.
   - We can also use compiler-specific pragmas to enable loop unrolling or other optimizations.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps.
