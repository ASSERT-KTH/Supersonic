This code implements a binary search tree (BST) data structure and provides three operations: insert, find, and print. The code reads a series of commands from input and performs the corresponding operation. The insert operation adds a new element to the BST, the find operation checks if an element exists in the BST, and the print operation outputs the elements of the BST in sorted order using in-order and pre-order traversals.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following aspects:
1. Improve memory usage: The current implementation dynamically allocates a new Node for each element inserted. This can lead to excessive memory allocation and deallocation overhead. We can optimize this by using a memory pool or pre-allocating a fixed-size array of Nodes to reduce memory allocation overhead.
2. Optimize the find operation: The current implementation performs a simple search in the BST to find an element. We can improve the find operation by utilizing the properties of the BST to perform a more efficient search.
3. Optimize the print operation: The current implementation performs two separate traversals (in-order and pre-order) to print the elements of the BST. We can optimize this by combining the traversals into a single traversal to reduce the number of recursive calls.

Let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of the optimizations.
