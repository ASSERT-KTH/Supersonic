The provided code is an implementation of a binary search tree (BST). It takes a sequence of commands as input and performs insertions, searches, and prints the tree in-order and pre-order.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the `<cstdio>` library, but it is not used. We can remove this include statement.

2. Avoid using the `using namespace std;` directive: This directive brings all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix to access the standard library entities.

3. Use `nullptr` instead of `NIL`: The code uses a `NIL` pointer to represent a null node. Instead, we can use the `nullptr` keyword introduced in C++11.

4. Pass nodes by reference: The `insert` and `find` functions currently pass nodes by value, which involves unnecessary copying. We can pass them by reference to avoid this overhead.

5. Avoid unnecessary assignments in the `insert` function: The `insert` function assigns `NIL` to the `y` pointer before entering the loop. This assignment is not necessary because `y` is always assigned a value inside the loop. We can remove this initial assignment.

6. Use a more efficient alternative for printing the tree: The current implementation uses recursive functions (`inorder` and `preorder`) to print the tree. Recursive calls can be expensive in terms of function call overhead. We can use an iterative approach to print the tree.

7. Optimize the `find` function: The `find` function performs a search in the BST. Currently, it always returns a boolean. We can modify the function to also return the node where the key was found, if any, to avoid traversing the tree twice.
