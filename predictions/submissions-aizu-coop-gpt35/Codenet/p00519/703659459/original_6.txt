Upon analyzing the provided code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant Data Structures:
   - The `pass` vector is an array of vectors, where each element is a vector storing the neighbors of a node. This can be replaced by a more efficient adjacency list representation, such as a vector of sets or a vector of unordered_sets, to avoid duplicate entries and improve lookup time.

2. Inefficient Looping:
   - The code uses a nested loop to iterate through the elements of the `pass` vector. This can be optimized by using range-based for loops or iterators instead of indices.

3. Unnecessary Memory Allocation:
   - The arrays `c`, `r`, and `d` are declared with a fixed size of 6000. This is inefficient if the actual input values are smaller. Instead, these arrays can be dynamically allocated with a size based on the input values.

4. Redundant Variable Initialization:
   - The arrays `used` and `visited` are initialized to false in each iteration of the main loop. This is unnecessary since these arrays are fully reset at the beginning of each iteration.

5. Inefficient Recursive Function Call:
   - The `dfs` function is called recursively for each neighbor of a node. This can be optimized by using a stack-based iterative approach instead of recursion.

6. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling, can be used to improve the performance of the code. Additionally, pragma directives can be used to provide hints to the compiler for optimizing specific parts of the code.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step-by-step.
