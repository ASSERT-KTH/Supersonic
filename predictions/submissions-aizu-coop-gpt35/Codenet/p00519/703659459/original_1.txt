The provided code appears to be implementing Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for improved performance. 

1. Avoid using unnecessary includes: The current code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. It's better to include only the required headers, such as `<vector>`, `<iostream>`, and `<algorithm>`.

2. Replace `vector<int> pass[6000]` with a more memory-efficient data structure: The `pass` array is used to store the adjacency list representation of the graph. However, using an array of vectors can be memory-intensive, especially if the graph is sparse. A more memory-efficient alternative is to use a vector of vectors, where each vector represents the adjacency list for a particular vertex.

3. Remove unused typedefs: The typedefs `vi`, `pii`, and `ll` are defined but not used in the code. Removing them will make the code cleaner and easier to read.

4. Avoid unnecessary function parameters: The `dfs` function takes unnecessary parameters `v` and `f`, which are not used. Removing these parameters will simplify the function signature and reduce unnecessary computation.

5. Use references instead of passing arrays as function arguments: The `visited` array in the `dfs` function can be passed by reference instead of passing it as a pointer. This avoids the overhead of array pointer dereferencing.

6. Use reference initialization when iterating over vectors: In the `rep` macro, the loop variable `i` is incremented each time. To avoid the overhead of copying the vector element, use reference initialization instead. This can be done by changing `rep(i, pass[u].size())` to `rep(const auto& i, pass[u])`.

7. Use `reserve` when initializing vectors: The `pass` vector is initialized without any pre-allocated memory. Since the number of elements is known in advance, it's better to use `reserve` to allocate memory for the vectors. This avoids unnecessary reallocations and improves performance.

8. Use a priority queue for finding the minimum distance vertex: The current code uses a linear search to find the vertex with the minimum distance. This can be optimized by using a priority queue (min-heap) to store the vertices based on their distances. This reduces the complexity of finding the minimum distance vertex from O(n) to O(log n).

9. Remove unnecessary initialization in `dijk` function: The `d` array is initialized with `INF` values at the beginning of the `dijk` function. However, since the array is immediately overwritten in the loop, this initialization is unnecessary and can be removed.

10. Use a suitable data type for `used` array: The `used` array is currently of type `bool`, which can lead to unnecessary memory usage. Since the array is used to mark visited vertices, it can be optimized by using a bitset instead.

11. Replace the `while(1)` loop with a more meaningful condition: The `while(1)` loop in the `dijk` function can be replaced with a more meaningful condition. For example, the loop can be terminated when the destination vertex `g` is marked as used.

With these optimizations in mind, here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <bitset>
#include <limits>

using namespace std;

constexpr int N = 6000;
constexpr int INF = numeric_limits<int>::max();

vector<vector<int>> pass(N);
vector<int> c(N);
vector<int> r(N);
vector<int> d(N);
bitset<N> used;

void dfs(int u, int f, int end, bitset<N>& visited) {
    if (visited[u])
        return;
    visited[u] = true;
    d[u] = min(d[u], d[u] + c[u]);
    if (f >= end)
        return;
    for (const auto& v : pass[u]) {
        dfs(v, f + 1, end, visited);
    }
}

int dijk(int s, int g) {
    fill(d.begin(), d.end(), INF);
    used.reset();
    d[s] = 0;
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
    pq.emplace(0, s);
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        int v = pq.top().second;
        pq.pop();
        if (used[v])
            continue;
        used[v] = true;
        bitset<N> visited;
        dfs(v, 1, r[v], visited);
        for (const auto& u : pass[v]) {
            if (!used[u]) {
                pq.emplace(d[u], u);
            }
        }
    }
    return d[g];
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> c[i] >> r[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        int a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;
        a--, b--;
        pass[a].push_back(b);
        pass[b].push_back(a);
    }
    cout << dijk(0, n - 1) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

These optimizations aim to improve memory usage and reduce unnecessary computations, resulting in a more efficient and performant code.
