The given code appears to be an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. The code defines a graph with `n` nodes and `k` edges. It then applies Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 0 to node `n-1`.

Upon analyzing the code, a few potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Memory Allocation: The code defines several arrays of size 6000 (`pass`, `c`, `r`, `d`, `used`, and `visited`). However, the actual number of nodes (`n`) may be much smaller than 6000. This results in unnecessary memory allocation and potentially affects cache performance.

2. Recursive DFS: The `dfs` function is implemented recursively. Recursive function calls can be expensive in terms of memory usage and function call overhead. It may be possible to optimize this recursion.

3. Loop Iterations: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the `pass` vector and perform operations on each element. This can potentially be optimized by using range-based loops or iterators.

4. Redundant Variables: The code defines `f` and `end` variables in the `dfs` function, but they are not used. These variables can be removed to improve code readability.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be proposed:

1. Use a dynamic data structure for the `pass` vector to avoid unnecessary memory allocation. A `vector<vector<int>>` can be used instead of `vector<int>[6000]`.

2. Replace the recursive `dfs` function with an iterative implementation using a stack or queue data structure. This will reduce the function call overhead and improve memory usage.

3. Replace nested loops with range-based loops or iterators to improve code readability and potentially optimize loop performance.

4. Remove redundant variables and unused code to simplify the program.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail and update the code accordingly.
