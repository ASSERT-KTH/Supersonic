The given code implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph. To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Data Structures: The code uses a vector of vectors (`pass`) to represent the graph. However, this is not an efficient data structure for this purpose. Instead, we can use an adjacency list representation using a vector of lists or arrays. This will reduce the memory usage and improve cache efficiency.

2. Function Calls: The code makes multiple function calls within loops, which can be expensive. We can optimize this by using inline functions or macros to eliminate the overhead of function calls.

3. Loop Optimization: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the graph, which can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations. We can also consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations, such as loop optimizations (e.g., loop unrolling, loop fusion) and compiler-specific flags (e.g., -O3 for maximum optimization).

Now, let's proceed with step-by-step explanations of each optimization:

1. Data Structures Optimization:
   - Replace the vector of vectors (`pass`) with an adjacency list representation using a vector of lists or arrays.
   - Use a `vector<list<int>>` or `vector<vector<int>>` to represent the graph.
   - This will reduce memory usage and improve cache efficiency, as the graph will be stored contiguously in memory.

2. Function Calls Optimization:
   - Replace the `dfs` function with an inline function or macro to eliminate the overhead of function calls.
   - Inline functions or macros will directly substitute the function code at the call site, reducing the function call overhead.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - Replace the nested loops in the `dijk` function with a single loop to iterate over the adjacency list.
   - This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the performance.
   - Consider loop unrolling to further reduce loop overhead, if feasible.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Add compiler-specific flags, such as `-O3`, to enable maximum optimization during compilation.
   - This will enable the compiler to apply various optimizations, including loop optimizations and inline function expansion.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the code:
