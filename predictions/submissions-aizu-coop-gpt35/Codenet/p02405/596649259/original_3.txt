The given code is a program that prints a checkerboard pattern of dots and hashtags. The size of the checkerboard is determined by the values of `H` and `W`, which are read from the user. The program continues to read new values for `H` and `W` until both are 0, at which point it exits.

Let's analyze the code for potential optimizations:

1. Input Handling: 
   - The program reads the values of `H` and `W` using `cin` inside the while loop. However, these values are not checked for validity. It would be a good idea to add input validation to ensure that the values entered by the user are within acceptable limits.
   - The program could also display a prompt to guide the user in entering the values.

2. Loop Structure:
   - The program uses nested loops to iterate over the rows and columns of the checkerboard. This is a straightforward approach, but there may be opportunities to optimize the loops.
   - The loops iterate from 1 to `H` and 1 to `W`, respectively. It would be more efficient to iterate from 0 to `H-1` and `W-1`, as this avoids unnecessary arithmetic operations in the loop conditions.

3. Output:
   - The checkerboard is printed using `cout` in the innermost loop. This can be a performance bottleneck, as `cout` can be slow when used repeatedly.
   - Instead of printing each character individually, the program could build the entire row as a string and then print the entire row at once. This would reduce the number of `cout` calls and potentially improve performance.

4. Array Access:
   - The expression `".#"[(i + j) % 2 == 0]` is used to determine whether to print a dot or a hashtag. This involves accessing the characters in the string `".#"`.
   - Instead of using a string, we can use a character array to store the dot and hashtag characters. This would avoid the overhead of accessing individual characters in the string.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization strategy.
