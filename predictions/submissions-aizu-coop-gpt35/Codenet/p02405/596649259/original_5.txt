The given code prints a checkerboard pattern of '.' and '#' characters based on the input values of H and W (height and width). The code uses nested loops to iterate through each row and column, and then uses modulus operator to determine whether to print a '.' or '#'.

There are a few potential optimizations that can be made to improve the efficiency of this code.

1. Avoid using the namespace std: The line `using namespace std;` brings all the names in the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and makes it harder to understand where each function or variable comes from. It's better to use the `std::` prefix before each name from the standard library, or you can simply use the specific names you need (e.g. `std::cout`, `std::cin`) without using the entire namespace.

2. Remove unnecessary empty lines: The code includes an empty `cout << endl;` statement after each iteration of the inner loop. This results in unnecessary output of empty lines. It's better to remove these empty lines to improve the overall efficiency of the program.

3. Use a more efficient data structure: The array `".#"` is used to determine whether to print a '.' or '#'. However, this array is not necessary and can be replaced with a simple conditional expression. This will avoid the unnecessary memory allocation and lookup associated with the array.

4. Modify loop conditions: The current loop conditions `i <= H` and `j <= W` include an unnecessary `=` sign. Since the loop iterations start from 1, it can be replaced with `i < H` and `j < W` respectively. This will save one unnecessary iteration in each loop.

5. Use constant references for input variables: The input variables `H` and `W` are passed by value to the `cin` statement. This results in unnecessary copying of the values. It's better to pass them as constant references (`const int& H` and `const int& W`) to avoid the extra copy.

6. Use `"\n"` instead of `std::endl`: The `std::endl` statement not only inserts a newline character but also flushes the output buffer. Flushing the buffer can be an expensive operation. It's better to use `"\n"` to simply insert a newline character without flushing the buffer.

7. Consider loop unrolling: The current code uses nested loops to iterate through each row and column. Loop unrolling can be considered to reduce the overhead of loop control mechanisms. However, this optimization may not provide significant performance improvements in this case due to the small size of the loops.

8. Compiler optimizations: The compiler can perform various optimizations based on the code and its usage patterns. It's recommended to enable compiler optimizations, such as using higher optimization levels (`-O2`, `-O3`) or using specific compiler flags to enable certain optimizations. This can be done through the compiler command-line options or pragma directives within the code.

Taking all these optimizations into consideration, the optimized code can be written as follows:
