The given code is a simple program that prints a checkerboard pattern of dots and hash symbols. It takes input for the height (H) and width (W) of the checkerboard and uses nested loops to print the pattern.

Upon analysis, we can identify a few possible areas for optimization:

1. Input Validation: The code assumes that the input values for H and W are positive integers. However, it does not validate this assumption. Adding input validation can improve the code's robustness.

2. Redundant Computation: The `i + j` computation inside the loop is repeated for each cell of the checkerboard. We can optimize this by precomputing the value of `(i + j) % 2` outside the loop.

3. Memory Usage: The code uses a character array `".#"` to determine the character to print at each cell. This array is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simple ternary expression.

4. Loop Optimization: The loop indices start from 1 and go up to H and W, which requires additional computations. We can optimize this by starting the indices from 0 and going up to H-1 and W-1.
