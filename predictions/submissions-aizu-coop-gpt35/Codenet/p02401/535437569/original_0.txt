The given code reads two integers and an arithmetic operator from the user and performs the corresponding operation. The program continues to read inputs until the operator is '?'.

Upon analysis, the code seems to be straightforward and simple. However, there are a few areas that can be optimized to improve performance and reduce memory usage.

1. Inefficient I/O: The current implementation uses `scanf` and `printf` to read and write the inputs and outputs. These functions are relatively slow compared to other I/O methods. We can use `std::cin` and `std::cout` for faster I/O operations.

2. Redundant `using namespace std`: The code unnecessarily includes the entire `std` namespace. It is recommended to avoid using namespace declarations in header files to prevent potential naming conflicts.

3. Looping with `while(1)`: The program uses an infinite loop with a `while(1)` statement. Although this is a common approach, it can be replaced with a more readable and efficient loop structure.

4. Multiple `if` conditions for operator comparison: The code uses multiple `if` conditions to compare the operator character. This can be optimized using a switch-case statement, which is more efficient for multiple comparisons.

Based on these observations, we can optimize the code as follows:
