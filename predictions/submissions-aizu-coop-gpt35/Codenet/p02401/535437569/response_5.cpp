The provided code is a simple calculator program that takes two integer inputs and an operator (+, -, /, *) from the user and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. The program continues to take inputs until the operator '?' is entered, at which point it terminates.

To optimize this code, we can focus on a few key areas:
1. Minimizing I/O operations: The program currently uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output, respectively. These I/O operations can be expensive, especially when called repeatedly in a loop. We can minimize the number of I/O operations by storing the results of arithmetic operations in a variable and printing the result only once.

2. Removing unnecessary conditionals: The code currently uses multiple `if` conditions to check the operator and perform the corresponding arithmetic operation. We can simplify this logic by using a switch statement, which is typically more efficient.

3. Optimizing memory usage: The code currently uses variables `x`, `y`, and `z` to store the inputs. These variables can be optimized to minimize memory usage, especially if we don't need to store the inputs after performing the arithmetic operation.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can also consider using compiler optimizations and pragmas to guide the compiler in optimizing the code further.
