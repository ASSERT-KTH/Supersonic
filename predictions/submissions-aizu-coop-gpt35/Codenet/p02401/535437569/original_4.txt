The code provided is a simple calculator program that takes two integer inputs and performs basic arithmetic operations on them (+, -, *, /). The program continues to accept input until the operator is a question mark ('?'), at which point it terminates.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Input Parsing: The current implementation uses `scanf` to parse the input, which can be relatively slow compared to other methods. We can explore alternative approaches to improve the efficiency of input parsing.

2. Redundant Output Formatting: The code uses separate `printf` statements for each arithmetic operation, which can lead to redundant formatting and output operations. Consolidating the output operations can improve efficiency.

3. Loop Structure: The code uses an infinite loop with a termination condition inside the loop. This structure can be optimized to reduce the number of conditional checks and improve performance.

Based on these observations, we can proceed with the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace `scanf` with a faster input parsing method.
2. Consolidate the output operations to avoid redundant formatting.
3. Optimize the loop structure to eliminate unnecessary conditional checks.

Now, let's discuss each optimization step in detail:

1. Input Parsing Optimization:
   - Instead of using `scanf`, we can use the `std::cin` stream for input parsing. This change will provide a more efficient and safer way to parse input. We can replace the line `scanf("%d %c %d", &x, &z, &y);` with `std::cin >> x >> z >> y;`.

2. Output Formatting Optimization:
   - Currently, the code uses separate `printf` statements for each arithmetic operation. We can consolidate these operations by storing the result in a variable and using a single `printf` statement outside the conditional checks. This change will reduce redundant formatting operations. We can introduce a variable `result` to store the result of the arithmetic operation and replace the `printf` statements with `result = x + y;`, `result = x - y;`, `result = x * y;`, and `result = x / y;`. Finally, we can use a single `printf` statement outside the conditional checks to output the result: `printf("%d\n", result);`.

3. Loop Structure Optimization:
   - The current implementation uses an infinite loop with conditional checks inside to determine if the program should terminate. Instead, we can use a modified loop structure that terminates when the operator is a question mark ('?'). This change eliminates the need for an extra conditional check inside the loop. We can modify the while loop condition to `while (z != '?')` and move the input parsing statement `std::cin >> x >> z >> y;` to the end of the loop.

Now, let's incorporate these optimization steps into the code:
