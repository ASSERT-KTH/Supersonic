The provided code is a simple calculator program that takes two integers and an operator as input and performs the corresponding operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) on the two numbers. The program continues to read inputs and perform calculations until the operator "?" is entered, at which point the program terminates.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The code is using the `scanf` function to read input values. This function can be inefficient and can lead to buffer overflow issues if not used carefully.

2. The program is using a series of `if-else` statements to determine the operator and perform the corresponding calculation. This approach can be improved by using a switch statement or a lookup table for better performance.

3. The code does not perform any error checking or validation on the input values. Adding input validation can improve the robustness and reliability of the program.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Use `std::cin` instead of `scanf` for reading input values. `std::cin` is a safer and more efficient way to read input values in C++.

2. Replace the series of `if-else` statements with a switch statement or a lookup table to improve performance and readability.

3. Add input validation to handle invalid or unexpected input values.
