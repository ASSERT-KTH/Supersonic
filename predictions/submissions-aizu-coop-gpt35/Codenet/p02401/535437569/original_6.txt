The given code is a simple calculator program that reads two integers and an operator from the user and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. However, there are several areas where this code can be optimized for better performance and memory usage.

1. Inefficient data type for the operator:
   The operator 'z' is declared as a character, which requires more memory than necessary. Since there are only a limited number of valid operators (+, -, *, /), using a character data type is inefficient. We can use an enumeration to represent the operator, which will reduce memory usage.

2. Redundant if-else if conditions:
   The code uses multiple if-else if conditions to check the value of the operator. This results in unnecessary branching and can be optimized by using a switch statement instead.

3. Input validation:
   The code does not handle invalid inputs, such as non-integer values or division by zero. Adding input validation will improve the robustness of the program.

4. Compiler optimizations:
   We can use compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. This can include loop unrolling or inline function expansion.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

enum Operator { ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE };

int main() {
  int x, y;
  Operator op;

  while (true) {
    if (scanf("%d %c %d", &x, reinterpret_cast<char*>(&op), &y) != 3) {
      return 0;  // Invalid input or end of input
    }

    switch (op) {
      case ADD:
        printf("%d\n", x + y);
        break;
      case SUBTRACT:
        printf("%d\n", x - y);
        break;
      case MULTIPLY:
        printf("%d\n", x * y);
        break;
      case DIVIDE:
        if (y != 0) {
          printf("%d\n", x / y);
        } else {
          printf("Division by zero error\n");
        }
        break;
      default:
        printf("Invalid operator\n");
        break;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the optimizations made:

1. Operator representation:
   We replace the character variable 'z' with an enumeration type 'Operator'. This reduces memory usage and improves code readability. The enumeration values are assigned meaningful names to make the code more self-explanatory.

2. Input validation:
   We add a check to ensure that scanf successfully reads three values (x, operator, y). If scanf returns a value other than 3, it means there was an invalid input or the end of input was reached. In both cases, we exit the program.

3. Switch statement:
   We replace the if-else if conditions with a switch statement. A switch statement is more efficient than multiple if-else if conditions, especially when there are a limited number of cases. It allows the compiler to generate more optimized code.

4. Division by zero:
   We add a check to handle division by zero. If the operator is '/', we check if 'y' is zero before performing the division. If 'y' is zero, we print an error message instead of performing the division.

5. Compiler optimizations:
   We can enable compiler optimizations to further improve the performance of the code. These optimizations can include loop unrolling, inline function expansion, and other optimizations performed by the compiler based on the target architecture.

With these optimizations, the code will be more efficient, consume less memory, and handle invalid inputs more gracefully.
