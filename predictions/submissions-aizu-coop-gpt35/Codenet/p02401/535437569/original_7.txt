The given code reads two integers and an operator from the user, performs the corresponding arithmetic operation, and prints the result. The program continues to prompt the user for input until the operator is a question mark ('?'), at which point it terminates.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified a few areas where performance improvements can be made:

1. Memory Usage: The code uses unnecessary memory to store the operator as a character. Since the operator is a single character, it can be stored as an integer instead, which will reduce memory usage.

2. Redundant Computations: The code performs the same computation multiple times for different operators. This can be optimized by calculating the result once and storing it in a variable, rather than recalculating it for each operator.

3. Loop Optimization: The code uses an infinite while loop to continuously prompt the user for input. This can be optimized by using a more efficient loop structure that avoids unnecessary iterations.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the character variable `z` with an integer variable `op` to store the operator.

2. Calculate the result of the arithmetic operation once and store it in a variable `result`.

3. Use a do-while loop instead of an infinite while loop to avoid unnecessary iterations.

Now, let's go through the optimization steps one by one:

Step 1: Replace the character variable `z` with an integer variable `op` to store the operator.
```cpp
int op;
```

Step 2: Calculate the result of the arithmetic operation once and store it in a variable `result`.
```cpp
int result;
if (op == '+') {
  result = x + y;
} else if (op == '-') {
  result = x - y;
} else if (op == '/') {
  result = x / y;
} else if (op == '*') {
  result = x * y;
}
```

Step 3: Use a do-while loop instead of an infinite while loop to avoid unnecessary iterations.
```cpp
do {
  scanf("%d %c %d", &x, &op, &y);

  if (op == '+') {
    result = x + y;
  } else if (op == '-') {
    result = x - y;
  } else if (op == '/') {
    result = x / y;
  } else if (op == '*') {
    result = x * y;
  }

  if (op != '?') {
    printf("%d\n", result);
  }
} while (op != '?');
```

Here's the complete optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int x, y;
  int op;
  int result;

  do {
    scanf("%d %c %d", &x, &op, &y);

    if (op == '+') {
      result = x + y;
    } else if (op == '-') {
      result = x - y;
    } else if (op == '/') {
      result = x / y;
    } else if (op == '*') {
      result = x * y;
    }

    if (op != '?') {
      printf("%d\n", result);
    }
  } while (op != '?');

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code reduces memory usage by storing the operator as an integer instead of a character. It also avoids redundant computations by calculating the result only once. Additionally, the use of a do-while loop optimizes the loop structure.

These changes do not introduce any significant trade-offs. The code complexity remains the same, and the functionality and output of the original code are preserved. The optimized code should execute faster and use less memory compared to the original code.
