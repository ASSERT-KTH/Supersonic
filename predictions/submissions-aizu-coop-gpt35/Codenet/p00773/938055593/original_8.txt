The provided code calculates the maximum tax revenue that can be generated given certain parameters. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized to improve performance:

1. Use a more efficient data structure: The code currently uses a 2D vector to store the tax values. However, since the size of the vector is fixed at 1000, it would be more efficient to use a 1D vector of pairs.

2. Avoid unnecessary type conversions: The code uses type conversions such as `(int)((a * (100 + x)) / 100.0)` to calculate values. Instead, we can use integer arithmetic to perform the calculations directly.

3. Reduce the number of iterations: The code iterates from `a = 1` to `s`, which can be a large number. We can optimize this by reducing the range of `a` to `(s - 1) / (100 + x)`.

4. Eliminate redundant calculations: The code calculates the tax values multiple times, both inside the loop and in the calculation of the maximum value. We can optimize this by calculating the tax values once and storing them in variables.

5. Apply compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or pragma directives, to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now, let's implement these optimization steps one by one.
