Code Analysis:
- The code reads three integers x, y, and s from the input stream.
- It then initializes a vector of vectors called "tax" with dimensions 1000x2.
- The code uses a while loop to iterate until either x, y, or s becomes zero.
- Within the loop, it calculates the values of a and b based on the input values.
- It then checks if the sum of a and b, multiplied by (100 + x)/100, is equal to s.
- If the condition is satisfied, it stores the values of a and b in the tax vector and updates the maximum value "maxi".
- Finally, it prints the maximum value.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid unnecessary calculations:
   - The code currently performs the calculation (int)((a * (100 + x)) / 100.0) multiple times. We can store this value in a variable to avoid redundant computations.
   - Similarly, the calculation (int)((b * (100 + x)) / 100.0) is repeated. We can store this value as well.

2. Use a more efficient data structure:
   - The current implementation uses a vector of vectors to store the values of a and b. This results in inefficient memory usage. We can optimize this by using a single vector of pairs instead.

3. Optimize the loop:
   - The loop iterates from a = 1 to s. However, we can optimize it by using a nested loop that starts from a = 1 and b = s - a and decrements b by 1 in each iteration. This way, we can avoid unnecessary iterations and improve performance.

4. Use compiler optimizations:
   - We can suggest using compiler optimizations like -O3 to enable aggressive optimizations by the compiler.
