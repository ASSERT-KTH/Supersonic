Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structure: The code uses a vector of vectors (`tax`) to store the values of `a` and `b`. However, since the number of iterations is not known in advance, this approach can result in inefficient memory usage. Additionally, accessing elements within the vector of vectors can be slower compared to a flat array.

2. Redundant computation: The expression `(int)((a * (100 + x)) / 100.0)` is repeated twice in the code. Since this expression is used to calculate the values of `b` and `maxi`, it can be computed once and stored in a variable to avoid redundant calculations.

3. Inefficient loop condition: The loop condition `a < s` checks whether `a` is less than `s` in every iteration. Instead, we can calculate the maximum possible value of `a` based on the given constraints and use that as the loop condition. This will reduce the number of loop iterations.

4. Unnecessary check for zero: The condition `b != 0` is not necessary because `b` is always positive. Therefore, we can remove this check.

Based on these observations, here is an optimization strategy:

1. Replace the vector of vectors (`tax`) with a flat array to improve memory usage and access speed.
2. Compute the expression `(int)((a * (100 + x)) / 100.0)` once and store it in a variable.
3. Calculate the maximum value of `a` based on the given constraints and use it as the loop condition.
4. Remove the unnecessary check for zero in the loop.
