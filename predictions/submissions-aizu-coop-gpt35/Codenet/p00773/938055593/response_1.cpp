The provided code calculates the maximum value of `maxi` based on three input values `x`, `y`, and `s`. It uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible combinations of `a` and `b` and checks if their sum is equal to `s`. If the condition is met, it updates the `tax` vector and calculates the maximum value of `maxi`.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The current code performs multiple calculations in each iteration of the loop, such as `(int)((a * (100 + x)) / 100.0)` and `(int)((b * (100 + x)) / 100.0)`. These calculations can be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant computations.

2. Optimize the loop: The current loop iterates from `a = 1` to `s`, which can be a large range depending on the input. To optimize this, we can change the loop to iterate from `a = 1` to a smaller upper bound, such as `s / 2`. This is because if `a` is greater than `s / 2`, `b` will be less than 1, which is not a valid solution.

3. Use more efficient data structures: The current code uses a 2D vector `tax` to store the valid solutions. However, we can optimize the memory usage by using a 1D vector and storing the values of `a` and `b` alternatively. This will reduce the memory footprint and improve cache efficiency.

4. Make use of compiler optimizations: We can utilize compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and inline function expansion, to improve the performance of the code. We can enable these optimizations by using compiler-specific pragmas or command-line options.
