Analysis:
- The code is implementing the heap sort algorithm to sort an array.
- The `hsort` function takes an array, its size, and a comparison function as arguments and sorts the array in-place.
- The code also provides overloaded versions of `hsort` to accept iterators and a default comparison function.
- The main function reads an input size `n`, then reads `n` integers into an array `a`, and finally calls `hsort` to sort the array and print the sorted array.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid unnecessary copies: The `hsort` function currently takes the array by value. Passing large arrays by value can introduce unnecessary copies, leading to increased memory usage and decreased performance. To avoid this, we can pass the array by reference or as a pointer.
2. Use move semantics: The `heapify` lambda function currently swaps elements using `std::swap`, which involves unnecessary copying. We can improve this by using move semantics (`std::move`) to reduce the number of copy operations.
3. Avoid unnecessary comparisons: The comparison function `cmp` is invoked multiple times within the `heapify` function. We can optimize this by storing the result of the comparison in a variable and reusing it instead of invoking the comparison function multiple times.
4. Optimize loop conditions: The loop conditions in the `heapify` function can be optimized. For example, instead of `(c = (p << 1) + 1) < hpsz`, we can calculate `c` as `(p << 1) + 1` before the loop and use `c < hpsz` as the loop condition, which eliminates the need for the assignment within the loop.
5. Use const references in comparison function: The comparison function `cmp` is passed by value. If the comparison function does not modify its arguments, we can pass it by const reference to avoid unnecessary copies.
6. Use `std::less` as default comparison function: The default comparison function for `hsort` is `std::less`. We can directly use `std::less` instead of creating a new instance of `std::less` in the default version of `hsort`.

Optimization steps:
1. Modify the `hsort` function to take the array by reference instead of by value.
2. Modify the `heapify` lambda function to use move semantics (`std::move`) instead of `std::swap`.
3. Store the result of the comparison function in a variable in the `heapify` function.
4. Optimize the loop conditions in the `heapify` function.
5. Pass the comparison function by const reference in the `heapify` function.
6. Use `std::less` as the default comparison function in the default version of `hsort`.
