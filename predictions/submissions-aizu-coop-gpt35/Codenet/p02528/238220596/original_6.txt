First, let's analyze the provided code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory usage: The code uses a static array `a` with a maximum size of 1000000. This fixed size may be excessive and waste memory for smaller input sizes. Additionally, the code does not handle cases where the input size exceeds the maximum array size.

2. Heapify function: The `heapify` function is defined as a lambda within the `hsort` function. While this can be convenient, it may hinder compiler optimizations. Extracting the `heapify` function as a separate function might improve performance.

3. Loop optimization: The loops in the `hsort` function and the `main` function can potentially be optimized. Unrolling the loops or using loop vectorization techniques might yield performance improvements.

4. Compiler optimizations: The code does not include any specific compiler optimizations or pragma directives to guide the compiler in optimizing the code. Adding appropriate compiler optimizations may result in performance gains.

Based on this analysis, we can devise an optimization strategy with the following steps:

1. Use a dynamic data structure instead of a static array to handle variable input sizes efficiently.

2. Extract the `heapify` function as a separate function to improve compiler optimizations.

3. Optimize the loops in the `hsort` and `main` functions by considering loop unrolling or loop vectorization.

4. Add compiler optimizations or pragma directives to guide the compiler in optimizing the code.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step explanation and implementation of these optimizations.
