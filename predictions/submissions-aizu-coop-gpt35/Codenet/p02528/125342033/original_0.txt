The given code reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` integers into an array `A`. It then sorts the array using `std::sort` and prints the sorted array.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas of optimization:

1. Memory Usage: The current implementation uses a fixed-size array `A` with a maximum size of 1000001. However, the actual number of elements read from the input may be smaller than this. We can optimize memory usage by dynamically allocating memory for the array based on the input size.

2. Input/Output: The code uses the `scanf` and `printf` functions for input and output, respectively. While these functions are generally efficient, they can be slow for large inputs. We can consider using faster input/output functions like `fgets` and `fputs` or the C++ `iostream` library.

3. Sorting Algorithm: The code uses the `std::sort` function to sort the array. Although `std::sort` is generally efficient, we can explore alternative sorting algorithms that may provide better performance for this specific case.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization strategy step-by-step.
