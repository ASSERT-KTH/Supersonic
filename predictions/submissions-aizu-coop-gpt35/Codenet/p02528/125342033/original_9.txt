The provided code reads an integer `n` from the input, followed by `n` integers. It then sorts the array of integers `A` in ascending order and prints the sorted array.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Input: The code reads one integer at a time using `scanf`. This can be time-consuming, especially for large inputs. We can optimize the input process by reading the entire array of integers at once using `scanf` with the `%d` format specifier and a loop.

2. Sorting: The code uses `std::sort` to sort the array of integers. While `std::sort` is efficient, it has a time complexity of O(n log n). Since the input size can be as large as 1000001, we can consider using a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as counting sort or radix sort, which have a time complexity of O(n).

3. Output: The code uses a loop to print the sorted array. Instead of printing one element at a time, we can optimize the output process by concatenating the elements into a string and then printing the entire string at once using `printf`.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of the optimizations.
