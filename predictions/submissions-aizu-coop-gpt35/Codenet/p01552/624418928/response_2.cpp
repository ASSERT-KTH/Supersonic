The given code appears to be a program that reads a query and a YAML-like string from standard input, parses the string into a hierarchical data structure, and then searches for the specified property in the structure based on the query. The program then outputs the value of the property if found, otherwise it prints "no such property".

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:
1. Memory usage optimization: The current implementation uses a recursive data structure to represent the YAML-like string. This can lead to excessive memory usage, especially for large input strings. We can optimize this by using a more efficient data structure, such as a flat array or a vector, to store the items.

2. Redundant string operations: The code performs multiple string concatenations using the '+' operator, which can be inefficient. We should replace these operations with more efficient alternatives, such as using a stringstream or a vector of characters for building the strings.

3. Unnecessary copying of strings: The code copies substrings from the input string into separate strings using the string constructor. This can be avoided by using string views or iterators to refer to the substrings instead of creating new strings.

4. Unnecessary recursion: The code uses recursion to parse the YAML-like string, which can be inefficient for large input strings. We can optimize this by using a stack-based iterative approach instead of recursion.

5. Compiler optimizations: We should enable compiler optimizations to let the compiler apply various optimizations, such as loop unrolling, inline function expansion, and constant propagation.
