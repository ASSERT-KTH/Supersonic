First, let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structures:
   - The code uses a `vector<int>` to store the individual components of the date. However, since the number of components is fixed (either 5 or 3), using an array might be more efficient.

2. Redundant computations:
   - The `check()` function is called multiple times in the code, which can be avoided by storing the result in a variable.
   - The `M[res.m - 1] + (check(res.y) && res.m == 2)` expression is repeated multiple times. Calculating it once and storing it in a variable can improve performance.

3. Loop optimization:
   - The `while (res.d / (365 + check(res.y + 1)))` loop can be optimized by calculating the number of years to add in a single computation and updating `res.y` accordingly.

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - Enabling compiler optimizations can help in automatically optimizing certain parts of the code. Adding pragmas or enabling compiler flags can hint the compiler to optimize the code.

Based on this analysis, let's formulate an optimization strategy.
