The given code contains two functions, `M2S` and `S2M`, which convert between two date representations: the first one represents a date as the number of days since December 21, 2012, and the second one represents a date as a combination of five numbers. The code reads input from the user, calls the appropriate conversion function, and prints the result.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The `M2S` function performs multiple calculations to convert the input numbers to a date. We can optimize this by avoiding unnecessary calculations and reducing the number of iterations in the loops.
2. Improve memory usage: The code uses a `vector<int>` to store the input numbers. However, we can optimize memory usage by reading the input directly into individual variables instead of using a vector.
3. Use more efficient data structures: The code uses a `struct` to represent dates, which requires separate variables for year, month, and day. We can optimize this by using a single integer to represent the date directly.
4. Streamline the conversion functions: The code can be optimized by streamlining the conversion functions `M2S` and `S2M` to minimize the number of calculations and iterations required.

Let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of the optimization process.
