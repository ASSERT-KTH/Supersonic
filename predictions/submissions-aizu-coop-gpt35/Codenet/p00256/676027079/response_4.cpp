Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The code uses a `vector<int>` to store the input values. However, since the input size is fixed at 5, it would be more efficient to use a fixed-size array or a `std::array<int, 5>` instead.
   - The `S` and `Ma` structures use `long long` data types, which may not be necessary. It would be more memory-efficient to use smaller data types, such as `int` or `short`, if they are sufficient to hold the required values.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - In the function `M2S()`, the calculations for `ka`, `t`, `w`, and `ki` can be combined into a single calculation by using nested multiplication. This would eliminate unnecessary intermediate variables and improve performance.

3. Inefficient Looping:
   - In the function `S2M()`, the loop that calculates the total number of days can be optimized. Instead of subtracting the number of days for each year iteratively, we can calculate the number of leap years in the given range and add an offset to the total number of days.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can suggest compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or enabling compiler-specific optimizations (e.g., `-O2`, `-O3`), to improve performance.
