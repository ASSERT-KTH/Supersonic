The given code includes two functions `M2S()` and `S2M()` that convert dates between two different formats. The `M2S()` function converts a date from the `Ma` format (consisting of five integers b, ka, t, w, ki) to the `S` format (consisting of three integers y, m, d). The `S2M()` function performs the reverse conversion.

Here are some potential areas for optimization in the given code:

1. The `check()` function: The `check()` function checks if a year is a leap year. Instead of using this function multiple times, we can precompute an array of leap years for faster access.

2. The `M2S()` function: This function performs several multiplications and additions to convert the `Ma` format to the `S` format. These calculations can be simplified and optimized.

3. The `S2M()` function: This function performs calculations to convert the `S` format to the `Ma` format. Similar to `M2S()`, there are opportunities for simplification and optimization.

4. The input processing in the `main()` function: The input processing is done using a string and a loop. This can be optimized by using `cin` directly and avoiding the loop.

Now let's optimize the code step by step.
