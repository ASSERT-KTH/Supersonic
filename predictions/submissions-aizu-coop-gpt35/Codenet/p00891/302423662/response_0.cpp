The given code appears to be implementing a pattern matching algorithm. The main goal is to count the number of occurrences of a given pattern in a given image. The code reads the image and pattern from the input, converts them into binary representation, and then uses a rolling hash technique to match the pattern with different positions in the image.

Upon analysis, the following potential areas of optimization can be identified:

1. Memory Usage: The code uses two-dimensional arrays `im` and `pa` to store the binary representation of the image and pattern. These arrays have fixed sizes of 1010 and 110, respectively, which may be unnecessarily large for most inputs. Reducing the size of these arrays to match the actual input size can save memory.

2. Loop Unrolling: The code uses nested loops in the `ppp()` function to calculate the rolling hash values for each position in the image. Unrolling these loops can potentially improve performance by reducing loop overhead.

3. Redundant Computations: The `ppp()` function calculates the rolling hash values for each position in the image, even if the pattern has already been matched at a previous position. This results in redundant computations. Skipping the computation for positions where the pattern has already been matched can improve efficiency.

4. Compiler Optimization: The code does not currently have any specific compiler optimization flags or directives. Enabling appropriate compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or auto-vectorization, can potentially improve performance.

Based on these observations, the following step-by-step optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Analyze the code and identify areas where memory usage can be reduced. Replace fixed-size arrays `im` and `pa` with dynamically allocated arrays.

2. Analyze the `ppp()` function and identify opportunities for loop unrolling. Modify the code to unroll the loops and reduce loop overhead.

3. Modify the `ppp()` function to skip the computation for positions where the pattern has already been matched.

4. Add compiler optimization flags or directives to maximize performance.
