The provided code is a program that reads input data from the standard input and performs some calculations to find matches between two patterns in an image. The program uses a brute-force approach to check all possible rotations and reflections of the pattern in the image.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified the following potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage:
   - The `im` array is declared as a 2D array of size `1010x1010`. However, the actual dimensions of the image are given by the variables `w` and `h`. The `im` array can be resized dynamically based on the input dimensions to reduce unnecessary memory usage.
   - Similarly, the `pa` array can also be resized dynamically based on the pattern dimensions `p`.

2. Loop Optimization:
   - The `ppp` function uses nested loops to iterate over the image and pattern. This can be a performance bottleneck, especially when the image and pattern are large. Consider optimizing these loops to reduce the number of iterations and improve cache utilization.
   - The `ppp` function also uses a vector `used` to store previously encountered patterns. This vector is checked for duplicates in every iteration of the outer loop. This can be a time-consuming operation as the size of the vector increases. Consider using a more efficient data structure, such as a hash set, to store the patterns and check for duplicates.

3. Redundant Computations:
   - The `ppp` function computes the hash value `a` for the pattern in every iteration of the outer loop. This computation can be moved outside the loop since the pattern does not change during the loop iterations.
   - The `ppp` function computes the hash values `b`, `g`, and `n` in every iteration of the inner and outer loops. These computations can be moved outside the loops to eliminate redundant calculations.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - The code can benefit from compiler optimizations. Consider enabling compiler optimizations, such as `-O2` or `-O3`, to allow the compiler to perform optimizations like loop unrolling, instruction scheduling, and inline function expansion.
