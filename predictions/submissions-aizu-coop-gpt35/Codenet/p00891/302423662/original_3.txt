The given code is a program that calculates the number of occurrences of one pattern within another pattern. The patterns are represented as binary matrices, where each element is either 0 or 1. The program reads in the dimensions of the matrices (`w`, `h`, and `p`), as well as the matrices themselves, and then performs a series of transformations and calculations to count the occurrences.

Upon analysis, several potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Inefficient memory usage: The program uses two-dimensional arrays (`im` and `pa`) to represent the input matrices. However, these arrays are larger than necessary, as they have dimensions of 1010x1010 and 110x110, respectively. This leads to unnecessary memory allocation and potentially slower performance. Optimizing the memory usage for these arrays can result in significant memory savings.

2. Redundant computations: The `ppp()` function calculates the hash value of the submatrices and compares them with the hash value of the pattern matrix. However, this computation is repeated multiple times for the same submatrices, leading to redundant computations. By caching the hash values and checking for duplicates, these redundant computations can be avoided.

3. Loop unrolling: The outer loop in the main function is iterating over the four possible transformations of the pattern matrix. However, the transformations are performed in a fixed order, and the loop can be unrolled to eliminate the overhead of the loop control.

4. Compiler optimizations: The code does not include any compiler optimizations, such as compiler flags or pragma directives, that can guide the compiler to perform certain optimizations. Adding appropriate compiler optimizations can potentially improve the performance of the code.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be proposed:

1. Optimize memory usage:
   - Reduce the size of the `im` array to `h`x`w`.
   - Reduce the size of the `pa` array to `p`x`p`.

2. Cache hash values:
   - Create a `unordered_set` to store the hash values of the submatrices.
   - Before calculating the hash value of a submatrix, check if it already exists in the set. If it does, skip the calculation.

3. Unroll the outer loop:
   - Manually perform the transformations in the order: original, rotated 90 degrees, rotated 180 degrees, and rotated 270 degrees.
   - Eliminate the outer loop and perform the calculations directly for each transformation.

4. Add compiler optimizations:
   - Add appropriate compiler optimization flags or pragma directives to guide the compiler to perform optimization.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step by step in the code:
