The given code is a C++ program that reads in an image and a pattern, and counts the number of occurrences of the pattern in the image. The image and pattern are represented as binary matrices, where each element represents a pixel. The program uses a rolling hash technique to efficiently compare the pattern with all possible submatrices of the image.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Memory Usage:
   - The `im` matrix is of size 1010x1010, while the `pa` matrix is of size 110x110. However, the actual input image and pattern are only of size w x h and p x p, respectively. This leads to inefficient memory usage.
   - The `used` vector is used to keep track of already processed patterns. However, it is not being utilized effectively. A more efficient data structure can be used to store this information.

2. Loop Optimization:
   - The `ppp` function contains two nested loops that iterate over the image and pattern matrices. These loops can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations or improve cache locality.
   - The `ch` and `ch1` functions also contain nested loops that can potentially be optimized.

3. Redundant Computations:
   - The rolling hash computation is being performed multiple times for the same submatrices of the image. This can be optimized to avoid redundant computations.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization, can be used to improve the performance of the code.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following optimization strategy:

- Use dynamically allocated memory to represent the image and pattern matrices, instead of fixed-size arrays.
- Modify the rolling hash computation to avoid redundant computations.
- Optimize the loops in the `ppp`, `ch`, and `ch1` functions.
- Replace the `used` vector with a more efficient data structure.
- Add compiler optimizations, if applicable.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step explanation of these optimizations.
