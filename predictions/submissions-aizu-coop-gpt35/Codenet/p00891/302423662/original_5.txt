The given code appears to implement a program that counts the number of occurrences of a given pattern in an image. The image and the pattern are represented as binary matrices, where each element is either 0 or 1. The program reads the image and the pattern from input, performs rotations and reflections of the pattern, and then counts the occurrences of the pattern in the image.

To optimize this program, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Memory Usage:
   - The `im` and `pa` matrices are declared as global variables and have fixed sizes. This can lead to inefficient memory usage if the actual image and pattern sizes are smaller. We can optimize this by dynamically allocating memory for these matrices based on the actual input sizes.
   - The `used` vector is used to store the patterns that have already been processed. This can consume a significant amount of memory if there are many unique patterns. We can optimize this by using a hash set or a bitset to store the patterns instead of a vector.

2. Loop Optimization:
   - The `ppp()` function contains nested loops that iterate over the image and pattern matrices. This can result in redundant computations and memory accesses. We can optimize this by reducing the number of iterations and minimizing memory accesses.
   - The `ch()` and `ch1()` functions involve swapping or reversing elements in the pattern matrix. These operations can be optimized by using more efficient algorithms or by eliminating the need for these operations altogether.

3. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can suggest compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization, to improve the performance of the code. Additionally, we can use compiler pragmas or directives to guide the compiler in optimizing certain parts of the code.

Next, we will provide a step-by-step explanation of each optimization and modify the code accordingly.
