The given code is an implementation of a pattern matching algorithm. It reads input data consisting of binary images and a pattern, and counts the number of occurrences of the pattern in the images. However, the code can be optimized in several ways to improve its performance and minimize memory usage.

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The `im` matrix is used to store the binary images, and `pa` matrix is used to store the pattern. Both matrices are of size 1010 x 1010, which is unnecessary since the `w` and `h` variables are used to determine the actual size of the images. We can reduce the size of these matrices to `w` x `h`.
   - The `used` vector is used to keep track of the patterns that have already been processed. However, the usage of `used` is inefficient since it uses linear search to check if a pattern has already been processed. We can replace `used` with an unordered set to improve the lookup time.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `ppp` function calculates the rolling hash values for each row and column of the image and compares them with the pattern. However, the `ppp` function is called multiple times with the same image and pattern, resulting in redundant computations. We can optimize this by storing the rolling hash values for each row and column in separate matrices and reuse them in subsequent iterations.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The `ch` function swaps the elements of the `pa` matrix to rotate the pattern. However, this can be optimized by using a single loop instead of nested loops.
   - The `ch1` function swaps the elements of the `pa` matrix to reflect the pattern vertically. Similar to the `ch` function, this can be optimized by using a single loop instead of nested loops.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimization flags, such as `-O3`, to enable aggressive optimization by the compiler. Additionally, we can use pragma directives, such as `#pragma GCC optimize`, to provide hints to the compiler for specific optimizations.

With these optimization strategies in mind, let's proceed with optimizing the code.
