The given code is a C++ program that reads input from the user and performs some calculations based on the input. The program takes in values for `w`, `h`, and `p`, which represent the width, height, and length of a pattern respectively. The program then reads in a grid of binary values (`im`) and a pattern (`pa`) and counts the number of times the pattern occurs in the grid, considering rotations and reflections.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Data Structures: The current code uses a 2D array to store the grid (`im`) and the pattern (`pa`). However, using a vector of vectors or a flat 1D array could provide better performance due to improved cache locality.

2. Loop Unrolling: Unrolling loops can reduce the number of iterations and improve performance. We can identify loops that can be unrolled and manually unroll them.

3. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop vectorization and auto-vectorization, to improve the performance of the code. We can also use pragma directives to provide hints to the compiler to optimize certain sections of the code.

4. Redundant Computations: The current code performs certain computations multiple times, which can be avoided by storing the results in variables and reusing them.
