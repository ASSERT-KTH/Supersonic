The given code appears to be a program that solves a pattern matching problem. It takes as input a grid of binary values `im`, a pattern `pa`, and dimensions `w`, `h`, and `p`. The program counts the number of occurrences of the pattern in the grid, considering all possible rotations and reflections of the pattern.

Upon analyzing the code, here are some potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage:
   - The `im` array is declared as `bool im[1010][1010]`, which can potentially consume a large amount of memory, especially if the dimensions `w` and `h` are large. However, the actual dimensions of `im` are `w` and `h`, so it can be optimized to `bool im[110][110]`.
   - The `pa` array is declared as `bool pa[110][110]`. Since `p` is the dimension of the pattern, this array can be optimized to `bool pa[10][10]` since the maximum value of `p` is 10.
   - The `used` vector stores `ull` values. Since the maximum number of elements in this vector is not known beforehand, it can potentially consume a large amount of memory. Consider using a more memory-efficient data structure or optimizing the usage of this vector.

2. Loop Optimization:
   - The `ppp()` function contains nested loops that iterate over the `pa` array and the `used` vector. Consider optimizing these loops to reduce unnecessary iterations or redundant computations.
   - The loop in the `ch1()` function iterates over the `pa` array and swaps elements. Consider optimizing this loop to reduce iterations or unnecessary swaps.

3. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Consider using compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization, to improve the performance of the code.
   - Use pragma directives to provide hints to the compiler for optimization, if necessary.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization strategy.
