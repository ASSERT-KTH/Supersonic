After analyzing the given code, I have identified the following potential optimizations:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` directive includes a large number of standard library headers, which can increase compilation time. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers for the program.

2. Replace the use of `memset` and `memcpy`: The `memset` and `memcpy` functions are used to initialize and copy memory blocks, respectively. However, they can be slow for large memory blocks. It is better to use a loop to initialize and copy memory manually.

3. Optimize the `mul` function: The `mul` function is used to multiply two matrices. However, it can be optimized by using loop unrolling and minimizing unnecessary checks.

4. Avoid unnecessary vector copies: The `restore` function creates a copy of the path vector using `reverse` and `push_back` operations. This can be avoided by using an index-based approach to print the path.

5. Optimize the `shortPhase` function: The `shortPhase` function can be optimized by using loop unrolling and minimizing unnecessary checks.

6. Optimize the `calcMinStep` function: The `calcMinStep` function can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary matrix multiplications and loop unrolling.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized code is as follows:
