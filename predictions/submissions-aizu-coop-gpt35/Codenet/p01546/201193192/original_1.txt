The given code is a C++ program that solves a graph problem. The program takes an input graph and finds the shortest path from the start vertex to a terminal vertex with a score greater than or equal to K. The program consists of two main functions: `shortPhase()` and `calcMinStep()`, and a `solve()` function that calls these two functions.

Let's analyze the code to identify potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. The `mul()` function is used to multiply two matrices. It uses three nested loops, which can be computationally expensive for large matrices.

2. The `shortPhase()` function uses dynamic programming to find the shortest path. It uses two 2D arrays, `dp` and `prv`, to store the scores and previous vertices at each step. However, the arrays are initialized and updated using nested loops, which can be inefficient.

3. The `calcMinStep()` function uses matrix multiplication to calculate the minimum step required to reach a score greater than or equal to K. It also uses nested loops for matrix multiplication, which can be time-consuming for large matrices.

4. The program uses `memset()` to initialize arrays with -1. However, this function can be slow for large arrays.

5. The program uses `vector` for storing the graph adjacency list. However, `vector` may have some overhead compared to a more efficient data structure like an array.

Now that we have identified potential areas for optimization, let's formulate an optimization strategy.
