The given code is a C++ program that solves a graph problem. It aims to find the minimum number of steps required to reach a certain score threshold in a directed weighted graph. The code uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant Memory Allocation: The code uses a two-dimensional array `dp` and `prv` for dynamic programming. However, these arrays are allocated and initialized in every call to the `shortPhase` function. This can be avoided by allocating the arrays once outside the function and passing them as parameters.

2. Inefficient Matrix Multiplication: The matrix multiplication operation in the `calcMinStep` function is currently implemented using three nested loops. This can be optimized by using an optimized matrix multiplication algorithm such as Strassen's algorithm or Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm.

3. Unnecessary Memory Usage: The code uses a `Mat` type, which is essentially a vector of vectors, to represent matrices. This can be replaced with a more memory-efficient alternative, such as a one-dimensional array or a custom matrix class.

4. Lack of Compiler Optimization: The code does not make use of any compiler optimizations or pragma directives. Enabling compiler optimizations can significantly improve the performance of the code.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step optimization process.
