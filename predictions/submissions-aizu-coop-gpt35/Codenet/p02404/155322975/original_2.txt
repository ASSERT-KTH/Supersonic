The provided code has a nested loop that prints a pattern of "#" and "." characters based on the input values of H and W. The outer loop iterates over the height of the pattern, and the inner loop iterates over the width of the pattern.

There are a few potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage in this code:

1. The code uses the `std::endl` manipulator to flush the output stream after each line is printed. This can be inefficient because it flushes the stream unnecessarily, leading to slower output. It is better to use `'\n'` instead, which inserts a newline character without flushing the stream.

2. The code uses repetitive if-else statements to determine whether to print "#" or ".". This can be optimized by using a more efficient data structure to represent the pattern.

3. The code does not take advantage of any compiler optimizations or pragmas. We can explore compiler-specific optimizations that can improve the performance of the code.

To optimize this code, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` directive.

Step 2: Replace `std::endl` with `'\n'` to improve output performance.

Step 3: Analyze the pattern and identify a more efficient data structure to represent it. Since the pattern consists of a border of "#" characters and a center of "." characters, we can represent it as a 2D array of characters.

Step 4: Modify the code to use the optimized data structure and remove the repetitive if-else statements.

Step 5: Explore compiler-specific optimizations or pragmas that can improve the performance of the code.

Let's apply these optimization steps to the code:
