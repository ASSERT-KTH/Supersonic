The given code is a simple program that prints a rectangular pattern of '#' and '.' characters based on user input for height (H) and width (W) of the rectangle. The program continues to prompt the user for input until both H and W are 0, at which point it terminates.

Upon analyzing the code, a few potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Input Validation: The current code assumes that the user will always provide valid input for H and W. However, it is good practice to validate user input to prevent potential issues, such as negative values or non-integer inputs.

2. Redundant Condition Checks: The nested if-else statements inside the nested for loops can be simplified by removing the redundant condition checks. Since the outer if condition checks for i == 1 or i == H, the inner if condition only needs to check for j == 1 or j == W.

3. Output Buffering: The code currently prints each character individually, resulting in multiple output operations. This can be optimized by buffering the output and printing the entire line at once.

I will now provide a step-by-step optimization plan to address these issues and improve the performance and efficiency of the code.
