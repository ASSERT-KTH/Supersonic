Analysis:
- The code reads two integers `H` and `W` from the user and prints a pattern of "#" and "." characters based on the values of `H` and `W`.
- The nested for loops iterate over each row and column of the pattern and decide whether to print "#" or "." based on the current row and column indices.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid unnecessary checks:
   - The condition `if (i == 1 || i == H)` is checked for every cell in the pattern. Since the first and last rows are always printed as "#", this condition can be moved outside the inner loop and checked only once.
   - Similarly, the condition `if (j == 1 || j == W)` can also be moved outside the inner loop and checked only once.

2. Reduce cout calls:
   - Currently, the code uses `cout` to print each character in the pattern. Instead of printing each character individually, we can build a string for each row and print the entire string using a single `cout` call. This will reduce the number of system calls and improve performance.

Optimization strategy:
1. Move the row conditions `if (i == 1 || i == H)` outside the inner loop.
2. Move the column conditions `if (j == 1 || j == W)` outside the inner loop.
3. Build a string for each row and print the entire string using a single `cout` call.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Move the row conditions `if (i == 1 || i == H)` outside the inner loop:
   - Rationale: The row conditions are checked for every cell in the pattern. By moving them outside the inner loop, we can avoid unnecessary checks and improve performance.
   - Trade-offs: This optimization does not introduce any trade-offs. It simply avoids redundant checks.

2. Move the column conditions `if (j == 1 || j == W)` outside the inner loop:
   - Rationale: Similar to the row conditions, the column conditions are checked for every cell in the pattern. By moving them outside the inner loop, we can avoid unnecessary checks and improve performance.
   - Trade-offs: This optimization does not introduce any trade-offs. It simply avoids redundant checks.

3. Build a string for each row and print the entire string using a single `cout` call:
   - Rationale: Instead of printing each character individually, we can build a string for each row and print the entire string using a single `cout` call. This reduces the number of system calls and improves performance.
   - Trade-offs: This optimization introduces a slight increase in code complexity as we need to construct the row string. However, the performance gain outweighs the complexity increase.
