The given code generates a rectangular pattern of "#" characters with a border of "#" and a fill of ".". The program takes input values for the height (H) and width (W) of the pattern, and continues generating patterns until H and W are both set to 0.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant `using namespace std;`: The `using` directive for the `std` namespace is not required as only the `cout` and `cin` objects are used from the `std` namespace. It is more efficient to use the specific objects rather than importing the entire namespace.

2. Unnecessary `endl`: The `endl` manipulator is used to insert a new line character '\n' and flush the output buffer. However, it is not necessary to flush the buffer after each line. Using `'\n'` instead of `endl` can improve performance.

3. Unoptimized loop conditions: The loop conditions in the inner for loop can be optimized. Instead of checking whether `i` and `j` are equal to 1 or `H` or `W` every time, we can use a boolean flag to check if the current iteration is at the border or not.

4. Inefficient memory usage: The code prints the pattern character by character using multiple `cout` statements. This can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and I/O operations. It would be more efficient to construct the entire pattern in a string and then print it once.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Remove the `using namespace std;` directive and use `std::cout` and `std::cin` explicitly.

2. Replace `endl` with `'\n'` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output buffer.

3. Use a boolean flag to check if the current position is at the border or not, instead of multiple if conditions.

4. Construct the entire pattern in a string and print it once, instead of printing each character separately.
