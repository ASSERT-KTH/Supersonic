The provided code implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph. The main areas of improvement that can be identified are:

1. Reducing the usage of the `std::string` class: The code uses the `std::string` class to store the final result. However, using `std::string` for concatenation can be inefficient due to frequent memory allocations and copying. We can optimize this by using a more efficient data structure, such as `std::stringstream`.

2. Eliminating unnecessary memory allocation: The `edges` vector is unnecessarily allocated with a fixed size of `MAX`, which is not guaranteed to be the actual number of edges. We can optimize this by using `edges.reserve(eNum)` to pre-allocate memory for `eNum` edges.

3. Removing redundant checks: The code checks for the condition `if (d[e.s] != __INT_MAX__ && d[e.t] > d[e.s] + e.d)` inside the inner loop. However, this condition can be moved outside the loop as it does not depend on the loop variable `j`.

4. Using a more efficient loop termination condition: The outer loop in the `BellmanFord` function iterates `vNum` times. However, we can optimize it by using a flag to check if any updates were made in the previous iteration. If no updates were made, we can break out of the loop early.

5. Using a more efficient data structure for `d`: The code uses an array of integers to represent the distances `d`. However, this array is allocated with a fixed size of `MAX`, which may result in wasted memory. We can optimize this by using a `std::vector<int>` instead, which can dynamically resize as needed.

6. Avoiding unnecessary copying of `edge` objects: The code creates a copy of each `edge` object inside the inner loop of the `BellmanFord` function. This can be optimized by using a const reference to the `edge` object instead of creating a copy.

7. Using a more efficient representation for infinity: The code uses the `__INT_MAX__` constant to represent infinity. However, this constant may not be the largest possible value for `int`. We can optimize this by using `INT_MAX` from the `<limits>` header instead.

8. Using `reserve` for the `ans` string: The code appends each result to the `ans` string. However, the size of the final result can be pre-allocated using `ans.reserve(vNum * 10)` (assuming each distance is represented as a 10-digit number).

Taking these optimizations into account, here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>
#include <limits>
using namespace std;

struct edge {
  int s, t, d;
};

vector<edge> edges;
stringstream ans;
vector<int> d;

int BellmanFord(int startVertex, int vNum, int eNum) {
  d.assign(vNum, numeric_limits<int>::max());
  d[startVertex] = 0;

  bool update = true;
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum && update; ++i) {
    update = false;
    for (const edge& e : edges) {
      if (d[e.s] != numeric_limits<int>::max() && d[e.t] > d[e.s] + e.d) {
        d[e.t] = d[e.s] + e.d;
        update = true;
        if (i == vNum - 1) {
          cout << "NEGATIVE CYCLE" << endl;
          return -1;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    if (i > 0)
      ans << " ";
    if (d[i] == numeric_limits<int>::max()) {
      ans << "INF";
    } else {
      ans << d[i];
    }
  }

  return 0;
}

int main() {
  int vNum, eNum;
  cin >> vNum >> eNum;
  int s, t, w;

  edges.reserve(eNum);

  for (int i = 0; i < eNum; ++i) {
    cin >> s >> t >> w;
    edges.push_back({s, t, w});
  }

  ans.str("");
  ans.clear();

  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    if (BellmanFord(i, vNum, eNum) == -1) {
      return 0;
    }
    ans << "\n";
  }

  cout << ans.str();
}
```

By optimizing the code as described above, we have reduced unnecessary memory allocations, eliminated redundant checks, and used more efficient data structures. These optimizations should improve both the running time and memory usage of the program.
