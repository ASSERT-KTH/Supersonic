The given code implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest paths from a given source vertex to all other vertices in a directed graph. However, there are several potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary Memory Allocation: The code defines a fixed-size array `d[MAX]` to store the distances from the source vertex to each vertex in the graph. However, this array is much larger than necessary for most graphs. We can optimize memory usage by dynamically allocating the `d` array based on the number of vertices in the graph (`vNum`).

2. Redundant Initialization: The code initializes all elements of the `d` array to `__INT_MAX__` using the `fill()` function. However, this initialization is unnecessary because the subsequent loop updates the distances based on the edges in the graph.

3. Inefficient Data Structure: The code uses a vector of `edge` structures to represent the graph edges. However, accessing elements in a vector can be slower compared to using a more efficient data structure, such as an array. We can optimize the data structure by using a dynamically allocated array to store the edges.

4. String Concatenation: The code repeatedly uses the `append()` function to concatenate strings to build the final output. This can be inefficient due to the repeated memory allocations and copying. Instead, we can store the distances in a separate array and construct the final output string after the algorithm completes.

5. Compiler Optimization: We can use compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. For example, we can enable compiler optimizations using the `-O2` flag, which instructs the compiler to apply various optimizations to the code.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step.
