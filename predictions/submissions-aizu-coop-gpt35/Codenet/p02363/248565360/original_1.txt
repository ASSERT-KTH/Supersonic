Code Analysis:

1. The `edge` struct represents an edge in a graph, with members `s`, `t`, and `d` representing the source vertex, target vertex, and weight of the edge, respectively.

2. The `edges` vector stores all the edges in the graph.

3. The `ans` string is used to store the output of the program.

4. The `d` array is used to store the shortest distance from the start vertex to each vertex in the graph.

5. The `BellmanFord` function implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest paths from a given start vertex to all other vertices in the graph.

6. The `main` function reads the number of vertices and edges from the input, constructs the graph by reading the edges, and then calls `BellmanFord` for each vertex.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a more efficient data structure to store the edges. The current implementation uses a vector of `edge` structs, which incurs memory overhead for each element and requires linear search to access elements. Instead, we can use an adjacency list representation, where each vertex has a list of outgoing edges. This will reduce the memory usage and improve the access time for edges.

2. Use a more efficient data type for `d` array. The current implementation uses an array of integers to store the shortest distances. However, `__INT_MAX__` is used as a sentinel value to represent infinity, which takes up a lot of memory. Instead, we can use a `vector<int>` and initialize all elements to infinity using `fill` function. This will reduce memory usage and eliminate the need for sentinel values.

3. Avoid unnecessary string concatenation in the `ans` string. The current implementation appends each distance to the `ans` string using `to_string`. This involves creating a new string for each distance, which incurs memory and time overhead. Instead, we can use a `stringstream` to build the output string efficiently.

4. Use compiler optimizations. We can use compiler optimizations like loop unrolling and inline functions to improve the performance of the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the `edges` vector with an adjacency list representation. Instead of storing all edges in a vector, create a vector of vectors, where each vertex has a vector of outgoing edges. This will reduce memory overhead and improve edge access time.

2. Replace the `d` array with a `vector<int>` and initialize all elements to infinity. Change the line `int d[MAX]` to `vector<int> d(vNum, __INT_MAX__)` and remove the `fill` line. This will reduce memory usage and eliminate the need for sentinel values.

3. Replace the string concatenation with a `stringstream`. Create a `stringstream` object at the start of the `BellmanFord` function. Instead of appending each distance to the `ans` string, append it to the `stringstream` using the `<<` operator. After the loop, assign the `stringstream` contents to the `ans` string.

4. Add compiler optimizations. Add the `inline` keyword before the `BellmanFord` function definition to hint the compiler to inline the function. Use compiler-specific pragmas or directives to enable loop unrolling and other optimizations, if supported.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define MAX 100000

struct edge {
  int t, d;
};

vector<vector<edge>> adjList;
string ans;

void BellmanFord(int startVertex, int vNum) {
  vector<int> d(vNum, __INT_MAX__);
  d[startVertex] = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    bool update = false;
    for (int j = 0; j < adjList[i].size(); ++j) {
      edge e = adjList[i][j];
      if (d[i] != __INT_MAX__ && d[e.t] > d[i] + e.d) {
        d[e.t] = d[i] + e.d;
        update = true;
        if (i == vNum - 1) {
          cout << "NEGATIVE CYCLE" << endl;
          return;
        }
      }
    }
    if (!update)
      break;
  }

  stringstream ss;
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    if (i > 0)
      ss << " ";
    if (d[i] == __INT_MAX__) {
      ss << "INF";
    } else {
      ss << d[i];
    }
  }
  ans = ss.str();
}

int main() {
  int vNum, eNum;
  cin >> vNum >> eNum;

  adjList.resize(vNum);

  int s, t, w;
  for (int i = 0; i < eNum; ++i) {
    cin >> s >> t >> w;
    adjList[s].push_back({t, w});
  }

  stringstream ss;
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    BellmanFord(i, vNum);
    ss << ans << "\n";
  }

  cout << ss.str();

  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:
- The optimization steps proposed in this solution aim to improve the performance and memory usage of the original code. However, some trade-offs exist:
  - The adjacency list representation requires additional memory compared to the vector of `edge` structs. However, this is justified by the improved efficiency in accessing edges.
  - The use of a `stringstream` instead of string concatenation may result in slightly increased code complexity. However, it significantly improves the performance by avoiding unnecessary memory allocation and copying during string concatenation.
