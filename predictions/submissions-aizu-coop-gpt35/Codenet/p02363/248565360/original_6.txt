Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structure: The use of a vector to store edges is not efficient in terms of memory usage. Since the number of edges is known in advance, we can use a fixed-size array instead.

2. Redundant computation: The `to_string()` function is called multiple times within the loop to convert integer values to strings. This can be avoided by using a stringstream to build the string representation of the distances.

3. Loop optimization: The nested loops in the `BellmanFord` function can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization step:

1. Inefficient data structure:
   - Replace the `vector<edge>` with a fixed-size array of `edge` structs. Since the maximum number of edges is defined as `MAX`, we can declare an array of size `MAX` to store the edges.
   - Replace `vector<edge> edges;` with `edge edges[MAX];`.

2. Redundant computation:
   - Replace the `ans.append(to_string(d[i]));` statement with a stringstream.
   - Create a stringstream object before the loop: `stringstream ss;`.
   - Instead of `ans.append(to_string(d[i]));`, use `ss << d[i];` to insert the integer value into the stringstream.
   - After the loop, set `ans` to the content of the stringstream: `ans = ss.str();`.

3. Loop optimization:
   - In the `BellmanFord` function, the outer loop iterates `vNum` times, and the inner loop iterates `eNum` times. Since the outer loop does not depend on the inner loop, we can interchange the loops to optimize the code.
   - Change the loop order as follows:
     ```
     for (int j = 0; j < eNum; ++j) {
       for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
         // Rest of the code remains the same
       }
     }
     ```

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - Use compiler optimizations flags such as `-O3` to enable aggressive optimizations during compilation.
   - Use `#pragma GCC optimize` directives to provide hints to the compiler for specific optimizations, such as loop unrolling or inlining.
