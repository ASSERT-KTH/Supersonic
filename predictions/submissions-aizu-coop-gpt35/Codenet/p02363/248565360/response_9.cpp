The given code implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a directed graph. However, there are several potential optimizations that can be made to improve its performance and memory usage.

1. Avoid using the `std::vector<edge>` data structure:
   - The vector `edges` is used to store all the edges in the graph. However, the number of edges is known in advance, so it is more efficient to use a fixed-size array instead of a vector.
   - Replace `vector<edge> edges` with `edge edges[MAX]` to use an array with a fixed size.

2. Avoid using the `std::string` data structure:
   - The string `ans` is used to store the final output. However, using a string for concatenation can be inefficient due to the dynamic resizing and copying involved.
   - Since the number of vertices is known in advance, it is more efficient to use a fixed-size array of characters to store the result.
   - Replace `string ans` with `char ans[MAX * 12]` to allocate enough space for the result.

3. Avoid using `__INT_MAX__` for infinity:
   - The value `__INT_MAX__` is used to represent infinity in the algorithm. However, this is not a portable solution, as it relies on implementation-specific behavior.
   - Instead, use a large value that is guaranteed to be greater than any possible path length in the graph.
   - Replace `__INT_MAX__` with a large constant, such as `INT_MAX` from the `<limits.h>` header.

4. Use `memset` instead of `fill` for array initialization:
   - The `fill` function is used to initialize the `d` array with a value. However, `memset` is a more efficient way to achieve the same result.
   - Replace `fill((int *)d, (d + MAX), __INT_MAX__);` with `memset(d, INT_MAX, sizeof(d));`.

5. Use a better data type for vertex and edge indices:
   - The code currently uses `int` for vertex and edge indices. However, if the number of vertices or edges is large, this can lead to unnecessary memory usage and slower performance.
   - Use a smaller data type, such as `short` or even `char`, if the number of vertices and edges is within the respective range.

6. Optimize the looping structure:
   - The code uses nested loops to iterate over all vertices and edges. However, it can be optimized by rearranging the loops and reducing the number of iterations.
   - Move the loop over vertices inside the loop over edges, so that the inner loop only iterates over the edges adjacent to the current vertex.
   - Replace the second loop with a while loop that terminates early if no updates are made.

7. Use a more efficient way to append integers to the result string:
   - Instead of using `to_string` to convert integers to strings and then appending them to the result string, use a more efficient method.
   - Implement a custom function that converts integers to strings and appends them directly to the result string.

8. Use `puts` instead of `cout` for output:
   - The code currently uses `cout` to print the result string. However, `puts` is a more efficient function for printing strings.
   - Replace `cout << ans;` with `puts(ans);`.
