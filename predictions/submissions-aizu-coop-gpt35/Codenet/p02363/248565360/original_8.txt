Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Use of `std::vector` for the `edges` data structure: The vector is used to store the edges of the graph. However, using a vector incurs overhead due to dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. A more efficient alternative would be to use a fixed-size array since the maximum number of edges is known in advance.

2. Use of `std::string` for `ans`: The `ans` string is used to store the final output. However, using a string and appending to it in each iteration can be inefficient due to repeated reallocation and copying. A more efficient approach would be to use a fixed-size character array and directly write into it.

3. Unnecessary casting in the `fill` function: The `fill` function is called with an array of integers, but it is casted to `(int *)`. This casting is unnecessary and can be removed.

4. Redundant check for `i == vNum - 1` inside the inner loop: The check `if (i == vNum - 1)` is performed inside the inner loop for every edge. This check is only needed once after the inner loop completes. Moving this check outside the inner loop will eliminate redundant computations.

5. Unnecessary use of `to_string` for integer to string conversion: The `to_string` function is used to convert integers to strings when appending to `ans`. However, this function can be expensive in terms of time and memory. Instead, a more efficient approach would be to use a custom integer to string conversion function.

Based on these observations, I will now present a step-by-step optimization strategy along with the corresponding code changes.
