The given code is a dynamic programming solution to a knapsack problem. In this problem, we are given a set of items with weights `w[i]` and we need to find the number of ways to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity `W`.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be made:

1. Redundant Loop: The outermost loop from `N-1` to `0` (i.e., `for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--)`) can be removed. Since the loop only accesses the values of `dp[cur]` and `dp[nxt]`, we can directly access those arrays without the need for an extra loop variable.

2. Redundant Modulo Operation: The `nxt` and `cur` variables are used to switch between the current and next rows of the `dp` array. Instead of using `%` operator, we can use a simple boolean variable to toggle between the rows.

3. Unnecessary Array Indexing: The `dp` array is a 3-dimensional array, with the third dimension always set to `N`. Since the third dimension is always constant, we can remove it from the array and use a 2-dimensional array `dp[2][10001]` instead.

4. Unnecessary Initialization: The `dp` array is initialized with 0 in every iteration of the loop. However, the array is completely overwritten in each iteration, so the initialization can be skipped.

5. Unnecessary Memory Usage: The `nmwidx` variable is used to keep track of the current weight index. However, it can be eliminated by directly using `i` as the weight index. The condition `if (k == N || w[k] > w[i])` can be simplified to `if (w[i] > w[i])` since `k` will always be equal to `i`.

6. Use `memset` instead of Loop Initialization: Instead of using nested loops to initialize the `dp` array, we can use the `memset` function from the `<cstring>` library to set all the elements to 0.

7. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` for Faster I/O: By adding `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` at the beginning of the `main` function, we can disable the synchronization of C++ streams with C standard streams, resulting in faster input/output operations.

Taking these optimizations into account, the optimized code can be written as follows:
