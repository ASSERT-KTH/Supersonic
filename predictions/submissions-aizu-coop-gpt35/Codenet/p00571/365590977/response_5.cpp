Upon analyzing the provided code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The `sort` function is being used to sort the `art` array based on the `size` member of the `Data` struct. However, the comparison function `cmp` is implemented in a non-optimal way. The use of the conditional operator (`? :`) and multiple function calls (`<`, `==`, `<`) within the comparison can be expensive. We can optimize this by using a single comparison using the `std::tie` function.

2. The `Max` function is implemented as an inline function, but it can be further optimized by using the `std::max` function from the `<algorithm>` header.

3. The loop to calculate the `sum_value` and `min_size` variables can be optimized by initializing them to the values of the first element of the `art` array outside the loop. This way, we can avoid unnecessary checks and assignments within the loop.

4. The loop to calculate the `ans` variable can be optimized by avoiding the repeated access to the `art` array elements. Instead, we can use local variables to store the values and sizes of the current and previous elements.
