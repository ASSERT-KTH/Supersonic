Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Data Structure Efficiency: The code uses an array of structures (`Data`) to store the size and value of each item. However, since the size and value are accessed together, it would be more efficient to store them as a single structure member.

2. Redundant Computations: The code computes the maximum value using the `Max` function, which performs unnecessary comparisons. Instead, we can directly use the `>` operator to compare values.

3. Loop Optimization: The code uses a loop to read the input values. We can optimize this loop by using a pointer to directly access the array elements.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and inline functions, to improve performance.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization:

1. Data Structure Efficiency:
   - Replace the `Data` structure with a single structure member that combines the size and value.
   - Update the `cmp` function to compare the combined size and value.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - Replace the `Max` function with the `>` operator to directly compare values.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - Replace the loop that reads the input values with a pointer-based approach to directly access the array elements.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and inline functions, to improve performance. We can add `#pragma` directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now, let's incorporate these optimizations into the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long llong;

#define N_MAX 500000

struct Data {
  llong combined; // Combined size and value
};

bool cmp(const Data &a, const Data &b) {
  return a.combined < b.combined;
}

inline llong Max(llong a, llong b) {
  return a > b ? a : b;
}

int main(void) {
  int N;
  scanf("%d", &N);

  Data art[N_MAX];

  // Read input values using a pointer-based approach
  llong *inputPtr = (llong *)art;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    scanf("%lld %lld", inputPtr++, inputPtr++);
  }

  sort(art, art + N, cmp);

  llong min_size = art[0].combined >> 32; // Extract size from combined
  llong sum_value = art[0].combined & 0xFFFFFFFF; // Extract value from combined
  llong ans = art[0].combined & 0xFFFFFFFF; // Extract value from combined

  for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
    llong combined = art[i].combined;
    llong value = combined & 0xFFFFFFFF; // Extract value from combined
    llong size = combined >> 32; // Extract size from combined

    llong tmp = sum_value + value - (size - min_size);

    if (tmp < value) {
      ans = value;
      sum_value = value;
      min_size = size;
    } else {
      ans = tmp;
      sum_value += value;
    }
  }

  printf("%lld\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we have made the following changes:

1. Replaced the `Data` structure with a single structure member `combined` that stores the size and value.
2. Updated the `cmp` function to compare the `combined` member instead of separate size and value members.
3. Replaced the `Max` function with the `>` operator to directly compare values.
4. Replaced the loop that reads the input values with a pointer-based approach to directly access the array elements.
5. Extracted the size and value from the `combined` member using bit shifting and masking operations.
6. Removed unnecessary assignments and computations.
7. Added comments to highlight the changes made and improve code readability.

These optimizations aim to improve the efficiency of the code by reducing memory usage, eliminating redundant computations, and optimizing loops.

Please note that the performance gain from these optimizations may vary depending on the compiler and the specific hardware architecture. It is recommended to profile the code and evaluate the performance improvements achieved.
