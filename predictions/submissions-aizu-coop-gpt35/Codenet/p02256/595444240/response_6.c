The provided code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, there are several potential areas for optimization:

1. Avoid unnecessary variable initialization: The variable `c` does not need to be initialized to 1. Instead, we can initialize it with the first value of `a % b` in the while loop.

2. Use a more efficient algorithm: The Euclidean algorithm can be optimized by using a bitwise GCD algorithm, which uses bitwise operations to calculate the GCD of two numbers. This algorithm is faster and more memory-efficient than the Euclidean algorithm.

3. Input validation: The code does not include any input validation to ensure that the user enters valid inputs. It is important to check for errors and handle them appropriately.
