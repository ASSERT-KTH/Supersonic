The given code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, there are a few areas where the code can be optimized for better performance and memory usage. 

1. Use a more efficient data type: The code currently uses the `int` data type to store the input numbers and the GCD. However, for larger numbers, `int` may not be sufficient. To handle larger numbers, we can use the `long long int` data type.

2. Reduce unnecessary variable initialization: The variable `c` is initialized with a value of 1 before the while loop. This is unnecessary since `c` will be overwritten inside the loop. Removing this initialization step will optimize the code slightly.

3. Optimize the loop condition: The current loop condition `while (c > 0)` checks if `c` is greater than 0 in each iteration. However, the Euclidean algorithm guarantees that `c` will eventually become 0, so we can simplify the loop condition to `while (c != 0)`.

4. Use the modulo operator instead of division: Instead of using the division operator `%`, we can use the modulo operator `%` which can be faster for some processors.

5. Add a check for the case when one of the numbers is 0: If one of the input numbers is 0, the GCD is the other number itself. Adding a check for this case can optimize the code and handle this special case more efficiently.
