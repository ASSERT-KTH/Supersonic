The provided code is a C++ program that takes a string as input and expands it according to a specific pattern. The expansion is performed based on the number of repetitions specified in the input string. The expanded string is then printed as the output.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks, inefficient memory usage, and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. The `cket` function iterates through the string to find the index of the closing parenthesis for a given opening parenthesis. This operation is performed repeatedly while expanding the string. The current implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the string. This can be optimized by using a stack data structure to keep track of opening parentheses and their corresponding indices, reducing the time complexity to O(1) for finding the closing parenthesis.

2. The `expand` function has a nested loop structure, which can be computationally expensive for large inputs. Additionally, the function creates multiple substrings using `str.substr()`, which incurs additional memory allocation and copying. This can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary substring creation and performing the expansion in a more efficient manner.

3. The `expand` function uses a global variable `n` to keep track of the number of expanded characters. This can lead to potential data race conditions and limit the reusability of the function.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the usage of the `cket` function with a stack-based approach to find the closing parenthesis index.
2. Refactor the `expand` function to perform the expansion in a more efficient manner, avoiding unnecessary substring creation.
3. Remove the global variable `n` and pass it as a parameter to the `expand` function to avoid data race conditions and improve reusability.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization and provide the optimized code.
