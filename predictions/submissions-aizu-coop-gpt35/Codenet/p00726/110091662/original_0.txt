Code Analysis:

1. The code uses recursion to parse and expand the input string. However, the current implementation has several inefficiencies that can be optimized.
2. The function `dfs` uses a string `r` to store the expanded string. However, appending characters to a string one by one using the `+=` operator can be slow, especially when the string becomes large. This can be improved by using a `stringstream` to build the expanded string.
3. The code uses a variable `n` to keep track of the count of a character or a group of characters. However, the use of `n` is not consistent and can be simplified. Instead of checking `n < 0` at multiple places, we can initialize `n` to 1 and update it only when a digit is encountered.
4. The code uses the `substr` function to extract substrings, which creates a new string object each time. This can be avoided by using indices to keep track of the current position in the string.
5. The function `dfs` takes a string `s` as an argument and returns the expanded string. However, the function modifies `s` by appending characters to it, which is unnecessary and can be avoided.
6. The code uses `string::size()` function in the for loop condition, which is called in each iteration. This can be optimized by storing the size of the string in a variable before the loop.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a `stringstream` to build the expanded string instead of appending characters to a string one by one. This will improve the performance of string concatenation.
2. Initialize `n` to 1 instead of -1 and update it only when a digit is encountered. This will simplify the logic and reduce unnecessary checks.
3. Use indices to keep track of the current position in the string instead of using `substr` function. This will avoid the creation of unnecessary string objects.
4. Avoid modifying the input string `s` in the `dfs` function. Instead, pass a constant reference to the function to improve code clarity and avoid unnecessary copying.
5. Store the size of the string in a variable before the loop to avoid calling `string::size()` function in each iteration.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the `#include <cstdio>` with `#include <stdio.h>` to use the C standard library instead of the C++ standard library. This will avoid unnecessary overhead.
2. Replace the `#include <iostream>` with `#include <iostream>` to use the C++ input/output streams library.
3. Replace the `using namespace std;` with `using std::string;` to only import the `string` class from the `std` namespace, reducing the risk of namespace conflicts and improving code readability.
4. Replace `printf` with `std::cout` and `scanf` with `std::cin` to use the C++ input/output streams library instead of the C standard library.
5. Change the `dfs` function signature to `string dfs(const string& s, int& pos)` to pass `s` as a constant reference and add a `pos` parameter to keep track of the current position in the string. This will avoid unnecessary string copying and improve code clarity.
6. Replace the `string r;` with `std::stringstream ss;` to use a `stringstream` to build the expanded string.
7. Replace `r += r0;` with `ss << r0;` to append the expanded string to the `stringstream`.
8. Replace `r.size()` with `N` in the condition `if (r.size() > N)` to avoid unnecessary function calls in each iteration of the loop.
9. Replace the `printf("%c\n", r.size() > N ? r[N] : '0');` with `std::cout << (r.size() > N ? r[N] : '0') << '\n';` to use the C++ output stream instead of `printf`.
10. Replace the `cin` statement with `std::getline(std::cin, s)` to read the input string including spaces.
11. Replace the `cin >> s >> N` with `std::istringstream(s) >> s >> N;` to parse the input string and the integer separately.
12. Remove the unnecessary variable `i` and use `pos` instead to keep track of the current position in the string.
13. Simplify the logic in the `dfs` function by initializing `n` to 1 instead of -1 and update it only when a digit is encountered.
14. Replace the `s.substr(i + 1, j - 1 - i - 1)` with `dfs(s, j);` to recursively call the `dfs` function with the updated position.
15. Remove the unnecessary `else` branches in the `dfs` function to simplify the logic.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

std::string dfs(const std::string& s, int& pos) {
  std::stringstream ss;
  int n = 1;
  int size = s.size();

  while (pos < size) {
    if ('0' <= s[pos] && s[pos] <= '9') {
      n = n * 10 + s[pos] - '0';
      pos++;
    } else if (s[pos] == '(') {
      pos++;
      std::string r0 = dfs(s, pos);
      for (int _ = 0; _ < n; _++) {
        ss << r0;
        if (ss.tellp() > size) {
          break;
        }
      }
      n = 1;
    } else {
      ss << std::string(n, s[pos]);
      n = 1;
      pos++;
    }
  }

  return ss.str();
}

int main() {
  for (;;) {
    std::string s;
    std::getline(std::cin, s);
    if (s == "0") {
      break;
    }
    int N;
    std::istringstream(s) >> s >> N;
    int pos = 0;
    std::string r = dfs(s, pos);
    std::cout << (r.size() > N ? r[N] : '0') << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code uses a `stringstream` to build the expanded string, avoids unnecessary function calls, and simplifies the logic in the `dfs` function. These improvements should result in better performance and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
