The provided code reads 28 integers from the user and inserts them into a set. Then, it iterates from 1 to 30 and checks if each number is present in the set. If not, it prints the number. 

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Use a bitset instead of a set: The set data structure has a time complexity of O(log n) for insertions and searches. However, since we are dealing with a small range of numbers (1 to 30), we can use a bitset to achieve constant time complexity for both insertions and searches. A bitset uses a fixed amount of memory and provides efficient bitwise operations.

2. Avoid unnecessary input/output: The code currently reads integers from the user and prints the missing numbers directly. However, we can eliminate the need for user input and optimize the output by storing the missing numbers in a vector and printing them all at once after the loop.
