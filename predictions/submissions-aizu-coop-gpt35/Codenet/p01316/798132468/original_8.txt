The given code implements a dynamic programming algorithm to solve a problem that involves calculating the minimum cost of adjusting the brightness of a sequence of pixels. However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized for better performance and memory usage.

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not recommended for production code. Instead, include only the necessary headers for the specific functionality used in the code.

2. Replace macros with inline functions: The macros `r(i, n)` and `INF` can be replaced with inline functions to improve code readability and avoid potential issues with macros.

3. Avoid using global variables: The `dp` array is declared as a global variable, which is generally not a good practice. It is better to declare it inside the main function to encapsulate it and avoid potential issues with global state.

4. Use vectors instead of arrays: Instead of using arrays for `b` and `a`, it is more efficient to use vectors. Vectors provide better memory management and can dynamically resize as needed.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code unnecessarily calculates `a[i + 1] - p` twice in the inner loop. It can be calculated once and stored in a variable to improve efficiency.

6. Optimize loop indices: The loop indices can be optimized to avoid unnecessary iterations. For example, in the innermost loop, the loop variable `k` can be used to directly access `b[k]` instead of using an additional variable `p`.

7. Use `std::min_element` instead of manual loop: Instead of manually iterating over all elements in the `dp[n]` array to find the minimum value, `std::min_element` can be used to simplify the code.

8. Utilize compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations can significantly improve the performance of the code. Use the appropriate compiler flags (e.g., `-O2` for GCC) to enable optimization.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and provide the optimized code.
