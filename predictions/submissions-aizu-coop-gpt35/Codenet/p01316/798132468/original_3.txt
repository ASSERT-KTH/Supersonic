The provided code seems to solve a dynamic programming problem, but it could benefit from some performance optimizations. Here's an optimization strategy that can be applied to improve the efficiency of the code:

1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header is not a standard C++ header and includes many unnecessary libraries. Instead, include only the necessary standard headers.

2. Replace the `#define` macro with inline functions: Instead of using the `#define` macro for the `r` macro and `INF` constant, define them as inline functions. This will make the code more readable and avoid any potential issues caused by macro expansion.

3. Use a more efficient data structure for `dp`: The current implementation uses a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table `dp`, which has a size of `20001 x 256`. This can be quite memory-intensive. Instead, we can use a 2D vector to dynamically allocate memory only for the required size.

4. Avoid unnecessary computations: The current code computes the minimum value of `dp[n][i]` for all `i` from 0 to 255. However, since the values of `dp[n][i]` are initialized to `INF`, we only need to compute the minimum value of `dp[n][i]` for `i` from 0 to 255 where `dp[n][i]` is not `INF`.

5. Use `std::min_element` instead of a manual loop: Instead of manually iterating over the elements of `dp[n]` to find the minimum value, we can use the `std::min_element` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` header to find the minimum element in a range.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step-by-step in the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

inline void r(int i, int n) {
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
}

inline int INF() {
  return 100000000;
}

int main() {
  int n, m;
  while (std::cin >> n >> m, n) {
    std::vector<int> b(m);
    std::vector<int> a(n + 1);
    r(i, m) std::cin >> b[i];
    r(i, n) std::cin >> a[i + 1];
    
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n + 1, std::vector<int>(256, INF()));
    dp[0][128] = 1;
    
    r(i, n) r(j, 256) {
      if (dp[i][j] != INF()) {
        r(k, m) {
          int p = j + b[k];
          if (p > 255)
            p = 255;
          if (p < 0)
            p = 0;
          dp[i + 1][p] = std::min(dp[i + 1][p], dp[i][j] + (a[i + 1] - p) * (a[i + 1] - p));
        }
      }
    }
    
    auto minIt = std::min_element(dp[n].begin(), dp[n].end());
    int p = *minIt;
    
    if (p != INF()) {
      std::cout << p - 1 << std::endl;
    }
  }
}
```

These optimizations should improve the performance and memory usage of the code while preserving the functionality and output of the original program.
