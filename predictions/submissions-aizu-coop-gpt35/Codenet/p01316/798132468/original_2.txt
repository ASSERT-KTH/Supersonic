Upon initial analysis, here are a few potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization in the given code:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary headers. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Inefficient data structure: The `dp` array is a 2D array of size `20001 x 256`, which can be quite large. This can lead to inefficient memory usage and slower access times.

3. Redundant computations: The code calculates `a[i + 1] - p` twice in the inner loop. This calculation can be moved outside the loop to avoid redundancy.

4. Unoptimized loops: The nested loops used in the code can potentially be optimized using loop unrolling or loop interchange techniques.

5. Compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations can be used to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now, let's formulate an optimization strategy to address these issues.
