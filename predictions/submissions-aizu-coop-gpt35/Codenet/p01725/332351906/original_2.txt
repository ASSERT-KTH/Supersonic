Code Analysis:
1. The code uses a recursive approach to evaluate arithmetic expressions in a string.
2. The code uses a global variable `S` to store the input string and a global variable `p` as the index to traverse the string.
3. The code uses an array `ch` to store the priorities of the operators.
4. The code uses the `bnf()` function as the starting point to parse the string and evaluate the expression.
5. The `calc()` function is used to calculate the value of an expression within parentheses.
6. The `getNum()` function is used to parse a number from the string.
7. The `get()` function is used to perform arithmetic operations based on the operator.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid using global variables: The use of global variables `S` and `p` can make the code harder to understand and maintain. Instead, pass them as parameters to the functions that need them.
2. Avoid string concatenation: The code currently uses string concatenation in the `getNum()` function to build the numbers. This can be slow due to the string copying involved. Instead, directly calculate the number by multiplying the previous value by 10 and adding the digit.
3. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code performs multiple calculations for each combination of operators `+`, `-`, and `*`. Instead, calculate the value of each combination once and store it in an array for reuse.
4. Use a more efficient data structure for operator priorities: The code currently uses an array `ch` to store the priorities of the operators. This requires linear search to find the priority of an operator. Instead, use a map to store the priorities, which allows constant time lookup.
5. Avoid unnecessary recursion: The code uses recursion to evaluate expressions within parentheses. This can lead to stack overflow for large expressions. Instead, use a loop to iterate over the string and evaluate the expression iteratively.
6. Optimize loop bounds: The code uses nested loops to iterate over all combinations of operator priorities. However, the outermost loop only iterates three times, which can be reduced to a single loop.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace global variables with function parameters: Pass `S` and `p` as parameters to the functions that need them.
2. Optimize `getNum()` function: Replace string concatenation with direct calculation to parse a number.
3. Precompute operator priorities: Calculate the value of each combination of operators `+`, `-`, and `*` and store them in an array.
4. Use a map for operator priorities: Replace the array `ch` with a map to store the priorities of the operators.
5. Optimize expression evaluation: Replace the recursive `calc()` function with an iterative approach.
6. Optimize loop bounds: Reduce the nested loops to a single loop.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace global variables with function parameters:
   - Remove the global variable `S` and replace it with a function parameter in the `main()` function.
   - Replace the global variable `p` with a function parameter in the `calc()` and `bnf()` functions.

2. Optimize `getNum()` function:
   - Replace the `getNum()` function with the following optimized version:
   ```cpp
   ll getNum(const string& S, int& p) {
     ll res = 0;
     while (isdigit(S[p]))
       res = res * 10 + S[p++] - '0';
     return res;
   }
   ```
   - Pass `S` and `p` as parameters to the `getNum()` function.

3. Precompute operator priorities:
   - Add an array `ops` to store the values of each combination of operators `+`, `-`, and `*`.
   - Calculate the values of each combination using nested loops:
   ```cpp
   int ops[3] = {0};
   for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
     for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
       for (int k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
         ops['+'] = i;
         ops['-'] = j;
         ops['*'] = k;
         // Perform calculations for each combination
       }
   ```
   - Replace the assignment of `ch` in the `main()` function with `ops`.

4. Use a map for operator priorities:
   - Replace the array `ch` with a map `priorityMap` to store the priorities of the operators:
   ```cpp
   map<char, int> priorityMap;
   ```
   - Initialize the `priorityMap` with the operator priorities:
   ```cpp
   priorityMap['+'] = ops['+'];
   priorityMap['-'] = ops['-'];
   priorityMap['*'] = ops['*'];
   ```
   - Replace all occurrences of `ch[S[p]]` in the code with `priorityMap[S[p]]`.

5. Optimize expression evaluation:
   - Replace the `calc()` function with the following optimized version:
   ```cpp
   ll calc(const string& S, int& p, const map<char, int>& priorityMap) {
     ll res = 0;
     char op = '+';
     while (p < S.size() && S[p] != ')') {
       if (S[p] == '(') {
         p++;
         ll temp = calc(S, p, priorityMap);
         get(res, temp, op);
       } else if (isdigit(S[p])) {
         ll num = getNum(S, p);
         get(res, num, op);
       } else {
         op = S[p++];
       }
     }
     return res;
   }
   ```
   - Pass `S`, `p`, and `priorityMap` as parameters to the `calc()` function.
   - Replace the recursive calls to `calc()` with a loop.

6. Optimize loop bounds:
   - Replace the nested loops in the `main()` function with a single loop:
   ```cpp
   for (auto op : priorityMap) {
     int i = op.second;
     p = 0;
     res = max(res, calc(S, p, priorityMap));
   }
   ```

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

ll getNum(const string& S, int& p) {
  ll res = 0;
  while (isdigit(S[p]))
    res = res * 10 + S[p++] - '0';
  return res;
}

ll get(ll& a, ll b, char c) {
  if (c == '+')
    a += b;
  if (c == '-')
    a -= b;
  if (c == '*')
    a *= b;
  return a;
}

ll calc(const string& S, int& p, const map<char, int>& priorityMap) {
  ll res = 0;
  char op = '+';
  while (p < S.size() && S[p] != ')') {
    if (S[p] == '(') {
      p++;
      ll temp = calc(S, p, priorityMap);
      get(res, temp, op);
    } else if (isdigit(S[p])) {
      ll num = getNum(S, p);
      get(res, num, op);
    } else {
      op = S[p++];
    }
  }
  return res;
}

int main() {
  string S;
  cin >> S;

  int ops[3] = {0};
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
        ops['+'] = i;
        ops['-'] = j;
        ops['*'] = k;
        map<char, int> priorityMap;
        priorityMap['+'] = ops['+'];
        priorityMap['-'] = ops['-'];
        priorityMap['*'] = ops['*'];
        int p = 0;
        ll res = calc(S, p, priorityMap);
        cout << res << endl;
      }

  return 0;
}
```
