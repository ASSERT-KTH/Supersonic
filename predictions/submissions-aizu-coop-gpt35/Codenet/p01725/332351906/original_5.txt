Code Analysis:
The given code is a C++ program that evaluates a mathematical expression represented as a string. It uses a recursive descent parsing approach to parse and evaluate the expression. The expression can contain the operators '+', '-', and '*', and can include parentheses for grouping.

The code defines several functions:
- `getNum()`: This function extracts a numerical value from the string and returns it as a long long integer.
- `get()`: This function performs the arithmetic operation specified by the operator 'c' on the values 'a' and 'b'.
- `calc()`: This function recursively parses and evaluates the expression.
- `bnf()`: This function is the entry point for parsing and evaluating the expression.
- `main()`: This function reads the input string, initializes the operator array 'ch', and performs a brute-force search over all possible operator combinations to find the maximum result.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. Recursive Parsing: The recursive parsing approach used in the code can be inefficient for large expressions, as it may result in excessive function calls and stack usage.
2. Multiple Function Calls: The 'get()' function is called multiple times within the 'calc()' function, which can lead to redundant computations.
3. Brute-Force Search: The brute-force search in the main loop is not efficient, as it checks all possible combinations of the operators. This can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace Recursive Parsing with Iterative Parsing: Convert the recursive parsing approach to an iterative one using a stack-based approach. This will eliminate the overhead of function calls and reduce stack usage.
2. Eliminate Redundant Function Calls: Instead of calling the 'get()' function multiple times within the 'calc()' function, perform the arithmetic operations directly.
3. Optimize Operator Combinations Search: Instead of checking all possible combinations of the operators in the main loop, optimize the search by considering only the necessary combinations based on the priorities of the operators.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Step 1: Replace Recursive Parsing with Iterative Parsing
- We will replace the recursive parsing approach with an iterative one using a stack-based approach.
- The 'calc()' function will be modified to use a stack to store the intermediate results and operators.
- We will use a while loop to iterate over the characters of the expression string and perform the necessary operations based on the current character.
- The modified 'calc()' function will return the final result of the expression.

Step 2: Eliminate Redundant Function Calls
- The 'get()' function is called multiple times within the 'calc()' function. Instead of using this function, we can directly perform the arithmetic operations.
- We will modify the code in the while loop of the 'calc()' function to directly perform the operations using the current operator and operands.

Step 3: Optimize Operator Combinations Search
- Instead of checking all possible combinations of the operators in the main loop, we can optimize the search by considering only the necessary combinations based on the priorities of the operators.
- We will modify the main loop to iterate over the necessary combinations of operators based on their priorities.
- We will remove the 'ch' array and directly use the operator values in the nested loops of the main loop.

The optimized code eliminates the recursive parsing approach and replaces it with an iterative stack-based approach. It also eliminates redundant function calls and optimizes the operator combinations search. The code is well-commented to highlight the changes made and to make the code easily understandable.
