The provided code calculates a solution to a problem, but it can be optimized for better performance. Here is the step-by-step optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes several unnecessary header files, such as `<algorithm>`, `<bitset>`, `<cassert>`, `<cmath>`, `<complex>`, `<cstdio>`, `<cstring>`, `<iostream>`, `<map>`, `<random>`, and `<unordered_map>`. These can be safely removed, as they are not used in the code.

2. Optimize the `gcd` function: The `gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using a recursive implementation. This recursive approach can be slow for large inputs. We can replace it with the built-in `__gcd` function from the `<algorithm>` header, which is faster. Update the `gcd` function as follows:

```cpp
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  return __gcd(a, b);
}
```

3. Optimize the `ext_gcd` function: The `ext_gcd` function calculates the extended GCD of two numbers. It can be optimized by using a loop instead of recursion. This will improve performance and reduce memory usage. Update the `ext_gcd` function as follows:

```cpp
ll ext_gcd(ll a, ll b, ll &x, ll &y) {
  ll d = a;
  x = 1;
  y = 0;
  while (b) {
    ll q = a / b;
    ll t = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = t;
    t = x;
    x = y;
    y = t - q * y;
  }
  return d;
}
```

4. Optimize the `init` function: The `init` function initializes some variables and calculates values. It can be optimized by removing unnecessary calculations and simplifying the code. Update the `init` function as follows:

```cpp
void init() {
  m = t - (m % t);
  u = gcd(t, w + d);
  h = gcd(t, m);
  tu = t / u;
  th = t / h;
  ll xx, y;
  ext_gcd(m, t, xx, y);
  x = ((xx % th) + th) % th;
}
```

5. Optimize the `solve` function: The `solve` function calculates the solution to the problem. It can be optimized by removing unnecessary variables and simplifying the code. Update the `solve` function as follows:

```cpp
int solve() {
  init();
  int res = 0;
  int l = 0;
  int s = 0;
  int th = t / h;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i += h) {
    if (s < n) {
      res += max(0, (i - w) / u - l);
      l = i / u;
    }
    s += x;
    if (s >= th)
      s -= th;
  }
  res += max(0, (t - w) / u - l);
  return res;
}
```

6. Update the `main` function: Now that we have optimized the other functions, the `main` function can remain as is.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int MN = 501 * 1000 * 1000;
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  return __gcd(a, b);
}
ll ext_gcd(ll a, ll b, ll &x, ll &y) {
  ll d = a;
  x = 1;
  y = 0;
  while (b) {
    ll q = a / b;
    ll t = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = t;
    t = x;
    x = y;
    y = t - q * y;
  }
  return d;
}
int w, d, n, m, t, u, h;
int x, tu, th;
void init() {
  m = t - (m % t);
  u = gcd(t, w + d);
  h = gcd(t, m);
  tu = t / u;
  th = t / h;
  ll xx, y;
  ext_gcd(m, t, xx, y);
  x = ((xx % th) + th) % th;
}
int solve() {
  init();
  int res = 0;
  int l = 0;
  int s = 0;
  int th = t / h;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i += h) {
    if (s < n) {
      res += max(0, (i - w) / u - l);
      l = i / u;
    }
    s += x;
    if (s >= th)
      s -= th;
  }
  res += max(0, (t - w) / u - l);
  return res;
}
int main() {
  cin >> w >> d >> n >> m >> t;
  w++;
  d--;
  printf("%.20f\n", 1.0 * solve() / tu);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code improves performance by using more efficient algorithms and simplifying the calculations. The changes made are minimal and preserve the functionality and output of the original code.
