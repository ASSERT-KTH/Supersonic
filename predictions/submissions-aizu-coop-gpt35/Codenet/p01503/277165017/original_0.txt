The given code calculates a numerical value and prints it as a floating-point number. The main bottleneck in this code is the `solve()` function, which computes the value using a loop. To optimize this code, we can focus on improving the efficiency of the `solve()` function.

Here is the step-by-step optimization strategy for the given code:

1. **Optimize `gcd()` function**: The `gcd()` function is used to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers. This function can be optimized using the Euclidean algorithm, which is more efficient than the recursive implementation provided. The optimized `gcd()` function is as follows:

```c++
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  while (b != 0) {
    ll temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
  }
  return a;
}
```

2. **Optimize `ext_gcd()` function**: The `ext_gcd()` function calculates the extended gcd of two numbers. This function can also be optimized using the iterative version of the extended Euclidean algorithm. The optimized `ext_gcd()` function is as follows:

```c++
ll ext_gcd(ll a, ll b, ll &x, ll &y) {
  ll prev_x = 1, curr_x = 0;
  ll prev_y = 0, curr_y = 1;
  while (b != 0) {
    ll quotient = a / b;
    ll temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
    
    temp = curr_x;
    curr_x = prev_x - quotient * curr_x;
    prev_x = temp;
    
    temp = curr_y;
    curr_y = prev_y - quotient * curr_y;
    prev_y = temp;
  }
  x = prev_x;
  y = prev_y;
  return a;
}
```

3. **Optimize `solve()` function**: The `solve()` function calculates the final result by iterating over a loop. We can optimize this function by removing unnecessary calculations and improving the loop structure. The optimized `solve()` function is as follows:

```c++
int solve() {
  init();
  int res = 0;
  int l = 0;
  int s = 0;
  int th = t / h;
  int max_val = (t - w) / u;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i += h) {
    if (s < n) {
      int curr = (i - w) / u - l;
      res += max(0, curr);
      l = i / u;
    }
    s += x;
    if (s >= th)
      s -= th;
  }
  res += max(0, max_val - l);
  return res;
}
```

4. **Optimize `main()` function**: In the `main()` function, the value of `w` is incremented by 1 and the value of `d` is decremented by 1. We can optimize this part by performing these operations directly in the calculation of `max_val` in the `solve()` function. This will eliminate the need for modifying the input values. The optimized `main()` function is as follows:

```c++
int main() {
  cin >> w >> d >> n >> m >> t;
  printf("%.20f\n", 1.0 * solve() / tu);
  return 0;
}
```

With these optimizations, the performance of the code will be improved, and unnecessary calculations will be eliminated. The final optimized code is as follows:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <cassert>
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <random>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<ll, ll> P;

ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  while (b != 0) {
    ll temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
  }
  return a;
}

ll ext_gcd(ll a, ll b, ll &x, ll &y) {
  ll prev_x = 1, curr_x = 0;
  ll prev_y = 0, curr_y = 1;
  while (b != 0) {
    ll quotient = a / b;
    ll temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
    
    temp = curr_x;
    curr_x = prev_x - quotient * curr_x;
    prev_x = temp;
    
    temp = curr_y;
    curr_y = prev_y - quotient * curr_y;
    prev_y = temp;
  }
  x = prev_x;
  y = prev_y;
  return a;
}

int solve() {
  init();
  int res = 0;
  int l = 0;
  int s = 0;
  int th = t / h;
  int max_val = (t - w - 1) / u;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i += h) {
    if (s < n) {
      int curr = (i - w) / u - l;
      res += max(0, curr);
      l = i / u;
    }
    s += x;
    if (s >= th)
      s -= th;
  }
  res += max(0, max_val - l);
  return res;
}

int main() {
  cin >> w >> d >> n >> m >> t;
  ll m = t - m % t;
  ll u = gcd(t, w + d);
  ll h = gcd(t, m);
  ll tu = t / u;
  ll th = t / h;
  ll xx, y;
  ext_gcd(m, t, xx, y);
  int x = ((xx % th) + th) % th;
  printf("%.20f\n", 1.0 * solve() / tu);
  return 0;
}
