Analysis:
- The code uses a recursive approach to explore all possible combinations of colors on a grid.
- It maintains a matrix `V` to represent the grid, where each element is an integer representing a color.
- The function `on` is called recursively to explore all possible combinations of colors.
- The function `calc` is used to calculate the size of a connected component of a given color.
- The algorithm starts with the color of the top-left element of the grid and explores all possible combinations of colors by calling `on`.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid unnecessary copying of the grid: The `temp` matrix is used to create a copy of the grid in each recursive call of `on`. This can be avoided by passing the grid by reference and reverting the changes after each recursive call.
2. Avoid redundant calculations: The function `calc` calculates the size of a connected component starting from a given position. However, it recalculates the size multiple times for the same connected component. This can be avoided by using memoization or by marking visited positions.
3. Use a more efficient data structure for marking visited positions: The `used` matrix is used to mark visited positions. However, it is an array of booleans and requires `O(h*w)` space. We can use a bitset or a bitmask to reduce the memory usage to `O(h*w/8)` or `O(h*w/32)` respectively.
4. Use loop unrolling: The loops in the code can be unrolled to reduce the overhead of loop control.
5. Use compiler optimizations: We can enable compiler optimizations to let the compiler perform low-level optimizations.

Optimization strategy:
1. Pass the grid by reference in the `on` function and revert the changes after each recursive call.
2. Use memoization or marking of visited positions in the `calc` function to avoid redundant calculations.
3. Use a bitset or bitmask for marking visited positions instead of a boolean matrix.
4. Unroll the loops in the code.
5. Enable compiler optimizations using pragma directives.

Step-by-step explanation of optimizations:
1. Pass the grid by reference in the `on` function and revert the changes after each recursive call:
   - Modify the `on` function signature to take `P& N` instead of `P N`.
   - Instead of assigning `temp = N` and reverting the changes at the end of the function, modify the recursive calls to pass `N` directly.
   - Remove the line `temp = N;` and the line `temp[y][x] = 0;` from the `calc` function.
   - Add `N[y][x] = 0;` after the recursive call to `calc` in the `calc` function.
   - Remove the line `temp[y][x] = c;` from the `on` function.
2. Use memoization or marking of visited positions in the `calc` function to avoid redundant calculations:
   - Add a memoization matrix `memo` of type `P` with dimensions `h` x `w` and initialize all elements to zero.
   - Modify the `calc` function to check if `memo[y][x]` is non-zero before starting the calculation.
   - If `memo[y][x]` is non-zero, return immediately without performing the calculation.
   - After the calculation is complete, store the result in `memo[y][x]`.
3. Use a bitset or bitmask for marking visited positions instead of a boolean matrix:
   - Replace the declaration `bool used[8][8];` with `bitset<64> used;`.
   - Replace the line `used[now.first][now.second] = true;` with `used.set(now.first * w + now.second);`.
   - Replace the line `if (used[now.first][now.second]) continue;` with `if (used.test(now.first * w + now.second)) continue;`.
4. Unroll the loops in the code:
   - Unroll the loops in the `calc` function by manually expanding the loop body 4 times.
   - Unroll the loops in the `on` function by manually expanding the loop body 6 times.
5. Enable compiler optimizations using pragma directives:
   - Add `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")` at the beginning of the code to enable aggressive compiler optimizations.
