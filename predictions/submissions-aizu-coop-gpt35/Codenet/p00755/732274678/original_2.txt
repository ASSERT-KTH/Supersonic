The given code is a program that solves a grid-based puzzle game. The goal of the game is to maximize the number of connected cells of the same color. The program takes the dimensions of the grid (height and width) and the initial color of the top-left cell. For each grid, it calculates the maximum number of connected cells of the same color and outputs the result.

Upon analyzing the code, here are some potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant calculations: The `calc` function performs a depth-first search to count the number of connected cells. However, it uses a temporary grid (`temp`) to mark visited cells and modifies it during the search. This creates unnecessary overhead of copying the entire grid and resetting it for each calculation. Instead, we can modify the `calc` function to take the grid as a reference parameter and mark visited cells by setting them to zero. This eliminates the need for the temporary grid.

2. Unnecessary recursion: The `on` function is called recursively to try different colors for the top-left cell. However, the recursion is not necessary for all cases. It is only required when `count` is less than 4, i.e., when we haven't yet tried all four directions. For `count` equal to 4, we can directly call the `on` function with the same color as the top-left cell. This optimization reduces the number of unnecessary function calls.

3. Memory allocation: The vector `V` is resized for each test case, which involves allocating and freeing memory. Instead, we can resize it once outside the loop and reuse it for all test cases. This eliminates the overhead of memory allocation and improves performance.

4. Unused variables: The variable `tres` is declared twice in the `on` function, leading to confusion and potential bugs. We can remove the inner declaration and use the outer `tres` variable consistently.

Based on these optimizations, let's proceed with modifying the code step by step.
