Code Analysis:
- The code calculates the maximum time it takes for a point to reach a target point, given a fixed speed. It does this by iteratively moving towards the target point and adjusting the step size.
- The code uses a custom `point` struct to represent 2D points and a vector of `point` objects to store the target points.
- The code also uses a vector of doubles to store the speeds of each target point.
- The main optimization opportunities in this code are:
  1. The `add` function can be optimized to avoid unnecessary floating-point operations.
  2. The `dist` function can be optimized to avoid unnecessary square root calculations.
  3. The loop that calculates the maximum distance can be optimized to avoid unnecessary distance calculations.
  4. The loop that calculates the maximum time can be optimized to avoid unnecessary distance calculations.
  5. The loop that calculates the maximum time can be optimized to avoid unnecessary division operations.
  6. The loop that calculates the maximum time can be optimized to avoid unnecessary subtraction operations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Optimization of the `add` function:
   - The current implementation uses the `abs` function to check if `a + b` is close to zero.
   - Instead of using `abs`, we can directly compare `a + b` with zero by subtracting `EPS * (abs(a) + abs(b))` from `a + b` and checking if the result is less than zero.
   - This avoids unnecessary floating-point operations caused by calling the `abs` function.
   - This optimization reduces the number of floating-point operations in the `add` function.

2. Optimization of the `dist` function:
   - The current implementation uses the `sqrt` and `pow` functions to calculate the distance between two points.
   - Instead of using `sqrt` and `pow`, we can directly calculate the squared distance by squaring the differences in x and y coordinates.
   - This avoids the costly square root calculation and reduces the number of floating-point operations in the `dist` function.

3. Optimization of the loop that calculates the maximum distance:
   - The current implementation calculates the distance between `now` and each target point in each iteration of the loop.
   - Instead of calculating the distance for each point, we can calculate the distance only once and store it in a temporary variable.
   - We can then use this temporary variable to compare distances and find the maximum distance.
   - This avoids unnecessary distance calculations and reduces the number of floating-point operations in the loop.

4. Optimization of the loop that calculates the maximum time:
   - The current implementation calculates the distance between `now` and each target point and divides it by the speed of each point in each iteration of the loop.
   - Instead of calculating the distance and speed for each point, we can calculate the distance and speed only once and store them in temporary variables.
   - We can then use these temporary variables to calculate the time and compare times to find the maximum time.
   - This avoids unnecessary distance and speed calculations and reduces the number of floating-point operations in the loop.

5. Optimization of the loop that calculates the maximum time:
   - The current implementation subtracts the coordinates of `now` and a target point in each iteration of the loop.
   - Instead of subtracting the coordinates, we can calculate the difference in coordinates only once and store it in a temporary variable.
   - We can then use this temporary variable to calculate the new value of `now` in each iteration.
   - This avoids unnecessary subtraction operations and reduces the number of floating-point operations in the loop.

6. Compiler optimizations:
   - We can use compiler-specific optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
   - These optimizations may include loop unrolling, loop vectorization, or other low-level optimizations provided by the compiler.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Optimization of the `add` function:
   - Replace the condition `if (abs(a + b) < EPS * (abs(a) + abs(b)))` with `if (a + b < -EPS * (abs(a) + abs(b)) || a + b > EPS * (abs(a) + abs(b)))`.
   - This avoids unnecessary floating-point operations caused by calling the `abs` function.

2. Optimization of the `dist` function:
   - Replace `return sqrt(pow(a.x - b.x, 2) + pow(a.y - b.y, 2));` with `return (a.x - b.x) * (a.x - b.x) + (a.y - b.y) * (a.y - b.y);`.
   - This avoids the costly square root calculation and reduces the number of floating-point operations in the `dist` function.

3. Optimization of the loop that calculates the maximum distance:
   - Replace the loop `for (int i = 0; i < P.size(); i++)` with `for (const auto& p : P)`.
   - Replace `dist(now, P[i]) / V[i]` with `dist_now_p / v`.
   - Calculate `dist_now_p` outside the loop once: `double dist_now_p = dist(now, p);`.
   - Calculate `v` outside the loop once: `double v = V[i];`.
   - Update the maximum distance calculation to `ans = max(ans, dist_now_p / v);`.
   - This avoids unnecessary distance calculations and reduces the number of floating-point operations in the loop.

4. Optimization of the loop that calculates the maximum time:
   - Replace the loop `for (double d = 10; d > EPS; d *= r)` with `for (double d = 10; d > EPS; d *= r*r)`.
   - Replace `dist(now, P[j]) / V[j]` with `dist_now_p / v`.
   - Calculate `dist_now_p` outside the loop once: `double dist_now_p = dist(now, P[mx]);`.
   - Calculate `v` outside the loop once: `double v = V[mx];`.
   - Replace `now = now + ((P[mx] - now) / dist(P[mx], now) * d);` with `now = now + ((p_diff) / dist_now_p * d);`.
   - Calculate `p_diff` outside the loop once: `point p_diff = P[mx] - now;`.
   - This avoids unnecessary distance calculations, division operations, and subtraction operations in the loop.

5. Compiler optimizations:
   - Use compiler-specific optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
   - This may include loop unrolling, loop vectorization, or other low-level optimizations provided by the compiler.
