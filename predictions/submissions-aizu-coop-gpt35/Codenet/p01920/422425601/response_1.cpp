The provided code is a C++ program that solves a specific problem using a square root decomposition technique. The program reads an input string `s` of length `n` consisting of 0s and 1s. It then performs `q` queries on the string `s` and prints the result of each query.

The program uses a `sqrt_decomp` class to perform square root decomposition on the input string `s`. The `sqrt_decomp` class divides the string into smaller buckets and stores them in a vector of vectors. It also maintains an additional vector to keep track of updates made to the buckets.

The program then iterates through the queries and performs operations on the `sqrt_decomp` objects `f` and `g` based on the query parameters. Finally, it calculates and prints the result of each query.

Now, let's analyze the code to identify potential optimization opportunities:

1. Use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header includes many standard library headers, which may not all be necessary for this program. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers explicitly, as it can improve compile times and reduce dependency on unnecessary libraries.

2. Use of `using namespace std;`: This line imports the entire `std` namespace, which can lead to potential naming conflicts and make the code less readable. It is considered a good practice to avoid using this statement and instead specify the namespace explicitly when necessary.

3. Use of `#define` macros: The code uses macros to define repetitive code snippets like loops and debugging statements. While macros can provide a concise way to write code, they can also make the code harder to read, debug, and maintain. It is recommended to replace these macros with explicit code to improve code clarity.

4. Inefficient memory usage: The `sqrt_decomp` class uses a vector of vectors to store the buckets, which can result in inefficient memory usage. Each bucket is represented as a separate vector, which introduces additional memory overhead. It is possible to optimize this data structure to reduce memory consumption.

5. Redundant computations: The code repeatedly computes the sum of bucket elements and the sizes of individual buckets. These computations can be avoided by maintaining additional variables to track these values and updating them incrementally whenever necessary.

6. Inefficient query processing: The code processes each query by iterating over the buckets and updating the bucket elements. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) for each query. It is possible to optimize the query processing to achieve better performance.

Based on the analysis, here is an optimization strategy to improve the performance and memory usage of the code:

1. Replace the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary standard library headers, such as `iostream`, `vector`, `string`, and `cmath`. Remove any unnecessary headers.

2. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement and specify the `std` namespace explicitly where necessary.

3. Replace the `#define` macros with explicit code. This will result in more readable and maintainable code.

4. Optimize the memory usage of the `sqrt_decomp` class:
    - Instead of using a vector of vectors to store the buckets, use a single vector to store all the elements.
    - Maintain an additional vector to store the starting index of each bucket.
    - Update the bucket sum and size incrementally whenever an element is updated.
    - Update the `sum()` function to calculate the sum using the bucket sum and sizes.

5. Optimize the query processing:
    - Instead of iterating over each bucket, calculate the starting and ending indices of the range within each bucket.
    - Update the elements within the range and update the bucket sum and size incrementally.
    - Update the `query()` function to handle the new range-based updates.
