The given code implements a square root decomposition algorithm to efficiently answer queries on a sequence of numbers. The main performance bottleneck in this code is the use of vectors to store the buckets and update values. The vector operations like push_back and resizing are expensive operations that can be optimized. Additionally, there are unnecessary computations and redundant checks in the query function that can be eliminated.

Here is an optimization strategy to improve the performance of the code:

1. Replace the vector of vectors (`buckets`) with a single dynamic array (`int*`). This will reduce the overhead of vector operations like push_back and resizing.

2. Use a single dynamic array (`int*`) to store the update values instead of a vector. This will eliminate the need for vector operations in the sum function.

3. Eliminate the unnecessary loop in the sum function. Instead of checking the update value for each bucket, we can maintain a separate sum variable for the buckets with update value 2. This will eliminate the need for multiple iterations over the buckets.

4. Optimize the query function by removing redundant checks and unnecessary computations. Instead of updating the entire bucket, we can update only the necessary elements in the bucket. This will reduce the number of assignments and improve the query performance.

5. Use loop unrolling in the query function to optimize the loop iterations. Instead of checking the conditions for each iteration, we can use if statements to handle the first and last iterations separately.

6. Use compiler optimizations like loop unrolling and inline functions to further improve performance. This can be achieved by using compiler directives like `#pragma` or compiler-specific options.
