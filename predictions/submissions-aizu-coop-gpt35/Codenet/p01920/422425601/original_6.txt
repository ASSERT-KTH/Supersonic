The provided code is for a program that performs queries on a string of binary digits. The program uses a square root decomposition technique to efficiently answer the queries. However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized for better performance and memory usage. 

Let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. Macro Definitions: The code uses several macro definitions, such as `rep`, `debug`, and `print`. While these macros may provide convenience during debugging, they add unnecessary complexity to the code and can hinder optimization efforts. It is recommended to remove these macros and use explicit code instead.

2. Unnecessary Includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended for production code. In this case, only the `<iostream>` and `<vector>` headers are needed. It is recommended to remove the unnecessary includes for better compilation times.

3. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses a vector of vectors (`buckets`) to store the digits in each bucket. This can lead to inefficient memory usage and slower access times. It is recommended to use a flat vector instead, where the index of each element corresponds to its position in the buckets.

4. Redundant Computations: The code performs redundant computations inside the `query` function. For example, it recomputes the bucket index and bucket size for each iteration of the loop. These computations can be moved outside the loop to improve performance.

5. Inefficient Looping: The code uses a `while` loop to iterate from `l` to `r` inside the `query` function. This loop can be replaced with a `for` loop to improve readability and potentially optimize the loop execution.

6. Unoptimized Query Conditions: The code uses multiple conditions inside the `if` statements to check for boundaries and update values. These conditions can be simplified and optimized to avoid unnecessary checks.

7. Unnecessary Function Calls: The code calls `f.sum()` and `g.sum()` inside the loop to compute the sum of the elements in the data structures. These function calls can be replaced with variables that store the current sum to avoid recomputing it multiple times.

Based on the analysis, here is the proposed optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary macro definitions.
2. Remove unnecessary includes and keep only `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.
3. Replace the vector of vectors (`buckets`) with a flat vector (`bucket_values`) to improve memory usage and access times.
4. Move the computation of bucket index and bucket size outside the loop in the `query` function.
5. Replace the `while` loop with a `for` loop in the `query` function.
6. Simplify and optimize the conditions inside the `if` statements in the `query` function.
7. Replace the function calls to `f.sum()` and `g.sum()` with variables that store the current sum.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step by step:

In the optimized code, the unnecessary macro definitions have been removed. The unnecessary includes have been removed, and only `<iostream>` and `<vector>` are included. The vector of vectors (`buckets`) has been replaced with a flat vector (`bucket_values`). The computation of the bucket index and bucket size has been moved outside the loop in the `query` function. The `while` loop has been replaced with a `for` loop in the `query` function. The conditions inside the `if` statements in the `query` function have been simplified and optimized. The function calls to `f.sum()` and `g.sum()` have been replaced with variables that store the current sum.

These optimizations aim to improve the efficiency of the code by reducing unnecessary computations, optimizing loops, and improving memory usage. The optimized code should have better performance and reduced memory footprint compared to the original code.
