After analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The `vector<vector<int>> buckets` data structure is used to store the values in each bucket. However, this nested vector is not efficient in terms of memory usage and cache locality. Instead, we can use a one-dimensional vector and calculate the indices of the buckets and elements.
   - The `vector<int> update` and `vector<int> bucket_sum` are used to store the update status and sum of each bucket, respectively. However, we can eliminate the `update` vector and use a flag value (e.g., -1) to indicate that the bucket needs to be updated. Additionally, we can eliminate the `bucket_sum` vector and calculate the sum dynamically when needed.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `query` function has redundant computations in both the while loops. The same code block is duplicated for updating the bucket values and calculating the bucket sums. Instead of duplicating the code, we can move the common code outside the while loops and update the bucket values and sums once.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The `query` function has two while loops that iterate over the elements in the buckets. We can optimize these loops by using pointer arithmetic instead of indexing to access the elements, which can potentially reduce memory access overheads.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations by adding the appropriate compiler flags or pragma directives. This will allow the compiler to apply various optimizations, such as loop unrolling, vectorization, and inline function expansion, to improve the performance of the code.
