## Code Analysis
Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant Computations: There are several functions that perform redundant computations, such as `abs(Point a)`, which calculates the norm of a point and then calculates the square root of the norm. This can be optimized by directly calculating the distance without calculating the norm and square root separately.
2. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses `vector` to store candidate lines and points, but the `push_back()` and `erase()` operations are called frequently. These operations can be expensive, especially when the vector grows large. A more efficient data structure, such as `std::set` or `std::unordered_set`, can be used to store unique candidate points without the need for manual sorting and duplicate removal.
3. Unnecessary Sorts: The code sorts the candidate points and the candidate lines, but the sorted order is not used for any purpose. These sorts can be eliminated to improve performance.
4. Redundant Line Calculations: The code calculates the intersection point of two lines multiple times, even if the lines have already been compared before. This can be optimized by storing the intersection points in a map or set and reusing them when needed.
5. Unoptimized Loops: There are nested loops in the `compute()` function that iterate over all possible combinations of lines and points. These loops can be optimized by using more efficient algorithms or data structures.

## Optimization Strategy
Based on the code analysis, the following optimization steps can be taken:

1. Replace `abs(Point a)` with a direct distance calculation function.
2. Replace `vector<Point>` with `std::unordered_set<Point>` to store unique candidate points.
3. Remove unnecessary sorts of candidate points and lines.
4. Cache the intersection points of lines to avoid redundant calculations.
5. Optimize the nested loops in the `compute()` function.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### Optimization 1: Replace `abs(Point a)` with a direct distance calculation function
The `abs(Point a)` function calculates the Euclidean distance of a point by first calculating the norm and then calculating the square root of the norm. This can be optimized by directly calculating the distance without calculating the norm and square root separately.

```cpp
// Before
double abs(Point a) { return sqrt(norm(a)); }

// After
double distance(Point a) { return sqrt(a.x * a.x + a.y * a.y); }
```

### Optimization 2: Replace `vector<Point>` with `std::unordered_set<Point>` to store unique candidate points
The code currently uses a `vector` to store candidate points, but it is inefficient when it comes to duplicate removal and frequent insertions and deletions. By using an `unordered_set`, we can store unique points without the need for manual sorting and duplicate removal.

```cpp
// Before
vector<Point> candidatePoints;

// After
unordered_set<Point> candidatePoints;
```

### Optimization 3: Remove unnecessary sorts of candidate points and lines
The code sorts the candidate points and lines, but the sorted order is not used for any purpose. These sorts can be eliminated to improve performance.

```cpp
// Before
sort(v.begin(), v.end());

// After
// No sorting required
```

### Optimization 4: Cache the intersection points of lines to avoid redundant calculations
The code calculates the intersection point of two lines multiple times, even if the lines have already been compared before. This can be optimized by storing the intersection points in a map or set and reusing them when needed.

```cpp
// Before
Point cp = crosspoint(line1, line2);

// After
unordered_map<pair<Line, Line>, Point> intersectionCache;
Point cp;

if (intersectionCache.find(make_pair(line1, line2)) != intersectionCache.end()) {
  cp = intersectionCache[make_pair(line1, line2)];
} else {
  cp = crosspoint(line1, line2);
  intersectionCache[make_pair(line1, line2)] = cp;
}
```

### Optimization 5: Optimize the nested loops in the `compute()` function
The nested loops in the `compute()` function can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm or data structure. One possible approach is to use a `set` or `unordered_set` to keep track of lines that have already been compared.

```cpp
// Before
rep(i, candidateLines.size()) REP(j, i + 1, candidateLines.size())

// After
unordered_set<Line> comparedLines;
rep(i, candidateLines.size()) {
  // Skip comparison if line has already been compared
  if (comparedLines.find(candidateLines[i]) != comparedLines.end()) {
