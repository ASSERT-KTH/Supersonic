First, let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it may increase compilation time. We should include only the necessary headers.

2. Redundant operators: The `abs` function is used for both floating-point and integer values, but the code includes `fabs` for floating-point values. We should use `fabs` consistently for floating-point values and `abs` for integer values.

3. Inefficient sorting: The code sorts the `candidatePoints` vector using the `sort` function, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). However, since the `candidatePoints` vector is already sorted, we can use `std::unique` to remove duplicates in O(n) time complexity.

4. Inefficient distance calculation: The code calculates the distance between two points using the `distanceLP` function, which involves multiple calculations and function calls. We can optimize this calculation by directly calculating the Euclidean distance between two points using the formula `sqrt(pow(p.x - q.x, 2) + pow(p.y - q.y, 2))`.

5. Unnecessary calculations: The code calculates the cross product multiple times for the same points. We can optimize this by storing the cross product results in variables and reusing them as needed.

6. Inefficient loop iteration: The code uses nested loops to check for intersections between line segments. We can optimize this by using a hash set or a map to store unique line segments and check for intersections more efficiently.

Based on the analysis, here is the optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary headers.
2. Replace `fabs` with `abs` for both floating-point and integer values.
3. Replace the sorting of `candidatePoints` with `std::unique`.
4. Replace the calculation of the distance between two points with the direct Euclidean distance formula.
5. Store the cross product results in variables and reuse them as needed.
6. Use a hash set or map to store unique line segments and optimize intersection checks.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and provide the optimized code:

#define COUNTER_CLOCKWISE 1

  }
  bool operator==(const Point &p) const {
    return fabs(x - p.x) < EPS && fabs(y - p.y) < EPS;
  }
};
