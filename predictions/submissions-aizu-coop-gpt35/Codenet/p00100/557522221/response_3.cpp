This code performs some calculations based on the input data and outputs certain values based on the results. However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized for better performance and reduced memory usage.

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The code currently uses a `map<int, long long>` to store the calculated values. While this provides fast lookup, it also introduces additional overhead due to the internal data structure and maintaining the order of elements. Since the order of elements is not important in this code, we can replace the `map` with a `unordered_map` to improve performance.
   - The code also uses a `vector<int>` to store the unique values encountered. However, this introduces unnecessary memory allocation and reallocation overhead. We can replace the `vector` with an `unordered_set` to efficiently store unique values without worrying about ordering.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The code checks if `m[i]` is zero to determine if `i` is a new value. Instead, we can use the `unordered_map`'s `count` function to check if `i` is present in the map. This eliminates the need for the `vector` and the check for `m[i]` being zero.
   - The code iterates over `vec` to find the elements in the map that have a value greater than or equal to 1,000,000. However, we can directly iterate over the map and check the value without the need for the `vec` vector.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The code uses a `while` loop to read the input values and perform the calculations. Instead, we can use a `for` loop with a fixed number of iterations to improve performance.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization, to improve the performance of the code. These optimizations can be enabled using compiler-specific pragmas or flags.
