The provided code reads a series of inputs, calculates a value for each input, and then checks if any of the calculated values are greater than or equal to 1,000,000. If a calculated value meets this condition, the corresponding input is printed; otherwise, "NA" is printed.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Reducing memory usage:
   - The `map` data structure is used to store the calculated values. However, since we only need to check if a value is greater than or equal to 1,000,000, we can replace the `map` with a simple `unordered_set` to reduce memory usage.

2. Avoiding unnecessary calculations:
   - The current implementation calculates the product of `p` and `q` for each input, even if the input is already present in the `map`. We can optimize this by checking if the input is already in the `unordered_set` before performing the calculation.

3. Using range-based loops:
   - The `for` loop iterating over `vec` can be optimized by using a range-based loop, which is more efficient.

4. Compiler optimization hints:
   - We can use compiler optimization flags or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
