The given code reads a sequence of inputs from the user and stores them in a map data structure. It then iterates over the map to find the keys whose corresponding values are greater than or equal to 1,000,000 and prints them. If no keys meet this criteria, it prints "NA".

Here are some potential optimizations that can be applied to this code:

1. Avoid using the `namespace std`: It is generally considered a good practice to avoid using `using namespace std` because it can lead to name clashes and confusion. Instead, explicitly prefix the standard library types and functions with `std::`.

2. Improve memory usage:
   - The current code uses a `map` to store the values, which requires memory for both the key-value pairs and the underlying binary search tree. Since the keys are integers and the range of possible keys is not specified, it is more memory-efficient to use a `vector` instead of a `map`.
   - Additionally, the code uses a separate `vector` to keep track of the keys. This can be eliminated by using a `vector<pair<int, long long>>` instead, where each pair represents a key-value pair.

3. Simplify the loop:
   - The loop that iterates over the vector can be simplified by using a range-based for loop instead of an index-based loop. This eliminates the need to access the elements using indices.
   - The iterator `it` is not necessary. Instead, we can directly access the key and value using `vec[i].first` and `vec[i].second`.

4. Use a more efficient output mechanism:
   - The code currently prints the result immediately when a key with a value greater than or equal to 1,000,000 is found. This can result in multiple calls to the output function, which can be inefficient. Instead, we can store the keys in a vector and print them all at once after the loop.

Taking all these optimizations into consideration, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

int main() {
  int n, i;
  while (std::cin >> n, n) {
    std::vector<std::pair<int, long long>> vec;
    long long p, q;
    bool found = false;

    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      std::cin >> i >> p >> q;
      bool isNewKey = true;
      for (auto& pair : vec) {
        if (pair.first == i) {
          pair.second += p * q;
          isNewKey = false;
          break;
        }
      }
      if (isNewKey) {
        vec.push_back(std::make_pair(i, p * q));
      }
    }

    std::vector<int> resultKeys;
    for (const auto& pair : vec) {
      if (pair.second >= 1000000) {
        found = true;
        resultKeys.push_back(pair.first);
      }
    }

    if (found) {
      for (const auto& key : resultKeys) {
        std::cout << key << std::endl;
      }
    } else {
      std::cout << "NA" << std::endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code improves memory usage by using a `vector<pair<int, long long>>` to store the key-value pairs instead of a `map`. It also simplifies the loop and output mechanism to reduce unnecessary computation and improve efficiency.
