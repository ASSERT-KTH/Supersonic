The given code is a program that reads multiple 8x8 binary matrices and performs a recursive flood-fill algorithm to set all connected cells to 0 starting from a given cell. The program then prints the modified matrix. 

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary header files like `algorithm`, `bitset`, `complex`, `functional`, `map`, `numeric`, `queue`, `set`, `sstream`, `stack`, `utility`, and `vector`. Since none of these headers are used in the code, we can remove them.

2. Remove unnecessary defines: The code defines several unnecessary macros like `FOR`, `REP`, `ALL`, `fi`, `se`, `PI`, `INF`, `MOD`, and `EPS`. These macros are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Optimize the flood-fill algorithm: The current implementation of the flood-fill algorithm uses recursion, which can be inefficient for large matrices. We can optimize this algorithm by using an iterative approach instead of recursion. This will eliminate the overhead of function calls and improve performance.

4. Optimize the input/output operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations can be slow, especially when performing them multiple times. We can optimize this by using faster input/output methods like `scanf` and `printf`.

5. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables `dx`, `dy`, and `n` are not used in the code. We can remove them to improve code readability.

6. Use `size_t` for loop variables: The loop variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are currently defined as `long long`. Since they are used as loop indices, it is more appropriate to define them as `size_t` to avoid any potential issues with negative values.
