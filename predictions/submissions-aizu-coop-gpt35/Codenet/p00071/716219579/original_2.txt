Code Analysis:
- The code uses a recursive function `solve` to perform a flood fill algorithm, starting from a given position and marking all connected cells as visited.
- The code reads input for multiple test cases, each consisting of an 8x8 grid of cells containing either 0 or 1, followed by the starting position for the flood fill algorithm.
- The output displays the modified grid after performing the flood fill algorithm for each test case.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
- The code uses recursion to perform the flood fill algorithm. Recursive function calls can be expensive in terms of memory usage and function call overhead.
- The code uses a 2D array to represent the grid. Accessing elements of a 2D array can be less cache-friendly compared to a 1D array.
- The code uses nested loops to iterate over the grid multiple times. This can result in redundant computations and slower performance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the recursive flood fill algorithm with an iterative approach using a stack.
2. Use a 1D array to represent the grid instead of a 2D array.
3. Avoid redundant computations by optimizing the loops.
4. Utilize compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler for further optimizations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the recursive flood fill algorithm with an iterative approach using a stack:
   - Create a stack to store the positions that need to be visited.
   - Push the starting position onto the stack.
   - While the stack is not empty, do the following:
     - Pop a position from the stack.
     - Mark the position as visited by setting the corresponding element in the 1D array to 0.
     - Push the neighboring positions (if they are within the grid and have not been visited) onto the stack.

2. Use a 1D array to represent the grid instead of a 2D array:
   - Declare a 1D array of size 64 to represent the grid.
   - Modify the code to access elements of the grid using a single index instead of two indices.
   - Update the code to calculate the indices based on the row and column of the grid.

3. Avoid redundant computations by optimizing the loops:
   - Move the initialization of `ny` and `nx` outside the inner loop to avoid redundant calculations.
   - Change the inner loop to iterate until `j` reaches the minimum of 3 or the remaining distance to the edge of the grid.

4. Utilize compiler optimizations and pragma directives:
   - Add compiler optimizations flags (`-O3` for GCC and Clang) to enable aggressive optimizations.
   - Use the `#pragma GCC optimize` directive to enable specific optimizations, such as loop unrolling.

The optimized code replaces the recursive flood fill algorithm with an iterative approach using a stack. It also uses a 1D array to represent the grid and optimizes the loops to avoid redundant computations. Additionally, it includes compiler optimizations flags and a pragma directive to enable further optimizations.
