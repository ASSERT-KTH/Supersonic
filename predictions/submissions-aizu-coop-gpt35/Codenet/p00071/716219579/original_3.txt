The provided code seems to solve a problem where a chessboard is given, and a number of moves are made by a knight on the board. For each move, the knight captures any enemy pieces it lands on. The program outputs the state of the board after each move.

Upon analysis, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Avoiding unnecessary includes: There are several unnecessary header files included in the code. For example, `<algorithm>`, `<bitset>`, `<cmath>`, `<complex>`, `<cstdio>`, `<fstream>`, `<functional>`, `<iostream>`, `<map>`, `<numeric>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<sstream>`, `<stack>`, and `<utility>` are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Removing unnecessary macros: The macros `ALL(s)`, `fi`, `se`, `PI`, `INF`, `MOD`, and `EPS` are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Avoiding unnecessary string manipulation: The `string s` variable is not used in the code and can be removed.

4. Avoiding unnecessary variable declarations: The variables `y`, `x`, and `n` are declared but not used. They can be removed.

5. Pass variables by reference: The `solve` function takes `y` and `x` as arguments, but they are not modified within the function. It is more efficient to pass them by reference to avoid creating unnecessary copies.

6. Avoiding unnecessary recursion: The `solve` function uses recursion to check neighboring cells. This can be replaced with a non-recursive approach, such as using a stack or a queue.

7. Removing unnecessary nested loops: The outer loop `REP(i, n)` and the inner loops `REP(j, 8)` and `REP(k, 8)` can be combined into a single loop.

8. Avoiding unnecessary calculations: The expressions `dy[i] * j` and `dx[i] * j` are repeatedly calculated in the nested loops. These calculations can be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant computations.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized code is as follows:
