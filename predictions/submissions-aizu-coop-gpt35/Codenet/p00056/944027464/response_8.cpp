The provided code generates a list of prime numbers up to 51000 and then for each input number `n`, it counts the number of pairs of prime numbers that sum up to `n`.

Here are some potential optimizations that can be applied to this code:

1. Use a Bitset instead of a Vector of Booleans:
   The `vector<bool>` data structure is not memory efficient. Each boolean value is stored as a separate byte, which leads to unnecessary memory usage. Instead, we can use `std::bitset`, which packs the boolean values tightly. This will significantly reduce memory consumption.

2. Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes for Prime Number Generation:
   The current implementation uses a simple loop to mark non-prime numbers. This can be improved by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which is more efficient for generating prime numbers. The algorithm works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime, starting from 2. This eliminates the need for an inner loop.

3. Optimize the Loop for Counting Pairs:
   The inner loop for counting pairs can be optimized by using a few techniques. First, we can use the `size_t` data type for the loop index since it is guaranteed to handle large array sizes. Second, we can use the square root of `n` as the upper limit for the inner loop, as we only need to check prime numbers up to that limit. Finally, we can use a counter variable instead of `push_back` to count the pairs, which eliminates the need for resizing the vector.

4. Use `reserve` for the Primes Vector:
   The primes vector is currently resized multiple times using `push_back`. This can be optimized by using the `reserve` function to preallocate memory for the vector, avoiding unnecessary reallocation and copying.
