Code Analysis:

1. The code uses a vector of boolean values to represent prime numbers. The size of the vector is set to 51000 + 1, which is unnecessary since the code only checks prime numbers up to 51000. This leads to inefficient memory usage.

2. The code iterates over odd numbers starting from 3 to mark non-prime numbers in the `isPrime` vector. However, it can be optimized to only iterate over odd numbers up to the square root of 51000.

3. The code uses a nested loop to mark multiples of each prime number as non-prime. This can be optimized to only iterate over odd multiples of each prime number.

4. The code checks if each number from 3 to 51000 is prime and adds it to the `primes` vector. However, it can be optimized to only add prime numbers that are less than or equal to n / 2.

5. The code checks if each prime number in the `primes` vector, when subtracted from n, is also prime. This can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, to check for prime numbers.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the `vector<bool>` with a `bitset` to represent prime numbers. This will reduce memory consumption since each boolean value in the `vector<bool>` takes up more space than a single bit in the `bitset`.

2. Update the loop that marks non-prime numbers in the `bitset` to only iterate up to the square root of 51000. This optimization reduces the number of iterations required.

3. Update the nested loop that marks multiples of each prime number to only iterate over odd multiples. This optimization reduces the number of iterations required and avoids marking even numbers as non-prime.

4. Update the loop that adds prime numbers to the `primes` vector to only add prime numbers that are less than or equal to n / 2. This optimization reduces the number of prime numbers added to the vector.

5. Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers up to n. This algorithm is more efficient than checking each number individually.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the `vector<bool>` with a `bitset` to represent prime numbers. The `bitset` uses a single bit to represent each boolean value, reducing memory consumption.

2. Update the loop that marks non-prime numbers in the `bitset` to only iterate up to the square root of 51000. This optimization reduces the number of iterations required since all non-prime numbers can be found within the square root of 51000.

3. Update the nested loop that marks multiples of each prime number to only iterate over odd multiples. This optimization reduces the number of iterations required and avoids marking even numbers as non-prime.

4. Update the loop that adds prime numbers to the `primes` vector to only add prime numbers that are less than or equal to n / 2. This optimization reduces the number of prime numbers added to the vector, as only prime numbers that can potentially be a pair with another prime number less than or equal to n / 2 need to be added.

5. Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers up to n. This algorithm is more efficient than checking each number individually. It works by iteratively marking all multiples of each prime number as non-prime.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  const int N = 51000;
  bitset<N + 1> isPrime;
  isPrime.set();
  isPrime.reset(0);
  isPrime.reset(1);
  
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= N; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime.test(i)) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= N; j += i * 2) {
        isPrime.reset(j);
      }
    }
  }

  vector<int> primes;
  primes.push_back(2);
  for (int i = 3; i <= N / 2; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime.test(i)) {
      primes.push_back(i);
    }
  }

  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < primes.size(); i++) {
      if (primes[i] <= n / 2) {
        if (isPrime.test(n - primes[i])) {
          kotae++;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code makes the following changes:

1. Replaces the `vector<bool>` with a `bitset<N + 1>` to represent prime numbers.

2. Updates the loop that marks non-prime numbers in the `bitset` to only iterate up to the square root of 51000.

3. Updates the nested loop that marks multiples of each prime number to only iterate over odd multiples.

4. Updates the loop that adds prime numbers to the `primes` vector to only add prime numbers that are less than or equal to n / 2.

5. Uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers up to n.

These optimizations reduce memory usage and improve the efficiency of the prime number generation and checking process.
