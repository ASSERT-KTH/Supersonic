Code Analysis:
- The code generates a list of prime numbers up to a certain limit (51000 in this case).
- It then takes input from the user until they enter 0, and for each input, it counts the number of pairs of prime numbers whose sum is equal to the input.
- The code uses a vector of booleans to represent whether a number is prime or not, and another vector to store the prime numbers.
- The code iterates through the prime numbers vector to count the pairs.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a more memory-efficient data structure to represent whether a number is prime or not.
2. Avoid unnecessary computations by optimizing the loop boundaries.
3. Use a more efficient algorithm to count the pairs of prime numbers.
4. Use compiler optimizations to encourage the compiler to optimize the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Use a bitset instead of a vector of booleans to represent prime numbers. A bitset uses a single bit to represent each number, resulting in significant memory savings.
2. Reduce the number of iterations in the outer loop by using the square root of the limit as the upper bound. Since any number greater than the square root of n must have a corresponding factor less than the square root of n, we only need to check numbers up to the square root of n.
3. Use a more efficient algorithm to count the pairs of prime numbers. Instead of iterating through the prime numbers vector, we can use a two-pointer technique to count the pairs in a single pass.
4. Use compiler optimizations to encourage the compiler to optimize the code. This can be achieved by using compiler-specific directives or flags, such as -O2 or -O3, to enable high-level optimizations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const int limit = 51000;
  bitset<limit + 1> isPrime;
  isPrime.set();
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;

  for (int i = 2; i * i <= limit; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= limit; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }

  vector<int> primes;
  for (int i = 2; i <= limit; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      primes.push_back(i);
    }
  }

  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    int left = 0, right = primes.size() - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
      int sum = primes[left] + primes[right];
      if (sum == n) {
        kotae++;
        left++;
        right--;
      } else if (sum < n) {
        left++;
      } else {
        right--;
      }
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code makes the following changes:
1. Replaces the vector<bool> with a bitset<limit + 1> to represent prime numbers more memory-efficiently.
2. Changes the loop boundaries in the outer loop to sqrt(limit) to reduce unnecessary iterations.
3. Uses a two-pointer technique to count the pairs of prime numbers in a single pass.
4. No specific compiler optimizations are applied, but you can use compiler-specific directives or flags, such as -O2 or -O3, to enable high-level optimizations.
