Code Analysis:
The given code generates a list of prime numbers up to 51000 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. It then reads a number from the user and counts the number of pairs of prime numbers whose sum is equal to the given number. 

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. The nested loop for generating the prime numbers has a time complexity of O(n^2). This can be improved.
2. The loop for checking pairs of prime numbers has a time complexity of O(n). This can also be improved.
3. The use of `vector<bool>` for `isPrime` can be inefficient in terms of memory usage.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a more efficient data structure, such as a `bitset`, to represent the `isPrime` array.
2. Reduce the number of iterations in the nested loop for generating prime numbers.
3. Change the loop for checking pairs of prime numbers to a more efficient approach.
4. Use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and compiler hints, to improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace `vector<bool>` with `bitset`:
   - `vector<bool>` can be inefficient in terms of memory usage because it uses one byte per bool value. `bitset` is a specialized container that uses a single bit per bool value, resulting in more efficient memory usage.
   - Replace `vector<bool> isPrime(51000 + 1, false);` with `bitset<51001> isPrime;`.

2. Reduce iterations in the nested loop:
   - The nested loop is used to mark non-prime numbers. However, we can reduce the number of iterations by only considering odd numbers.
   - Change the initialization of the second loop to `int j = i * i;` and the increment to `j += i * 2;`.

3. Change the loop for checking pairs of prime numbers:
   - The current approach checks if `n - primes[i]` is prime by accessing `isPrime.at(n - primes[i])`. This involves a function call and bounds checking, which can be expensive.
   - Instead, we can check if `n - primes[i]` is prime by directly accessing the corresponding bit in the `bitset`.
   - Replace `if (isPrime.at(n - primes[i]))` with `if (isPrime[n - primes[i]])`.

4. Use compiler optimizations:
   - Enable compiler optimizations by adding the appropriate compiler flags or using a pragma directive. This allows the compiler to perform optimizations such as loop unrolling and inline function expansion.
   - Add compiler optimizations based on the specific compiler being used.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  bitset<51001> isPrime;
  isPrime.set();
  isPrime.reset(0);
  isPrime.reset(1);

  for (int i = 3; i * i < 51001; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j < 51001; j += i * 2) {
        isPrime.reset(j);
      }
    }
  }

  vector<int> primes;
  primes.push_back(2);
  for (int i = 3; i < 51000; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      primes.push_back(i);
    }
  }

  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < primes.size(); i++) {
      if (primes[i] <= n / 2) {
        if (isPrime[n - primes[i]]) {
          kotae++;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code reduces the time complexity of generating prime numbers from O(n^2) to O(n log log n) and improves the efficiency of checking pairs of prime numbers. It also uses a more efficient data structure (`bitset`) for storing prime number information and suggests the use of compiler optimizations to further enhance performance.
