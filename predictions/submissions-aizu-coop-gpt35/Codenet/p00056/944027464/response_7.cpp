The provided code calculates the number of prime pairs whose sum is equal to a given number `n`. It first generates a list of prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm and then iterates over the list to count the prime pairs.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several potential optimization opportunities:

1. Redundant computations: The code performs unnecessary computations by iterating over even numbers in the second loop. Since even numbers (except 2) cannot be prime, we can skip these iterations.

2. Unnecessary vector initialization: The `isPrime` vector is initialized with `false` for all elements. However, we only need to mark the numbers that are prime as `true`. By default, vectors are already initialized with the default value of `false`, so the initial loop can be removed.

3. Inefficient memory usage: The `isPrime` vector is of type `vector<bool>`, which is implemented as a bit vector. This can result in inefficient memory usage. We can use a `vector<char>` instead, which uses a byte to represent each element and provides better memory utilization.

4. Unnecessary vector resizing: The `primes` vector is initially empty and elements are pushed back one by one. This results in frequent resizing of the vector, which can be avoided by pre-allocating the appropriate size based on the expected number of prime numbers.

5. Improved loop termination condition: The loops iterating over `i` can terminate at the square root of `n` instead of `51000`. This is because any factor of `n` greater than its square root will have a corresponding factor that is less than its square root.
