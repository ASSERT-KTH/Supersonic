The given code is a program that calculates the number of pairs of prime numbers whose sum is equal to a given number. The program first generates a list of prime numbers up to 51000 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, and then checks each number in the given range to find the pairs.

Here are the optimizations that can be done to improve the performance and memory usage of the code:

1. Use a Bitset instead of a Vector<bool>: The current implementation uses a `vector<bool>` to store the prime numbers. However, `vector<bool>` is not an efficient way to store boolean values due to its specialization. Instead, we can use a `bitset` which uses a single bit to represent a boolean value. This will significantly reduce memory usage.

2. Reduce the range of the outer loop: The outer loop in the code iterates from 3 to 51000, checking for prime numbers. However, we can optimize this by reducing the range to sqrt(51000) since any non-prime number greater than sqrt(51000) will have a factor less than sqrt(51000).

3. Store the size of the `primes` vector in a separate variable: In the inner loop, the code calls `primes.size()` in each iteration. Since the size of the `primes` vector remains constant throughout the loop, we can store the size in a separate variable to avoid redundant function calls.

4. Use prefix increment instead of postfix increment: In the inner loop, the code uses postfix increment (`i++`) to iterate through the `primes` vector. However, prefix increment (`++i`) is more efficient as it avoids the creation of a temporary copy.

5. Use `reserve` to pre-allocate memory for `primes` vector: The `primes` vector is initially empty and grows dynamically as prime numbers are added to it. We can improve performance by using the `reserve` function to pre-allocate memory for the expected number of prime numbers. Since we know the upper limit of prime numbers, we can reserve memory for that number.

6. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: The `emplace_back` function can be used instead of `push_back` to construct the prime numbers directly in the vector, avoiding the need for a copy or move operation.

7. Add compiler optimization flags: We can improve the performance further by adding compiler optimization flags. For example, using `-O3` flag with GCC or Clang will enable more aggressive optimizations.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const int N = 51000;
  bitset<N + 1> isPrime;
  isPrime.set();
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;

  int sqrtN = sqrt(N);
  for (int i = 2; i <= sqrtN; ++i) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= N; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }

  vector<int> primes;
  primes.reserve(N / log(N));

  for (int i = 2; i <= N; ++i) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      primes.emplace_back(i);
    }
  }

  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    int size = primes.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
      int p = primes[i];
      if (p > n / 2) {
        break;
      }
      if (isPrime[n - p]) {
        kotae++;
      }
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations aim to reduce memory usage, eliminate unnecessary computations, and improve the overall performance of the code.
