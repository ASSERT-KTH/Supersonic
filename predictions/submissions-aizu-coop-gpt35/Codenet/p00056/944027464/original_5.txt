The provided code generates a list of prime numbers up to 51000 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm and then uses this list to count the number of pairs of primes that sum up to a given input number. 

Let's go through the code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The `isPrime` vector: The vector is initialized with all elements set to `false`, and then primes are marked as `true` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. However, since the vector is boolean, we can use a `bitset` instead, which will use less memory.

2. The second loop: The second loop marks multiples of each prime as non-prime. However, it starts from `i+i`, which means it can start from `i*i` since all smaller multiples of `i` have already been marked by previous primes. This will reduce the number of iterations.

3. The `primes` vector: The vector stores all prime numbers. Instead of using a vector, we can use a `bitset` or an array to store only the indices of prime numbers, which will further reduce memory usage.

4. The inner loop in the main logic: The loop iterates over all prime numbers and checks if their complement (n - prime) is also prime. This can be optimized by using a binary search instead of a linear search.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps:

Step 1: Replace `vector<bool> isPrime` with `bitset<51001> isPrime`. This will reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Modify the second loop to start from `i*i` instead of `i+i`. This will reduce the number of iterations.

Step 3: Replace `vector<int> primes` with `bitset<51001> primes`. This will further reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Modify the main logic to use binary search instead of linear search.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  bitset<51001> isPrime;
  isPrime.set();
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;

  for (int i = 2; i * i <= 51000; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= 51000; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }

  int primesCount = count(isPrime.begin(), isPrime.end(), true);
  int primes[primesCount];
  int index = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i <= 51000; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      primes[index++] = i;
    }
  }

  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < primesCount; i++) {
      if (primes[i] <= n / 2) {
        if (binary_search(primes, primes + primesCount, n - primes[i])) {
          kotae++;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces memory usage by using a `bitset` instead of a `vector<bool>`, eliminates redundant computations, and uses binary search for faster searching. It also uses an array instead of a vector to store prime numbers, further improving memory efficiency.

The trade-off for these optimizations is slightly increased code complexity, but the improvements in memory usage and running time outweigh the added complexity.
