The given code is a simple program that takes three integers as input and checks if they are in increasing order. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few areas where improvements can be made to optimize the program:

1. Unnecessary variable declaration: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are declared at the beginning of the main function but are not initialized. Since they are immediately overwritten by the `scanf` function, there is no need to declare them beforehand.

2. Inefficient input validation: The line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` does not serve any purpose and can be removed.

3. Redundant comparison: The condition `a < b && b < c` can be simplified to `a < b < c`. This will eliminate one comparison operation.

4. Unnecessary return statement: The `return (0);` statement at the end of the main function is not required, as the `main` function implicitly returns 0.
