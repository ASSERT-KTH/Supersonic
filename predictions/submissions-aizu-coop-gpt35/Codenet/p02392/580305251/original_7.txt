The provided code is a simple program that takes three integers as input and checks if they are in increasing order. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". 

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few areas that can be optimized:

1. Unnecessary variable declaration: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are declared at the beginning of the program but are not initialized. This is unnecessary since they are immediately overwritten by the values obtained from the user input.

2. Incorrect usage of comma operator: The expression `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` is using the comma operator incorrectly. This expression does not have any effect on the program and should be removed.

3. Redundant condition: The condition `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` is redundant and has no effect on the program's logic. It can be safely removed.

4. Redundant parentheses: The return statement `(0)` has unnecessary parentheses. They can be removed without affecting the program.

Now let's optimize the code step by step:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int a, b, c;

  // Read the input values directly into the variables
  scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);

  // Check if a, b, and c are in increasing order
  if (a < b && b < c) {
    printf("Yes\n");
  } else {
    printf("No\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we have removed the unnecessary code and improved the readability of the program. The changes made do not affect the functionality or output of the original code.
