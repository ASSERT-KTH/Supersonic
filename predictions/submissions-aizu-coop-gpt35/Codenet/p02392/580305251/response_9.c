Upon analyzing the provided code, we can identify a few areas where performance improvements can be made:

1. Data Types: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are declared as `int`. However, their values are constrained to be between 0 and 100. We can optimize memory usage by using a smaller data type, such as `unsigned char`, which can represent values between 0 and 255.

2. Input Validation: The code includes the line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;`, which seems to be an attempt to validate the input values. However, this line does not have any effect on the program's behavior. We can remove this line as it is redundant.

3. Compiler Optimization: We can suggest compiler optimizations to improve the program's performance. For example, we can use the `-O3` optimization flag to enable aggressive optimizations during compilation.
