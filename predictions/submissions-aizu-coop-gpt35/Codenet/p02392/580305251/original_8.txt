The given code snippet is a simple program that takes three integer inputs and checks if they are in ascending order. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". 

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified a few potential optimizations that can improve its efficiency:

1. The line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` is incorrect and does not serve any purpose. We can remove this line as it has no effect on the program's behavior.

2. The `scanf` function is used to read the input values, but it does not handle any error conditions. It is good practice to check the return value of `scanf` to ensure that the input was successfully read. We can add error handling for the `scanf` function.

3. The condition `a < b && b < c` can be simplified to `a < b < c`. However, this code is not syntactically correct in C. We need to rewrite the condition as `a < b && b < c` to ensure the correct behavior.

4. Currently, the program always prints either "Yes" or "No" based on the input values. We can add an additional check to avoid unnecessary computations. If `a >= b`, we already know that the condition `a < b && b < c` will be false, so we can directly print "No" without evaluating the second condition.

Taking these optimizations into consideration, let's modify the code:
