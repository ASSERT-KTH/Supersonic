The provided code is a simple program that reads three integers from the user and checks if they are in increasing order. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". 

On initial analysis, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary use of comma operator: The line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` does not serve any purpose and can be removed.

2. Redundant condition: The condition `a < b && b < c` can be simplified to `a < c`.

3. Lack of error handling: The program does not handle the case where the user enters invalid input. Adding error handling is essential to make the program more robust.
