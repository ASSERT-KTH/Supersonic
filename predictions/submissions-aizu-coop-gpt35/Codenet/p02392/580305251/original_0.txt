The given code is a simple program that takes three integer inputs from the user and checks if they are in increasing order. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". 

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few areas where optimizations can be made:

1. Unnecessary variable declaration: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are declared before the input is taken. We can move the declaration of these variables to after the input statement, since they are not used before that.

2. Redundant condition: The condition `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` does not serve any purpose and can be removed.

3. Unoptimized input: The `scanf` function is not the most efficient way to read input. We can use `fgets` to read a line of input and then parse it using `sscanf`. This will reduce the number of system calls and improve performance.

4. Unoptimized output: The `printf` function can be slow when used repeatedly. We can use `puts` instead to output a single string, which is faster.

Based on these observations, we can proceed with the following optimization steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary variable declaration.

2. Remove the redundant condition.

3. Replace the `scanf` function with `fgets` and `sscanf` to optimize input.

4. Replace the `printf` function with `puts` to optimize output.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  char input[100];
  
  fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);
  int a, b, c;
  sscanf(input, "%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
  
  if (a < b && b < c) {
    puts("Yes");
  } else {
    puts("No");
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have removed the unnecessary variable declaration, removed the redundant condition, and replaced `scanf` with `fgets` and `sscanf` for optimized input. Additionally, we have replaced `printf` with `puts` for optimized output.

These changes help improve the performance and efficiency of the code while preserving the functionality and output of the original code.
