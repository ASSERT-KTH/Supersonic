The given code is a simple program that takes three integers as input and checks if they are in increasing order. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". 

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few areas where optimization can be applied:

1. Unnecessary range check: The line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` is not valid C code and does not serve any purpose. We can remove this line.

2. Redundant if condition: The condition `a < b && b < c` is redundant because if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then by transitivity, `a` must be less than `c`. We can simplify the code by removing this condition and directly printing "Yes".

3. Unoptimized I/O: The code uses the `scanf()` and `printf()` functions for input and output. These functions are relatively slow compared to other I/O methods. We can use a faster I/O method like `scanf()` with `%d` instead of `scanf()` with space-separated integers.
