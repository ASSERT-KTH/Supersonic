The given code is a simple program that takes three integers as input and checks if they are in increasing order. If they are, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". Let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization.

1. Code Analysis:
   - The code is straightforward and does not involve any complex computations or algorithms.
   - There are no redundant or unnecessary computations.
   - The data structures used (integers) are efficient and appropriate for the task.
   - The program does not contain any loops or recursive calls.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Since the code is already quite simple, there are limited opportunities for optimization.
   - We can focus on minimizing memory usage and exploring any compiler optimizations that may be available.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. There are no inefficient data structures or computations in the code.
   2. The code does not contain any loops or recursive calls that can be optimized.
   3. We can consider adding compiler optimizations to improve the performance further. For example, we can use compiler-specific pragmas or flags to hint the compiler to optimize the code. However, the effectiveness of this step depends on the specific compiler being used.

4. Optimized Code Block:
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main() {
     int a, b, c;
     scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);
     if (a < b && b < c) {
       printf("Yes");
     } else {
       printf("No");
     }
     printf("\n");
     return 0;
   }
   ```
