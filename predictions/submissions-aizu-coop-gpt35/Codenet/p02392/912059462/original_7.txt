Code Analysis:
- The code takes three integers as input and checks if they are in ascending order.
- If the condition is true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables 'a', 'b', and 'c' are not used after the condition check. We can remove them and directly use the values obtained from the input.

2. Eliminate unnecessary input: The code takes inputs for 'a', 'b', and 'c' separately. This can be optimized by using a single input statement to read all three integers at once.

3. Use a more efficient data structure: Rather than using separate variables for 'a', 'b', and 'c', we can use an array to store the integers. This will eliminate the need for multiple variables and simplify the code.

4. Use a ternary operator: Instead of using an if-else statement, we can use a ternary operator to directly print "Yes" or "No" based on the condition.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary variables:
   - Remove the variables 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
   - Update the scanf statement to read the integers directly.

2. Eliminate unnecessary input:
   - Remove the individual scanf statements for 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
   - Use a single scanf statement to read all three integers at once.

3. Use a more efficient data structure:
   - Define an array 'arr' of size 3 to store the integers.
   - Update the scanf statement to store the input values in the 'arr' array.

4. Use a ternary operator:
   - Replace the if-else statement with a ternary operator.
   - Print "Yes" if the condition is true, otherwise print "No".

Optimized Code Block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int arr[3];
  scanf("%d%d%d", &arr[0], &arr[1], &arr[2]);
  
  printf("%s\n", (arr[0] < arr[1] && arr[1] < arr[2]) ? "Yes" : "No");
  
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code eliminates unnecessary variables, reduces input operations, uses a more efficient data structure, and simplifies the condition check using a ternary operator. It retains the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance and reducing memory usage.
