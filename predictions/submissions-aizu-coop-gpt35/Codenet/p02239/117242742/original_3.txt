The provided code is an implementation of the breadth-first search algorithm (BFS) for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for improved performance and reduced memory usage.

1. Inefficient Memory Usage:
   - The adjacency matrix `m` is a 2D array of size 105x105, even though the number of nodes (`n`) is provided as input. This leads to inefficient memory usage, especially when `n` is much smaller than 105.
   - The `v` and `d` arrays are also of size 105, regardless of the actual number of nodes in the graph.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The code checks if `m[u][i]` is true in every iteration of the inner loop, even though the matrix is assumed to be symmetric (i.e., `m[u][i]` and `m[i][u]` are the same). This results in redundant computations and can be optimized.

3. Compiler Optimization:
   - The code does not have any compiler optimization flags or directives. Adding appropriate compiler optimizations can significantly improve performance.

Now let's optimize the code step by step.

Step 1: Efficient Memory Usage:
To optimize the memory usage, we need to dynamically allocate memory for the adjacency matrix (`m`), the visited array (`v`), and the distance array (`d`).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

void bfs(int s, bool* v, int* d, bool** m, int n) {
  v[s] = true;
  d[s] = 0;
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(s);
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int u = q.front();
    q.pop();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (m[u][i] && !v[i]) {
        d[i] = d[u] + 1;
        v[i] = true;
        q.push(i);
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  bool** m = new bool*[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    m[i] = new bool[n];
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      m[i][j] = false; // Initialize all elements to false
    }
  }

  int* d = new int[n];
  bool* v = new bool[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    d[i] = -1;
    v[i] = false;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int u, k;
    cin >> u >> k;
    for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      int v;
      cin >> v;
      m[u - 1][v - 1] = true;
    }
  }

  bfs(0, v, d, m, n);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << i + 1 << ' ' << d[i] << endl;
  }

  // Deallocate memory
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    delete[] m[i];
  }
  delete[] m;
  delete[] d;
  delete[] v;

  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we dynamically allocate memory for the adjacency matrix (`m`) using a 2D array of size `n x n`. This ensures efficient memory usage by allocating memory only for the required number of nodes (`n`).

Step 2: Redundant Computations:
Since the adjacency matrix `m` is symmetric, we can optimize the code by checking for connections in only one direction. We can iterate over nodes `i` from `u` to `n` instead of iterating over all nodes in each iteration of the inner loop. This reduces the number of redundant computations.

```cpp
void bfs(int s, bool* v, int* d, bool** m, int n) {
  v[s] = true;
  d[s] = 0;
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(s);
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int u = q.front();
    q.pop();
    for (int i = u; i < n; i++) { // Iterate from u to n instead of 0 to n
      if (m[u][i] && !v[i]) {
        d[i] = d[u] + 1;
        v[i] = true;
        q.push(i);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Step 3: Compiler Optimization:
To enable compiler optimizations, we can add the `-O3` flag while compiling the code. This flag enables aggressive optimizations, including loop unrolling, function inlining, and other optimizations that can significantly improve performance.

```cpp
// Compile with optimization flags:
// g++ -O3 -std=c++11 main.cpp -o optimized_program
```

The `-O3` flag tells the compiler to optimize the code using the highest level of optimization available. Note that the `-O3` flag may vary depending on the compiler being used.

The optimized code is now ready. It has improved memory usage, reduced redundant computations, and takes advantage of compiler optimizations.
