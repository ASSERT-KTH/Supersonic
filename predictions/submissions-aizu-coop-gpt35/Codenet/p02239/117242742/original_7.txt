The given code implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from a given source vertex to all other vertices in an undirected graph. However, there are several potential optimizations that can be made to improve the performance and memory usage of this code. 

1. Avoiding global variables: The code currently uses global variables `m`, `n`, `v`, and `d`. Global variables can make the code harder to maintain and optimize. It is better to pass variables as function parameters or use local variables when possible.

2. Efficient data structure for the adjacency matrix: The code uses a 2D boolean array `m` to represent the adjacency matrix of the graph. However, this approach requires O(n^2) space, even if the graph is sparse. A more memory-efficient representation would be to use an adjacency list instead of an adjacency matrix. This would reduce the space complexity to O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

3. Avoiding unnecessary memory initialization: The code initializes the `d` array with -1 for all vertices before running the BFS algorithm. However, this initialization is not necessary since the BFS algorithm will assign a distance value to each vertex. Removing this initialization can save some unnecessary memory writes.

4. Avoiding unnecessary checks in the BFS loop: The inner loop in the BFS algorithm checks if the current vertex `i` is unvisited (`!v[i]`) and if there is an edge between `u` and `i` (`m[u][i]`). However, since the graph is undirected, if there is an edge from `u` to `i`, there will also be an edge from `i` to `u`. Hence, it is sufficient to only check if the current vertex `i` is unvisited (`!v[i]`).

5. Efficient input and output handling: The code currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations can be slow, especially when dealing with large inputs or outputs. Using a faster input-output mechanism, such as `scanf` and `printf`, can improve the overall performance of the code.

Now, let's optimize the code step-by-step.
