The given code is a C++ program that performs a breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph represented by an adjacency matrix. The program reads an input graph from standard input, performs the BFS starting from vertex 0, and outputs the shortest path distance from vertex 0 to each vertex in the graph.

Let's analyze the code to identify potential areas of improvement.

1. The `m` matrix:
   - The `m` matrix is used to store the adjacency matrix of the graph. However, it is not initialized before being used. This can lead to undefined behavior if the matrix values are not explicitly set.
   - The `m` matrix is of fixed size (105x105), which may be excessive for most practical use cases. It consumes unnecessary memory. We can optimize the memory usage by allocating a 2D dynamic array with the actual size required by the input graph.

2. The `v` and `d` arrays:
   - The `v` array is used to mark visited vertices, and the `d` array is used to store the shortest path distances. Both arrays are initialized outside the `bfs` function, but they are not reset between multiple BFS calls.
   - To ensure correct results for multiple BFS calls, we need to reset these arrays before each BFS call.

3. The BFS algorithm:
   - The BFS algorithm implemented in the `bfs` function is correct, but there are a few optimizations we can apply to improve its performance:
     - Instead of using a separate `v` array to mark visited vertices, we can mark a vertex as visited by setting its corresponding `d` value to a non-negative value. This eliminates the need for the `v` array.
     - We can avoid multiple memory allocations and deallocations by using a single array to store both the queue and the visited status of each vertex. This can be achieved by using a pair or a struct to store the vertex and its distance in the queue.
     - To further optimize memory usage, we can use a vector instead of a queue. A vector allows us to efficiently access elements at both ends without the overhead of dynamic memory allocation.

4. Input and output:
   - The code reads the input graph from standard input and outputs the results to standard output. We can assume that the input and output formats are fixed and cannot be optimized further.
