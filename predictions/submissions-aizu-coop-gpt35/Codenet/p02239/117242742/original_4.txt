The given code performs a breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph represented by an adjacency matrix. The goal is to find the shortest path from a given source node to all other nodes in the graph.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structure: The code uses a 2D array `m` to represent the adjacency matrix. However, this approach is not memory-efficient since it reserves space for all possible edges, even if they do not exist in the graph. Additionally, using a boolean array to represent visited nodes (`v`) and distances (`d`) is also not memory-efficient.

2. Redundant computations: The code unnecessarily computes the indices `u - 1` and `v - 1` when storing and accessing elements in the adjacency matrix. This can be avoided by using a 0-based index directly.

3. Lack of loop optimization: The loop in the `bfs` function could be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and improve cache locality. Loop unrolling might be beneficial in this case.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the 2D array `m` with an adjacency list representation of the graph. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.

2. Replace the boolean arrays `v` and `d` with integer arrays. Initialize them with a special value (e.g., -1) to represent unvisited nodes and infinite distances.

3. Remove the unnecessary index calculations `u - 1` and `v - 1` when accessing elements in the adjacency matrix.

4. Optimize the loop in the `bfs` function by unrolling it for a fixed number of iterations. This can improve cache locality and reduce loop overhead.

5. Consider using compiler optimizations, such as loop optimization pragmas or compiler flags, to further improve performance. However, this step is optional and may depend on the specific compiler being used.

Next, I will provide a step-by-step explanation of each optimization and present the optimized code.
