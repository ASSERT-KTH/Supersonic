This code implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to calculate the shortest path from a given source vertex to all other vertices in an undirected graph. The graph is represented using an adjacency matrix.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few areas for potential optimization:

1. Unnecessary memory usage: The adjacency matrix `m` is a 2D array of size 105x105, even though the input graph may have fewer than 105 vertices. This leads to inefficient memory usage.

2. Redundant computation: The code initializes all elements of the `v` array to false in the `bfs` function, even though it is already initialized to false before the function call. This is unnecessary and can be optimized.

3. Redundant checks: The condition `m[u][i] && !v[i]` checks if there is an edge between vertices `u` and `i`, but it is redundant because the graph is undirected. Checking only `m[i][u]` would be sufficient.

4. Input validation: The current code assumes that the input is well-formed and does not perform any validation. Adding input validation can improve the robustness of the program.

Now let's proceed with the optimization strategy.
