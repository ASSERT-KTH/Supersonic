First, let's analyze the code to identify potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:

1. The `isso` function checks if a number is prime. It can be improved by terminating the loop early when a factor is found.
2. The `powint` function calculates the power of a number. It can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm like exponentiation by squaring.
3. The `dfs2` function uses recursion to perform a depth-first search. It can be optimized by using an iterative approach or by using tail recursion.
4. The `involve` vector is resized to a fixed size of 100000, which consumes unnecessary memory.
5. The `mp` map is used to store group and member names. It can be optimized by using an unordered_map instead, which has a faster lookup time.

Now, let's formulate an optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `isso` function with a more efficient prime checking algorithm.
2. Replace the `powint` function with an optimized algorithm like exponentiation by squaring.
3. Optimize the `dfs2` function by using an iterative approach instead of recursion.
4. Replace the `involve` vector with a more efficient data structure like an adjacency list.
5. Replace the `mp` map with an unordered_map for faster lookup time.

Next, let's provide a detailed step-by-step explanation of each optimization:

1. Optimization of `isso` function:
   - Replace the current prime checking algorithm with a more efficient algorithm like the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
   - The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm that can find all prime numbers up to a given limit efficiently.
   - It works by iteratively marking the multiples of prime numbers, starting from 2, as composite.
   - The remaining numbers that are not marked as composite are prime numbers.
   - By using this algorithm, we can significantly improve the efficiency of prime checking.

2. Optimization of `powint` function:
   - Replace the current algorithm with an optimized algorithm like exponentiation by squaring.
   - Exponentiation by squaring is a fast algorithm for computing the power of a number.
   - It works by squaring the base and halving the exponent at each step.
   - This reduces the number of multiplications required, resulting in a more efficient algorithm.

3. Optimization of `dfs2` function:
   - Replace the recursive approach with an iterative approach using a stack.
   - Instead of making recursive calls, we can use a stack to keep track of the nodes to visit.
   - This eliminates the overhead of recursive function calls and improves the efficiency of the depth-first search.

4. Optimization of `involve` vector:
   - Replace the `involve` vector with an adjacency list data structure.
   - An adjacency list is a more efficient way to represent graph connections.
   - Instead of storing all connections in a vector, we can store each node's connections in a list.
   - This reduces memory usage and improves the efficiency of accessing and modifying connections.

5. Optimization of `mp` map:
   - Replace the `mp` map with an unordered_map for faster lookup time.
   - The unordered_map provides constant-time average complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.
   - This improves the efficiency of name lookup and reduces the overall running time of the program.

In the optimized code, the following changes have been made:

1. The `isso` function has been replaced with the more efficient prime checking algorithm using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. The `powint` function has been replaced with the optimized exponentiation by squaring algorithm.
3. The `dfs2` function has been optimized by using an iterative approach with a stack instead of recursion.
4. The `involve` vector has been replaced with an adjacency list data structure for more efficient graph representation.
5. The `mp` map has been replaced with an unordered_map for faster name lookup.

These optimizations improve the performance and memory usage of the program while preserving its functionality and output.
