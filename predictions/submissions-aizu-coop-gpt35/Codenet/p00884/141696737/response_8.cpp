The given code appears to be a program that takes input in the form of group and member names, and then calculates the number of unique member names present in the input.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Inefficient prime number checking: The `isso` function checks whether a given number is prime. However, it can be optimized by only checking odd numbers greater than 2 and by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number.

2. Inefficient exponentiation function: The `powint` function calculates the power of a number. However, it can be optimized by using the binary exponentiation algorithm, which reduces the number of multiplications required.

3. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a vector of vectors (`involve`) to represent relationships between group and member names. This can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and access time. Using a more efficient data structure, such as an adjacency list or a map, can improve performance.

4. Redundant or unnecessary computations: There are multiple redundant computations in the code. For example, the line `involve.resize(100000)` can be removed as it is unnecessary. Additionally, the line `involve[mp[groupname]].push_back(mp[membername[i]])` can be optimized by reusing the result of `mp[groupname]` instead of calling it multiple times.

5. Unnecessary include statements: The code includes multiple unnecessary header files, such as `<array>`, `<bitset>`, `<complex>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<functional>`, `<iomanip>`, `<limits>`, and `<queue>`. These should be removed to improve compilation time.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Optimize the `isso` function to improve prime number checking.
2. Optimize the `powint` function to improve exponentiation.
3. Replace the vector of vectors (`involve`) with a more efficient data structure.
4. Eliminate redundant or unnecessary computations.
5. Remove unnecessary include statements.
