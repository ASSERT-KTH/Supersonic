The given code calculates the maximum percentage of minutes in a day when a specific event occurs. The code reads input parameters from the user and calculates the result based on these parameters. 

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. The `minutes` array is used to store the availability of each minute in a week. However, this array is not necessary as we can calculate the availability on the fly using bitwise operations.
2. The `ck` function calculates the percentage of minutes when the event occurs. However, it uses nested loops, which can be inefficient for large values of `m`. We can optimize this function by avoiding unnecessary iterations.
3. The `todays` and `totime` functions are used to calculate the day and time of a given minute index. However, these functions are not used in the current code and can be removed.
4. The `pow` function is used to calculate powers. However, for small `n` values, we can replace it with a simple multiplication to improve performance.

Based on these observations, here is the step-by-step optimization plan:

1. Remove the `minutes` array and calculate availability on the fly in the `ck` function using bitwise operations.
2. Optimize the `ck` function by avoiding unnecessary iterations.
3. Remove the unused `todays` and `totime` functions.
4. Replace the `pow` function with a simple multiplication for small `n` values.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the code:
