Analysis:
1. The `minutes` array is used to represent whether a particular minute is available or not. It is a boolean array of size 7 * 24 * 60, representing the availability of each minute in a week. This array is used to check the availability of consecutive `s` minutes starting from a given minute.
2. The `ck` function calculates the probability of finding `n` available slots of `s` minutes with a gap of `t` minutes between each slot. It iterates through `m` possible starting minutes and checks if all the consecutive `s` minutes are available using the `minutes` array.
3. The `todays` function calculates the day of the week for a given minute index.
4. The `totime` function checks if a given minute index corresponds to the night time (18:00 to 06:00).

Optimization Strategy:
1. Instead of using a boolean array to represent the availability of each minute, we can use a bitset to represent the availability of each minute. This will reduce memory usage significantly.
2. We can precalculate the availability of each minute based on the given inputs and store it in a bitset or an integer. This will eliminate the need to calculate the availability for each minute during the computation of `ck` function.
3. We can optimize the `ck` function by removing the inner loop and using bit operations to check the availability of consecutive `s` minutes. This will improve the running time of the function.
4. We can use compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code, such as loop unrolling or function inlining.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `minutes` array with a bitset. This will reduce the memory usage of the array.
2. Calculate the availability of each minute based on the given inputs and store it in a bitset or an integer. This can be done before the main loop in the `main` function.
3. Modify the `ck` function to use bit operations to check the availability of consecutive `s` minutes. Iterate through the possible starting minutes using a loop.
4. Remove the inner loop in the `ck` function and use bit operations to check the availability of consecutive `s` minutes. This will improve the running time of the function.
5. Use compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code, such as loop unrolling or function inlining.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int s, n, t, m, p;
bitset<7 * 24 * 60> minutes;
int wbits, tbits;

double ck(int start) {
  int cnt = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++, start += t) {
    if ((minutes & (minutes >> start)).count() >= s) {
      cnt++;
    }
  }
  return (1.0 - pow(1.0 - 1.0 / p, (double)cnt * n));
}

inline int todays(int i) {
  return (i / (24 * 60));
}

inline bool totime(int i) {
  int tm = i % (24 * 60) / 24;
  return (tm >= 18 || tm < 6);
}

int main() {
  string weekday, time;
  while (cin >> s >> n >> t >> weekday >> time >> p >> m, m) {
    if (weekday == "All")
      wbits = (1 << 7) - 1;
    else
      wbits = 1;
    if (time == "Night")
      tbits = 1;
    else if (time == "Day")
      tbits = 2;
    else
      tbits = 3;
    double ans = 0.0;

    // Calculate the availability of each minute
    for (int i = 7 * 24 * 60 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if ((wbits & (1 << i / 1440)) && (tbits & (1 << ((i / 360 + 1) % 4 / 2))))
        minutes[i] = true;
      else
        minutes[i] = false;
    }

    for (int i = 24 * 60 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      ans = max(ans, ck(i));
    }
    cout << fixed << setprecision(16) << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

The optimized code uses a bitset to represent the availability of each minute, reducing memory usage. It precalculates the availability of each minute based on the given inputs and stores it in the bitset. The `ck` function is optimized by using bit operations to check the availability of consecutive minutes. Compiler optimizations and pragma directives are not included in this code as they are dependent on the compiler and platform being used.
