The given code is a C++ program that solves a knapsack problem using dynamic programming. The goal is to maximize the value of items that can be included in the knapsack, given their weights and values.

Upon analyzing the code, here are some potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses a 2D array `dp` to store the dynamic programming table. However, the maximum size of this array is fixed at 333x333, which is much larger than necessary. This results in inefficient memory usage.

2. Redundant Computations: The code contains redundant computations inside the `dpru` function. For each item, the code checks if `j >= c[i]` twice: once in the `if` condition and again when accessing `dp[i + 1][j - c[i]]`. This redundancy can be eliminated.

3. Loop Optimization: There are two nested loops in the `dpru` function. The outer loop iterates over `n`, while the inner loop iterates over `m`. We can optimize these loops by:
    - Swapping the order of the loops, so that the inner loop iterates over `n` and the outer loop iterates over `m`. This change allows us to access `dp[i + 1][j - c[i]]` directly, without the need for additional conditions.
    - Using loop unrolling to process multiple iterations of the inner loop at once. By unrolling the loop, we can reduce the number of branch instructions and improve cache locality.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest the use of compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler about potential optimizations. These optimizations can include loop unrolling, vectorization, and inlining of small functions.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step.
