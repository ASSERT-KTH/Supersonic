The given code is a C++ program that solves a dynamic programming problem using the "0/1 Knapsack" algorithm. It reads input values for the number of items (n) and the maximum weight capacity (m), and then reads n lines of input, each containing the weight and value of an item for three different scenarios. The program calculates the maximum value that can be achieved by selecting a subset of items that does not exceed the weight capacity for each scenario, and outputs the maximum value.

To optimize the code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Unnecessary header files: There are several unnecessary header files included in the code, such as `<complex>`, `<memory>`, and `<sstream>`. We can remove these to improve compile time.

2. Unused macros: The macros `foreach`, `all`, `rall`, `CLEAR`, `rep`, `max_swap`, and `min_swap` are defined but not used in the code. We can safely remove them.

3. Redundant includes: Some of the included headers are not required for the code to compile and run correctly. We can remove these to improve compile time.

4. Magic numbers: The numbers 333 and 3 are used in multiple places in the code without any explanation. We can define constants for these numbers to improve code readability.

5. Inefficient data structures: The current implementation uses a 2D array `dp` to store the results of subproblems. However, since we only need to access the previous row of `dp` at each iteration, we can optimize memory usage by using two 1D arrays instead.

6. Unnecessary string input: The code reads a line of input as a string and then discards it, which is unnecessary. We can remove the `getline` call and directly read the integer values.

7. Missing input validation: The code does not perform any input validation, assuming that the input is always valid. We should add appropriate checks to handle invalid input gracefully.

8. Code organization: The code currently puts all the logic inside the `main` function. We can improve code readability and maintainability by separating the logic into smaller functions.
