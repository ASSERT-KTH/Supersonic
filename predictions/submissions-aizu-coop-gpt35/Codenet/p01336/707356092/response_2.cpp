Before diving into the code optimizations, let's analyze the given code to identify potential areas for improvement:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files that are not used in the program. These include `<algorithm>`, `<bitset>`, `<cctype>`, `<cmath>`, `<deque>`, `<limits>`, `<list>`, `<map>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, and `<utility>`. Removing these unnecessary header files can improve compile time.

2. The `using namespace std;` directive brings all names from the `std` namespace into the global scope, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less readable. It is recommended to avoid using this directive and instead use the `std::` prefix when necessary.

3. The class `Data` is used to store information about idols. However, the class members are all public, violating encapsulation principles. It would be better to make the members private and provide getter and setter functions to access and modify them.

4. The `vector<Data> idols` is created and filled within the while loop. This can be moved outside the loop to avoid unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations.

5. The `memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp))` call initializes the `dp` array with zeros. However, since `dp` is already a global variable, it is unnecessary to initialize it again in each iteration of the while loop. The initialization can be moved outside the loop.

6. The nested loops `for (int i = 0; i <= M; i++)`, `for (int j = 0; j < idols.size(); j++)`, and `for (int k = 0; k <= 300; k++)` have fixed ranges and can be optimized to improve efficiency. 

7. The use of `stringstream` is unnecessary and can be replaced with direct `cin` and `getline` calls.

Now, let's formulate an optimization strategy to improve the code's efficiency:

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Avoid using the `using namespace std;` directive.
3. Encapsulate the members of the `Data` class and provide getter and setter functions.
4. Move the `vector<Data> idols` declaration outside the while loop.
5. Move the `memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp))` call outside the while loop.
6. Optimize the nested loops to reduce unnecessary iterations.
7. Update the print statement to use `cout` instead of `printf`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - Remove the following unnecessary header files: `<algorithm>`, `<bitset>`, `<cctype>`, `<cmath>`, `<deque>`, `<limits>`, `<list>`, `<map>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, and `<utility>`.
   - These headers are not used in the code and can be safely removed.

2. Avoid using the `using namespace std;` directive:
   - Remove the `using namespace std;` directive.
   - Instead, use the `std::` prefix when necessary to access names from the `std` namespace.

3. Encapsulate the members of the `Data` class:
   - Modify the `Data` class to encapsulate its members by making them private.
   - Provide getter and setter functions to access and modify the members.
   - Replace the direct member access in the code with the getter and setter functions.

4. Move the `vector<Data> idols` declaration outside the while loop:
   - Move the `vector<Data> idols` declaration outside the while loop to avoid unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations.
   - This can be done by declaring `vector<Data> idols` before the while loop and clearing it at the end of each iteration.

5. Move the `memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp))` call outside the while loop:
   - Move the `memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp))` call outside the while loop to avoid unnecessary initialization in each iteration.
   - This can be done by moving the `memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp))` call before the while loop.

6. Optimize the nested loops:
   - The nested loops `for (int i = 0; i <= M; i++)`, `for (int j = 0; j < idols.size(); j++)`, and `for (int k = 0; k <= 300; k++)` can be optimized.
   - The innermost loop `for (int k = 0; k <= 300; k++)` can be optimized by using a variable `idols[j].mC * k` instead of recalculating it in each iteration.
   - The middle loop `for (int j = 0; j < idols.size(); j++)` can be optimized by using a constant reference to `idols[j]` instead of accessing it through indexing.
   - The outermost loop `for (int i = 0; i <= M; i++)` can be optimized by using a temporary variable to store `dp[i]` and avoid repeated array indexing.

7. Update the print statement:
   - Update the print statement `printf("%d\n", maxv)` to use `cout` instead of `printf`.
   - Replace it with `std::cout << maxv << std::endl`.
