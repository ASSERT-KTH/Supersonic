The given code is a C++ program that solves a dynamic programming problem. The program reads input from the standard input and computes the maximum value that can be achieved by selecting different combinations of idols, subject to certain constraints.

Let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Allocation: The program uses a 2D array `dp` to store the computed values. The size of the array is determined by the values of `N` and `M`. However, the size of the array is fixed at `301` for the first dimension and `3` for the second dimension. This means that the program is allocating more memory than necessary, which can be a significant overhead if `N` and `M` are large.

2. Unnecessary Copying: The `Data` class stores the name of the idol as a string. However, the name is copied from the input string into the `name` variable and then again into the `mName` member variable. This results in unnecessary copying and can be optimized.

3. Redundant Computation: The program repeatedly computes the values `idols[j].mC * k` inside the innermost loop. This computation can be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant computation.

4. Loop Optimization: The program uses three nested loops to iterate over the `dp` array. This can be optimized by using a single loop with appropriate indexing.

5. Compiler Optimizations: The program does not use any compiler optimizations. Enabling compiler optimizations can significantly improve the performance of the program.

Based on the analysis, here is the proposed optimization strategy:

1. Use a dynamically allocated 2D array for `dp` instead of a fixed-size array. This will allow us to allocate memory based on the actual values of `N` and `M`.

2. Eliminate the unnecessary copying of the idol name by using a reference to the input string instead of creating a new string object.

3. Move the computation of `idols[j].mC * k` outside the innermost loop to avoid redundant computation.

4. Replace the nested loops for computing `dp` values with a single loop and appropriate indexing.

5. Enable compiler optimizations to leverage the optimizations provided by the compiler.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Memory Allocation:
   - Replace the declaration of `dp` with a dynamically allocated 2D array using the `new` operator.
   - Update the size of the array based on the actual values of `N` and `M`.
   - Use `vector` instead of a fixed-size array to store the computed values.

2. Unnecessary Copying:
   - Change the type of `mName` from `string` to `const string&` in the `Data` class to avoid copying the idol name.
   - Modify the `Data` constructor to use a reference to `name` instead of copying it.

3. Redundant Computation:
   - Move the computation of `idols[j].mC * k` outside the innermost loop and store it in a variable.

4. Loop Optimization:
   - Replace the nested loops for computing `dp` values with a single loop.
   - Use appropriate indexing to access the elements of the `dp` array.

5. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Add compiler-specific optimization flags or directives to enable compiler optimizations.

With the proposed optimizations, the code should have improved performance and reduced memory usage. The changes made are minimal and should not affect the functionality or output of the original program.
