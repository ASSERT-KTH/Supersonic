Analysis:
- The program reads input from the user, which consists of a number of idols and their attributes.
- It then calculates the maximum values of three attributes (V, D, L) based on a given budget (M) and idol costs (C).
- The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the maximum values.
- The final result is printed to the console.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary headers. We can remove them to reduce compilation time.
2. Avoid unnecessary global defines: The program defines `_USE_MATH_DEFINES` and `INF`, but they are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.
3. Use more efficient data structures:
   - The program uses a vector to store idols. However, since the number of idols is fixed, we can use an array instead.
   - The program uses a 2D array `dp` to store intermediate results. We can optimize memory usage by using a 1D array instead.
4. Improve loop efficiency:
   - The innermost loop checks if `i - idols[j].mC * k < 0` repeatedly. We can calculate this value once outside the loop.
   - The innermost loop goes up to 300, but the maximum value of `k` is determined by the budget `M` and idol cost `C`. We can optimize the loop bound.
5. Use more efficient algorithms:
   - Currently, the program uses a brute-force approach to calculate the maximum values. We can potentially improve the algorithm to reduce the number of calculations.

Optimization strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes and defines.
2. Replace the vector with an array to store idols.
3. Replace the 2D array `dp` with a 1D array.
4. Move the calculation of `i - idols[j].mC * k` outside the innermost loop.
5. Optimize the loop bounds in the innermost loop.
6. Improve the algorithm to reduce redundant calculations.

Let's implement these optimizations step by step.
