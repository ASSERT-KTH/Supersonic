The given code is a program that solves a dynamic programming problem. It reads input from stdin and computes the maximum value that can be obtained by choosing a combination of idols, subject to certain constraints. The program uses a 3-dimensional array `dp` to store the maximum values at each state.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Avoid unnecessary string copying: The `Data` class stores the name of each idol as a separate string. Instead of creating a new string object, we can store the name as a pointer to a constant string. This will reduce memory usage and avoid unnecessary string copying.

2. Avoid unnecessary computation: The current implementation computes the maximum values for all possible combinations of idols and quantities. However, it is not necessary to compute the values for all quantities. We can optimize this by only computing the values for quantities that are a multiple of idol's `mC` value.

3. Optimize memory usage: The `dp` array is currently declared with a fixed size of 301x3. However, the maximum value of `M` can be up to 300. We can optimize memory usage by declaring the `dp` array with a size of `M+1`x3.

4. Use more efficient data structures: The current implementation uses a vector to store the idols. However, since the number of idols is fixed, we can use a fixed-size array instead of a vector. This will reduce memory usage and potentially improve cache performance.

5. Enable compiler optimizations: We can enable compiler optimizations by using compiler-specific directives or pragmas. This will allow the compiler to apply various optimization techniques to the code, such as loop unrolling or vectorization.

Now, let's proceed to optimize the code step by step.
