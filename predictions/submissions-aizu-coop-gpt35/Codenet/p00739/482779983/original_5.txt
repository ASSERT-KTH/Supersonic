The given code is a solution to a puzzle problem. It uses a backtracking algorithm to find a solution by placing "tatu" and "kazu" pieces on a grid, subject to certain constraints.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Reducing memory usage:
   - The `visited` set is currently a 4-dimensional array, which can be quite memory-intensive. We can reduce the memory usage by converting it into a 1-dimensional array of sets, where each set represents a combination of `(cnt, init_dir, f)` values. This will reduce the memory usage without affecting the functionality of the code.

2. Avoiding unnecessary computations:
   - The `inside` function is called multiple times in the `backtrack` function. We can optimize this by storing the result of the `inside` function in a variable and reusing it instead of calling the function multiple times.

3. Loop optimization:
   - The loops `rep(i, cnt)` and `rep(i, h) rep(j, w)` can be optimized by using a range-based for loop instead of the `rep` macro. This will simplify the code and potentially improve performance.

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations to allow the compiler to apply various optimization techniques such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and code reordering. This can be done by adding appropriate compiler flags or pragma directives.

Now, let's go step by step and implement these optimizations in the code.
