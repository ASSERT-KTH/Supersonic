The given code appears to solve a puzzle where a certain number of "tatu" pieces need to be placed in a grid. The code uses backtracking to find a solution to the puzzle. 

Upon analysis, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant computations: There are several redundant computations within the code. For example, the `inside` function is called multiple times with the same arguments. Similarly, the `backtrack` function makes multiple calls to `inside` and `field` array access. These redundant computations can be eliminated to improve performance.

2. Inefficient data structures: The usage of a `map` and a `set` to store visited states and indices can be inefficient for large inputs. These data structures have a higher time complexity for insertion and lookup operations. Alternative data structures should be considered to improve performance.

3. Unnecessary memory usage: The `visited` array is initialized and cleared in each iteration of the outer loop, which is unnecessary. It can be cleared only once before entering the loop. Additionally, the `visited` array uses a lot of memory, even for larger inputs. Finding a more memory-efficient representation might be beneficial.

4. Lack of compiler optimizations: The code does not utilize any compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can help the compiler optimize the code. Utilizing such optimizations can result in better performance.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be proposed:

1. Eliminate redundant computations:
   - Compute the `inside` check only once and store the result in a variable for reuse.
   - Store the `field` array element in a variable instead of accessing it multiple times.

2. Optimize data structures:
   - Replace the `map` with a more efficient data structure, such as a hash table or a fixed-size array.
   - Replace the `set` with a bitset or a boolean array to represent visited states.

3. Optimize memory usage:
   - Move the initialization and clearing of the `visited` array outside the loop.
   - Use a more memory-efficient representation for the `visited` array, such as a bitset or a boolean array.

4. Utilize compiler optimizations:
   - Enable compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and function inlining, to improve performance.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step-by-step in the code.
