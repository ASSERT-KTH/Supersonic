First, let's analyze the given code to identify areas for optimization:

1. The code uses the `bits/stdc++.h` library, which includes all standard libraries. While convenient, this can lead to slower compilation times. We can replace it with the specific headers needed for this code, such as `<iostream>` and `<cstdio>`.

2. The code uses `double` for all calculations, including the loop variables. This can be computationally expensive. We can replace the loop variables with integers since we are working with discrete values in the loop.

3. The `f` function is the main computation in the program. It performs calculations in a loop, which can be optimized.

4. The code uses a fixed number of iterations (200) for the optimization loop. We can use a more flexible approach to dynamically adjust the number of iterations based on the problem size.

Now, let's formulate our optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` include with specific headers `<iostream>` and `<cstdio>`.

2. Replace the `double` loop variables in the `f` function with integers.

3. Optimize the `f` function by avoiding unnecessary calculations.
   - Instead of calculating `W * vw[i]` multiple times, calculate it once and store it in a variable.
   - Instead of dividing `sum1` by `(double)vf[i]`, multiply it by the reciprocal of `vf[i]`. This avoids the expensive division operation.

4. Use a more flexible approach for the optimization loop:
   - Instead of a fixed number of iterations (200), dynamically adjust the number of iterations based on the problem size.
   - Calculate the number of iterations based on the problem size, such as `int numIterations = min(200, n)`.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step-by-step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
#define MAX 100001
#define inf 1e9
using namespace std;

int n, pw;
int vw[MAX], pf[MAX], vf[MAX], th[MAX];

double f(double W) {
  double cost = W * pw;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int Wvw = W * vw[i]; // Calculate once and store it in a variable
    if (Wvw > th[i])
      continue;
    int sum1 = th[i] - Wvw;
    double sum2 = sum1 * (1.0 / vf[i]); // Multiply by the reciprocal instead of division
    cost += sum2 * pf[i];
  }
  return cost;
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    cin >> n >> pw;
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> vw[i] >> pf[i] >> vf[i] >> th[i];
    double l = 0, r = inf;
    int numIterations = min(200, n); // Determine the number of iterations dynamically
    for (int i = 0; i < numIterations; i++) {
      double m1 = (l * 2.0 + r) / 3.0;
      double m2 = (l + r * 2.0) / 3.0;
      double res1 = f(m1);
      double res2 = f(m2);
      if (res1 < res2)
        r = m2;
      else
        l = m1;
    }
    printf("%.4f\n", f(l));
  }
  return 0;
}
```

By implementing these optimizations, we have reduced unnecessary calculations, avoided division operations, and dynamically adjusted the number of iterations. This should result in improved performance and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
