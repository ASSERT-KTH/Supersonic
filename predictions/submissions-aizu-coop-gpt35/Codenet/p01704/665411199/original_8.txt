Code Analysis:

1. The program reads in the values of `n` and `pw` from the input. These values represent the number of items and the maximum weight the knapsack can hold, respectively.

2. The program then reads in the values of `vw`, `pf`, `vf`, and `th` arrays. These arrays represent the weight, profit, value, and threshold of each item, respectively.

3. The program uses a ternary search algorithm to find the minimum cost for the given knapsack problem. The `f` function calculates the cost for a given weight `W` and returns it.

4. The program outputs the minimum cost by calling the `f` function with the weight `l`, which is the result of the ternary search algorithm.

Potential optimizations:

1. The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes a large number of unnecessary header files, which can slow down the compilation process. It is better to include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<cstdio>`.

2. The `inf` constant is defined as `1e9`, which is unnecessarily large for this problem. Since the profit and value are given as doubles, it would be sufficient to define `inf` as a large double value, such as `1e18`.

3. The `MAX` constant is defined as `100001`, which is larger than the maximum value of `n` in the problem statement. It can be reduced to a smaller value, such as `1000`, to save memory.

4. The `vw`, `pf`, `vf`, and `th` arrays are declared with a size of `MAX`, which is larger than the actual number of items `n`. This wastes memory. Instead, these arrays can be declared with a size of `n`.

5. The `f` function can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary calculations. For example, the expression `W * vw[i]` is calculated multiple times within the loop. It can be calculated once and stored in a variable for reuse.

6. The `f` function can be further optimized by avoiding the division operation within the loop. Instead of dividing `sum1` by `vf[i]`, we can multiply it by the reciprocal of `vf[i]`, which is more efficient.

7. The ternary search algorithm can be optimized by reducing the number of iterations. The current implementation uses a fixed number of iterations (`200`), which may not be optimal in all cases. We can introduce a termination condition based on the difference between `l` and `r` to stop the algorithm when the difference becomes smaller than a certain threshold.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove the unnecessary `bits/stdc++.h` header and include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<cstdio>`.

2. Replace the `inf` constant with a large double value, such as `1e18`.

3. Reduce the `MAX` constant to a smaller value, such as `1000`.

4. Declare the `vw`, `pf`, `vf`, and `th` arrays with a size of `n` instead of `MAX`.

5. Calculate `W * vw[i]` once and store it in a variable for reuse within the loop.

6. Multiply `sum1` by the reciprocal of `vf[i]` instead of dividing it.

7. Optimize the termination condition of the ternary search algorithm based on the difference between `l` and `r`.

#define inf 1e18

using namespace std;

int n, pw;
double vw[MAX], pf[MAX], vf[MAX], th[MAX];

double f(double W) {
  double cost = W * pw;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    double wv = W * vw[i];
    if (wv > th[i])
      continue;
    double sum1 = th[i] - wv;
    double sum2 = sum1 * (1.0 / vf[i]);
    cost += sum2 * pf[i];
  }
  return cost;

int main() {
  while (1) {
    cin >> n >> pw;
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> vw[i] >> pf[i] >> vf[i] >> th[i];
    double l = 0, r = inf;
    double diff = (r - l) / 3.0;
    while (diff > 1e-9) {
      double m1 = l + diff;
      double m2 = r - diff;
      double res1 = f(m1);
      double res2 = f(m2);
      if (res1 < res2)
        r = m2;
      else
        l = m1;
      diff = (r - l) / 3.0;
    }
    printf("%.4f\n", f(l));
  }
  return 0;
}
