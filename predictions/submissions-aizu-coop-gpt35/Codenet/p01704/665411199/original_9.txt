Analysis:
1. The code uses an inefficient method to calculate the cost. It iterates over each item and performs multiple divisions and multiplications for each item.
2. The code uses floating-point arithmetic for comparisons, which can be slower than integer comparisons.
3. The code uses a linear search to find the minimum cost. It performs 200 iterations to find the minimum value, which is not efficient.
4. The code uses an array of size MAX for each item, which can lead to excessive memory usage for large values of MAX.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the linear search for finding the minimum cost with a more efficient algorithm, such as binary search or ternary search.
2. Replace the floating-point arithmetic with integer arithmetic for comparisons.
3. Optimize the cost calculation by reducing the number of divisions and multiplications.
4. Use a more efficient data structure to store item information, such as a struct or a class.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, as it includes a large number of unnecessary headers.
2. Replace the `double` data type with `int` for `pw`, as the weight is given as an integer.
3. Replace the `double` data types for `vw`, `pf`, `vf`, and `th` with a struct or class, to store the item information in a more efficient manner.
4. Replace the floating-point arithmetic in the comparison `W * vw[i] > th[i]` with integer arithmetic. Multiply `W` and `vw[i]` by a common factor to convert them to integers.
5. Replace the division `sum1 / (double)vf[i]` with integer division, as `vf[i]` is an integer.
6. Optimize the cost calculation by reducing the number of divisions and multiplications. Calculate `sum2` outside the loop and multiply it with `pf[i]` inside the loop.
7. Replace the linear search for finding the minimum cost with a binary search or ternary search algorithm.
8. Remove the unnecessary constant `MAX`, as it is not used in the code.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

struct Item {
  int vw, pf, vf, th;
};

int n, pw;
vector<Item> items;

int f(int W) {
  int cost = W * pw;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (W * items[i].vw > items[i].th)
      continue;
    int sum1 = items[i].th - W * items[i].vw;
    int sum2 = sum1 / items[i].vf;
    cost += sum2 * items[i].pf;
  }
  return cost;
}

int findMinCost(int l, int r) {
  while (l < r) {
    int m1 = l + (r - l) / 3;
    int m2 = r - (r - l) / 3;
    int res1 = f(m1);
    int res2 = f(m2);
    if (res1 < res2)
      r = m2 - 1;
    else
      l = m1 + 1;
  }
  return f(l);
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    cin >> n >> pw;
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    items.resize(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> items[i].vw >> items[i].pf >> items[i].vf >> items[i].th;
    int l = 0, r = 1000000;
    int minCost = findMinCost(l, r);
    printf("%.4f\n", minCost / 10000.0);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code replaces the floating-point arithmetic with integer arithmetic, reduces the number of divisions and multiplications, and uses a more efficient algorithm for finding the minimum cost. It also uses a struct to store the item information efficiently and avoids excessive memory usage by using a vector instead of an array.
