Code Analysis:
- The code starts by reading the input values for `n`, `m`, and `X`.
- It then reads the array `H` of size `n`.
- It reads `m` edges and constructs a graph `G` using the input values.
- It initializes a priority queue `que` and pushes the starting vertex `X` into it.
- It maintains a map `v2id` to assign unique IDs to every vertex-height pair encountered.
- It maintains a `max_h` array to store the maximum height reached for each vertex.
- It maintains a set `height` to store the heights reached for each vertex.
- It uses a while loop to process vertices from the priority queue.
- It checks if the current height is greater than the maximum height reached for the vertex and updates the maximum height if necessary.
- It then checks each neighbor of the current vertex and calculates the new height and back height based on the cost of the edge and the maximum height restrictions.
- If the new height is greater than the maximum height reached for the neighbor, it assigns new IDs to the neighbor and adds the neighbor to the priority queue.
- After processing all vertices, it creates a new graph `gg` based on the assigned IDs.
- It handles the case when the starting vertex has a height greater than 0 separately.
- It calculates the shortest path from the starting vertex to the goal vertex using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Finally, it prints the shortest path distance.

Potential Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a more efficient data structure for the graph representation. The current implementation uses vectors and sets, which can be slow for large graphs. Consider using an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list with better time complexity for graph operations.
2. Avoid unnecessary calculations and memory usage. Analyze the code to identify any redundant computations or unnecessary memory allocations that can be eliminated.
3. Optimize the Dijkstra's algorithm implementation. Look for opportunities to improve the efficiency of the algorithm, such as using a better data structure for the priority queue or applying any optimization techniques specific to Dijkstra's algorithm.
4. Consider compiler optimizations. Explore the use of compiler-specific optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation of Optimization Steps:
1. Use an adjacency list instead of vectors of structures for the graph representation. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.
2. Remove the unnecessary `height` set. Since the heights are already stored in the adjacency list, there is no need to maintain a separate set.
3. Use a `vector` instead of a `map` for `v2id`. This will provide faster access to the IDs of vertex-height pairs.
4. Use an `unordered_map` instead of a `map` for `v2id`. This will provide faster lookup and insertion of vertex-height pairs.
5. Optimize the Dijkstra's algorithm implementation by using a Fibonacci heap or a binary heap instead of the `priority_queue`. This will reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.
6. Use `int` variables instead of `ll` for `max_h` and `d` arrays. Since the maximum height and shortest path distances are limited to the range of `int`, using `int` will save memory and improve cache utilization.
7. Use a `memset` function instead of `fill` to initialize the `d` array with INF. This will provide faster initialization.
8. Optimize the loop that calculates the heights and distances for each vertex. Instead of using a set and iterating over it, directly process the heights in the adjacency list while constructing the graph `gg`.
9. Remove the redundant `if` condition to check if `ans` is `INF` before printing. Since `ans` is initialized to `INF`, this check is unnecessary.
