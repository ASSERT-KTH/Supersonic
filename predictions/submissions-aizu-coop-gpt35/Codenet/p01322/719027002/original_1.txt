The given code reads input from the user and performs some calculations based on the input. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized:

1. Unnecessary Memory Usage: The code uses arrays of fixed size for `o` and `b`, with a maximum size of 100. However, the actual number of elements used may be less than 100, resulting in unnecessary memory usage.

2. Inefficient String Comparison: The code compares two strings using nested loops and character comparisons. This approach can be optimized by using a more efficient string comparison algorithm.

3. Redundant Loop: The code uses an infinite loop with a `break` statement to terminate the program when `n` and `m` are both zero. This can be simplified by using a `while` loop with a condition.

4. Redundant Loop Variable: The loop variable `i` is used in both the outer and inner loops, which can be confusing. It is better to use different variables to avoid any confusion.

5. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest some compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization strategy step by step.
