The given code is a C++ program that reads input from the user and performs some calculations based on the input. The program reads two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` pairs of strings and integers. It then reads `m` strings and checks if each string matches any of the pairs of strings read earlier. If a match is found, the corresponding integer is added to the total sum. Finally, the program outputs the sum.

To optimize this code, we need to identify potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage. Let's analyze the code step by step.

1. Inefficient Memory Usage:
   - The arrays `o` and `b` have a fixed size of 100. This limits the number of pairs of strings and integers that can be processed. We can replace these arrays with dynamically allocated containers that can grow as needed.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The innermost loop compares each character of the string `l` with the corresponding character of each string in the array `b`. This comparison is unnecessary because the loop can terminate as soon as a mismatch is found. We can optimize this loop by introducing an early exit.

3. Inefficient String Comparison:
   - The comparison of characters in the innermost loop can be optimized. Instead of comparing each character individually, we can use a bitwise comparison to check if the characters are equal or if one of them is a wildcard character.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can suggest the use of compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. Depending on the compiler and its version, certain optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, or vectorization may be automatically applied.

Now let's proceed with the optimization steps.
