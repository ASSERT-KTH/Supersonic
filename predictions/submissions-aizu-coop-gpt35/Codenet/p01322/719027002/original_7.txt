The given code reads input values for `n` and `m`, and then reads `n` strings and `n` integers. It then reads `m` strings and checks if each string matches any of the `n` strings. If there is a match, the corresponding integer is added to the `ans` variable. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

Here are some potential optimizations that can be applied to improve the performance of the code:

1. Replace `string` with `const char*` for `b` array:
   - Since the `b` array only stores fixed-length strings of length 8, using `const char*` instead of `string` can save memory and improve performance.
   - This change eliminates the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and string operations for each element of the `b` array.

2. Use `std::array` instead of built-in array:
   - Replace the built-in array `o` with `std::array` for improved safety and performance.
   - `std::array` provides bounds checking and can be optimized by the compiler more efficiently compared to a built-in array.

3. Use `std::unordered_map` for fast lookup:
   - Instead of iterating over the `n` strings to find a match, use `std::unordered_map` to perform constant-time lookup.
   - The keys of the unordered map will be the strings from the input, and the values will be the corresponding integers.
   - This change will significantly reduce the time complexity of matching the strings.

4. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to improve input/output performance:
   - By default, C++ streams are synchronized with C-style I/O functions, which can reduce performance.
   - Disabling synchronization using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` can improve the input/output performance.

Now, let's apply these optimizations step by step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <array>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  
  int n, m;
  std::array<int, 100> o;
  std::array<const char*, 100> b;
  std::unordered_map<std::string, int> map;
  std::string l;
  int ans;
  
  for (;;) {
    std::cin >> n >> m;
    if (!n && !m)
      break;
      
    ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> l >> o[i];
      b[i] = l.c_str();
      map.emplace(l, o[i]);
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      std::cin >> l;
      auto it = map.find(l);
      if (it != map.end()) {
        ans += it->second;
      }
    }
    
    std::cout << ans << '\n';
  }
}
```

With these optimizations, the code should run more efficiently and use memory more effectively. The changes made preserve the functionality and output of the original code while improving its performance.
