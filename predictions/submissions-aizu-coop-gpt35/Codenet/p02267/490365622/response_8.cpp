The given code reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` elements into array `S`. It then reads another integer `q`, followed by `q` elements into array `T`. The code then iterates over each element of `T` and checks if it exists in `S`. If a match is found, it increments the counter `cnt`. Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

This code can be optimized in several ways to improve its performance and reduce memory usage.

1. Use a more efficient data structure:
   - The current code uses simple arrays `S` and `T` to store the elements. However, searching for an element in an array has a time complexity of O(n). To improve the search performance, we can use a more efficient data structure like a hash set or a binary search tree.

2. Avoid redundant or unnecessary computations:
   - The code currently uses two nested loops to compare each element of `T` with each element of `S`. However, if we sort the arrays `S` and `T`, we can perform a binary search to check if an element exists in the array. This reduces the time complexity of the search operation to O(log n) instead of O(n).

3. Optimize the loops:
   - The loops in the code can be optimized for better performance. Loop unrolling can be applied to reduce loop overhead, especially in the nested loops. Additionally, the order of the loops can be changed to improve cache locality and reduce cache misses.

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations to let the compiler automatically optimize the code. For example, we can use optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` while compiling the code to enable aggressive optimizations.
