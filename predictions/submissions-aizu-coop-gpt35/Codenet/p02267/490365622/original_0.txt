The given code is a simple program that takes input arrays S and T, and counts the number of elements in T that are present in S. While the code works correctly, there are several areas that can be optimized for better performance and reduced memory usage.

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The arrays S and T have fixed sizes of 10000 and 500 respectively. Using such large fixed-size arrays can waste memory if the actual input sizes are smaller. It is better to use dynamically allocated arrays to optimize memory usage.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The code uses nested loops to compare each element in T with every element in S. This results in redundant comparisons and can be optimized to reduce the number of comparisons.

3. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Using compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization, can improve the performance of the code. We can suggest the use of compiler-specific pragmas or directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now, let's go through the step-by-step optimization process:

Step 1: Replace fixed-size arrays with dynamically allocated arrays:
```c
int* S = malloc(n * sizeof(int));
int* T = malloc(q * sizeof(int));
```
By using dynamic memory allocation, we can optimize memory usage by allocating only the required memory based on the input sizes.

Step 2: Optimize the comparison loop:
```c
for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    if (T[i] == S[j]) {
      cnt++;
      break;
    }
  }
}
```
In the existing code, the inner loop continues even after finding a match. This results in unnecessary comparisons. We can optimize this by breaking out of the inner loop as soon as a match is found, and move on to the next element in T.

Step 3: Use compiler optimizations:
We can suggest the use of compiler-specific pragmas or directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. For example, we can use `#pragma omp parallel for` to parallelize the loop and improve performance. However, the effectiveness of such optimizations depends on the compiler and platform being used.

Here's the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int n, q, i, j, cnt = 0;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  
  int* S = malloc(n * sizeof(int));
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);

  scanf("%d", &q);

  int* T = malloc(q * sizeof(int));
  for (j = 0; j < q; j++)
    scanf("%d", &T[j]);

  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      if (T[i] == S[j]) {
        cnt++;
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  printf("%d\n", cnt);

  free(S);
  free(T);

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code improves memory usage by using dynamically allocated arrays instead of fixed-size arrays. It also reduces redundant computations by breaking out of the inner loop as soon as a match is found. Additionally, we suggest using compiler optimizations to further improve performance, such as parallelization using `#pragma omp parallel for` (if supported by the compiler).
