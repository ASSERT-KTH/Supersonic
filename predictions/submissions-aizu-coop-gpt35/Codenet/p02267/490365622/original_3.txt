The provided code reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` integers into an array `S`. It then reads another integer `q`, followed by `q` integers into an array `T`. The code then counts the number of elements in `T` that are also present in `S` and prints the count.

While the code is correct and functional, there are several opportunities for optimization:

1. **Data Structures**: The code uses simple arrays to store the elements. However, arrays are not the most efficient data structure for searching elements. Using a more efficient data structure, such as a hash set or a binary search tree, can significantly improve the performance.

2. **Redundant Computations**: The code performs multiple unnecessary computations. For example, it compares each element of `T` with every element of `S` even after finding a match. This results in redundant iterations.

3. **Compiler Optimizations**: Compiler optimizations can greatly improve the performance of the code. By using appropriate compiler flags or pragma directives, we can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code, such as loop unrolling or vectorization.

Now, let's optimize the code step-by-step while preserving its functionality and output.
