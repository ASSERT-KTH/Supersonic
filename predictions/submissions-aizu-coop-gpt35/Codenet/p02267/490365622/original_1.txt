The given code reads an integer `n` followed by `n` elements into an array `S`. It then reads another integer `q` followed by `q` elements into an array `T`. The code then checks for each element in `T` if it exists in `S` and increments a counter `cnt` if it does. Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

There are a few potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage in this code:

1. The arrays `S` and `T` have fixed sizes of 10000 and 500 respectively. This can lead to wasted memory if the input sizes are smaller. Additionally, if the input sizes are larger, the code will not be able to handle them. It would be more efficient to dynamically allocate memory for these arrays based on the actual input sizes.

2. The nested loop for comparing each element of `T` with each element of `S` has a time complexity of O(n*q). If `n` and `q` are large, this can result in a significant number of comparisons and slow down the program. This can be improved by using a more efficient algorithm or data structure to perform the search.

3. The code breaks out of the inner loop as soon as a match is found. While this reduces unnecessary comparisons, it does not take advantage of the fact that `S` is sorted. Since `S` is sorted, we can use binary search to find a match in O(log n) time instead of searching linearly through the array.

Based on these observations, we can proceed with the following optimization steps:

1. Dynamically allocate memory for arrays `S` and `T` based on the input sizes to avoid wasted memory and handle larger input sizes.

2. Sort array `S` using a more efficient sorting algorithm like quicksort or mergesort. Sorting `S` will allow us to perform binary search for each element of `T`.

3. Replace the linear search loop with a binary search algorithm to find matches in `S`.

4. Update the code to handle the dynamically allocated arrays and free the memory after use.

Here is the optimized code with the above changes:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Comparison function for quicksort
int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {
  return (*(int *)a - *(int *)b);
}

// Binary search algorithm
int binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {
  int left = 0;
  int right = size - 1;
  while (left <= right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    if (arr[mid] == target) {
      return 1;
    }
    if (arr[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  int n, *S, q, *T, i, cnt = 0;

  scanf("%d", &n);
  S = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);

  scanf("%d", &q);
  T = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * q);
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++)
    scanf("%d", &T[i]);

  // Sort array S
  qsort(S, n, sizeof(int), compare);

  // Perform binary search for each element of T
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++)
    if (binarySearch(S, n, T[i])) {
      cnt++;
    }

  printf("%d\n", cnt);

  // Free dynamically allocated memory
  free(S);
  free(T);

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code uses dynamic memory allocation to allocate memory for arrays `S` and `T` based on the input sizes. The `qsort` function is used to sort the array `S` in ascending order. The `binarySearch` function is used to perform a binary search for each element of `T` in the sorted array `S`. The dynamically allocated memory is freed at the end of the program.

Trade-offs:
- The use of dynamic memory allocation adds some complexity to the code, as we need to allocate and free memory explicitly. However, this allows the code to handle different input sizes efficiently and avoid wasted memory.
- Sorting the array `S` using a more efficient sorting algorithm improves the search performance but adds some overhead in terms of time complexity. However, the overall performance is significantly improved compared to a linear search.
- The binary search algorithm requires the array `S` to be sorted. If the array is not sorted, additional sorting steps will be needed.
