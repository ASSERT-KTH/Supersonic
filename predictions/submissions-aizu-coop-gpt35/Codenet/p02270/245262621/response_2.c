Analysis:
- The code reads the number of packets and tracks from the input.
- It then reads the weight of each packet and calculates the maximum weight and the sum of all weights.
- It uses binary search to find the minimum capacity that can allocate all packets.
- The `canAlloc` function checks if it is possible to allocate all packets within a given capacity.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid unnecessary calculations:
   - The code calculates the maximum weight and the sum of all weights in the initial loop. Instead of storing the maximum weight and sum, we can calculate them on the fly while iterating over the packets in the `canAlloc` function.

2. Improve loop efficiency:
   - The `canAlloc` function has a loop that iterates over all packets. We can optimize this loop by using a pointer instead of an index to access the weight array. This can eliminate the need for the `i` variable and the index-based access.

3. Optimize memory usage:
   - The `canAlloc` function uses a variable `alloced_in_one` to keep track of the allocated weight in one track. However, this variable is not necessary. We can use a local variable in the loop instead of `alloced_in_one`.

4. Use more efficient data types:
   - The code uses `long` as the data type for capacity and `num_packet`. We can use more specific data types such as `int` for capacity and `size_t` for `num_packet` to improve memory usage and potentially gain performance benefits.

5. Compiler optimizations:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations by using appropriate compiler flags and pragma directives. This can help the compiler to generate more efficient code.
