The given code calculates the minimum weight capacity required for k trucks to carry a given set of weights. However, there are several areas of the code that can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Inefficient Memory Usage:
   - The `Input` function creates a temporary vector `W` to store the weights and returns it by value. This involves unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation. Instead, we can pass the `W` vector by reference and fill it directly in the function.
   - The `IsAllLoaded` function also takes the `W` vector by value, which requires copying the entire vector. We can improve this by passing it by const reference instead.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `IsAllLoaded` function calculates the sum of the weights in each iteration of the loop. This can be optimized by calculating the total weight sum outside the loop and updating it incrementally as the loop progresses.

3. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can suggest the compiler to optimize the code by enabling compiler optimizations. This can be done by passing appropriate flags to the compiler during compilation.

Let's proceed with optimizing the code step by step.
