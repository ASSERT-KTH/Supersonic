The given code calculates the minimum capacity of a conveyor belt required to distribute items from a set of weights equally among a given number of containers. The code takes the number of items, the number of containers, and the weights of the items as input, and outputs the minimum conveyor belt capacity.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. Input Function: The `Input` function reads the weights of the items from the user and stores them in a vector. This function is called inside the `Calc` function for each test case. However, the function returns a copy of the vector, which incurs unnecessary memory overhead. 

2. IsAllLoaded Function: The `IsAllLoaded` function checks whether it is possible to load all the items onto the conveyor belt with a given capacity. It iterates over the entire vector of weights, accumulating the weights and checking if they exceed the given capacity. However, the function uses the `accumulate` function to calculate the sum of weights in each iteration, resulting in redundant computations.

3. Calc Function: The `Calc` function calculates the minimum capacity of the conveyor belt required to distribute items equally. It iteratively increments the capacity until it finds a capacity that satisfies the condition in the `IsAllLoaded` function. This approach may be inefficient for large input sizes, as it performs multiple iterations and calls the `IsAllLoaded` function multiple times.

To optimize the code, I propose the following steps:

Step 1: Modify the Input Function
- Instead of returning a copy of the vector, pass a reference to the vector and populate it directly in the `Input` function.
- This eliminates the need for copying the vector, reducing memory usage and improving efficiency.

Step 2: Modify the IsAllLoaded Function
- Instead of using the `accumulate` function to calculate the sum of weights in each iteration, maintain a running sum of weights.
- This avoids redundant computations and improves the efficiency of the function.

Step 3: Modify the Calc Function
- Rather than incrementing the capacity iteratively, we can use a binary search approach to find the minimum capacity that satisfies the condition in the `IsAllLoaded` function.
- This approach reduces the number of iterations and calls to the `IsAllLoaded` function, improving efficiency.
