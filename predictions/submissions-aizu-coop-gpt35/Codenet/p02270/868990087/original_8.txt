Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified a couple of areas that can be optimized for better performance:

1. Inefficient Data Structure: The array `N[]` is currently being used to store the weights. However, this approach is not memory-efficient as it uses a fixed-size array. Since the number of weights is given by `n`, it would be more efficient to use a dynamically allocated array or a container that can dynamically resize itself, such as a `std::vector`.

2. Redundant Comparison: In the `check()` function, there is a redundant comparison `if (i == n)` after incrementing `i`. Since the loop condition `s + N[i] <= w` ensures that `i` will never exceed `n`, this comparison can be removed.

3. Integer Division: In the `main()` function, the calculation of `mid` is currently done using integer division `(left + right) / 2`. This can be replaced with a bit shift operation `(left + right) >> 1`, which is faster for large integers.

4. Compiler Optimization: We can add compiler optimization flags or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize the code. For example, we can use the `-O3` flag for aggressive optimization, or we can use `#pragma` directives such as `pragma GCC optimize("O3")` in GCC or `pragma clang optimize on` in Clang.

Now, let's proceed with optimizing the code step by step:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int check(const vector<int>& N, int k, int w) {
  int i = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
    int s = 0;
    while (s + N[i] <= w) {
      s += N[i];
      ++i;
      // No need for the comparison i == n
      // The loop condition ensures i will never exceed n
    }
  }
  return i;
}

int main() {
  int MAX_W = 1000000000;
  int n, k;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);
  vector<int> N(n);  // Use a dynamically allocated array or a vector
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &N[i]);
  }
  int left = 0;
  int right = MAX_W;
  while (left < right) {
    // Use bit shift operation for faster integer division
    int mid = (left + right) >> 1;
    if (check(N, k, mid) == n) {
      right = mid;
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  cout << right << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

With these optimizations, we have improved the code's efficiency by using a more memory-efficient data structure and removing redundant comparisons. We have also made a minor improvement in performance by using a bit shift operation for integer division. Additionally, we have suggested compiler optimizations to further enhance the code's performance.
