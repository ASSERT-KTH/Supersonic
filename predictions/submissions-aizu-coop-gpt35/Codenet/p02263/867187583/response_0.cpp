The provided code is a simple calculator program that evaluates postfix expressions using a stack. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for improved performance and reduced memory usage.

1. Inefficient Stack Implementation:
The current implementation of the stack class is using a vector to store the elements. However, vectors are not the most efficient data structure for a stack. Each insertion or removal operation requires resizing the vector, resulting in unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations. To improve the stack implementation, we can replace the vector with a dynamically allocated array.

2. Redundant Function Calls:
The isFull() and isEmpty() functions in the Stack class are unnecessary. Instead, we can directly check the size of the stack container (s_) to determine if it is full or empty.

3. Unnecessary String Copy:
The current code uses a character array (s) to read the input string from scanf(). However, there is no need to copy the string into a separate array. We can directly read the input string into a temporary variable and perform the necessary operations on it.

4. Unnecessary String Comparison:
The if-else ladder in the main function compares the first character of the input string (s) to determine the operation to be performed. Instead of using string comparison, we can use a switch statement with the ASCII values of the characters to determine the operation.

5. Unnecessary Memory Allocation:
The current code uses the atoi() function to convert the input string to an integer. However, atoi() dynamically allocates memory for the converted integer, which can be inefficient. We can use the faster and safer std::stoi() function instead.

6. Unnecessary Vector Initialization:
The stack vector (s_) is initialized with a fixed size of 110, which may not be optimal for all input cases. We can initialize the vector with a smaller size and dynamically resize it as needed.

7. Avoiding Namespace Usage:
Using the "using namespace std" directive is generally discouraged in C++ to avoid namespace collisions. It is better to explicitly specify the namespace for each standard library function or class.
