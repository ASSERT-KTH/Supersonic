Code Analysis:
1. The Stack class is implemented using a vector to store the elements. However, the vector is not being used efficiently. The vector is resized to the maximum size initially, which may result in wasted memory if the stack does not require the full capacity.
2. The isEmpty() and isFull() functions are not efficient. They rely on checking the value of the top_ variable, which requires an additional comparison operation.
3. The pop() function has unnecessary checks for an empty stack. The isEmpty() check before the pop operation is redundant because the pop operation already handles the case when the stack is empty.
4. The main() function reads input using scanf() and performs the corresponding operations based on the input. The code could benefit from using a more efficient input reading method.
5. The main() function does not have any error handling for invalid input.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the vector in the Stack class with a dynamically allocated array. The array size will be adjusted based on the actual number of elements in the stack.
2. Replace the top_ variable with a pointer to the top element of the stack. This eliminates the need for the isEmpty() and isFull() functions.
3. Remove the unnecessary isEmpty() check in the pop() function.
4. Replace the scanf() function with a more efficient input reading method, such as fgets() or getchar().
5. Add error handling for invalid input.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. In the Stack class, replace the vector<int> s_ with an int* s_. This will be a dynamically allocated array to store the stack elements.
2. Remove the top_ variable from the Stack class and replace it with an int* top_ that points to the top element of the stack.
3. Modify the push() function to update the top_ pointer instead of the top_ variable.
4. Modify the pop() function to directly access the top element using the top_ pointer and update the pointer to the next element.
5. In the main() function, replace the scanf() function with fgets() or getchar() to read input character by character.
6. Handle the input characters as follows:
   - If the character is a digit, accumulate the digits to form a number and push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is an operator (+, -, *), perform the corresponding operation using the top two elements of the stack and push the result back onto the stack.
   - If the character is a newline or space, ignore it.
   - If the character is any other character, handle it as an error.
7. Add error handling for invalid input, such as printing an error message and exiting the program.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

class Stack {
public:
  Stack(int n) : s_(new int[n]), top_(s_){};
  ~Stack() {
    delete[] s_;
  }
  bool isEmpty() { return top_ == s_; }
  void push(int x) {
    *(++top_) = x;
  }
  int pop() {
    return *(top_--);
  }

private:
  int* s_;
  int* top_;
};

int main() {
  char s[1000];
  Stack stack(110);
  fgets(s, sizeof(s), stdin);
  char* p = s;
  while (*p != '\0' && *p != '\n') {
    if (*p >= '0' && *p <= '9') {
      int num = 0;
      while (*p >= '0' && *p <= '9') {
        num = num * 10 + (*p - '0');
        p++;
      }
      stack.push(num);
    } else if (*p == '+') {
      int rhs = stack.pop();
      int lhs = stack.pop();
      int t = lhs + rhs;
      stack.push(t);
      p++;
    } else if (*p == '-') {
      int rhs = stack.pop();
      int lhs = stack.pop();
      int t = lhs - rhs;
      stack.push(t);
      p++;
    } else if (*p == '*') {
      int rhs = stack.pop();
      int lhs = stack.pop();
      int t = lhs * rhs;
      stack.push(t);
      p++;
    } else if (*p == ' ' || *p == '\t') {
      p++;
    } else {
      printf("Invalid input\n");
      return 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", stack.pop());
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:
1. The optimized code uses a dynamically allocated array instead of a vector for the stack. This reduces memory usage by allocating memory only for the actual number of stack elements. However, it introduces the responsibility of managing memory manually, including proper allocation and deallocation.
