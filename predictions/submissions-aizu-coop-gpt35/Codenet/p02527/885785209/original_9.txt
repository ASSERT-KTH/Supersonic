Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential optimizations that can improve its performance and reduce memory usage:

1. Use a more efficient sorting algorithm: The current implementation uses a quicksort algorithm. While quicksort has an average time complexity of O(n log n), it can degrade to O(n^2) in the worst case. Additionally, it requires extra memory for the stack. An alternative algorithm, such as introsort or heapsort, could be used to ensure worst-case time complexity of O(n log n) and eliminate the need for extra memory.

2. Eliminate unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary headers, such as `<algorithm>`, `<cassert>`, and `<vector>`. These headers are not used in the code and can be removed to reduce compile time and memory usage.

3. Avoid unnecessary data copying: The current implementation copies the input array `a` to `l` and `r` in the `quicksort` function. This copying operation can be avoided by passing `l` and `r` as arguments directly.

4. Replace `rand()` with a more efficient random number generator: The `rand()` function is not very efficient and can be replaced with a more efficient random number generator, such as the Mersenne Twister algorithm (`std::mt19937`).

5. Use `std::cout` instead of `printf()`: The `printf()` function is slower compared to `std::cout` in C++. Replacing `printf()` with `std::cout` can improve the output performance.

6. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The code uses `max_element()` function to find the maximum element in the array `l` and `r`. However, this function call is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simple loop to find the maximum element.

Based on these optimizations, I will now provide an optimized version of the code.
