Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Allocation: The program dynamically allocates memory for the `boss` and `height` arrays using the `new` operator. However, it does not deallocate this memory using the `delete` operator. This can lead to memory leaks and inefficient memory usage. To optimize memory usage, we can replace the dynamic memory allocation with static arrays or use the `std::vector` container.

2. Path Compression: The `get_boss` function currently implements path compression by assigning the root boss to all intermediate nodes on the path. However, this implementation uses recursion, which can be inefficient for large input sizes. We can optimize this by using an iterative approach instead of recursion.

3. Union by Rank: The `unite` function currently uses the height of the trees to determine which boss to assign. However, this implementation does not consider the rank of the trees, which can lead to unbalanced trees and slower union operations. We can optimize this by implementing the union by rank technique to ensure a balanced tree structure.

4. Compiler Optimization: We can use compiler optimizations, such as optimizing for speed (`-O3` flag) or enabling loop unrolling (`-funroll-loops` flag), to instruct the compiler to optimize the code further.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with implementing them step by step.

Step 1: Memory Allocation Optimization
---------------------------------------
To optimize memory allocation, we can replace the dynamic memory allocation with the `std::vector` container. This container provides automatic memory management and is more efficient than manually managing memory using `new` and `delete` operators.

Replace the following lines:
```cpp
int *boss, *height;
```
with:
```cpp
vector<int> boss(N), height(N);
```

Step 2: Path Compression Optimization
-------------------------------------
To optimize the path compression in the `get_boss` function, we can replace the recursive approach with an iterative approach. This will eliminate the function call overhead and improve the performance for large input sizes.

Replace the `get_boss` function with the following implementation:
```cpp
int get_boss(int id) {
  int root = id;
  while (boss[root] != root) {
    root = boss[root];
  }
  while (boss[id] != root) {
    int parent = boss[id];
    boss[id] = root;
    id = parent;
  }
  return root;
}
```

Step 3: Union by Rank Optimization
----------------------------------
To optimize the `unite` function, we can implement the union by rank technique. This technique considers the rank (i.e., height) of the trees and always attaches the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree. This ensures a balanced tree structure and improves the performance of union operations.

Replace the `unite` function with the following implementation:
```cpp
void unite(int x, int y) {
  int boss_x = get_boss(x);
  int boss_y = get_boss(y);
  if (boss_x == boss_y)
    return;
  if (height[boss_x] > height[boss_y]) {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
  } else if (height[boss_x] < height[boss_y]) {
    boss[boss_x] = boss_y;
  } else {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
    height[boss_x]++;
  }
}
```

Step 4: Compiler Optimization
----------------------------
To enable compiler optimizations, add the following pragma directive at the beginning of the program:
```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("O3")
```
This will instruct the GCC compiler to optimize the code for speed.

Optimized Code:
---------------
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <queue>
#include <stack>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
typedef long long int ll;
#define BIG_NUM 2000000000
#define MOD 1000000007
#define EPS 0.000001
using namespace std;
int N;
vector<int> boss, height;
int get_boss(int id) {
  int root = id;
  while (boss[root] != root) {
    root = boss[root];
  }
  while (boss[id] != root) {
    int parent = boss[id];
    boss[id] = root;
    id = parent;
  }
  return root;
}
int is_same(int x, int y) { return get_boss(x) == get_boss(y); }
void unite(int x, int y) {
  int boss_x = get_boss(x);
  int boss_y = get_boss(y);
  if (boss_x == boss_y)
    return;
  if (height[boss_x] > height[boss_y]) {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
  } else if (height[boss_x] < height[boss_y]) {
    boss[boss_x] = boss_y;
  } else {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
    height[boss_x]++;
  }
}
int main() {
  #pragma GCC optimize("O3")
  int Q, command, x, y;
  scanf("%d %d", &N, &Q);
  boss.resize(N);
  height.resize(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    boss[i] = i;
    height[i] = 1;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d %d", &command, &x, &y);
    if (command == 0) {
      unite(x, y);
    } else {
      if (is_same(x, y)) {
        printf("1\n");
      } else {
        printf("0\n");
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

By applying these optimizations, we have improved the memory usage, eliminated recursion, ensured a balanced tree structure, and enabled compiler optimizations for the code. These optimizations should result in a more efficient and performant program.
