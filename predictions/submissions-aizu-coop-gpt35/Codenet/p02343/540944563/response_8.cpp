The provided code is an implementation of a disjoint set data structure using the union-find algorithm. The code aims to answer queries of whether two elements belong to the same set or not, and to merge two sets together.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be proposed:

1. Replace the `typedef` with `using` for better readability: 
   ```cpp
   using ll = long long int;
   ```

2. Replace the macro constants with `constexpr` variables:
   ```cpp
   constexpr int BIG_NUM = 2000000000;
   constexpr int MOD = 1000000007;
   constexpr double EPS = 0.000001;
   ```

3. Replace the dynamically allocated arrays with `std::vector` for better memory management:
   ```cpp
   std::vector<int> boss(N);
   std::vector<int> height(N, 1);
   ```

4. Use a loop to initialize the `boss` vector instead of a separate loop:
   ```cpp
   std::iota(boss.begin(), boss.end(), 0);
   ```

5. Use a loop to process the queries instead of separate `if` conditions:
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
     scanf("%d %d %d", &command, &x, &y);
     if (command == 0) {
       unite(x, y);
     } else {
       printf("%d\n", is_same(x, y) ? 1 : 0);
     }
   }
   ```
