The given code implements a union-find data structure and performs a series of union and find operations based on the input commands. 

Here are the potential optimizations that can be made to improve the efficiency of the code:

1. Replace the recursive `get_boss` function with a loop:
   - The `get_boss` function uses recursion to find the representative of an element in the union-find data structure. However, this can be replaced with a loop to avoid the overhead of function calls.
   - By using a loop, we can iteratively update the parent pointer until we reach the representative element. This eliminates the need for recursive function calls.
   - This optimization reduces the function call overhead and improves the overall performance.

2. Use path compression during the `get_boss` operation:
   - Path compression is a technique used in union-find data structures to optimize the `find` operation.
   - During the `get_boss` operation, we can update the parent pointers of all the nodes on the path to directly point to the root (representative) element.
   - This optimization improves the running time of subsequent `get_boss` operations by reducing the height of the union-find tree.

3. Use union by rank during the `unite` operation:
   - Union by rank is another optimization technique used in union-find data structures to optimize the `union` operation.
   - The rank of a node represents an upper bound on the height of the corresponding tree.
   - During the `unite` operation, we can merge the smaller tree into the larger tree to maintain the balance of the union-find tree.
   - This optimization reduces the overall height of the union-find tree and improves the running time of subsequent `get_boss` operations.

4. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation:
   - The code currently uses dynamically allocated arrays for `boss` and `height`.
   - Since the size of `boss` and `height` is known at compile time, we can use static arrays instead of dynamically allocating memory.
   - This optimization reduces the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

Here is the optimized code with the above optimizations applied:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <queue>
#include <stack>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
typedef long long int ll;
#define BIG_NUM 2000000000
#define MOD 1000000007
#define EPS 0.000001
using namespace std;
const int MAX_N = 100000;

int N;
int boss[MAX_N], height[MAX_N];

int get_boss(int id) {
  int root = id;
  while (boss[root] != root) {
    root = boss[root];
  }
  
  // Path compression
  while (boss[id] != id) {
    int temp = boss[id];
    boss[id] = root;
    id = temp;
  }
  
  return root;
}

int is_same(int x, int y) {
  return get_boss(x) == get_boss(y);
}

void unite(int x, int y) {
  int boss_x = get_boss(x);
  int boss_y = get_boss(y);
  if (boss_x == boss_y)
    return;
  if (height[boss_x] > height[boss_y]) {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
  } else if (height[boss_x] < height[boss_y]) {
    boss[boss_x] = boss_y;
  } else {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
    height[boss_x]++;
  }
}

int main() {
  int Q, command, x, y;
  scanf("%d %d", &N, &Q);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    boss[i] = i;
    height[i] = 1;
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d %d", &command, &x, &y);
    if (command == 0) {
      unite(x, y);
    } else {
      if (is_same(x, y)) {
        printf("1\n");
      } else {
        printf("0\n");
      }
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code makes the following changes:

1. Replaced the recursive `get_boss` function with a loop.
2. Added path compression during the `get_boss` operation.
3. Added union by rank during the `unite` operation.
4. Replaced dynamically allocated arrays with static arrays.
5. Added comments to explain the optimizations made.

These optimizations improve the running time of the code by reducing the overhead of function calls, minimizing the height of the union-find tree, and avoiding unnecessary memory allocation.
