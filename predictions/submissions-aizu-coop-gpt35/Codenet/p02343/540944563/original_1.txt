The given code implements a disjoint-set data structure using the union-find algorithm. It reads a series of commands and performs the corresponding operations on a set of elements. The goal is to optimize the code for efficiency, reducing both running time and memory usage.

Let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant memory allocation: The code uses dynamically allocated arrays `boss` and `height` to store the parent and height information for each element. However, the size of these arrays is fixed and known at compile-time. Therefore, we can replace these arrays with static arrays or use vectors with a pre-allocated size to avoid the overhead of dynamic memory allocation.

2. Inefficient find operation: The `get_boss` function uses recursive calls to find the root parent of an element. This can lead to excessive function call overhead and unnecessary stack usage. We can optimize this by using path compression, which flattens the tree structure and reduces the height of each node, resulting in faster find operations.

3. Unnecessary check in `is_same` function: The `is_same` function calls `get_boss` twice to check if two elements have the same root parent. This is redundant since the `get_boss` function already performs this check. We can remove the `is_same` function and directly compare the results of `get_boss` in the main program.

4. Input/output operations: The code uses the `scanf` and `printf` functions for input/output. These functions can be slow, especially for large inputs. We can optimize this by using faster I/O functions such as `scanf` with format specifiers or `cin`/`cout` from the C++ standard library.

Based on the above analysis, let's proceed with the optimization strategy:

1. Replace dynamic memory allocation with static arrays or vectors with pre-allocated size.

2. Optimize the find operation by implementing path compression.

3. Remove the `is_same` function and directly compare the results of `get_boss` in the main program.

4. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with faster I/O functions.

Now, let's implement the optimizations step-by-step:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
typedef long long int ll;
#define BIG_NUM 2000000000
#define MOD 1000000007
#define EPS 0.000001
using namespace std;
int N;
vector<int> boss, height;
int get_boss(int id) {
  if (boss[id] == id)
    return id;
  else {
    boss[id] = get_boss(boss[id]); // Path compression
    return boss[id];
  }
}
void unite(int x, int y) {
  int boss_x = get_boss(x);
  int boss_y = get_boss(y);
  if (boss_x == boss_y)
    return;
  if (height[x] > height[y]) {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
  } else if (height[x] < height[y]) {
    boss[boss_x] = boss_y;
  } else {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
    height[x]++;
  }
}
int main() {
  int Q, command, x, y;
  cin >> N >> Q; // Faster I/O using cin
  boss.resize(N);
  height.resize(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    boss[i] = i;
    height[i] = 1;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    cin >> command >> x >> y; // Faster I/O using cin
    if (command == 0) {
      unite(x, y);
    } else {
      if (get_boss(x) == get_boss(y)) { // Compare the root parents directly
        cout << "1\n"; // Faster I/O using cout
      } else {
        cout << "0\n"; // Faster I/O using cout
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code:

1. Replaced `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` for faster input/output operations.

2. Replaced dynamic memory allocation with `vector` and used `resize` to allocate memory with a pre-defined size.

3. Implemented path compression in the `get_boss` function to optimize find operations.

4. Removed the `is_same` function and directly compared the result of `get_boss` in the main program.

These optimizations reduce the overhead of memory allocation, improve the efficiency of find operations, and use faster I/O functions for input/output operations.

The trade-off of these optimizations is increased code complexity due to the use of vectors and the implementation of path compression. However, these changes are minimal and do not significantly impact the overall code structure or readability.

Overall, these optimizations should result in improved running time and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
