Code Analysis:
- The code implements the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) algorithm using a graph representation.
- The LCA algorithm is used to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree.
- The code uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) to compute the LCA for each query.
- The code defines several data structures and aliases, such as `Edge`, `Edges`, `Graph`, `Array`, and `Matrix`, to represent the graph and its properties.
- The code also defines a `LowestCommonAncestor` class that encapsulates the LCA algorithm and provides an interface to compute the LCA for any pair of nodes.
- The code includes some utility functions, such as `chmax` and `chmin`, which are not used in the current context.
- The code uses macros for debugging purposes, but those macros are not relevant to the performance optimization task.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. Memory Usage: The code uses a lot of vector containers, which can consume a significant amount of memory for large inputs. The `Graph`, `Array`, and `Matrix` types are all defined as vectors, and they are used to represent the graph and its properties.
2. Recursive DFS: The LCA algorithm is implemented using a recursive depth-first search, which can be inefficient for large trees or deep recursion levels. Each query calls the DFS function recursively, leading to redundant computations and function call overhead.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace Vectors with Arrays: Replace the `Graph`, `Array`, and `Matrix` types with arrays to reduce memory usage. Since the sizes of these data structures are known in advance, using arrays can provide better memory efficiency compared to vectors.
2. Optimize DFS: Replace the recursive DFS implementation with an iterative version to eliminate the recursive function call overhead and reduce stack usage. This can improve the performance for large trees or deep recursion levels.
3. Use Loop Unrolling: Unroll the loops inside the LCA algorithm to reduce loop iteration overhead and improve cache locality.
4. Enable Compiler Optimizations: Enable compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and inline expansion, to let the compiler automatically optimize the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace Vectors with Arrays:
   - Replace the `Graph`, `Array`, and `Matrix` types with arrays by changing the typedefs to use arrays instead of vectors.
   - This change reduces the memory usage because arrays have a fixed size and do not incur the overhead of dynamic resizing like vectors.
   - Update the code to use array indexing instead of vector methods for accessing elements.
   - Make sure to update any code that relies on vector methods, such as `emplace_back`, to use array indexing instead.
   - This change may slightly increase the code complexity as array sizes need to be managed manually, but it significantly reduces memory usage.
2. Optimize DFS:
   - Replace the recursive DFS implementation with an iterative version to eliminate the overhead of recursive function calls and reduce stack usage.
   - Rewrite the `dfs` function to use a stack data structure instead of recursion.
   - Use a while loop to process the elements in the stack until the stack is empty.
   - This change reduces the function call overhead and allows for better performance with large trees or deep recursion levels.
3. Use Loop Unrolling:
   - Unroll the loops inside the LCA algorithm to reduce loop iteration overhead and improve cache locality.
   - Identify the loops that can benefit from unrolling and manually write out the loop iterations.
   - This change reduces the number of loop iterations and improves performance by reducing loop overhead and improving data locality.
4. Enable Compiler Optimizations:
   - Enable compiler optimizations to let the compiler automatically optimize the code.
   - This can be done by using compiler-specific pragmas or command-line options to enable optimizations.
   - Compiler optimizations can include loop unrolling, inline expansion, and other optimizations that can significantly improve code performance.
   - Enabling compiler optimizations can provide additional performance gains without modifying the code.
