Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify the following potential areas for optimization:

1. The `dfs` function in the `LowestCommonAncestor` struct is currently implemented recursively. Recursive function calls can be expensive in terms of both time and memory. We can optimize this function by implementing it iteratively using a stack.

2. The `get` function in the `LowestCommonAncestor` struct contains two nested loops. We can improve the efficiency of this function by using a binary search or another technique to reduce the number of iterations.

3. The code uses the `vector` container extensively. While `vector` is a convenient and versatile container, it may not always be the most efficient choice. We can analyze the usage of `vector` and consider alternative data structures that can provide better performance.

4. The code uses a custom `Edge` struct to represent edges in the graph. However, we only use the `s` and `d` members of the struct. We can modify the code to use a simpler representation of edges to reduce memory usage.
