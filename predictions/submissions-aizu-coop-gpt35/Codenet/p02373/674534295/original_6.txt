After analyzing the provided code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant computations in the LowestCommonAncestor class:
   - In the `dfs` function, the depth of each node is computed recursively. This can be optimized by passing the depth as a parameter and updating it in each recursive call.
   - The `get` function performs multiple iterations over the parent array to find the lowest common ancestor. This can be optimized by using a single loop and bitwise operations.

2. Inefficient memory usage:
   - The `parent` array in the LowestCommonAncestor class is initialized with the maximum possible size, even though it may not be fully utilized. This can be optimized by resizing the vector to the actual size required.

3. Lack of compiler optimizations:
   - The code does not include any compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. Adding appropriate compiler optimizations can improve the overall performance of the program.

Based on these observations, here is the step-by-step optimization strategy:

1. In the LowestCommonAncestor class:
   - Replace the recursive computation of depth in the `dfs` function with a parameterized approach.
   - Use a single loop and bitwise operations in the `get` function to find the lowest common ancestor.

2. Optimize memory usage:
   - Resize the `parent` vector in the LowestCommonAncestor class to the actual size required.

3. Add compiler optimizations:
   - Add appropriate compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now, let's implement these optimizations in the code:
