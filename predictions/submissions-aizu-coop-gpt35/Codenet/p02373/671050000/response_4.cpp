The given code implements the Heavy-Light Decomposition algorithm to solve the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) problem on a tree. The goal is to optimize the code for efficiency, with a focus on improving running time and minimizing memory usage.

Upon initial analysis, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant computation of the sizes of subtrees during the DFS traversal.
2. Redundant computation of the LCA path lengths.
3. Excessive use of vectors and resizing operations.
4. Unnecessary use of macros for loop iteration.

To optimize the code, the following steps can be taken:

1. Remove the unnecessary macros for loop iteration (`REP`, `FOR`, `EACH`) and replace them with regular `for` loops. This will make the code more readable and eliminate the need for additional macro expansion.

2. Replace the `vector<vector<int>>` data structure with a more memory-efficient data structure for representing the tree. Instead of storing the tree as an adjacency list of vectors, we can use a single vector to represent the tree as an array of parent indices. This will reduce the memory overhead and improve cache locality.

3. Eliminate the redundant computation of subtree sizes during the DFS traversal. Instead of storing the sizes in a separate `size` vector, we can calculate them on-the-fly during the traversal. This will save memory and eliminate the need for a separate vector.

4. Optimize the construction of the LCA path lengths. Instead of using a 2D vector (`len`) to store the lengths, we can use a single 1D vector to represent the path lengths. This will reduce memory usage and simplify the code.

5. Optimize the LCA computation by eliminating redundant iterations. Instead of iterating over the LCA paths twice, we can compute the LCA in a single iteration by finding the lowest common ancestor of the two given nodes. This will reduce the running time of the LCA computation.
