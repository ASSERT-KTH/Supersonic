Analysis:
- The code implements the Heavy-Light Decomposition algorithm to find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a tree.
- The main bottleneck in this code is the construction of the `len` vector, which stores the lengths of each path in the tree. This construction is done in the constructor of the `HeavyLight` class.
- The current implementation has a time complexity of O(N^2), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because for each path, it iterates over all 2*M elements of the `len` vector and sets their values to 0 or 1. This can be optimized to O(N) by using a more efficient approach.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Optimize `len` vector construction:
   - Instead of setting all the values of the `len` vector to 0 and 1, we can initialize them to 0 and then update only the necessary values to 1.
   - We can use a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the tree to compute the lengths of each path in a bottom-up manner.
   - During the DFS traversal, we can keep track of the current path and its size. Whenever we encounter a node, we can update the corresponding values in the `len` vector.
   - This approach reduces the time complexity of `len` vector construction from O(N^2) to O(N).

2. Compiler optimizations:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations to allow the compiler to perform optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and instruction reordering.
   - We can add compiler-specific pragmas or directives to guide the compiler's optimizations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Optimize `len` vector construction:
   - Remove the existing construction of the `len` vector in the constructor of the `HeavyLight` class.
   - Add a new private member function `computeLen()` in the `HeavyLight` class to compute the lengths of each path.
   - In the `computeLen()` function, initialize the `len` vector with the correct size and set all values to 0.
   - Perform a DFS traversal of the tree and update the `len` vector as follows:
     - When visiting a node, update the corresponding values in the `len` vector based on the current path and its size.
     - For each node, find its path root and path position.
     - Update the corresponding values in the `len` vector by adding 1 to the appropriate indices.
   - Call the `computeLen()` function in the constructor of the `HeavyLight` class to compute the `len` vector.

2. Compiler optimizations:
   - Add compiler-specific pragmas or directives to enable optimizations.
   - For example, if using GCC, add the following line at the beginning of the code: `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")`.
