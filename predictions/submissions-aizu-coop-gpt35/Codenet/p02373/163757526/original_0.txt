The provided code performs Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries on a tree using the Euler tour technique and a sparse table data structure. To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which contains a large number of standard library headers. This can lead to slower compilation times. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers, such as `<cstdio>`, `<vector>`, and `<cmath>`, to reduce the compilation time.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This practice is generally discouraged as it can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix to specify the standard library types and functions.

3. Optimize memory usage: The code uses a 2D array `ST[LOGN][MAXN << 1]` to store the sparse table. However, this array is much larger than necessary. We can reduce its size to `ST[LOGN][MAXN]` since the maximum number of nodes in the path is `MAXN`.

4. Use `vector` instead of arrays: The code uses arrays to store the adjacency list and the path. However, using `vector` can provide better memory management and avoid potential buffer overflows. We can replace `int adjList[MAXN]` with `vector<int> adjList[MAXN]`, `ii path[MAXN << 1]` with `vector<ii> path`, and `ii ST[LOGN][MAXN]` with `vector<vector<ii>> ST`.

5. Avoid redundant computations: The code currently performs two separate DFS calls to construct the Euler tour path. This results in redundant computations and can be optimized. We can modify the `dfs` function to compute the path and the index in the path simultaneously, eliminating the need for the `idx_in_path` array.

6. Use `emplace_back` for efficiency: Instead of using `push_back` to add elements to a vector, we can use `emplace_back` to construct the element in-place, reducing unnecessary copies.

7. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The code uses the `min` function to find the minimum element in the sparse table. However, we can directly compare the elements using the `<` operator, which avoids the function call overhead.

8. Optimize the LCA algorithm: The LCA algorithm can be optimized by avoiding the `swap` operation and using bit manipulation to calculate `p` (the highest power of 2 that divides `(r - l)`).

Taking these optimizations into account, the optimized code is as follows:
