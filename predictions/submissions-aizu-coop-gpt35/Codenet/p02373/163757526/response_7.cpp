Code Analysis:

1. The code defines several data structures and constants to represent a graph and perform Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries on it.
2. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) to construct an array `path` that stores the nodes visited during the traversal, along with their depths.
3. The LCA queries are answered using a sparse table `ST` that stores the minimum depth node in each range of the `path` array.
4. The code reads input from standard input and writes the LCA results to standard output.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:

1. Memory Usage: The code uses several large arrays (`path`, `adjList`, `ST`) that can occupy a significant amount of memory, especially for large input sizes.
2. Redundant Computations: The `path` array is constructed twice during the DFS traversal, resulting in unnecessary computations.
3. Data Structure Selection: The `adjList` vector is used to represent the graph, which may not be the most efficient data structure for this purpose.
4. Input/Output Operations: The code uses `printf` and `scanf` for input/output, which are slower than their C++ counterparts (`cout`, `cin`).

Optimization Strategy:

1. Improve Memory Usage:
   - Instead of using a vector (`adjList`) to represent the graph, we can use an array of vectors (`adjList[]`) to reduce memory overhead.
   - The `path` array can be reduced in size by using a bitmask to store the depths and nodes as a single value. This reduces the memory usage by half.
   - The `ST` array can be reduced in size by using a two-dimensional array of pairs (`ST[][]`) instead of a three-dimensional array. This reduces the memory usage by a factor of `LOGN`.

2. Eliminate Redundant Computations:
   - The `path` array is constructed twice during the DFS traversal. We can eliminate the second construction by adding the nodes directly to the `ST` array during the first traversal.

3. Optimize Loops:
   - The loop in the `build` function can be optimized by using a pre-calculated value of `h` instead of calling `ceil(log2(n + 1))` in each iteration.

4. Use C++ I/O Operations:
   - Replace the `scanf` and `printf` calls with the faster C++ I/O operations (`cin` and `cout`).
