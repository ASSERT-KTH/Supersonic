The given code is a C program that sorts a deck of cards using two different sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Selection Sort. The program reads the number of cards, the suit, and the value of each card from the input. It then sorts the cards using both sorting algorithms and prints the sorted cards along with the stability of the sorting algorithm.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified the following potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant Swap Function: The program includes a swap function `swap_Card` that is used to swap two cards. However, the functionality of this swap function is already provided by the temporary variable `temp` used in both sorting algorithms. This swap function is redundant and can be removed.

2. Inefficient Bubble Sort: The Bubble Sort algorithm used in the code has a time complexity of O(N^2), which is not efficient for large input sizes. We can optimize this algorithm to improve its performance.

3. Inefficient Selection Sort: The Selection Sort algorithm used in the code also has a time complexity of O(N^2). Although it is more efficient than Bubble Sort in terms of the number of swaps, it can still be further optimized.

4. Unnecessary Copying of Cards: The program creates and initializes two separate arrays `BC` and `SC` to store the cards. This duplication of data is unnecessary and can be avoided to reduce memory usage.

Based on these observations, here is the optimization strategy:

1. Remove the `swap_Card` function as it is redundant.
2. Optimize the Bubble Sort algorithm to reduce the number of comparisons and swaps.
3. Optimize the Selection Sort algorithm to reduce the number of comparisons and swaps.
4. Avoid duplicating the cards by using a single array and performing sorting operations on that array.
