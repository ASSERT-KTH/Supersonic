This code performs sorting on an array of cards using two different sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Selection Sort. The sorted arrays are then printed, along with an indication of whether the sorting algorithm is stable or not.

Let's analyze the code to identify potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. The `swap_Card` function is called within both the Bubble Sort and Selection Sort functions. This function can be optimized by removing it entirely and using direct assignments instead of swapping elements.

2. The Bubble Sort and Selection Sort functions use nested loops to iterate through the array. Both of these sorting algorithms have a time complexity of O(N^2), which can be quite inefficient for large input sizes. We can consider using a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as Quick Sort or Merge Sort, which have an average time complexity of O(N*logN).

3. The main function reads input from the user and stores the cards in two different arrays: `BC` and `SC`. However, there is no need to store the same cards in two separate arrays. We can optimize the memory usage by using a single array.

4. The `printf` function is called multiple times within the loops to print the sorted arrays. This can be optimized by storing the output in a buffer and printing it once at the end.

Based on these observations, here is an optimization strategy:

1. Remove the `swap_Card` function and replace it with direct assignments.
2. Replace the Bubble Sort and Selection Sort functions with a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as Quick Sort or Merge Sort.
3. Modify the main function to use a single array instead of two separate arrays.
4. Optimize the printing of the sorted arrays by storing the output in a buffer and printing it once at the end.
