The given program is a simple implementation of the Bubble Sort and Selection Sort algorithms to sort an array of Card structures. The Card structure represents a playing card with a suit and value.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. Redundant Code: The swap_Card() function is not being used in the main program. We can remove this function to avoid unnecessary function calls.

2. Inefficient Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort and Selection Sort are not the most efficient sorting algorithms for large arrays. We can consider replacing them with more efficient algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort.

3. Unnecessary Memory Usage: The program uses two separate arrays, BC and SC, to store the same set of cards. This consumes double the memory required. We can optimize this by using a single array and performing the sorting operations on a copy of the original array.

4. Unoptimized Loop Conditions: The loop conditions in the BubbleSort() and SelectionSort() functions can be optimized to reduce unnecessary iterations. In both functions, the inner loop can be terminated early if no swaps or minimum value changes occur.

5. Lack of Compiler Optimizations: The code does not include any compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. We can consider adding optimization flags or directives to improve the generated machine code.

Based on these observations, let's formulate an optimization strategy and propose the necessary changes to improve the performance and memory usage of the program.
