The provided code calculates the minimum gap between a given distance `d` and a target distance `e` using a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to `d`, while the inner loop iterates from the current value of the outer loop variable to `d`. For each iteration, the code calculates the distance `cost` using the Pythagorean theorem and then calculates the gap between `cost` and the target distance `e`. It keeps track of the minimum gap found so far and outputs it after the loop ends.

While the code correctly calculates the minimum gap, it can be optimized in several ways to improve its efficiency:

1. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code currently calculates the distance `cost` for all combinations of `i` and `j`, even if the sum of `i` and `j` is not equal to `d`. We can optimize this by only calculating `cost` when `i + j == d`.

2. Avoid unnecessary loop iterations: The inner loop currently starts from `i` and goes up to `d` for each value of the outer loop variable `i`. This results in redundant iterations and can be optimized by starting the inner loop from `d - i` instead.

3. Use integer arithmetic instead of floating-point: The code currently uses floating-point arithmetic to calculate the distances. Since the input values are integers, we can use integer arithmetic instead, which is generally faster.

4. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes `<map>`, `<string>`, and `<vector>` libraries, which are not used. We can remove these unnecessary includes to reduce compilation time.

Based on these optimizations, the following is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath> // Use <cmath> instead of <math.h>

int main() {
  int d, e;
  while (true) {
    std::cin >> d >> e;
    if (d == 0 && e == 0)
      break;

    int minGap = 100000;
    for (int i = 0; i <= d; i++) {
      for (int j = d - i; j <= d; j++) {
        if (i + j == d) {
          int cost = std::sqrt(i * i + j * j);
          int gap = std::abs(cost - e);
          if (gap < minGap) {
            minGap = gap;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    std::cout << minGap << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we avoid unnecessary calculations and loop iterations, use integer arithmetic instead of floating-point, and remove unnecessary includes. These changes should improve the efficiency of the code and reduce memory usage.

Please note that the optimized code may not drastically improve the performance, but it should be more efficient compared to the original code.
