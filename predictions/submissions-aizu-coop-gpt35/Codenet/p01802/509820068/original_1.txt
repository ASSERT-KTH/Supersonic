The provided code calculates the minimum distance between two points on a grid. The code reads two integers `d` and `e` from the user, and calculates the minimum distance between two points `(i, j)` on the grid, such that `i + j = d`. The distance is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.

Upon analysis, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code currently calculates the square root twice, once to calculate the distance `cost` and again to calculate the difference `gap`. Since we are only interested in comparing the distances, we can avoid the square root calculation by comparing the squared distances instead.

2. Optimize loop boundaries: The inner loop starts from `i` and goes up to `d`. However, since `i + j = d`, the inner loop can be optimized to start from `j` instead of `i`. This reduces the number of iterations and avoids redundant calculations.

3. Use a more efficient data structure: The code currently uses a `map` to store the distances and find the minimum. However, since we only need to track the minimum distance, we can use a variable to store the minimum distance directly.

4. Use `constexpr` for constant values: The value `100000` is a constant and can be declared as `constexpr` to allow the compiler to optimize its usage.

Taking these optimizations into consideration, the optimized code can be written as follows:
