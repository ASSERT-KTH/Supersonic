Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified a few areas where optimization can be applied:

1. Input/Output Functions: The code currently uses `scanf` and `cout` for input and output respectively. These functions can be slow for large inputs/outputs. Switching to faster input/output functions like `cin` and `printf` can improve performance.

2. Array Size: The array `A` is declared with a fixed size of 10001. This is unnecessary and can lead to wasted memory if `n` is smaller than 10001. We can dynamically allocate memory for array `A` based on the value of `n`.

3. Loop Unrolling: The loop `for (int i = min; i < 10001; i++)` can be optimized by unrolling the loop, which means executing multiple iterations of the loop body in each iteration of the loop. This can improve performance by reducing loop overhead.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to improve performance. For example, enabling optimization flags like `-O2` can help the compiler to perform optimizations like loop unrolling, constant propagation, and code inlining.

Based on these observations, I will now provide a step-by-step explanation of the proposed optimizations and the resulting optimized code.
