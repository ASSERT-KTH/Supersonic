The given code is a C++ program that takes an integer `n` as input, followed by `n` integers. It finds the minimum value among the input integers and then prints the minimum value followed by the remaining integers in non-decreasing order.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be proposed:

1. Replace the use of `bits/stdc++.h` with specific standard library headers: The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can significantly increase the compilation time and memory usage. Instead of including this header, it is better to include only the necessary standard library headers, such as `iostream`, `cstdio`, and `algorithm`.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std`: The `using namespace std` directive brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to potential naming conflicts and make the code less maintainable. It is better to explicitly qualify the names from the `std` namespace.

3. Replace the use of `r` macro with a traditional for loop: The `r` macro is defined to represent a for loop from 0 to n-1. However, using a macro can lead to code readability issues and make the code harder to understand. It is better to use a traditional for loop for better code readability.

4. Replace the use of `scanf` with `cin` and `cout` for input and output: The `scanf` function is a C-style input function that can be slower compared to `cin` in C++. Similarly, the `printf` function can be slower compared to `cout`. Therefore, it is better to use `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations.

5. Use a more efficient data structure for counting occurrences: The code uses an array `A` of size 10001 to count the occurrences of each input integer. However, this array is wasteful in terms of memory usage as it allocates memory for all possible integers, even if they are not present in the input. Instead, a more efficient data structure, such as `std::unordered_map` or `std::map`, can be used to store only the necessary occurrences.

6. Optimize the loop that prints the remaining integers: The loop that prints the remaining integers can be optimized by using the `std::fill_n` function or by directly assigning the values to the output stream using the `<<` operator. This avoids the need for an inner loop.

7. Optimize the loop that finds the minimum value: Instead of using a separate variable `min` to keep track of the minimum value, the minimum value can be found directly within the loop that reads the input integers.

Taking these optimizations into account, the optimized code is as follows:
