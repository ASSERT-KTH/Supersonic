First, let's analyze the provided code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down compilation time. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. The `#define r(i, n) for (auto i = 0; i < n; i++)` macro is used to define a simple loop. However, using macros can be error-prone and can lead to unexpected behavior. It is better to use regular loops instead.

3. The `scanf` function is used for input, which can be slower compared to other input methods like `cin`. However, the performance impact of this can be negligible in most cases.

4. The `A` array is used to count the frequency of each number. However, it is declared with a fixed size of 10001, regardless of the input size. This can waste memory and potentially lead to buffer overflow if the input size is larger than the array size.

Now let's define an optimization strategy to improve the code:

1. Replace the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header with the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Remove the macro `#define r(i, n) for (auto i = 0; i < n; i++)` and replace it with a regular loop.

3. Consider using `cin` instead of `scanf` for input.

4. Optimize the counting of frequencies by using a more efficient data structure, such as `std::vector` or `std::unordered_map`.

5. Avoid unnecessary computations, such as the subtraction of `A[min]` after finding the minimum value.

Now let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Replace the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header with the necessary headers:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
```

2. Remove the macro `#define r(i, n) for (auto i = 0; i < n; i++)` and replace it with a regular loop:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // loop body
}
```

3. Consider using `cin` instead of `scanf` for input:
```cpp
int n;
cin >> n;
```
Note: The performance difference between `cin` and `scanf` is generally negligible, so this step might not lead to significant optimization. However, using `cin` can improve code readability.

4. Optimize the counting of frequencies by using a more efficient data structure, such as `std::vector` or `std::unordered_map`:
```cpp
std::vector<int> freq(10001, 0); // Initialize a vector of size 10001 with all elements set to 0

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    freq[t]++;
}
```
This optimization replaces the fixed-size array `A` with a dynamically-sized vector `freq`. The vector is initialized with a size of 10001 and all elements set to 0. Then, we increment the frequency of each number as we read it from input.

5. Avoid unnecessary computations, such as the subtraction of `A[min]` after finding the minimum value:
```cpp
int min = 2000000;
int minIndex = -1; // Track the index of the minimum value

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    if (t < min) {
        min = t;
        minIndex = i;
    }
    freq[t]++;
}

// Decrement the frequency of the minimum value
freq[min]--;
```
Instead of subtracting `A[min]` after finding the minimum value, we track the index of the minimum value and use it to decrement the frequency directly in the `freq` vector.

Now let's put all the optimization steps together in the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    std::vector<int> freq(10001, 0);
    int min = 2000000;
    int minIndex = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int t;
        std::cin >> t;
        if (t < min) {
            min = t;
            minIndex = i;
        }
        freq[t]++;
    }

    freq[min]--;

    std::cout << min;
    for (int i = min; i < 10001; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < freq[i]; j++) {
            std::cout << ' ' << i;
        }
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code retains the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance and memory usage. It replaces the fixed-size array with a dynamically-sized vector, uses regular loops instead of macros, and avoids unnecessary computations.
