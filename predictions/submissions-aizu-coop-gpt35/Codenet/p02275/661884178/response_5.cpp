The given code is used to find the minimum element in an array and print the array in sorted order. However, there are several areas of improvement in terms of performance and memory usage. 

1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes a large number of unnecessary standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. Instead, include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` for input/output and `<vector>` for dynamic arrays.

2. Replace the `r(i, n)` macro with a simple `for` loop: The `r(i, n)` macro is used to iterate over a range from 0 to `n`. However, using a macro can make the code less readable and can potentially introduce bugs. It is better to use a traditional `for` loop instead.

3. Avoid using `auto` for loop variables: The `auto` keyword is used to automatically deduce the type of a variable based on its initializer. While this can be convenient, it can also lead to unexpected type deductions and potential performance overhead. It is better to explicitly declare the loop variable type.

4. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input/output: The `scanf` and `printf` functions from the C standard library are known for their slower performance compared to `std::cin` and `std::cout`. It is recommended to use the C++ I/O streams for better performance.

5. Use a more efficient data structure for counting frequencies: The current code uses a static array `A` to count the frequencies of the numbers. This approach requires a large fixed-size array and wastes memory if the input numbers are sparse. Instead, it is better to use a dynamic data structure like `std::vector` or `std::unordered_map` to store the frequencies.

6. Minimize the number of I/O operations: The code currently calls `std::cout` multiple times to print the sorted array elements. This can be slow, especially for large arrays. Instead, it is better to build a single string of the sorted array elements and then print it using a single `std::cout` call.

7. Use a more efficient sorting algorithm: The code currently relies on the frequencies of the numbers to print them in sorted order. However, this approach requires iterating over the frequencies multiple times, which can be inefficient. Instead, it is better to use a sorting algorithm like `std::sort` to directly sort the numbers.
