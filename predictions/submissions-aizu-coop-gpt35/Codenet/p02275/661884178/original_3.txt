Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is not recommended as it includes unnecessary headers. We should include only the required headers to minimize compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. The use of `r(i, n)` macro for the loop is unnecessary. We can use a standard for loop instead.

3. The use of `int min = 2000000` as the initial value for `min` is unnecessary and can be replaced with `INT_MAX`.

4. The use of `A[10001]{}` to initialize the array `A` is unnecessary. We can initialize it later when we know the value of `n`.

5. The use of `scanf` can be replaced with `cin` for input and `cout` can be replaced with `printf` for output. This can improve the I/O performance.

6. The loop `for (int i = min; i < 10001; i++)` can be optimized to start from `min + 1` since we have already printed `min` outside the loop.

7. The loop `r(j, A[i])` can be optimized by using a while loop instead of a for loop.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps one by one:

1. Remove the unnecessary header and replace it with the required headers:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>
```

2. Replace the `r(i, n)` macro with a standard for loop:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
```

3. Replace the initial value of `min` with `INT_MAX`:
```cpp
int min = INT_MAX;
```

4. Remove the unnecessary initialization of `A` and initialize it later:
```cpp
int A[10001] = {0};
```

5. Replace `scanf` and `cout` with `cin` and `printf` respectively:
```cpp
int n;
cin >> n;
int min = INT_MAX, t, A[10001] = {0};
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  cin >> t;
  if (t < min)
    min = t;
  A[t]++;
}
A[min]--;
printf("%d", min);
for (int i = min + 1; i < 10001; i++) {
  int j = A[i];
  while (j--) {
    printf(" %d", i);
  }
}
printf("\n");
```

With these optimizations, we have improved the efficiency of the code by removing unnecessary headers, macros, and initializations. We have also replaced the I/O operations for better performance. The optimized code is now more readable and efficient while preserving the functionality and output of the original code.
