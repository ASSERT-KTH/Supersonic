After analyzing the provided code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structures: The code uses arrays to store the values of `A` and `D`. However, since the size of these arrays is known at compile-time, it would be more efficient to use `std::vector` instead.

2. Redundant computation: The code computes the average of `east` and `A[j]` multiple times within the loop. This calculation can be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant computation.

3. Inefficient loop: The loop that computes the value of `t` for the east direction iterates from `people[i] + 1` to `N-1`. However, since the value of `east` is updated within the loop, we can break out of the loop as soon as `D[j] == 1` is encountered.

4. Unnecessary loop: The loop that computes the value of `t` for the west direction iterates from `people[i] - 1` to `0`. However, this loop can be avoided by initializing `west` to `A[people[i]]` and updating it within the loop only when `D[j] == 0`.

5. Compiler optimizations: Adding compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or compiler directives, can potentially improve the performance of the code. However, the effectiveness of these optimizations may vary depending on the specific compiler and target architecture.
