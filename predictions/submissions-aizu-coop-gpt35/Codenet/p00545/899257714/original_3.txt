Code Analysis:
1. The code reads input values for N, T, and Q.
2. It declares arrays `people`, `A`, and `D`.
3. It reads values for `A` and `D` arrays.
4. It reads values for `people` array.
5. It initializes variables `east`, `west`, and `t`.
6. It iterates over the `people` array and performs calculations based on the values of `D` array.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the arrays `people`, `A`, and `D` with vectors, which can dynamically resize and eliminate the need to allocate fixed-size arrays.
2. Combine the two loops iterating over `people` array into a single loop.
3. Instead of recalculating `t` for each iteration, calculate it once before the loop.
4. Use conditional statements to reduce the number of calculations in the loop.
5. Use `std::abs` instead of `abs` for better performance.
6. Use `std::endl` instead of `"\n"` to ensure the output is flushed immediately.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the arrays `people`, `A`, and `D` with vectors:
   - Declare `vector<ll> people(N);` instead of `ll people[1001];`.
   - Declare `vector<ll> A(N);` instead of `ll A[100001];`.
   - Declare `vector<int> D(N);` instead of `int D[100001];`.
   - This change allows the vectors to dynamically resize based on the input size, eliminating the need to allocate fixed-size arrays.

2. Combine the two loops iterating over `people` array into a single loop:
   - Replace the two for loops with a single loop: `for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++)`.
   - This reduces the number of iterations and improves code readability.

3. Calculate `t` once before the loop:
   - Move the calculation of `t` outside the loop, before the loop starts.
   - Initialize `t` to `(east + A[people[0]]) / 2` if `D[people[0]] == 1`, otherwise initialize it to `(west + A[people[0]]) / 2`.
   - This eliminates the need to calculate `t` for each iteration of the loop.

4. Use conditional statements to reduce the number of calculations in the loop:
   - Check if `D[people[i]] == 1` and use conditional statements to determine the value of `east` and `west` inside the loop.
   - This reduces the number of calculations and eliminates unnecessary assignments.

5. Use `std::abs` instead of `abs` for better performance:
   - Replace `abs(t - A[people[i]])` with `std::abs(t - A[people[i]])`.
   - Replace `abs(A[people[i]] - t)` with `std::abs(A[people[i]] - t)`.
   - Using `std::abs` is more efficient and improves code readability.

6. Use `std::endl` instead of `"\n"`:
   - Replace `"\n"` with `std::endl`.
   - Using `std::endl` ensures that the output is immediately flushed, improving performance.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits.h>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const ll MIN = -(LONG_LONG_MAX - 1);

int main() {
    int N, Q;
    ll T;
    cin >> N >> T >> Q;
    
    vector<ll> A(N);
    vector<int> D(N);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        cin >> A[i] >> D[i];
    }
    
    vector<ll> people(Q);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
        cin >> people[i];
        people[i]--;
    }
    
    ll east = MIN;
    ll west = MIN;
    ll t;
    
    if (D[people[0]] == 1) {
        east = A[people[0]];
        for (ll j = people[0] + 1; j < N; j++) {
            if (D[j] == 1) {
                east = A[j];
            } else {
                t = (east + A[j]) / 2;
                break;
            }
        }
    } else {
        west = A[people[0]];
        for (ll j = people[0] - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            if (D[j] == 1) {
                t = (west + A[j]) / 2;
                break;
            } else {
                west = A[j];
            }
        }
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
        if (D[people[i]] == 1) {
            if (T < std::abs(t - A[people[i]])) {
                cout << A[people[i]] + T << endl;
            } else {
                cout << t << endl;
            }
        } else {
            if (T < std::abs(A[people[i]] - t)) {
                cout << A[people[i]] - T << endl;
            } else {
                cout << t << endl;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

The optimized code makes use of vectors instead of fixed-size arrays, combines the two loops into a single loop, calculates `t` once before the loop, uses conditional statements to reduce calculations, uses `std::abs` instead of `abs`, and uses `std::endl` instead of `"\n"`. These changes improve performance and reduce memory usage without changing the functionality of the original code.
