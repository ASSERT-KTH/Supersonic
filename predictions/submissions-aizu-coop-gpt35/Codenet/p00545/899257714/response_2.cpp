Upon analyzing the provided code, we can identify several potential optimizations:

1. Avoiding unnecessary memory usage: The `people` array can be avoided altogether. We can directly iterate over the given `Q` queries and calculate the result for each query.

2. Reducing unnecessary computations: The current code has unnecessary iterations in both the east and west loops. We can optimize these loops to eliminate unnecessary iterations.

3. Avoiding redundant calculations: The code performs the same calculation multiple times in different parts of the code. We can store the calculated value in a variable and reuse it to avoid redundant calculations.

4. Using appropriate data types: The code uses `long long` for array indexing and loop variables, which is unnecessary. We can use `int` instead.

Based on these observations, we can now proceed with the optimization strategy:

1. Remove the `people` array and directly iterate over the queries.

2. Optimize the east loop by:
   - Initializing `j` to `people[i] + 1` instead of 0.
   - Modifying the loop condition to `j < N && D[j] != 1`.
   - Breaking the loop as soon as we find a `D[j] != 1`.

3. Optimize the west loop by:
   - Initializing `j` to `people[i] - 1` instead of `N-1`.
   - Modifying the loop condition to `j >= 0 && D[j] != 1`.
   - Breaking the loop as soon as we find a `D[j] != 1`.

4. Store the result of `(east + A[j]) / 2` in a variable `t` to avoid redundant calculations.
