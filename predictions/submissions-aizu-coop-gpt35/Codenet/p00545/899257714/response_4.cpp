The provided code appears to be solving a problem related to finding the closest meeting point between two people who are walking towards each other. However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized for better performance and memory usage.

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The arrays `A` and `D` are used to store the positions and directions of the people, respectively. However, these arrays are unnecessarily large and can be reduced in size based on the input values of `N` and `Q`. The size of these arrays can be changed to `N` instead of `100001` and `D` can be changed to `bool` instead of `int` since it only takes two possible values.
   - The array `people` is used to store the indices of the people for whom the meeting point needs to be calculated. Similar to the previous arrays, its size can be reduced to `Q` instead of `1001`.

2. Redundant or Unnecessary Computations:
   - The calculation of `MIN` is not necessary since the minimum value of `long long` can be obtained using `LLONG_MIN` from `<limits.h>`.
   - The calculation of `abs(t - A[people[i]])` and `abs(A[people[i]] - t)` can be avoided by checking if `T` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `t` and `A[people[i]]`. This can be done using a single condition instead of two separate conditions.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The inner loop that searches for the next meeting point, starting from `people[i] + 1` or `people[i] - 1`, can be optimized by using a while loop instead of a for loop. This allows us to directly break out of the loop when the meeting point is found, instead of looping through the remaining elements.
   - The outer loop that iterates over the `Q` queries can be optimized by using a range-based for loop instead of indexing each query.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - The use of compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and auto-vectorization, can be helpful. These optimizations can be enabled using pragmas or compiler flags specific to the compiler being used.
