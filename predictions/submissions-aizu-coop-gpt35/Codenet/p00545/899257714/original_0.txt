The given code appears to be a program that calculates the expected arrival time for a group of people traveling east or west. The program takes as input the number of people (N), the time (T), and the number of queries (Q). It then reads the arrival time (A) and direction (D) for each person. Finally, it calculates and outputs the expected arrival time for each query.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary Memory Usage: The arrays `people`, `A`, and `D` are allocated with fixed sizes (1001 and 100001). However, the actual number of elements used may be smaller than these sizes. This leads to inefficient memory usage. We can improve this by dynamically allocating memory based on the input size.

2. Redundant Calculations: The calculation `(east + A[j]) / 2` and `(west + A[j]) / 2` are repeated multiple times within the loops. We can optimize this by calculating the average once and reusing it.

3. Loop Optimization: The loops used to find the previous and next arrivals for each person can be optimized. Currently, the loops iterate through each person sequentially. We can optimize this by using binary search to find the previous and next arrivals in logarithmic time complexity.

4. Compiler Optimization: We can suggest compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling, to improve the performance of the loops.

Now, let's proceed with step-by-step optimization of the code.
