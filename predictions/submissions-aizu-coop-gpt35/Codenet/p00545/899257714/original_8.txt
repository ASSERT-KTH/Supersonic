Upon analyzing the provided code, the following potential optimizations and improvements can be made:

1. Unnecessary Variables: The variables `east` and `west` are not required. They are only used to store the values of `A[people[i]]` and are not used further in the code. We can directly use `A[people[i]]` instead.

2. Loop Optimization: The inner loops in the code can be optimized. Instead of iterating through all the elements from `people[i] + 1` to `N` and from `people[i] - 1` to `0`, we can break out of the loop once the condition is satisfied. This will avoid unnecessary iterations and improve performance.

3. Compiler Optimization: We can suggest the compiler to optimize the code by using compiler optimizations or pragma directives. For example, we can use `-O3` flag during compilation to enable maximum optimization level.

Based on these observations, let's optimize the code step by step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const ll MIN = -(LONG_LONG_MAX - 1);

int main() {
  int N, Q;
  ll T;
  cin >> N >> T >> Q;
  ll people[1001];
  ll A[100001];
  int D[100001];

  // Input
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> A[i] >> D[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    cin >> people[i];
    people[i]--;
  }

  // Process queries
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    ll t = A[people[i]]; // Initialize t with the current person's position

    if (D[people[i]] == 1) {
      // East direction
      for (ll j = people[i] + 1; j < N; j++) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          t = A[j]; // Update t with the latest east position
        } else {
          t = (t + A[j]) / 2; // Calculate the midpoint
          break;
        }
      }

      if (T < abs(t - A[people[i]])) {
        cout << A[people[i]] + T << endl;
      } else {
        cout << t << endl;
      }
    } else {
      // West direction
      for (ll j = people[i] - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          t = (t + A[j]) / 2; // Calculate the midpoint
          break;
        } else {
          t = A[j]; // Update t with the latest west position
        }
      }

      if (T < abs(A[people[i]] - t)) {
        cout << A[people[i]] - T << endl;
      } else {
        cout << t << endl;
      }
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code:
- The unnecessary variables `east` and `west` have been removed.
- The inner loops have been optimized to break out early when the condition is satisfied.
- Compiler optimizations or pragma directives have not been explicitly mentioned, but they can be enabled during compilation using the `-O3` flag.

These optimizations improve the performance of the code by reducing unnecessary iterations and eliminating unnecessary variables. The code complexity remains the same, and the functionality and output of the original code are preserved.
