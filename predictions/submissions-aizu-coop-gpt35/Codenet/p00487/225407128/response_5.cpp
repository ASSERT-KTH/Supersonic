The given code calculates the maximum number of elements that can be selected from two arrays `a` and `b` according to certain conditions. However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized for better performance and reduced memory usage.

1. Eliminate unnecessary data structures: The code uses an array `p` of pairs to store elements from array `a` along with their indices. This array is sorted and then used to calculate the sum. Instead of using this additional array, we can directly use array `a` and its indices to achieve the same result.

2. Avoid redundant computations: The code checks for the condition `if (!use[p[id].sc])` multiple times in different loops. This condition can be checked once and the result can be stored in a temporary variable for reuse.

3. Optimize loops: The code uses three nested loops to iterate over the arrays `b` and `p`. By optimizing these loops, we can reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

4. Use compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. This can further improve the performance of the program.
