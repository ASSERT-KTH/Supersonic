The given code calculates the number of ways to reach a certain value by performing addition or subtraction operations on a given set of numbers. The goal is to optimize this code for efficiency by identifying and addressing any potential performance bottlenecks or memory inefficiencies.

Let's analyze the code to identify areas for optimization:

1. The `dp` array is initialized in a nested loop, which has a time complexity of O(100*20) = O(2000). This can be optimized by using `memset` to initialize the array to zero in a single step, which has a time complexity of O(1).

2. The `dp` array is of size 110x21, even though we only need to store values up to N. This can be optimized by reducing the size of the `dp` array to Nx21.

3. The outer loop in the second nested loop runs until N-1, which is incorrect. It should run until N. This is a bug in the code.

4. The `dp` array is unnecessarily storing values for all possible sums from 0 to 20, even though we only need to calculate the number of ways to reach the sum equal to `a[N]`. This can be optimized by reducing the size of the `dp` array to Nx(2*a[N]+1), where 2*a[N]+1 is the maximum possible sum value.

Now, let's formulate an optimization strategy based on the identified areas for improvement:

1. Optimize the initialization of the `dp` array using `memset`.
2. Reduce the size of the `dp` array to Nx(2*a[N]+1).
3. Correct the loop condition in the second nested loop.
4. Remove unnecessary calculations by only considering the sum equal to `a[N]` in the final result.
