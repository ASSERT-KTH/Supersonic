Code Analysis:
1. The code implements a dynamic programming algorithm to solve a problem involving an array `a` and a 2D array `dp`.
2. The array `a` stores N integers as input.
3. The array `dp` is used to store intermediate results of the dynamic programming algorithm.
4. The code initializes `dp` to 0 for all indices (i, j) where 0 <= i <= 100 and 0 <= j <= 20.
5. The code then populates `dp` using a nested loop.
6. Finally, the code prints the result stored in `dp[N - 1][a[N]]`.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a more efficient data structure to store the intermediate results of the dynamic programming algorithm.
2. Simplify the nested loop by removing unnecessary computations.
3. Consider compiler optimizations or pragma directives to further optimize the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the 2D array `dp` with a 1D array `dp` of size 21. This is because `dp[i][j]` only depends on `dp[i-1][j-a[i]]` and `dp[i-1][j+a[i]]`, which means we only need to store the results for the previous row.
2. Initialize `dp` to 0 for all indices (j) where 0 <= j <= 20.
3. Iterate over `a` from 1 to N and for each element `a[i]`, iterate over `dp` from 0 to 20.
4. In the inner loop, update `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - a[i]]` and `dp[j + a[i]]` if the indices are within the range of 0 to 20.
5. Use a temporary array `temp` to store the updated values of `dp` for each iteration of `a`.
6. After the inner loop completes, copy the values from `temp` back to `dp` for the next iteration of `a`.
7. Finally, print the result stored in `dp[a[N]]`.

Trade-offs:
1. By using a more efficient data structure and removing unnecessary computations, the code should be able to run faster and use less memory.
2. However, the code becomes slightly more complex due to the need for a temporary array to store updated values of `dp`.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int a[101];
long long dp[21];

int main() {
  int N;
  cin >> N;

  for (int j = 0; j <= 20; j++) {
    dp[j] = 0;
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }

  dp[a[1]] = 1;

  for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
    long long temp[21] = {0};

    for (int j = 0; j <= 20; j++) {
      if (j - a[i] >= 0)
        temp[j] += dp[j - a[i]];
      if (j + a[i] <= 20)
        temp[j] += dp[j + a[i]];
    }

    for (int j = 0; j <= 20; j++) {
      dp[j] = temp[j];
    }
  }

  cout << dp[a[N]] << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, the main changes are:
1. The 2D array `dp` is replaced with a 1D array `dp` of size 21.
2. The initialization of `dp` is moved outside the loop iterating over `i`.
3. The inner loop now updates a temporary array `temp` instead of directly updating `dp`.
4. After the inner loop completes, the values from `temp` are copied back to `dp`.
5. The final result is printed using `dp[a[N]]`.

These changes simplify the code and reduce unnecessary memory usage, resulting in improved performance.
