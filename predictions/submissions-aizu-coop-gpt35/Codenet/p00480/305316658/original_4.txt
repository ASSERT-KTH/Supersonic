The provided code calculates the number of ways to reach a certain sum by adding or subtracting the elements of the input array `a`. The results are stored in the `dp` array. The code uses dynamic programming to build up the solution incrementally.

Upon analyzing the code, a few potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage can be identified:

1. The `dp` array is initialized to zero in a nested loop. This initialization is unnecessary since the array will be fully populated during the subsequent calculations.

2. The outer loop in the second nested loop iterates up to `N-1`, but the inner loop iterates up to 20. This is unnecessary since the valid indices of `dp` are from 0 to 20. This can be fixed by changing the condition of the inner loop to `j <= a[i]`.

To optimize the code, we can follow these steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary initialization of the `dp` array.

2. Modify the condition of the inner loop to `j <= a[i]`.

3. Loop unrolling: Since the inner loop only iterates from 0 to `a[i]`, we can manually unroll the loop to avoid the overhead of loop control.

4. Use a single-dimensional array instead of a two-dimensional array to store the results. This will reduce memory usage.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 101;
const int MAX_SUM = 21;

int a[MAX_N];
long long dp[MAX_SUM];

int main() {
  int N;
  cin >> N;

  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }

  dp[a[1]] = 1;

  for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = a[i]; j >= 0; j--) {
      dp[j] += dp[j - a[i]];
    }
    for (int j = 0; j <= a[i]; j++) {
      dp[j] += dp[j + a[i]];
    }
  }

  cout << dp[a[N]] << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

The optimizations made in this code include:
1. Removing unnecessary initialization of the `dp` array.
2. Modifying the condition of the inner loop to `j <= a[i]`.
3. Loop unrolling by splitting the inner loop into two separate loops.
4. Using a single-dimensional array `dp` instead of a two-dimensional array.

These optimizations reduce the number of iterations and unnecessary computations, resulting in improved performance and reduced memory usage.
