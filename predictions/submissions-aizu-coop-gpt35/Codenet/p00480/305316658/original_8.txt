The given code implements a dynamic programming algorithm to solve a problem related to counting the number of ways to reach a certain value using addition and subtraction operations. The code uses a 2D array `dp` to store the intermediate results.

Upon analysis, the following optimizations can be proposed:

1. **Reduce the size of the array `dp`**: The array `dp` is currently declared as `long long dp[110][21]`, which is larger than necessary for the given problem. Since the maximum value of `N` is given as an input, we can reduce the size of `dp` to `dp[N][21]`.

2. **Use `memset` to initialize the array**: Instead of manually initializing each element of `dp` to zero using nested loops, we can use the `memset` function to initialize the entire array to zero in a more efficient manner.

3. **Optimize the inner loop**: The inner loop iterates from 0 to 20, but it can be optimized to iterate only over the possible values of `j` based on the current element `a[i]`. By calculating the minimum and maximum possible values of `j` based on `a[i]`, we can reduce the number of iterations in the inner loop.

4. **Optimize the loop bounds**: The loop `for (i = 2; i < N; i++)` should be changed to `for (i = 2; i <= N; i++)` to include the last element of the input array `a`.

5. **Consider compiler optimizations**: We can use compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize the code. For example, we can use `-O3` optimization level and `#pragma GCC optimize` to enable compiler optimizations.

Let's now implement these optimizations step-by-step in the code.
