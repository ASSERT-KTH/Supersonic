This code appears to be solving a problem related to subarray sums. However, there are several areas where performance optimizations can be made:

1. Inefficient data structures:
   - The `sum` array is used to store the cumulative sum of elements in the `A` array. However, it is not necessary to store all the cumulative sums. Only the necessary cumulative sums for each subarray need to be stored.

2. Redundant computations:
   - The `calc` function calls the `Find` function for each position in the array. However, the `Find` function performs redundant calculations for each position, leading to unnecessary overhead.

3. Inefficient loop structure:
   - The `calc` function uses a simple loop structure to iterate over each position in the array. However, this can be optimized further by using a sliding window approach, which eliminates the need for the `Find` function altogether.

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - The code does not currently use any compiler optimizations or pragma directives. Enabling compiler optimizations can help generate more efficient machine code.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step.

Step 1: Efficient data structure
The `sum` array is currently used to store all the cumulative sums of the `A` array. However, we can optimize this by only storing the necessary cumulative sums for each subarray. This can be achieved by using two pointers to keep track of the current subarray.

Step 2: Redundant computations
The `Find` function is called for each position in the array, leading to redundant calculations. To avoid this, we can modify the `calc` function to use a sliding window approach. This involves maintaining two pointers, `start` and `end`, which represent the start and end of the current subarray. We can then update the subarray sum by subtracting the element at `start` and adding the element at `end`. This eliminates the need for the `Find` function.

Step 3: Efficient loop structure
By using the sliding window approach, we can optimize the loop structure in the `calc` function. Instead of iterating over each position in the array, we can use a single loop that iterates from `0` to `2 * N - 1`. This eliminates the need for the outer loop in the original code.

Step 4: Compiler optimizations
To enable compiler optimizations, we can use the `#pragma` directive to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. In this case, we can use `#pragma GCC optimize` to enable optimizations for the binary search in the main loop.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;
const int64 INF = 1LL << 58;

bool calc(int N, int* A, int64 size) {
  int64 subarray_sum = 0;
  int start = 0, end = 0;
  
  while (end < 2 * N) {
    subarray_sum += A[end];
    
    if (end >= N) {
      subarray_sum -= A[start];
      start++;
    }
    
    if (subarray_sum >= size)
      return true;
    
    end++;
  }
  
  return false;
}

int main() {
  int N;
  scanf("%d", &N);
  
  int A[200000];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    scanf("%d", A + i);
    A[N + i] = A[i];
  }
  
  int64 low = 0, high = INF;
  
  #pragma GCC optimize("O3")
  while (high != low) {
    int64 mid = (low + high + 1) >> 1;
    
    if (calc(N, A, mid))
      low = mid;
    else
      high = mid - 1;
  }
  
  printf("%lld\n", low);
}
```

This optimized code eliminates unnecessary memory usage, reduces redundant computations, and improves the loop structure. Additionally, it enables compiler optimizations to improve the performance further.
