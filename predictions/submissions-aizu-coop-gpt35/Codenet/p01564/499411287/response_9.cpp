To optimize the given code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Memory Usage: The code uses several data structures that may be inefficient in terms of memory usage. For example, the `vector<int>` data structure is used extensively throughout the code. We can consider replacing it with more memory-efficient alternatives, such as arrays or bitsets, where applicable.

2. Redundant Computations: The code performs several redundant computations, such as repeatedly calculating the size of arrays and vectors. We can eliminate these redundant computations by storing the sizes in variables and reusing them where necessary.

3. Loop Optimization: There are several loops in the code that can potentially be optimized. For example, the `dfs()` function uses a loop to iterate over the elements of a vector. We can consider unrolling this loop to reduce the overhead of loop control.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest the use of compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. For example, we can use optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to enable high-level optimizations.

Now, let's go through the optimization steps one by one.

Step 1: Memory Usage Optimization
- Replace the `vector<int>` data structure with arrays or bitsets, where applicable. For example, we can replace `vector<int> g[N]` with `int g[N][MAX_SIZE]` or `bitset<MAX_SIZE> g[N]` to save memory.

Step 2: Redundant Computations
- Store the sizes of arrays and vectors in variables and reuse them where necessary. For example, instead of repeatedly calculating `sz[p]` in the `dfs_sz()` function, we can store it in a variable and reuse it in the loop.
- Instead of using `tie()` to extract values from tuples, we can directly access the elements using `.first` and `.second` to avoid unnecessary function calls.

Step 3: Loop Optimization
- Consider unrolling the loop in the `dfs()` function to reduce the overhead of loop control. This can be done by manually expanding the loop body and removing unnecessary loop variables.

Step 4: Compiler Optimizations
- Use compiler optimizations flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to enable high-level optimizations. This will allow the compiler to optimize the code based on its understanding of the program.
