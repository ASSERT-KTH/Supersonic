## Code Analysis

The given code is a C++ program that solves a problem using a data structure called a Heavy-Light Decomposition Tree. The main goal of the code is to perform queries on a tree structure efficiently. The program reads inputs from the standard input, performs the required operations, and outputs the results to the standard output.

Here are some observations about the code:

1. The code includes a lot of unnecessary header files. We should remove the unnecessary ones to improve compilation time.
2. The `Tree` struct represents a binary tree node and contains various attributes related to the node.
3. The `Tree` class has a static `merge` function that merges two `Node` objects.
4. The `Tree` class has a `push` function that propagates changes from the parent node to its children.
5. The `HLComp_Y` struct represents the Heavy-Light Decomposition Tree and contains various data structures and functions related to it.
6. The `HLComp_Y` struct has a `dfs_sz` function that calculates the size of each subtree in the tree.
7. The `HLComp_Y` struct has a `dfs` function that performs a depth-first search on the tree and constructs the Heavy-Light Decomposition Tree.
8. The `HLComp_Y` struct has a `path_set` function that updates the values of a path in the tree.
9. The `HLComp_Y` struct has a `path_get` function that retrieves the values of a path in the tree.
10. The `main2` function is the main logic of the program and performs the required operations based on the inputs.
11. The `main` function sets up the stack space and calls `main2`.

## Optimization Strategy

Based on the analysis, here is the optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files to improve compilation time.
2. Optimize the `merge` function in the `Tree` class to reduce unnecessary object copies.
3. Optimize the `push` function in the `Tree` class to avoid unnecessary function calls and object copies.
4. Optimize the `set` and `get` functions in the `Tree` class to avoid unnecessary recursion and object copies.
5. Optimize the `path_set` and `path_get` functions in the `HLComp_Y` struct to avoid unnecessary function calls and object copies.
6. Optimize the input and output functions to improve their performance.
7. Remove the unnecessary stack setup and cleanup in the `main` function.

Let's now go step by step and implement these optimizations.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. Remove unnecessary header files

The following header files are not used in the code and can be removed:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <cassert>
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <valarray>
```

### 2. Optimize the `merge` function

The `merge` function in the `Tree` class can be optimized to reduce unnecessary object copies. Currently, it creates a new `Node` object to store the result of the merge. Instead, we can modify the `merge` function to take a reference to the result `Node` object and update its attributes directly. This will eliminate the need for creating a new `Node` object and copying the values.

Here's the optimized `merge` function:

```cpp
static void merge(const Node& l, const Node& r, Node& res) {
  if (l.sz == 0) {
    res = r;
    return;
  }
  if (r.sz == 0) {
    res = l;
    return;
  }
  res.sz = l.sz + r.sz;
  res.sm = l.sm + r.sm;
  res.lsm = max(l.lsm, l.sm + r.lsm);
  res.rsm = max(r.rsm, r.sm + l.rsm);
  res.ma = max(max(l.ma, r.ma), l.rsm + r.lsm);
  res.mv = max(l.mv, r.mv);
}
```

### 3. Optimize the `push` function

The `push` function in the `Tree` class can be optimized to avoid unnecessary function calls and object copies. Currently, it checks if the node has children and then calls `lzdata` on the children. Instead, we can directly call `lzdata` on the children without the if condition. This will eliminate the need for checking the condition and reduce function call overhead.

Here's the optimized `push` function:

```cpp
void push() {
  if (n.sz == 1) {
    return;
  }
  l->lzdata(n.lz);
  r->lzdata(n.lz);
  n.lzf = false;
}
```

### 4. Optimize the `set` and `get` functions

The `set` and `get` functions in the `Tree` class can be optimized to avoid unnecessary recursion and object copies. Currently, the functions recursively call themselves for the left and right subtrees. Instead, we can modify the functions to use a loop and maintain a stack of nodes to process. This will eliminate the need for recursion and reduce function call overhead. Additionally, we can pass the result `Node` object by reference to avoid unnecessary object copies.

Here are the optimized `set` and `get` functions:

```cpp
void set(int a, int b, int x) {
  if (b <= 0 || n.sz <= a) {
    return;
  }
  vector<pair<Tree*, int>> stack;
  stack.push_back(make_pair(this, 0));

  while (!stack.empty()) {
    auto& [node, offset
