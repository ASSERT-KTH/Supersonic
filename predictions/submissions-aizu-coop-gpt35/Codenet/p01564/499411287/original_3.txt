Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The code uses an array of vectors (`g[N]`) to represent a graph. This data structure is not efficient for graph operations, such as adding edges and finding neighbors.
   - The code uses a `vector` of `int` (`buf`) to temporarily store data during the construction of the `Tree` structure. This can lead to unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `merge` function is called multiple times with the same arguments, which can result in redundant computations.

3. Inefficient Memory Usage:
   - The `Tree` structure stores a pointer to its left and right subtrees (`NP l, r`). This can lead to excessive memory usage for large trees.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - The code does not include any compiler optimization flags or directives, which can limit the compiler's ability to optimize the code.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the array of vectors (`g[N]`) with a more efficient graph representation, such as an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix.

2. Replace the `vector` of `int` (`buf`) with a fixed-size array to avoid unnecessary memory allocations.

3. Optimize the `merge` function to avoid redundant computations.

4. Refactor the `Tree` structure to use a more memory-efficient representation, such as a flat array.

5. Add compiler optimization flags or directives to enable compiler optimizations.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization:

1. Replace the array of vectors (`g[N]`) with an adjacency list:
   - Instead of using `vector<int> g[N]`, we can define a `vector<vector<int>> g` to represent the graph.
   - This avoids unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations for the array of vectors.
   - The `add` function can be updated as follows:

```cpp
void add(int a, int b) {
  g[a].push_back(b);
  g[b].push_back(a);
}
```

2. Replace the `vector` of `int` (`buf`) with a fixed-size array:
   - Instead of using `vector<int> buf`, we can define a fixed-size array `int buf[N]` to store temporary data during the construction of the `Tree` structure.
   - This avoids unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations for the `buf` vector.
   - The `dfs` function can be updated as follows:

```cpp
void dfs(int p, int b) {
  if (g[p].size() == (b == -1 ? 0 : 1)) {
    buf[nc] = 1;
    bufdata[nc] = data[p];
    bufsm[nc + 1] = bufsm[nc] + buf[nc];
    li[lc] = new Tree(nc + 1, buf, bufsm, bufdata);
    return;
  }

  // Rest of the function remains unchanged
}
```

3. Optimize the `merge` function to avoid redundant computations:
   - The `merge` function is called multiple times with the same arguments. We can optimize it by introducing memoization to avoid redundant computations.
   - We can store the result of each `merge` call in a memoization table and check if the result is already present before performing the computation.
   - Here's an optimized version of the `merge` function:

```cpp
static unordered_map<pair<const Node&, const Node&>, Node> memo;
static Node merge(const Node &l, const Node &r) {
  auto it = memo.find({l, r});
  if (it != memo.end()) {
    return it->second;
  }

  // Original merge logic
  Node res(l.sz + r.sz);
  res.sm = l.sm + r.sm;
  res.lsm = max(l.lsm, l.sm + r.lsm);
  res.rsm = max(r.rsm, r.sm + l.rsm);
  res.ma = max(max(l.ma, r.ma), l.rsm + r.lsm);
  res.mv = max(l.mv, r.mv);

  memo[{l, r}] = res;
  return res;
}
```

4. Refactor the `Tree` structure to use a more memory-efficient representation:
   - Instead of storing pointers to the left and right subtrees (`NP l, r`), we can store the indices of the left and right subtrees in a flat array.
   - The `Tree` structure can be updated as follows:

```cpp
struct Tree {
  struct Node {
    Node(int sz = 0) : sz(sz), lzf(false) {}
    int sz;
    int d, sm, lz;
    int lsm, rsm, ma, mv;
    bool lzf;
  } n;
  int l, r; // Indices of left and right subtrees in a flat array
  // Rest of the structure remains unchanged
};
```

5. Add compiler optimization flags or directives:
   - To enable compiler optimizations, we can add compiler flags or directives, such as `-O2` for optimization level 2.
   - For example, if using GCC, we can compile the code with `g++ -O2 -o program program.cpp`.

Finally, here's the complete optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <cassert>
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <random>
#include <set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <valarray>
