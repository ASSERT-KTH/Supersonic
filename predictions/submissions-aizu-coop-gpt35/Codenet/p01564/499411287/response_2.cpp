Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified several potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. Memory Allocation: The code allocates a large static array of size `MN` (220100) for the `HLComp_Y` struct. This can lead to inefficient memory usage if the actual number of elements is much smaller than `MN`. We can optimize this by dynamically allocating memory based on the actual number of elements.

2. Unnecessary Data Copying: The code uses the `buf`, `bufdata`, and `bufsm` arrays to store temporary data during the construction of the `Tree` objects. However, these arrays are not needed once the `Tree` objects are created. We can eliminate the need for these arrays by directly constructing the `Tree` objects.

3. Redundant Data Storage: The `Tree` struct stores the `sz` and `sm` values separately, even though `sm` can be computed from `sz` and the `d` value. This redundancy can lead to unnecessary memory usage. We can optimize this by removing the `sm` field and computing it on the fly when needed.

4. Inefficient Looping: The `path_set` and `path_get` functions use a loop to traverse the path from one node to another in the tree. However, this can be optimized by using a recursive approach instead of a loop.

5. Unnecessary Code: The code includes several unnecessary header files that are not used in the program. We can remove these to simplify the code and reduce compilation time.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Dynamically allocate memory for the `HLComp_Y` struct based on the actual number of elements.

2. Eliminate the `buf`, `bufdata`, and `bufsm` arrays and directly construct the `Tree` objects.

3. Remove the `sm` field from the `Node` struct in the `Tree` class and compute it on the fly when needed.

4. Use a recursive approach instead of a loop in the `path_set` and `path_get` functions.

5. Remove unnecessary header files.
