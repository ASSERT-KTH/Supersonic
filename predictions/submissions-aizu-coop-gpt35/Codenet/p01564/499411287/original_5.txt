Code Analysis:
- The code uses the Heavy-Light Decomposition algorithm to efficiently answer queries on a tree.
- The main bottleneck is likely the Tree data structure and its operations, specifically the set() and get() functions.
- The set() and get() functions perform recursive calls, which can be expensive for large trees.
- The merge() function is called frequently and may have room for optimization.
- The code uses a lot of unnecessary includes, which can increase compilation time.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary header files. We can remove the unnecessary includes to reduce compilation time.
2. Optimize the Tree data structure:
   - Replace the recursive set() and get() functions with iterative versions that use a stack.
   - Use loop unrolling to optimize the merge() function.
   - Apply compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the Tree data structure.
3. Optimize the Heavy-Light Decomposition algorithm:
   - Avoid unnecessary calculations and function calls.
   - Combine multiple assignments and calculations into a single statement for efficiency.
   - Apply compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the Heavy-Light Decomposition algorithm.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes:
   - Remove the unnecessary includes to reduce compilation time.

2. Optimize the Tree data structure:
   - Replace the recursive set() and get() functions with iterative versions that use a stack:
     - Instead of making recursive calls, we can use a stack to perform iterative traversal of the tree.
     - This will eliminate the function call overhead and improve performance for large trees.
   - Use loop unrolling to optimize the merge() function:
     - The merge() function is called frequently and can benefit from loop unrolling.
     - By unrolling the loop, we can reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.
   - Apply compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the Tree data structure:
     - Use compiler optimizations, such as inline functions and loop optimizations, to improve the performance of the Tree data structure.

3. Optimize the Heavy-Light Decomposition algorithm:
   - Avoid unnecessary calculations and function calls:
     - Analyze the code and identify any unnecessary calculations or function calls that can be avoided.
   - Combine multiple assignments and calculations into a single statement for efficiency:
     - Look for opportunities to combine multiple assignments or calculations into a single statement to improve performance.
   - Apply compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the Heavy-Light Decomposition algorithm:
     - Use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and loop optimizations, to improve the performance of the Heavy-Light Decomposition algorithm.
