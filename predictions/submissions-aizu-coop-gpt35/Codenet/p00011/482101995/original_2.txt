Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `w` from the user, which represents the width of a line.
- It then reads an integer `n` from the user, which represents the number of horizontal lines.
- The code initializes a vector `StartingPoint` of size `w` and populates it with values from 1 to `w`.
- It then enters a loop where it reads the left and right endpoints of a horizontal line from the user, swaps the corresponding elements in the `StartingPoint` vector, and repeats this process `n` times.
- Finally, it prints the elements of the `StartingPoint` vector.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a more efficient data structure for `StartingPoint`: Instead of using a vector, we can use a simple array to store the starting points. This will reduce the memory usage and improve cache locality, as arrays have a smaller memory overhead compared to vectors.
2. Avoid unnecessary variable initialization: The `THorizonalLine` struct and the `Dummy` variable are not necessary. We can directly read the left and right endpoints of the horizontal line into local variables.
3. Use a more efficient loop for populating `StartingPoint`: Instead of using a loop to populate the `StartingPoint` vector, we can use the `std::iota` function from the `<numeric>` header to fill the array with consecutive values.
4. Use a more efficient loop for swapping elements: Instead of using the `std::swap` function for each swap operation, we can directly swap the elements using a temporary variable.
5. Enable compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to further improve the performance of the code. This can be done by enabling optimization flags during compilation or using `#pragma` directives to provide hints to the compiler.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace `vector<int> StartingPoint(w);` with `int StartingPoint[w];`: This change replaces the vector with a simple array, reducing the memory overhead and improving cache locality.
2. Remove the `THorizonalLine` struct and the `Dummy` variable: Since we only need the left and right endpoints of the horizontal line, we can directly read them into local variables.
3. Replace the loop for populating `StartingPoint` with `std::iota(StartingPoint, StartingPoint + w, 1);`: This change replaces the loop with a single function call to `std::iota`, which fills the array with consecutive values starting from 1. This is more efficient than manually populating the array using a loop.
4. Replace `swap(StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1], StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1]);` with `int temp = StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1]; StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1] = StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1]; StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1] = temp;`: This change replaces the `std::swap` function with direct element swapping using a temporary variable. This avoids the function call overhead and improves performance.
5. Enable compiler optimizations: Depending on the compiler being used, we can enable compiler optimizations by passing appropriate flags during compilation or by using `#pragma` directives to provide hints to the compiler. This can greatly improve the performance of the code by allowing the compiler to apply various optimization techniques.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>

int main() {
  int w;
  std::cin >> w;
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  int StartingPoint[w];
  std::iota(StartingPoint, StartingPoint + w, 1);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int left, right;
    char dummy;
    std::cin >> left >> dummy >> right;
    int temp = StartingPoint[left - 1];
    StartingPoint[left - 1] = StartingPoint[right - 1];
    StartingPoint[right - 1] = temp;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    std::cout << StartingPoint[i] << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces memory usage by using an array instead of a vector, avoids unnecessary variable initialization, and uses more efficient loops for populating the array and swapping elements. Additionally, you should enable compiler optimizations to further improve the performance of the code.
