Code Analysis:
1. The code reads two inputs: `w` and `n`, where `w` represents the number of elements in the `StartingPoint` vector and `n` represents the number of `THorizonalLine` objects to be read.
2. The `StartingPoint` vector is initialized with values from 1 to `w`.
3. `n` `THorizonalLine` objects are read from input and the values at their respective indices (`Left` and `Right`) in the `StartingPoint` vector are swapped.
4. The final `StartingPoint` vector is printed.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Currently, the code uses a vector of integers to represent the `StartingPoint`. However, since the values in `StartingPoint` are always a sequence of integers from 1 to `w`, we can optimize the memory usage by using a simple array instead of a vector. This will reduce the overhead of managing the dynamic memory allocation of the vector.
2. The `swap` function is called `n` times, which can be optimized by directly swapping the values using a temporary variable, without the need for a function call.
3. The loops can be optimized by using loop unrolling, which reduces the overhead of loop control and improves cache utilization.
4. Finally, we can use compiler optimizations, such as loop optimization flags (-O2 or -O3) to enable automatic loop unrolling and other optimizations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `vector<int> StartingPoint(w)` declaration with `int StartingPoint[w]` to use a simple array instead of a vector. This reduces the memory overhead of the vector.

```cpp
int StartingPoint[w];
```

2. Replace the `swap` function call with direct swapping of the values using a temporary variable.

```cpp
int temp = StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1];
StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1] = StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1];
StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1] = temp;
```

3. Optimize the loops by unrolling them. Loop unrolling reduces the overhead of loop control and improves cache utilization by processing multiple iterations of the loop in a single iteration.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < w; i += 2) {
  cout << StartingPoint[i] << endl;
  cout << StartingPoint[i + 1] << endl;
}

if (w % 2 != 0) {
  cout << StartingPoint[w - 1] << endl;
}
```

4. Enable compiler optimizations by adding the appropriate compiler flags. For example, if you are using GCC, use the `-O2` or `-O3` flag to enable optimization.

```bash
g++ -O2 -o optimized_program program.cpp
```

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct THorizonalLine {
  int Left;
  int Right;
};

int main() {
  int w;
  cin >> w;

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  int StartingPoint[w];
  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    StartingPoint[i] = i + 1;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    THorizonalLine HorizonalLine;
    char Dummy;
    cin >> HorizonalLine.Left >> Dummy >> HorizonalLine.Right;

    int temp = StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1];
    StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1] = StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1];
    StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1] = temp;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < w; i += 2) {
    cout << StartingPoint[i] << endl;
    cout << StartingPoint[i + 1] << endl;
  }

  if (w % 2 != 0) {
    cout << StartingPoint[w - 1] << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code reduces memory overhead by using a simple array instead of a vector. It also directly swaps the values without using the `swap` function. The loops are unrolled to reduce loop control overhead and improve cache utilization. Finally, enabling compiler optimizations further improves the performance of the code.
