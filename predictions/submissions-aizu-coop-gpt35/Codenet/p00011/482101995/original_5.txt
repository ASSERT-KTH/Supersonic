Code Analysis:
1. The code reads an integer `w` as the width of the line and an integer `n` as the number of horizontal lines.
2. It creates a vector `StartingPoint` of size `w`, initializes it with consecutive numbers from 1 to `w`, and then swaps the elements of `StartingPoint` based on the input lines.
3. Finally, it prints the elements of `StartingPoint` to the console.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use `std::array` instead of `std::vector` for `StartingPoint` because the size is known at compile-time.
2. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation by reserving space for `StartingPoint` using `StartingPoint.reserve(w)`.
3. Remove the `using namespace std` directive and explicitly qualify `std` where necessary to avoid potential namespace clashes.
4. Avoid using `swap` function to swap the elements of `StartingPoint` and use direct assignment for better performance.
5. Consider using a more efficient input/output method.
6. Apply compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and optimizing compiler flags.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace `vector<int> StartingPoint(w)` with `std::array<int, w> StartingPoint` to use `std::array` instead of `std::vector` for better performance and less memory usage. This will remove dynamic memory allocation and deallocation overhead.
2. Add `StartingPoint.reserve(w)` before the first loop to reserve space for `StartingPoint` and avoid unnecessary memory reallocations.
3. Replace `swap(StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1], StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1])` with direct assignments `StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1] = StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1]` and `StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1] = StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1]`. This eliminates the function call overhead of `swap` and improves performance.
4. Consider using a more efficient input/output method. For example, use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve input/output performance.
5. Optionally, enable compiler optimizations by using compiler-specific flags or pragmas. For example, use `-O3` flag for GCC or Clang to enable aggressive optimizations.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>

struct THorizonalLine {
  int Left;
  int Right;
};

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  
  int w;
  std::cin >> w;
  
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::array<int, w> StartingPoint;
  StartingPoint.reserve(w);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    StartingPoint[i] = i + 1;
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    THorizonalLine HorizonalLine;
    char Dummy;
    std::cin >> HorizonalLine.Left >> Dummy >> HorizonalLine.Right;
    
    StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1] = StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1];
    StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1] = StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1];
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    std::cout << StartingPoint[i] << '\n';
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we have replaced `vector<int>` with `std::array<int, w>` and used `StartingPoint.reserve(w)` to reserve space for `StartingPoint` to avoid unnecessary memory reallocations. We have also replaced `swap` with direct assignments for better performance. Additionally, we have added `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to improve input/output performance.
