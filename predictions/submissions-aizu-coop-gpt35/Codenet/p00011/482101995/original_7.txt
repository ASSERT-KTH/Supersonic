Code Analysis:

1. The code reads two inputs, "w" and "n", where "w" represents the width of a line and "n" represents the number of horizontal lines to be swapped.
2. It then creates a vector called "StartingPoint" with size "w" and initializes it with values from 1 to "w".
3. It reads "n" pairs of integers, representing the left and right endpoints of each horizontal line. It then swaps the corresponding elements in the "StartingPoint" vector.
4. Finally, it prints the elements of the "StartingPoint" vector.

Potential optimizations:
1. The use of the "swap" function in the loop can be optimized to directly swap the elements using a temporary variable instead of calling the swap function.
2. The unnecessary struct "THorizonalLine" can be eliminated, and the left and right values can be read directly into separate variables.
3. The vector "StartingPoint" can be replaced with a simple array, as its size is fixed and known at compile-time.
4. The unnecessary "Dummy" variable can be eliminated, as it is not used.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the vector "StartingPoint" with a simple array.
2. Remove the unnecessary "struct THorizonalLine" and read the left and right values directly into separate variables.
3. Replace the "swap" function with a direct swap using a temporary variable.
4. Eliminate the unnecessary "Dummy" variable.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the vector "StartingPoint" with a simple array:
   - Instead of using a vector, declare a simple array called "StartingPoint" with a size of "w". This reduces the overhead of vector operations and memory allocation.

2. Remove the unnecessary "struct THorizonalLine" and read the left and right values directly into separate variables:
   - Replace the struct definition with two separate integer variables called "left" and "right".
   - Read the left and right values directly into these variables.

3. Replace the "swap" function with a direct swap using a temporary variable:
   - Instead of using the swap function, change the swap operation by using a temporary variable.
   - Swap the values of "StartingPoint[left - 1]" and "StartingPoint[right - 1]" directly.

4. Eliminate the unnecessary "Dummy" variable:
   - Remove the "Dummy" variable declaration and its usage, as it is not needed.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int w;
  std::cin >> w;

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  int StartingPoint[w];
  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    StartingPoint[i] = i + 1;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int left, right;
    std::cin >> left >> right;
    int temp = StartingPoint[left - 1];
    StartingPoint[left - 1] = StartingPoint[right - 1];
    StartingPoint[right - 1] = temp;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    std::cout << StartingPoint[i] << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates the vector and replaces it with a simple array, removes the unnecessary struct, replaces the swap function with a direct swap, and eliminates the unnecessary "Dummy" variable. These changes minimize memory usage and improve performance by reducing the overhead of unnecessary operations.
