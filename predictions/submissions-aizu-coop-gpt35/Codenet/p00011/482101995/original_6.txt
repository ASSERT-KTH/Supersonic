Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `w` which represents the number of elements in a vector.
- It then reads an integer `n` which represents the number of times a swap operation is performed on the vector.
- The code initializes a vector `StartingPoint` with values from 1 to `w`.
- It then performs `n` swap operations on the vector based on user inputs.
- Finally, it prints the elements of the vector.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use `reserve` to preallocate memory for the vector `StartingPoint` to avoid unnecessary reallocations during the loop where values are assigned to it.
2. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` statement as it is considered a bad practice.
3. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve the performance of input/output operations.
4. Use a more efficient data structure to represent the horizontal lines. Instead of storing each line as a separate struct object, store the starting and ending points of each line in two separate vectors.
5. Use `std::array` instead of `std::vector` for `StartingPoint` vector as the size is known at compile-time.
6. Use `std::swap` instead of `std::swap` to avoid unnecessary namespace lookup.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Use `reserve` to preallocate memory for the vector `StartingPoint`:
   - By using `StartingPoint.reserve(w)` before the loop, we allocate memory for `w` elements in advance, preventing reallocations during the loop where values are assigned to it. This reduces the overhead of memory reallocation and improves performance.

2. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` statement:
   - It is considered a bad practice to have a `using namespace std;` statement in the global namespace. It can lead to name clashes and make the code less readable. Since the code is already using the `std` namespace explicitly, we can safely remove this statement.

3. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`:
   - By disabling the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, we can improve the performance of input/output operations. The `std::cin` and `std::cout` streams will no longer be synchronized with the C standard library streams (`stdin` and `stdout`), which can result in faster I/O.

4. Use a more efficient data structure to represent the horizontal lines:
   - Instead of storing each line as a separate struct object, we can store the starting and ending points of each line in two separate vectors. This reduces the overhead of creating and managing individual struct objects for each line.

5. Use `std::array` instead of `std::vector` for `StartingPoint` vector:
   - Since the size of `StartingPoint` is known at compile-time (it is based on the user input `w`), we can use `std::array` instead of `std::vector`. `std::array` has a fixed size and does not require dynamic memory allocation, resulting in improved performance.

6. Use `std::swap` instead of `std::swap`:
   - Instead of using `swap` from the global namespace, we can use `std::swap` specifically to avoid unnecessary namespace lookup.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <array>
#include <algorithm>

struct THorizonalLine {
  int Left;
  int Right;
};

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

  int w;
  std::cin >> w;

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::array<int, 100000> StartingPoint;
  StartingPoint.fill(0);
  std::vector<int> leftPoints(n);
  std::vector<int> rightPoints(n);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> leftPoints[i];
    char Dummy;
    std::cin >> Dummy >> rightPoints[i];
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::swap(StartingPoint[leftPoints[i] - 1], StartingPoint[rightPoints[i] - 1]);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    std::cout << StartingPoint[i] << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the code includes the following changes:
- Added `#include <array>` to use `std::array`.
- Removed the unnecessary `using namespace std;` statement.
- Used `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams.
- Replaced the `std::vector<int>` with `std::array<int, 100000>` for `StartingPoint` vector.
- Created separate vectors `leftPoints` and `rightPoints` to store the starting and ending points of each line.
- Used `std::swap` specifically instead of `swap` from the global namespace.
