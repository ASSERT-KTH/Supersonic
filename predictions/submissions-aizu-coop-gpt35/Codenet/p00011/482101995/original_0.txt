Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer 'w' to indicate the number of elements in the 'StartingPoint' vector.
- It then reads an integer 'n' to indicate the number of times the 'StartingPoint' vector needs to be modified.
- For each modification, it reads two integers 'Left' and 'Right', which represent the indices of the elements to be swapped in the 'StartingPoint' vector.
- Finally, it prints the modified 'StartingPoint' vector.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation: Instead of using a vector, which dynamically allocates memory, we can use a fixed-size array since the size is known in advance.

2. Avoid unnecessary swaps: The code currently swaps the elements of the 'StartingPoint' vector in each iteration. Instead, we can keep track of the swaps and perform them at the end, reducing the number of swaps to just 'n' times.

3. Avoid unnecessary struct creation: The code currently creates a struct 'THorizonalLine' in each iteration. We can avoid this overhead by directly reading the left and right indices.

4. Use more efficient input and output methods: The code currently uses 'cin' and 'cout' for input and output respectively. These operations can be slow, especially for large inputs or outputs. Instead, we can use 'scanf' and 'printf' for faster input and output.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the vector 'StartingPoint' with a fixed-size array. This avoids the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

2. Instead of swapping the elements in each iteration, keep track of the swaps in a separate data structure, such as an array of pairs or a vector of pairs.

3. Replace the struct 'THorizonalLine' with two separate integer variables 'left' and 'right'. This avoids the overhead of creating a struct in each iteration.

4. Use 'scanf' instead of 'cin' for faster input. Replace the line `cin >> w;` with `scanf("%d", &w);` and `cin >> n;` with `scanf("%d", &n);`.

5. Use 'printf' instead of 'cout' for faster output. Replace the line `cout << StartingPoint[i] << endl;` with `printf("%d\n", StartingPoint[i]);`.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int w;
  scanf("%d", &w);
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int StartingPoint[1000000];
  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    StartingPoint[i] = i + 1;
  }
  int swaps[1000000][2];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int left, right;
    char Dummy;
    scanf("%d %c %d", &left, &Dummy, &right);
    swaps[i][0] = left - 1;
    swaps[i][1] = right - 1;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    swap(StartingPoint[swaps[i][0]], StartingPoint[swaps[i][1]]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", StartingPoint[i]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:
- The trade-off in this optimization is increased code complexity. By using a fixed-size array instead of a vector, the code becomes less flexible as the size needs to be determined in advance. Additionally, using 'scanf' and 'printf' instead of 'cin' and 'cout' makes the code less readable, but it significantly improves the performance.
