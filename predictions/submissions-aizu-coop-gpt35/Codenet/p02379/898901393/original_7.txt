The provided code calculates the Euclidean distance between two points using the distance formula. However, there are a few potential optimizations that can be made to improve the efficiency of the code:

1. Avoid unnecessary inclusion of `<math.h>`: The code only uses the `sqrt()` function from the `<math.h>` library. Therefore, we can remove the inclusion of `<math.h>` and instead use the function prototype for `sqrt()`.

2. Optimize the distance calculation: The current implementation calculates the square of the differences of the x and y coordinates separately and then adds them together. Instead, we can simplify the calculation by directly calculating the square of the Euclidean distance formula: `temp = (p1.x - p2.x) * (p1.x - p2.x) + (p1.y - p2.y) * (p1.y - p2.y)`.

3. Use pass-by-reference instead of pass-by-value for the `distance()` function: Currently, the `distance()` function takes two `point` structs as arguments, which results in copying the entire `point` structs. To avoid this unnecessary overhead, we can modify the `distance()` function to take the arguments as pointers.

4. Use `const` keyword for read-only input parameters: The `distance()` function does not modify the input parameters `p1` and `p2`. Therefore, we can use the `const` keyword to indicate that these parameters are read-only, which allows the compiler to perform additional optimizations.

5. Use `static` keyword for internal helper functions: The `distance()` function is only used within the same translation unit (i.e., the same source file). Therefore, we can use the `static` keyword to limit its visibility to the current file, potentially allowing the compiler to perform additional optimizations.

Taking these optimizations into account, here's the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct point {
  double x;
  double y;
} point;

double sqrt(double x); // Function prototype for sqrt()

double distance(const point* p1, const point* p2) {
  double temp = (p1->x - p2->x) * (p1->x - p2->x) + (p1->y - p2->y) * (p1->y - p2->y);
  return sqrt(temp);
}

int main(void) {
  point p1, p2;
  double d;
  scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf", &p1.x, &p1.y, &p2.x, &p2.y);
  d = distance(&p1, &p2);
  printf("%.5f\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces unnecessary overhead and improves the efficiency of the original code without sacrificing functionality.
