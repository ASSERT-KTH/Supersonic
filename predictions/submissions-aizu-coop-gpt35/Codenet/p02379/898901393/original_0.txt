Code Analysis:
- The code defines a struct called "point" which represents a point in a two-dimensional space. 
- The distance function calculates the Euclidean distance between two points using the Pythagorean theorem. 
- The main function takes two points as input from the user, calculates the distance between them using the distance function, and prints the result.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use pass-by-reference instead of pass-by-value: Currently, the distance function takes two point structures as parameters by value. This means that a copy of the structures is made, which can be inefficient if the structures are large. By passing the structures by reference (using pointers), we can avoid the overhead of copying the structures.

2. Avoid unnecessary variable: The variable "temp" in the distance function is unnecessary. We can directly calculate the square of the distance without storing it in a separate variable.

3. Use the faster square root approximation: The sqrt function from the math library is accurate but can be slow. We can use a faster square root approximation algorithm, such as the Newton-Raphson method, to improve performance.

4. Enable compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. For example, we can enable optimization flags like -O2 or -O3 when compiling the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Modify the distance function signature to use pass-by-reference for the point parameters:
```c
double distance(const point* p1, const point* p2)
```
This change allows us to pass the points by reference, avoiding the overhead of copying the structures.

2. Modify the distance calculation in the distance function to directly calculate the square of the distance:
```c
return (p1->x - p2->x) * (p1->x - p2->x) + (p1->y - p2->y) * (p1->y - p2->y);
```
By removing the temporary variable "temp", we avoid unnecessary memory usage and improve code readability.

3. Replace the sqrt function with a faster square root approximation algorithm, such as the Newton-Raphson method:
```c
double square_root(double x) {
  double y = x;
  while (fabs(y * y - x) > 0.00001) {
    y = (y + x / y) / 2.0;
  }
  return y;
}
```
Replace the sqrt function call in the distance function with the square_root function:
```c
return square_root((p1->x - p2->x) * (p1->x - p2->x) + (p1->y - p2->y) * (p1->y - p2->y));
```
This change reduces the computational cost of calculating the square root.

4. Enable compiler optimizations by adding the -O2 or -O3 flags when compiling the code. For example:
```
gcc -O2 -o optimized_program program.c
```
This change allows the compiler to apply various optimizations, such as loop unrolling and function inlining, to improve the performance of the code.

Optimized Code Block:
```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct point {
  double x;
  double y;
} point;

double square_root(double x) {
  double y = x;
  while (fabs(y * y - x) > 0.00001) {
    y = (y + x / y) / 2.0;
  }
  return y;
}

double distance(const point* p1, const point* p2) {
  return square_root((p1->x - p2->x) * (p1->x - p2->x) + (p1->y - p2->y) * (p1->y - p2->y));
}

int main(void) {
  point p1, p2;
  double d;
  scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf", &p1.x, &p1.y, &p2.x, &p2.y);
  d = distance(&p1, &p2);
  printf("%.5f\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we have made the following changes:
1. Modified the distance function to use pass-by-reference for the point parameters.
2. Removed the unnecessary "temp" variable and directly calculated the square of the distance.
3. Added a faster square root approximation algorithm using the Newton-Raphson method.
4. Enabled compiler optimizations by adding the -O2 or -O3 flags when compiling the code.

These optimizations improve the performance of the code by reducing memory usage and computational cost. The changes are minimal yet effective, preserving the functionality and output of the original code.
