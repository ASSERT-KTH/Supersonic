The code provided calculates the distance between two points in a Cartesian plane using the distance formula. It reads the coordinates of the two points from the user, calculates the distance using the `distance` function, and then prints the result.

Here are the potential areas for optimization in this code:

1. Inefficient use of the `sqrt` function: The `sqrt` function is called to calculate the square root of the distance. Calculating the square root is an expensive operation compared to simple arithmetic operations. We can avoid using the `sqrt` function by comparing the squared distance instead.

2. Redundant use of the `temp` variable: The `distance` function uses the temporary variable `temp` to store the squared distance calculation. Instead, we can directly return the squared distance.

3. Lack of input validation: The code does not perform any input validation on the user input. It assumes that the user will always provide valid numerical values. Adding input validation can improve the robustness of the program.

Now let's proceed with the optimization strategy.
