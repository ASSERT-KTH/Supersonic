First, let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The `mp` array is used to store the values for each cell in the grid. Since the grid size can be up to 1001x1001, using a 2D array might not be the most memory-efficient approach.

2. The `dp` array is used for dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible paths. It is initialized with zeros using `memset`. However, since the array is later completely overwritten in the nested loops, this initialization is unnecessary.

3. The `saiki` function uses recursion to traverse the grid. Recursion can be computationally expensive and may lead to stack overflow for large grid sizes.

4. The nested loops in the main function iterate over each cell in the grid. However, the order of iteration is not optimized, which can result in poor cache performance.

5. There are unnecessary semicolons at the end of the variable declarations and an empty line between the variable declarations and the function `main`.

Now, let's formulate an optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `mp` array with a more memory-efficient data structure, such as a 1D array or a bitset.

2. Remove the unnecessary initialization of the `dp` array.

3. Replace the recursive `saiki` function with an iterative loop to traverse the grid.

4. Optimize the order of iteration in the nested loops to improve cache performance.

5. Consider enabling compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization, to further improve performance.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int h, w, n;
  while (1) {
    cin >> h >> w >> n;
    if (!h && !w && !n)
      break;

    vector<int> mp(h * w);  // Use a 1D vector instead of a 2D array

    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++)
        cin >> mp[i * w + j];  // Store values in the 1D vector

    vector<int> dp(h * w);  // Use a 1D vector instead of a 2D array

    // No need to initialize dp array, as it will be completely overwritten

    dp[0] = n - 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        // Calculate indices for the neighboring cells
        int idx_right = i * w + j + 1;
        int idx_bottom = (i + 1) * w + j;

        dp[idx_right] += dp[i * w + j] / 2 + mp[i * w + j] * dp[i * w + j] % 2;
        dp[idx_bottom] += dp[i * w + j] / 2 + !mp[i * w + j] * dp[i * w + j] % 2;
        if (dp[i * w + j] % 2)
          mp[i * w + j] = !mp[i * w + j];
      }

    int x = 0, y = 0;

    // Traverse the grid iteratively instead of using recursion
    while (y != h && x != w) {
      int dx[] = {0, 1}, dy[] = {1, 0};
      cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << endl;
      int next_x = x + dx[mp[y * w + x]];
      int next_y = y + dy[mp[y * w + x]];
      x = next_x;
      y = next_y;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code:

- The `mp` array is replaced with a 1D `vector<int>`. The values are stored in the vector using the formula `i * w + j` to calculate the index.

- The `dp` array is replaced with a 1D `vector<int>`. The unnecessary initialization is removed.

- The `saiki` function is replaced with an iterative loop that traverses the grid. This avoids the recursion overhead.

- The order of iteration in the nested loops is optimized for better cache performance, as the indices are calculated using `i * w + j`.

- The unnecessary semicolons and empty line are removed.

- The `bits/stdc++.h` header is replaced with the necessary headers `iostream` and `vector`.

The optimized code is well-commented to highlight the changes made and make it easily understandable.
