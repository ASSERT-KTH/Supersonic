Code Analysis:
- The code uses a recursive function `saiki` to traverse a grid represented by the `mp` array.
- The `dp` array is used to keep track of the number of steps remaining at each cell.
- The grid is traversed recursively until the end is reached.
- The code also includes input and output operations to read the input grid and print the path.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Eliminate unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is unnecessary. We can replace it with specific headers that are actually needed.
2. Avoid unnecessary variables: The semicolon after `dp[1001][1001];` is unnecessary and can be removed.
3. Use more efficient data types: The code uses `int` for grid values, but the values are only 0 or 1. We can use `bool` instead, which will reduce memory usage.
4. Optimize the recursive function: The recursive function `saiki` can be optimized to avoid function calls and improve performance. We can replace it with a loop that iterates until the end is reached.
5. Optimize the dynamic programming loop: The loop that updates the `dp` array can be optimized to reduce redundant computations and improve performance.
6. Consider compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization, to further improve the performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Eliminate unnecessary includes:
   - Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary headers, such as `#include <iostream>` and `#include <cstring>`.
2. Avoid unnecessary variables:
   - Remove the semicolon after `dp[1001][1001];`.
3. Use more efficient data types:
   - Replace `int` with `bool` for the `mp` array, as the values are only 0 or 1.
4. Optimize the recursive function:
   - Replace the `saiki` function with a loop that iterates until the end is reached.
   - Initialize `x` and `y` to 0.
   - Inside the loop, update `x` and `y` using the corresponding `dx` and `dy` values.
   - Check if `y` is equal to `h` or `x` is equal to `w`. If true, print the coordinates and exit the loop.
5. Optimize the dynamic programming loop:
   - Update the dynamic programming loop as follows:
     - Replace `dp[i][j + 1] += dp[i][j] / 2 + mp[i][j] * dp[i][j] % 2;` with `dp[i][j + 1] = dp[i][j] / 2 + mp[i][j] * dp[i][j] % 2;`.
     - Replace `dp[i + 1][j] += dp[i][j] / 2 + !mp[i][j] * dp[i][j] % 2;` with `dp[i + 1][j] = dp[i][j] / 2 + !mp[i][j] * dp[i][j] % 2;`.
     - Move the check for `dp[i][j] % 2` inside the loop.
6. Consider compiler optimizations:
   - Add compiler optimizations, such as `-O3`, to enable aggressive optimizations by the compiler.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

bool mp[1001][1001];
int dp[1001][1001];

int h, w, n;

void printCoordinates(int x, int y) {
  int dx[] = {0, 1};
  int dy[] = {1, 0};

  while (y != h && x != w) {
    x += dx[mp[y][x]];
    y += dy[mp[y][x]];
  }

  std::cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  while (true) {
    std::cin >> h >> w >> n;

    if (!h && !w && !n)
      break;

    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++)
        std::cin >> mp[i][j];

    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    dp[0][0] = n - 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        dp[i][j + 1] = dp[i][j] / 2 + mp[i][j] * dp[i][j] % 2;
        dp[i + 1][j] = dp[i][j] / 2 + !mp[i][j] * dp[i][j] % 2;

        if (dp[i][j] % 2)
          mp[i][j] = !mp[i][j];
      }
    }

    printCoordinates(0, 0);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Note: The compiler optimizations mentioned in step 6 can be applied by passing appropriate flags to the compiler during the compilation process.
