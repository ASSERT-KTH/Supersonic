First, let's analyze the given code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The code uses a recursive function `saiki` to perform a depth-first search. Recursive functions can be inefficient due to the overhead of function calls and the potential for stack overflow if the recursion depth is too large.

2. The code uses a 2-dimensional array `mp` to store the map data, and another 2-dimensional array `dp` as a dynamic programming table. However, the code does not make full use of the dynamic programming table, as it only updates and uses a single cell `dp[i][j]` at a time.

3. The code uses `memset` to initialize the `dp` array with zeros. This is unnecessary since the subsequent loop will overwrite all the values anyway.

4. The code performs integer division and modulo operations (`/` and `%`) inside the nested loop. These operations can be computationally expensive, especially when performed repeatedly.

Based on this analysis, we can formulate an optimization strategy as follows:

1. Replace the recursive function `saiki` with an iterative loop. This will eliminate the function call overhead and reduce the risk of stack overflow.

2. Use a 1-dimensional array instead of a 2-dimensional `dp` array. This will reduce the memory usage and potentially improve cache performance.

3. Avoid unnecessary operations and computations, such as the use of `memset` and the repeated integer division and modulo operations.

4. Consider using compiler optimizations and pragmas to further improve performance. For example, enabling loop unrolling or vectorization may provide performance benefits.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and implementation of these optimizations.
