The provided code appears to be solving a problem using a recursive function `saiki()` and a dynamic programming approach. However, there are several potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary `using namespace std` directive: This directive is considered bad practice as it pollutes the global namespace. It is better to use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.

2. Inefficient data structure: The code uses a 2D array `mp[1001][1001]` to store the input data. However, the problem statement mentions that the input size is at most 1000x1000. Therefore, the array could be resized to a smaller size, which would reduce memory usage.

3. Redundant computation: The code performs the same computation twice in the nested loops of the main function. The expressions `dp[i][j] / 2 + mp[i][j] * dp[i][j] % 2` and `dp[i][j] / 2 + !mp[i][j] * dp[i][j] % 2` are calculated multiple times. It would be more efficient to calculate these values once and store them in a temporary variable.

4. Inefficient memory initialization: The code uses `memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp))` to initialize the `dp` array to zero. However, `memset` is not the most efficient way to initialize an array in C++. It would be better to use a loop to explicitly set each element to zero.

5. Lack of comments: The code lacks comments, making it difficult to understand the logic and purpose of certain sections. Adding comments would improve code readability and maintainability.

Based on these observations, I will now proceed with the optimization steps.
