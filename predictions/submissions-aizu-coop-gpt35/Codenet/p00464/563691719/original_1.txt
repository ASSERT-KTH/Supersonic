The given code seems to solve a problem where the objective is to find a path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell of a grid, with certain constraints and rules. 

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance issues and areas of improvement can be identified:

1. The use of `cout` for printing the output inside the `saiki` function can cause a slowdown. Instead of printing the output immediately, it would be more efficient to store the results in a data structure and print them all at once after the `saiki` function completes.
2. The use of `memset` to initialize the `dp` array with zeros is unnecessary. The subsequent loop that populates the `dp` array already assigns values to each element, so there is no need for explicit initialization.
3. The `dp` array is not used after it is populated. This implies that it may be possible to eliminate the need for this array entirely, reducing memory usage.
4. The use of the `bits/stdc++.h` header is not recommended as it includes unnecessary headers and can slow down the compilation process. It is better to include specific headers that are actually needed.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the immediate printing of results in the `saiki` function with storing the results in a data structure.
2. Eliminate the unnecessary `memset` call to initialize the `dp` array.
3. Find an alternative approach to eliminate the need for the `dp` array.
4. Remove the `bits/stdc++.h` header and include only the necessary headers.

Next, we will proceed with a step-by-step explanation of each optimization step.
