Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structure: The code currently uses a 2D array `mp` and `dp` to store the input matrix and the dynamic programming table respectively. However, using a 2D vector instead of a C-style 2D array can provide more flexibility and potentially improve performance.

2. Redundant computation: The code repeatedly computes `dp[i][j] / 2` and `dp[i][j] % 2` multiple times in the inner loop. These computations can be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations.

3. Loop optimization: The recursive function `saiki` is currently implemented using a pair of arrays `dx` and `dy`. By eliminating these arrays and using a loop instead, we can potentially improve performance.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling and pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Based on these observations, we can proceed with the following step-by-step optimization strategy:

1. Replace the C-style arrays `mp` and `dp` with 2D vectors to improve efficiency and flexibility.

2. Move the computations `dp[i][j] / 2` and `dp[i][j] % 2` outside the inner loop to avoid redundant calculations.

3. Replace the recursive function `saiki` with a loop implementation to improve performance.

4. Apply compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and pragma directives, to further enhance performance.

Now, let's incorporate these optimization steps into the code:
