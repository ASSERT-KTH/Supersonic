The given code is a C++ program that solves a problem using a recursive approach. The program takes input parameters `m` and `n`, where `m` represents the number of columns and `n` represents the number of rows. It then takes an `n` by `m` grid of binary values as input. The goal is to find the minimum number of steps required to divide the grid into two equal parts by removing one column at a time.

The program uses a map `mp` to store the minimum steps required for each grid configuration. The function `search()` is recursively called to find the minimum steps. The base case is when there is only one column remaining in the grid, in which case the depth of recursion is returned. Otherwise, the function tries removing each column and recursively calls itself on the remaining grid configurations.

Now, let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The use of `map<pair<vector<int>, int>, int> mp` to store the minimum steps for each grid configuration is inefficient. This is because the map has a large overhead due to the use of pairs and vectors as keys. Additionally, the map lookup and insertion operations have a time complexity of O(log n).

2. The `search()` function performs redundant computations by recomputing the same grid configurations multiple times. This is because the function does not store the computed results for each grid configuration.

3. The `search()` function has a time complexity of O(2^n * m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. This is because for each column, the function divides the grid into two parts and recursively calls itself on each part. The exponential time complexity suggests that there is potential for optimization.

Based on the above analysis, we can formulate an optimization strategy to improve the performance of the code.
