The given code appears to solve a problem related to searching and partitioning a set of strings. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance:

1. Redundant Computation: The code recomputes the same partition for different subsets of the input vector `vi` multiple times. This can be avoided by memoizing the results in the map `mp`.

2. Inefficient Data Structure: The map `mp` is currently using a pair of a vector and an integer as the key. This can be improved by using a hash-based data structure like `unordered_map` instead of `map`, which can provide faster lookup times.

3. Unnecessary Copying: The code creates two separate vectors `a` and `b` for each recursive call, which results in unnecessary memory allocation and copying. Instead, we can pass a range (start and end indices) to each recursive call to avoid this overhead.

4. Loop Optimization: The loop in the `search` function can be optimized by using iterators instead of indices. This can improve performance, especially when the vector size is large.

5. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest the compiler to optimize the code further by using compiler-specific directives or flags. For example, we can use `-O3` optimization level to enable aggressive optimization.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step.
