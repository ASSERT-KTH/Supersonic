Code Analysis:

1. The code reads input values for `a`, `b`, and `n` from the user.
2. It initializes a 2D array `way` of size `17x17` and sets all elements to zero.
3. It reads `n` pairs of integers `t1` and `t2` and sets the corresponding element in `way` to -1.
4. It initializes the first row and column of `way` to 1 if they are not marked as -1.
5. It iterates over the remaining elements of `way` and sets each element to the sum of the element to its left and the element above it, if it is not marked as -1.
6. Finally, it prints the value at `way[b][a]`.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:

1. The 2D array `way` is of fixed size `17x17`. This limits the size of the input matrix and consumes unnecessary memory.
2. The loops that set the initial values of `way` to zero, and the loops that set the first row and column to 1, can be optimized.
3. The loop that calculates the values of `way` can be optimized by avoiding redundant checks and unnecessary variable assignments.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use dynamic memory allocation to create a 2D array of size `b+1 x a+1` instead of a fixed size `17x17` array. This will allow the program to handle larger input matrices.
2. Initialize the values of the 2D array `way` to zero using `memset` instead of a nested loop.
3. Optimize the loop that sets the first row and column of `way` to 1 by removing the conditional check for -1.
4. Optimize the loop that calculates the values of `way` by avoiding redundant checks for -1 and unnecessary variable assignments.
5. Use appropriate compiler optimization flags or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize the code further.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the declaration of `way` with a pointer to a pointer, and allocate memory dynamically for the 2D array using `malloc`:
```cpp
int **way = (int **)malloc((b+1) * sizeof(int *));
for (int i = 0; i <= b; i++) {
  way[i] = (int *)malloc((a+1) * sizeof(int));
}
```
   - This dynamically allocates memory for the 2D array `way` with `b+1` rows and `a+1` columns.
   - The `sizeof(int *)` calculates the size of a pointer to an integer, and `sizeof(int)` calculates the size of an integer. Multiplying these sizes by the number of rows and columns gives the total memory required.

2. Use `memset` to set all elements of `way` to zero:
```cpp
memset(way, 0, (b+1) * sizeof(int *));
```
   - This sets the memory block allocated for `way` to zero.

3. Remove the conditional check for -1 in the loop that sets the first row and column of `way` to 1:
```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= a; i++) {
  way[1][i] = 1;
}
for (int i = 1; i <= b; i++) {
  way[i][1] = 1;
}
```
   - Since the values of the first row and column are never set to -1, there is no need for the conditional check.

4. Optimize the loop that calculates the values of `way` by avoiding redundant checks for -1 and unnecessary variable assignments:
```cpp
for (int i = 2; i <= b; i++) {
  for (int j = 2; j <= a; j++) {
    if (way[i][j] != -1) {
      way[i][j] = way[i][j - 1] + way[i - 1][j];
    }
  }
}
```
   - Instead of separately checking if each element is -1, we can directly calculate the sum of the adjacent elements.
   - Also, there is no need for the variables `w` and `h` to store the values of the adjacent elements.

5. Use appropriate compiler optimization flags or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize the code further. This can vary depending on the compiler being used. For example, with the GCC compiler, you can use the `-O3` flag to enable aggressive optimizations.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
  int a, b, n, t1, t2;

  while (scanf("%d %d", &a, &b), a || b) {
    scanf("%d", &n);

    int **way = (int **)malloc((b+1) * sizeof(int *));
    for (int i = 0; i <= b; i++) {
      way[i] = (int *)malloc((a+1) * sizeof(int));
    }

    memset(way, 0, (b+1) * sizeof(int *));

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d %d", &t1, &t2);
      way[t2][t1] = -1;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= a; i++) {
      way[1][i] = 1;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= b; i++) {
      way[i][1] = 1;
    }

    for (int i = 2; i <= b; i++) {
      for (int j = 2; j <= a; j++) {
        if (way[i][j] != -1) {
          way[i][j] = way[i][j - 1] + way[i - 1][j];
        }
      }
    }

    printf("%d\n", way[b][a]);

    for (int i = 0; i <= b; i++) {
      free(way[i]);
    }
    free(way);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:
1. The use of dynamic memory allocation adds some overhead in terms of memory management and deallocation. However, this allows for more flexibility in handling larger input matrices.
2. The optimizations in the code may slightly increase the complexity of the code in terms of additional loops or conditional statements. However, these optimizations are minimal and the overall readability of the code is not significantly affected.
