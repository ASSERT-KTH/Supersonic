The provided code calculates the number of possible paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid, given certain obstacles. It uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of paths for each position in the grid.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage: The program uses a 2D array `way[17][17]` to store the number of paths for each position in the grid. However, the grid size is determined at runtime and can be much larger than 17x17. This fixed-size array limits the program's ability to handle larger grids efficiently.

2. Redundant Computations: The program performs redundant calculations when checking for obstacles and updating the number of paths for each position. For example, when calculating `way[i][j]`, it checks `way[i][j-1]` and `way[i-1][j]` multiple times, even when they have already been calculated.

3. Loop Optimization: The program uses nested loops to iterate over each position in the grid. These loops can potentially be optimized to reduce unnecessary iterations.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The program does not include any compiler optimizations or pragma directives. Adding these can help the compiler generate more efficient code.

Based on the above analysis, the following optimization steps can be taken to improve the code's performance:

1. Efficient Data Structure: Replace the fixed-size array `way[17][17]` with a dynamically allocated 2D array to accommodate larger grid sizes.

2. Precompute Obstacles: Instead of using `-1` to represent obstacles in the grid, use a separate boolean array to store the obstacle positions. This avoids the need for multiple checks when updating the number of paths.

3. Loop Optimization: Optimize the nested loops to reduce unnecessary iterations. For example, the outer loop can be terminated early if the top-right corner is an obstacle, and the inner loop can be skipped if the current position is an obstacle.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Add compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code, such as loop unrolling or vectorization.

Now, let's implement these optimization steps in the code.
