The provided code calculates the number of unique paths in a grid from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. The grid has dimensions `a` rows and `b` columns and contains obstacles represented by -1. The program reads the dimensions of the grid and the positions of the obstacles from the input and prints the number of unique paths.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential optimizations to improve the performance and memory usage:

1. Inefficient Memory Usage: The current code uses a 2D array `way` to store the number of unique paths. However, since the grid dimensions are known, the array can be replaced with a 1D array, reducing memory usage.

2. Redundant Computations: The code checks for obstacles at each position in the grid when calculating the number of unique paths. Instead, we can pre-process the grid and mark the obstacle positions separately, avoiding redundant checks during path calculation.

3. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest enabling compiler optimizations to allow the compiler to perform various optimizations automatically.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of these optimizations and provide the optimized code.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int a, b, n, t1, t2;
  while (scanf("%d %d", &a, &b), a || b) {
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // Create a 1D array to store the number of unique paths
    std::vector<int> way(b + 1, 0);

    // Preprocess the grid and mark obstacle positions
    std::vector<std::vector<bool>> hasObstacle(b + 1, std::vector<bool>(a + 1, false));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d %d", &t1, &t2);
      hasObstacle[t2][t1] = true;
    }

    // Calculate the number of unique paths
    way[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= b; i++) {
      for (int j = 1; j <= a; j++) {
        if (!hasObstacle[i][j]) {
          if (j > 1)
            way[j] += way[j - 1];
        } else {
          way[j] = 0; // Reset the number of unique paths for the current column
        }
      }
    }

    printf("%d\n", way[a]);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of Optimizations:

1. Inefficient Memory Usage: The original code uses a 2D array `way[17][17]` to store the number of unique paths. However, since the grid dimensions are known, we can replace it with a 1D array `way[b+1]` to reduce memory usage. This change reduces the memory footprint from `17 * 17 * sizeof(int)` to `(b+1) * sizeof(int)`.

2. Redundant Computations: The original code checks for obstacles at each position in the grid when calculating the number of unique paths. Instead, we can pre-process the grid and mark the obstacle positions separately using a 2D boolean array `hasObstacle[b+1][a+1]`. This change avoids redundant checks during path calculation, improving performance.

3. Compiler Optimizations: We suggest enabling compiler optimizations to allow the compiler to perform various optimizations automatically. This includes optimizations such as loop unrolling, constant folding, and instruction scheduling.

Trade-offs: The optimizations made in this code result in improved memory usage and potentially faster execution time. However, the code becomes slightly more complex due to the additional preprocessing step.
