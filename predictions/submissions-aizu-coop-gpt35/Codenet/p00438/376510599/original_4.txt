Code Analysis:
- The program calculates the number of possible paths to reach a given cell (b, a) in a grid. The grid has dimensions a x b.
- The grid is represented by the 2D array `way[][]`, where each cell represents the number of ways to reach that cell.
- The obstacles are represented by cells with the value -1.
- The program reads the input values and initializes the `way[][]` array accordingly.
- It then calculates the number of ways to reach each cell in the grid using dynamic programming.
- Finally, it prints the number of ways to reach the destination cell.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a more efficient data structure for the grid:
   - The current code uses a 2D array to represent the grid. However, this approach is not memory-efficient, especially if the grid size is large.
   - Instead, we can use a 1D array of size (a+1)*(b+1) to represent the grid. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.
   - We can access any cell (i, j) using the formula: `way[i * (a + 1) + j]`.

2. Reduce redundant computations:
   - The current code checks if `way[1][i]` and `way[i][1]` are -1 in separate loops. However, we can combine these checks into a single loop to avoid redundant iterations.

3. Optimize the inner loop:
   - The current inner loop calculates the number of ways to reach each cell based on the values of adjacent cells.
   - We can optimize this loop by avoiding unnecessary calculations when the adjacent cells are obstacles (-1).
   - Additionally, we can use temporary variables `w` and `h` instead of accessing the `way` array multiple times.

4. Enable compiler optimizations:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations using compiler-specific flags or pragmas to let the compiler optimize the code further.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the 2D array `way[17][17]` with a 1D array `way[(a+1)*(b+1)]`.
   - This reduces memory usage and improves cache locality.
   - Update the code to access cells using the formula: `way[i * (a + 1) + j]`.
   - Update the loop limits accordingly.

2. Combine the checks for `way[1][i]` and `way[i][1]` into a single loop.
   - This reduces redundant iterations.
   - Replace the separate loops with a single loop from 1 to `a` and update the condition to check if either `way[1][i]` or `way[i][1]` is -1.

3. Optimize the inner loop.
   - Instead of accessing `way[i][j - 1]` and `way[i - 1][j]` multiple times, store their values in temporary variables `w` and `h`.
   - Use these temporary variables to calculate `way[i][j]`.
   - This reduces redundant array accesses.

4. Enable compiler optimizations.
   - Use compiler-specific flags or pragmas to enable compiler optimizations.
   - This allows the compiler to perform additional optimizations based on the target architecture and optimization level.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int a, b, n, t1, t2;
  while (scanf("%d %d", &a, &b), a || b) {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    int size = (a + 1) * (b + 1);
    int* way = new int[size];
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      way[i] = 0;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d %d", &t1, &t2);
      way[t2 * (a + 1) + t1] = -1;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= a; i++) {
      if (way[i] == -1 || way[b * (a + 1) + i] == -1) {
        break;
      }
      way[i] = 1;
      way[b * (a + 1) + i] = 1;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i <= b; i++) {
      for (int j = 2; j <= a; j++) {
        if (way[i * (a + 1) + j] != -1) {
          int w = 0, h = 0;
          if (way[i * (a + 1) + j - 1] != -1) {
            w = way[i * (a + 1) + j - 1];
          }
          if (way[(i - 1) * (a + 1) + j] != -1) {
            h = way[(i - 1) * (a + 1) + j];
          }
          way[i * (a + 1) + j] = w + h;
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", way[b * (a + 1) + a]);
    delete[] way;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code:
- The 1D array `way[]` is used to represent the grid.
- The checks for `way[1][i]` and `way[i][1]` are combined into a single loop.
- The inner loop is optimized by using temporary variables `w` and `h`.
- Compiler optimizations are not explicitly shown in the code but can be enabled using compiler-specific flags or pragmas.
