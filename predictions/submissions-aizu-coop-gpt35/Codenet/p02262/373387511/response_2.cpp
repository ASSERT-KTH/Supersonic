The provided code implements a shell sort algorithm, which is a variation of insertion sort. The algorithm sorts an array of integers in ascending order and also counts the number of comparisons made during the sorting process. The sorted array and the number of comparisons made are then printed as output.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified a few areas for potential optimization:

1. Inefficient Memory Usage: The code uses a vector `G` to store the gap sequence for shell sort. However, since the size of the gap sequence is known beforehand, it would be more efficient to use a static array instead of a vector.

2. Redundant Variable: The variable `cnt` is used to count the number of comparisons made during the sorting process. However, it is unnecessary to have this variable as a global variable. It can be moved inside the `selectionSort` function as a local variable.

3. Inefficient Swapping: The swapping of elements in the `insertionSort` function can be optimized. Instead of using a temporary variable `tmp` for swapping, we can directly swap the elements using XOR swapping.

4. Unnecessary Loop: The `selectionSort` function uses an infinite loop with a break statement. Instead, it can be rewritten as a for loop with a condition based on the gap sequence.
