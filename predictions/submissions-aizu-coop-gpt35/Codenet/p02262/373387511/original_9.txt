The provided code implements a sorting algorithm called Shell Sort. The main optimization opportunities in this code can be summarized as follows:

1. Reducing the number of memory allocations: The code uses a vector `G` to store the sequence of gap values used in the Shell Sort algorithm. However, this vector is not necessary as we can calculate the gap values on the fly without storing them in a separate container.

2. Minimizing unnecessary data copying: The code swaps elements in the array `a` during the sorting process. However, swapping elements is an expensive operation. Instead of swapping, we can shift elements to the right to make room for the current element being inserted.

3. Avoiding unnecessary comparisons and iterations: The code uses a `while` loop to find the correct position to insert an element in the sorted subarray. However, this loop can be optimized by using a single comparison and a single assignment to shift elements.

4. Reducing redundant calculations: The code calculates the size of the vector `G` multiple times in the main function. This calculation can be done once and stored in a variable for reuse.

Based on these optimization opportunities, let's proceed with the step-by-step optimization process.
