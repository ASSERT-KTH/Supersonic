The code provided implements a selection sort algorithm with a variation of the insertion sort algorithm called shell sort. The shell sort algorithm is used to sort the elements in the array `a` in ascending order. The code prints the sorted array, the number of comparisons made during the sorting process, and the elements of the original array.

To optimize the code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The `G` vector is used to store the gap values for the shell sort algorithm. Instead of using a vector, we can use a fixed-size array since the number of gap values is known in advance.

2. Minimize memory access: The `a` array is accessed multiple times during the sorting process. By initializing a local variable `tmp` in the `insertionSort` function and using it for swapping elements, we can reduce memory access and improve performance.

3. Simplify and optimize the sorting loops: The current implementation of the sorting loops can be simplified to improve performance. We can use the decrementing loop counter instead of using `i - g` as the termination condition in the `insertionSort` function. Additionally, we can use the prefix increment operator `++j` instead of `j = j - g` to reduce the number of operations.

4. Utilize compiler optimizations: We can use compiler-specific optimizations, such as loop unrolling and compiler pragmas, to hint the compiler to optimize the code further.

By applying these optimizations, we can improve the performance and memory usage of the code.
