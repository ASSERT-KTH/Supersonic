The provided code performs a shell sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The shell sort algorithm works by sorting subarrays with a decreasing gap sequence, known as the "G" sequence in this code. The number of swaps performed during the sorting process is counted and stored in the variable "cnt". The sorted array, the size of the G sequence, and the value of cnt are printed at the end.

To optimize this code for efficiency, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Replace variable-length arrays: The code uses a variable-length array `int a[n]`. Variable-length arrays are not part of the C++ standard and can lead to inefficient memory usage. We can replace this with a `std::vector<int>` to dynamically allocate memory and improve performance.

2. Avoid unnecessary swaps: The current code performs swaps even when the elements are already in the correct order. We can optimize the insertion sort algorithm to avoid unnecessary swaps by breaking out of the inner while loop when the condition `a[j - g] > a[j]` is false.

3. Optimize loop indices: The code uses multiple loop indices, such as `i`, `j`, and `h`. We can optimize the loop indices by using more descriptive variable names and considering loop unrolling if applicable.

4. Use `std::swap` for swapping elements: Instead of using a temporary variable to perform swaps, we can use the `std::swap` function from the `<algorithm>` header. This can improve code readability and potentially lead to better compiler optimizations.

5. Use iterators instead of indexing: Instead of accessing elements of the vector `G` using indexing, we can use iterators. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary bounds checking.

6. Consider compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations, such as inline functions and loop unrolling, to improve performance. We can also use compiler-specific pragmas or directives to provide hints to the compiler for optimization.

Here's the optimized code with the aforementioned changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int cnt;
std::vector<int> G;

void insertionSort(std::vector<int>& a, int g, int n) {
    for (int i = g - 1; i < n; i++) {
        int j = i;
        while (j - g >= 0 && a[j - g] > a[j]) {
            std::swap(a[j], a[j - g]);
            j = j - g;
            cnt++;
        }
    }
}

void selectionSort(std::vector<int>& a, int n) {
    cnt = 0;
    for (int h = 1;;) {
        if (h > n)
            break;
        G.push_back(h);
        h = 3 * h + 1;
    }
    for (int i = G.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        insertionSort(a, G[i], n);
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> a[i];
    }
    selectionSort(a, n);
    std::cout << G.size() << std::endl;
    std::cout << G.back();
    for (auto it = G.rbegin() + 1; it != G.rend(); ++it) {
        std::cout << " " << *it;
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
    std::cout << cnt << std::endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cout << a[i] << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have improved the memory usage by replacing the variable-length array with a `std::vector` and reduced unnecessary swaps in the insertion sort algorithm. We have also improved code readability and utilized standard library functions for swapping elements and iterating over the `G` vector. Compiler optimizations and pragmas can be added based on the specific compiler and platform used to further enhance the performance.
