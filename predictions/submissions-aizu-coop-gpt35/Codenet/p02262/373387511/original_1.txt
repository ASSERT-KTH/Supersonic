The given code implements a sorting algorithm known as Shell Sort. Shell Sort is an optimization of Insertion Sort, where the array is sorted in multiple passes with decreasing gap values. The gap values are generated using the formula `h = 3 * h + 1`, where `h` starts with 1 and increases until it exceeds the array size. The code uses an array `a` to store the input elements and sorts this array using the Shell Sort algorithm.

To optimize this code for efficiency, we can make the following improvements:

1. Replace Variable-Length Arrays (VLAs) with Dynamic Memory Allocation: The code uses a variable-length array `a[n]` to store the input elements. Variable-length arrays are not standard in C++, and their usage can result in inefficient memory allocation on the stack. Instead of VLAs, we can use dynamic memory allocation to create an array of size `n`.

2. Avoid Unnecessary Vector Resizing: The vector `G` is used to store the gap values. In the current code, the vector is resized multiple times within the selectionSort function, which can lead to unnecessary memory reallocations and inefficiency. We can pre-calculate the gap values and initialize the vector with the correct size once before the sorting process.

3. Optimize Insertion Sort: The insertionSort function can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary array accesses and reducing the number of assignments. Instead of swapping elements using temporary variables, we can directly shift the elements to their correct positions.

4. Minimize Redundant Computations: The code currently recomputes `G.size()` multiple times in the main function. We can store the value in a variable to avoid redundant computations.

5. Use Pragma Directives for Loop Optimization: We can use pragmas to provide hints to the compiler for loop optimizations. For example, we can use `#pragma unroll` to enable loop unrolling, which can improve performance by reducing loop overhead.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code.
