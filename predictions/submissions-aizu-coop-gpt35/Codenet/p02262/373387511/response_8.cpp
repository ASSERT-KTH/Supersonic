The given code implements a shell sort algorithm using the Shell's original sequence for gap generation. The code reads an integer `n` from the user, followed by an array of `n` integers. It then sorts the array using the shell sort algorithm and prints the number of gaps used (`G.size()`), the largest gap (`G[G.size() - 1]`), the gaps in descending order, the number of comparisons made during the sorting process (`cnt`), and the sorted array.

To optimize this code for efficiency, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid using `vector<int>` for storing the gaps (`G`): Since the maximum number of gaps is known in advance (log3(n)), we can use a fixed-size array instead of a dynamically resizing vector. This will eliminate the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

2. Avoid unnecessary swapping in the insertion sort: The current implementation uses a swap operation to place the elements in the correct position during the insertion sort. Instead, we can use a temporary variable to store the value being inserted and shift the elements to the right. This eliminates the need for swapping and reduces memory access overhead.

3. Optimize the selection of gaps: The current implementation generates the gaps using the original Shell's sequence. However, this sequence is not the most efficient for all inputs. We can replace it with a more efficient sequence, such as the Marcin Ciura sequence, which has been empirically determined to perform well in practice.

4. Use `std::array` instead of C-style arrays: To improve code readability and safety, we can use `std::array` instead of C-style arrays. This will allow us to pass the array by reference to functions, eliminating the need to pass the array size explicitly.
