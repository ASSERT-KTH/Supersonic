Analysis:
- The program uses the Shell Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.
- The `insertionSort` function performs the insertion sort for a given array and a gap value.
- The `ShellSort` function calculates the gap sequence and calls `insertionSort` for each gap value.
- The program also includes a global variable `count` to keep track of the number of comparisons made during sorting.
- The sorted array is printed along with the number of comparisons made.

Potential optimizations:
1. Remove unused variables: The variables `temp_temp` and `temp` are not used anywhere else in the program and can be removed.

2. Avoid redundant computations:
   - The current implementation calculates the gap sequence in the `ShellSort` function every time. We can calculate it once and store it in an array for reuse.
   - The `num < h[i]` check in the second loop of `ShellSort` can be optimized. Instead of starting from the first element and checking each gap value, we can start from `temp` and decrement the value until it becomes larger than `num`.

3. Improve memory allocation:
   - The current implementation uses dynamic memory allocation for the input array `arr`. However, since the size of the array is known beforehand, we can use a fixed-size array instead.

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - Use compiler optimizations like `-O3` to enable aggressive optimizations by the compiler.
