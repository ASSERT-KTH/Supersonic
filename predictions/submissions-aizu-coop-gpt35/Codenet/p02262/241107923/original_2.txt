Code Analysis:
- The code implements the Shell Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.
- The Shell Sort algorithm starts by dividing the array into smaller subarrays and then performs insertion sort on each subarray.
- The main function takes input from the user, allocates memory for the array, calls the ShellSort function, and then prints the sorted array and some additional information.
- The ShellSort function initializes an array `h` with a sequence of decreasing values, and then iterates over these values to call the insertionSort function.
- The insertionSort function performs the insertion sort algorithm on the array.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary global variables: The variables `count`, `temp`, and `temp_temp` are declared as global but are only used within the ShellSort function. It is better to declare them as local variables within the function.
2. Use dynamic memory allocation for the `h` array: The current implementation assumes a fixed size of 20 for the `h` array. Instead, we can dynamically allocate memory for the `h` array based on the number of iterations required.
3. Optimize the loop in the ShellSort function: The loop that finds the value of `temp` can be optimized to break out early if the condition is satisfied. Additionally, the loop that initializes the `h` array can be optimized to calculate the values directly without the need for the previous values.
4. Optimize the insertionSort function: The insertionSort function can be optimized by reducing the number of memory accesses and eliminating unnecessary computations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary global variables:
   - Remove the declarations of `count`, `temp`, and `temp_temp` from the global scope.
   - Declare them as local variables in the ShellSort function.
   - Update references to these variables accordingly.

2. Use dynamic memory allocation for the `h` array:
   - Replace the fixed-size array declaration `int h[20]` with a pointer `int* h`.
   - Allocate memory for the `h` array dynamically based on the number of iterations required.
   - Update references to the `h` array accordingly.
   - Free the allocated memory at the end of the ShellSort function.

3. Optimize the loop in the ShellSort function:
   - Replace the loop that finds the value of `temp` with a more efficient approach.
     - Start `i` from 19 and decrement it until `h[i] <= num`.
     - Set `temp = i - 1` after the loop.
   - Replace the loop that initializes the `h` array with a more efficient approach.
     - Start `i` from `temp` and decrement it until `i >= 0`.
     - Calculate `h[i] = 3 * h[i + 1] + 1` directly.
     - This eliminates the need for the previous values of `h`.

4. Optimize the insertionSort function:
   - Replace the loop variable `i` with a local variable `j`.
   - Move the assignment `v = arr[i]` outside the loop.
   - Eliminate the repeated memory access `arr[j + (*h)]` by introducing a temporary variable.
   - Avoid the redundant subtraction `j = j - (*h)` by using a separate variable for the decrement.
   - Update references to `i` and `v` accordingly.
