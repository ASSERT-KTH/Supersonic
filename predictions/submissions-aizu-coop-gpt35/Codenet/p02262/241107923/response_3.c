Analysis:
1. The code uses two sorting algorithms: Shell Sort and Insertion Sort. Shell Sort is a variation of Insertion Sort that sorts elements at a specific interval. Insertion Sort is used to sort the elements within each interval.
2. The code initializes an array `h` of size 20 to store the intervals used in Shell Sort.
3. The code reads an integer `num` from input, allocates memory for an array `arr` of size `num`, and reads `num` integers into `arr`.
4. The code calls `ShellSort` to sort the array `arr`.
5. The code prints the number of intervals used (`temp_temp + 1`), the sorted array in reverse order, the number of comparisons made during sorting (`count`), and the original array.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid using a global variable `count`. Instead, pass it as a parameter to the `insertionSort` function and update it within the function.
2. Avoid using multiple global variables (`count`, `temp`, `temp_temp`). They can be declared as local variables within the `main` function and passed as parameters when required.
3. Avoid using a fixed size array `h` of size 20. Instead, calculate the required size dynamically based on the maximum interval needed.
4. Use a more efficient sorting algorithm like Quick Sort or Merge Sort instead of Insertion Sort for larger arrays.

Optimization strategy:
1. Pass `count`, `temp`, and `temp_temp` as parameters to the `insertionSort` function instead of declaring them as global variables.
2. Calculate the required size of the array `h` dynamically instead of using a fixed size of 20.
3. Replace the Insertion Sort algorithm with a more efficient sorting algorithm like Quick Sort or Merge Sort.
4. Remove unnecessary variables and statements.

Step-by-step explanation of optimizations:
1. Remove the global variables `count`, `temp`, and `temp_temp`. Declare them as local variables within the `main` function and pass them as parameters to the `insertionSort` function when required.
2. Calculate the required size of the array `h` dynamically instead of using a fixed size of 20. Modify the code as follows:
   - Replace the line `int h[20];` with `int* h = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * num);`.
   - Replace the loop `for (i = 0; i < 20; i++)` with `for (i = 0; i < num; i++)`.
   - Remove the loop `for (i = 0; i < 20; i++)` after the previous loop.
3. Replace the Insertion Sort algorithm with a more efficient sorting algorithm like Quick Sort or Merge Sort. Here, we will use the Quick Sort algorithm.
   - Add a function `quickSort` to perform the Quick Sort algorithm.
   - Modify the `ShellSort` function as follows:
     - Remove the call to `insertionSort` and replace it with a call to `quickSort`.
     - Remove the parameter `h` from the `insertionSort` function.
4. Remove unnecessary variables and statements:
   - Remove the variable `j` from the `insertionSort` function.
   - Remove the `if (i == temp)` condition and the `temp_temp` variable from the `ShellSort` function.
