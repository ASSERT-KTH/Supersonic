The given code appears to be a simple program that reads a series of integers from the user, stores them in an array, and then calculates the sum of all the integers in the array. However, there are several areas where this code can be optimized for efficiency.

1. Data Structures:
   - The code uses a simple array `c` to keep track of the occurrences of each number. However, since the maximum possible value of `b` is not specified, using a fixed-size array of size 999 may not be efficient. Instead, we can use a dynamic data structure like a hash table or a dynamic array to store the occurrences of each number. This will ensure that memory is allocated only for the actual number of unique elements encountered.
   - Additionally, the array `c` is being used to store boolean values (1 or 0) to indicate whether a number has been encountered or not. This is inefficient in terms of memory usage. Instead, we can use a bitset or a bitmask to represent the presence or absence of a number.

2. Redundant Computation:
   - The code unnecessarily reads the value of `b` in every iteration of the loops. Instead, we can move the input statement outside the loops and assign the value to a separate variable before starting the loops. This will avoid redundant computation and improve performance.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The loops in the code are simple for-loops that iterate over the range `[0, a)`. These loops can be optimized using loop unrolling. Loop unrolling is a technique where multiple iterations of a loop are combined into a single iteration. This reduces the number of loop control instructions and improves performance.
