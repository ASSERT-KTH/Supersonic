The provided code reads in two arrays, S and T, and counts the number of elements in T that are also present in S. The code uses nested loops to compare each element of S with each element of T, and increments a counter variable, C, whenever a match is found.

Here are the potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization in the code:

1. Memory Usage: The code declares two arrays, S and T, with a fixed size of 100. This limits the program's ability to handle larger inputs. The size of the arrays should be dynamically allocated based on the input size.

2. Linear Search: The code uses a linear search algorithm to find matches between the elements of S and T. This has a time complexity of O(n*q), where n is the size of S and q is the size of T. This algorithm is inefficient for large inputs.

3. Redundant Variable: The variable 't' is declared but never used in the code. It can be safely removed to improve code readability.

4. Compiler Optimization: The code does not use any compiler optimizations. Enabling compiler optimizations can help improve the performance of the code.

To optimize the code, we can follow the following steps:

Step 1: Dynamically allocate memory for arrays S and T based on the input size.

Step 2: Use a more efficient algorithm to count the number of matches between S and T. One approach is to use a hash set to store the elements of S, and then iterate over the elements of T to check if they exist in the hash set. This reduces the time complexity to O(n + q).

Step 3: Enable compiler optimizations to further improve the performance of the code.
