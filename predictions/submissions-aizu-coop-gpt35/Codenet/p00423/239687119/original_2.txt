The given code reads a series of pairs of integers from the user until the user enters a 0. For each pair, it calculates the sum of the integers and updates the variables `a` and `b` based on the comparison of the integers. At the end, it stores the final values of `a` and `b` in two separate vectors and prints the contents of the vectors.

Here are some potential optimizations for this code:

1. Avoid unnecessary vector resizing: The code currently uses two vectors (`veca` and `vecb`) to store the intermediate results. However, since the number of iterations is known in advance (based on the input value of `n`), we can pre-allocate the vectors with the required size to avoid repeated resizing.

2. Simplify the logic to update `a` and `b`: The code contains multiple if-else conditions to update `a` and `b` based on the values of `game_a` and `game_b`. This logic can be simplified to make it more efficient.

3. Modify the loop termination condition: Instead of using `while (1)` and breaking the loop when `n` is 0, we can modify the loop termination condition to directly check for `n` being non-zero.

4. Optimize the loop iteration: The loop that prints the contents of the vectors can be optimized by using pre-increment (`++i`) instead of post-increment (`i++`) to avoid the overhead of creating a temporary copy of `i`.

Here's the optimized code with the optimizations applied:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  int a = 0;
  int b = 0;
  std::vector<int> veca, vecb;

  while (std::cin >> n && n != 0) {
    veca.reserve(n);
    vecb.reserve(n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      int game_a, game_b;
      std::cin >> game_a >> game_b;

      int sum = game_a + game_b;
      a += sum;
      b += sum;

      if (game_a < game_b) {
        a -= sum;
      } else if (game_a > game_b) {
        b -= sum;
      }
    }

    veca.push_back(a);
    vecb.push_back(b);

    a = 0;
    b = 0;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < veca.size(); ++i) {
    std::cout << veca[i] << " " << vecb[i] << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Let's go through the optimizations step-by-step:

1. Avoid unnecessary vector resizing:
   - We modified the code to reserve space in the vectors `veca` and `vecb` before the inner loop starts.
   - By reserving space, we avoid the overhead of resizing the vectors during each iteration of the inner loop.

2. Simplify the logic to update `a` and `b`:
   - We simplified the logic by calculating the sum of `game_a` and `game_b` only once and storing it in the `sum` variable.
   - Instead of updating `a` and `b` separately based on the comparison, we always add `sum` to both `a` and `b` and then subtract `sum` from the appropriate variable based on the comparison.
   - This eliminates the need for separate if-else conditions and reduces the number of arithmetic operations.

3. Modify the loop termination condition:
   - We modified the loop termination condition of the `while` loop to directly check for `n` being non-zero.
   - This simplifies the code and avoids the need for an explicit `break` statement.

4. Optimize the loop iteration:
   - We changed the post-increment (`i++`) in the loop that prints the contents of the vectors to pre-increment (`++i`).
   - Pre-increment is generally more efficient as it avoids the overhead of creating a temporary copy of `i`.

These optimizations help improve the performance and memory usage of the code without changing the functionality or output.
