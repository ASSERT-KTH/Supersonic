First, let's analyze the code and identify potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `#include <complex>`. We should only include the necessary header files to reduce compilation time and avoid namespace pollution.

2. The code uses a lot of unnecessary type aliases. For example, `using ll = long long` and `using ld = long double`. These aliases are not used in the code, so we should remove them to reduce unnecessary code complexity.

3. The code uses a lot of unnecessary `using` statements. For example, `using namespace std` and `using namespace complex`. These using statements can cause naming conflicts and make the code less readable. We should remove them and use the `std::` prefix when necessary.

4. The code uses `random_shuffle` to shuffle the input points. However, `random_shuffle` has been deprecated since C++14 and removed in C++17. We should use the `shuffle` function from the `<algorithm>` header instead.

5. The `chk` function has a nested loop that iterates over `b` for each element in `a`. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the size of `b`. We can optimize this by using two pointers technique to find the next element in `b` for each element in `a`. This will reduce the time complexity to O(nlogn).

6. The code uses a boolean array `used` to keep track of used elements. However, we can use a `std::set` or `std::unordered_set` to improve the lookup time when checking if an element is used.

7. The code sorts the arrays `a` and `b` in each call to the `chk` function. However, we can sort them once before the main loop and then use binary search to find the next element in `b` for each element in `a`. This will reduce the time complexity of sorting from O(nlogn) to O(n).

Based on the above analysis, we can now formulate an optimization strategy:

1. Replace unnecessary header files with the necessary ones.
2. Remove unnecessary type aliases and `using` statements.
3. Replace `random_shuffle` with `shuffle`.
4. Optimize the `chk` function by using the two pointers technique and using a `std::set` or `std::unordered_set` for `used` elements.
5. Sort the arrays `a` and `b` once before the main loop and use binary search to find the next element in `b` for each element in `a`.
