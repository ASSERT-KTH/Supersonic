The given code appears to solve a problem involving finding the smallest enclosing disc that contains a set of points. The program reads the input, calculates the smallest enclosing disc for each set of points, and checks if there is a valid solution that satisfies certain conditions.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations.
2. Optimize the loop iterations and conditions.
3. Minimize the number of function calls.
4. Optimize data structures and algorithms where possible.

Let's go step by step to optimize the code:

Step 1: Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations
- The `vector<int> b` and `vector<ld> a` are allocated and deallocated in the `chk` function repeatedly in each iteration of the outer loop. We can move these vector declarations outside the loop to avoid unnecessary memory reallocations.

Step 2: Optimize loop iterations and conditions
- The loop in the `smallest_enclosing_disc` function uses a random shuffle on the input points. This is not necessary for finding the smallest enclosing disc, and it introduces unnecessary randomness and potential performance degradation. We can remove the `random_shuffle` call.

Step 3: Minimize the number of function calls
- The `norm` function is called multiple times in the `c3` function. We can store the `norm` of each point in a variable before the loop to avoid redundant function calls.

Step 4: Optimize data structures and algorithms
- The current implementation uses a brute-force approach to find the smallest enclosing disc. This can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm, such as Welzl's algorithm or the QuickHull algorithm. However, implementing these algorithms would require a significant rewrite of the code. Since our goal is to make minimal yet effective changes, we will not focus on this optimization for now.
