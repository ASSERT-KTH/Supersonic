The given code is written in C++ and appears to solve a problem related to finding the smallest enclosing circle. However, the code contains some areas that can be optimized for better performance and memory usage.

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The code uses a `vector<P>` to store points, which are represented as complex numbers. This is an efficient representation, but the vector is copied and shuffled multiple times, which can be avoided.
   - The code uses a `vector<int>` to store the results. Instead, we can directly output the results without storing them.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `chk` function performs repeated sorting of the `a` and `b` vectors. We can optimize this by sorting the `b` vector only once, before entering the loop.
   - The `in_circle` function performs a square root operation in every iteration of the loop. We can avoid this by comparing the squared distances instead.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The nested loops in the `smallest_enclosing_disc` function can be optimized by breaking out of the inner loops once a valid circle is found.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can leverage compiler optimizations by enabling compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to enable aggressive optimizations.

Now, let's proceed with optimizing the code step by step.

Optimization Steps:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a lot of unnecessary standard library headers. We can remove it and only include the required headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The `dump` macro is not used in the code and can be safely removed.

3. Optimize the `smallest_enclosing_disc` function:
   - Instead of copying and shuffling the input vector `ps` in every function call, we can pass it by reference and shuffle it once outside the function.
   - In the `c3` function, we can break out of the loop as soon as a valid circle is found, instead of continuing the loop.
   - In the `c2` function, we can replace the division by `(ld)2` with multiplication by `0.5`.
   - In the `in_circle` function, we can compare the squared distances instead of using the `norm` function and comparing with `eps`.

4. Optimize the `chk` function:
   - Sort the `b` vector only once, before entering the loop.
   - Compare the squared distances instead of using the `eps` constant.

5. Optimize the main function:
   - Instead of storing the results in a vector and then printing them, we can directly output the results.
   - Remove the unnecessary `used` array and directly check if a radius is used by comparing it with `-1`.
