The provided code appears to be a program that solves a problem related to finding the smallest enclosing disc of a set of points. The program takes as input the number of circles and points, the radii of the circles, and the coordinates of the points. It then calculates the minimum enclosing disc for each set of points and checks if the radius of the disc is smaller than the radius of any remaining circle. If it is, the circle is marked as used and the process is repeated for the next set of points until all circles are used or no solution is found.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary calculations:
   - The `norm` function is called multiple times in the code. We can calculate it once and store the result in a variable to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The `abs` function is also called multiple times. We can replace it with the more efficient `std::hypot` function, which calculates the length of the vector without squaring the components.
   - The `cross` and `dot` functions are called in each iteration of the `c3` function. We can optimize this by calculating the cross product and dot product directly without using the functions.

2. Use more efficient data structures:
   - The `vector` class is used to store the points and circles. However, the `std::vector` class has some overhead due to its dynamic resizing capabilities. Since the size of the vectors is known in advance, we can use plain arrays instead to reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.
   - The `std::vector` used to store the indices of the circles can be replaced with a fixed-size array, as the size is known in advance.

3. Optimize loops and conditions:
   - The nested loops in the `smallest_enclosing_disc` function can be optimized by breaking out of the inner loops early if a condition is met. This reduces the number of iterations and improves the overall performance.
   - The condition `!(mb[i] < r[j] + eps)` can be simplified to `mb[i] >= r[j] + eps` to avoid the negation and improve readability.

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - We can use compiler-specific optimizations, such as loop unrolling and vectorization, to further improve the performance. This can be achieved by using compiler flags or pragmas.
