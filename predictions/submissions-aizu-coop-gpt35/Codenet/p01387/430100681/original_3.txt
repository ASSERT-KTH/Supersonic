The given code implements the Centroid Path Decomposition algorithm to solve a query problem on a tree. The main performance bottleneck in this code is the usage of the `OrderedMultiSet` data structure, which has a time complexity of O(logN) for each operation. This leads to a total time complexity of O(QlogN), where Q is the number of queries and N is the number of nodes in the tree.

To optimize the code, we can replace the `OrderedMultiSet` data structure with a more efficient alternative that has a faster time complexity. Additionally, we can make some other minor optimizations to improve the overall performance. The optimization steps are as follows:

1. Replace `OrderedMultiSet` with `std::multiset`: The `std::multiset` data structure in the C++ standard library provides similar functionality to `OrderedMultiSet`, but with faster average time complexities. The `std::multiset` operations have an average time complexity of O(logN), which is the same as `OrderedMultiSet`, but the constant factors are smaller. This will result in a significant improvement in the overall performance.

2. Use `std::vector` instead of `std::stack` for stack-based operations: The `std::vector` data structure can be used instead of `std::stack` for stack-based operations, such as building the subtree size and path. `std::vector` has a similar time complexity for these operations, but it avoids the overhead of stack operations. This will result in a minor improvement in performance.

3. Replace `scanf` with `std::cin` and `printf` with `std::cout`: The `std::cin` and `std::cout` stream objects in the C++ standard library are generally faster than the `scanf` and `printf` functions from the C standard library. This is because the stream objects perform buffering, which reduces the number of system calls and improves I/O performance. Changing the I/O functions may result in a minor improvement in overall performance.

4. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back` for vectors: The `emplace_back` function in the `std::vector` data structure constructs the object directly in place, avoiding unnecessary copy or move operations. This can result in a minor improvement in performance.

5. Remove unnecessary code and variables: There are some variables and code blocks in the given code that are not used or are redundant. Removing these unnecessary parts will result in cleaner and more efficient code.

Here is the optimized code with the above-mentioned optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

struct CentroidPathDecomposition {
  struct Centroid {
    int ParIndex, ParDepth, Deep;
    vector<int> node;
    Centroid(int idx, int dep, int deep)
        : ParIndex(idx), ParDepth(dep), Deep(deep) {}
    inline size_t size() { return (node.size()); }
    inline int &operator[](int k) { return (node[k]); }
    inline pair<int, int> Up() { return (make_pair(ParIndex, ParDepth)); }
  };
  vector<vector<int>> graph;
  vector<int> SubTreeSize, NextPath;
  vector<int> TreeIndex, TreeDepth;
  vector<Centroid> Centroids;
  void BuildSubTreeSize() {
    vector<pair<int, int>> s;
    s.emplace_back(0, -1);
    while (!s.empty()) {
      auto p = s.back();
      s.pop_back();
      if (~SubTreeSize[p.first])
