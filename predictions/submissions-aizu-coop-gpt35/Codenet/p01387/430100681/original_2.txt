After analyzing the given code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Random Number Generation: The `xor128()` function is used to generate random numbers. However, this implementation is not efficient and can be optimized.

2. Memory Usage: The code uses a large vector called `pool` to store nodes. This vector can be replaced with a more memory-efficient data structure.

3. Redundant Computations: There are several redundant computations happening in the code, such as repeatedly calling the `count()` function. These computations can be optimized to improve performance.

4. Unnecessary Memory Allocation: The `clone()` function is used to create a new node by copying an existing node. However, this is unnecessary and can be avoided.

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `xor128()` function with a more efficient random number generator, such as the Mersenne Twister or the C++11 random library.

2. Replace the vector `pool` with a more memory-efficient data structure, such as an array or a custom memory pool.

3. Optimize the redundant computations by caching the results and avoiding unnecessary function calls.

4. Remove the `clone()` function and modify the code to avoid unnecessary memory allocation.

5. Apply compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization, to further improve performance.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code.
