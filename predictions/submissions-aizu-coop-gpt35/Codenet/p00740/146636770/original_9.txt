Analysis:
- The code uses a while loop to continuously read inputs until n and p both become zero.
- Inside the loop, it initializes an array of 50 integers called "stone" and sets all elements to zero.
- It then reads the values of n and p from the user.
- The code then enters a loop that continues until a condition is met.
- Inside this loop, it checks if the "bowl" variable is zero. If it is, it adds the value of stone[i] to bowl and sets stone[i] to zero.
- If bowl is not zero, it increments stone[i] by one and decrements bowl by one.
- If bowl becomes zero and stone[i] becomes equal to p, it sets the ans variable to the value of i and exits the loop.
- After that, there is a nested loop that performs a large number of unnecessary computations. It adds i and j and assigns the result to the variable k, but k is not used anywhere in the code.
- Finally, the code prints the value of ans.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient Array Initialization:
   - The array "stone" is initialized to zero in every iteration of the while loop, which is unnecessary.
   - We can move the initialization outside the while loop to save unnecessary computations.

2. Redundant Computation:
   - The nested loop that performs unnecessary computations can be removed as it does not contribute to the functionality of the program.

3. Compiler Optimization:
   - We can suggest the compiler to optimize the code by using appropriate compiler flags or pragma directives.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Move Array Initialization:
   - Move the initialization of the "stone" array outside the while loop.
   - This will prevent unnecessary re-initialization of the array in each iteration.
   - Initialize the array only once before the while loop.

2. Remove Redundant Computation:
   - Remove the nested loop that calculates the value of k.
   - This computation is not used anywhere in the code and does not contribute to the functionality of the program.

3. Compiler Optimization:
   - Add compiler optimization flags or pragma directives to suggest the compiler to optimize the code.
   - This can include flags like -O2 or -O3 for GCC or Clang compilers, or pragma directives specific to the compiler being used.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  int stone[50] = {0}; // Initialize the "stone" array only once
  int bowl;
  int n, p;
  
  while (1) {
    cin >> n;
    cin >> p;
    if (n == 0 && p == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    bowl = p;
    bool flg = true;
    int ans;
    for (int i = 0; flg; i = (i + 1) % n) {
      if (bowl == 0) {
        bowl = bowl + stone[i];
        stone[i] = 0;
      } else {
        stone[i]++;
        bowl--;
        if (bowl == 0 && stone[i] == p) {
          ans = i;
          flg = false;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

Note: Compiler optimization flags and pragma directives will depend on the compiler being used and the specific optimization level desired. Please consult the compiler documentation for the appropriate flags or directives to use.
