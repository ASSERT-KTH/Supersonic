Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage can be identified:

1. Redundant computations in the `ccw` function:
   The `ccw` function computes the cross product of two vectors and performs various comparisons. However, some of these computations are redundant and can be optimized.

2. Inefficient data structure for storing existing intersection points:
   The code uses a vector `exist` to store existing intersection points. However, checking for the existence of a point in the vector requires iterating over all elements, resulting in a linear search. This can be improved by using a more efficient data structure like a set or unordered_set.

3. Inefficient loop structure:
   The code uses nested loops to check for intersections between line segments. This results in redundant computations and increases the time complexity of the algorithm.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Optimize the `ccw` function:
   - Remove unnecessary comparisons and computations.
   - Simplify the return statements by directly returning the result of the comparisons.

2. Replace the vector `exist` with a set or unordered_set:
   - This will improve the efficiency of searching for existing intersection points.

3. Optimize the loop structure:
   - Avoid redundant computations by iterating over the segments in a different order.
   - Use a set or unordered_set to avoid duplicate intersection points.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization:

1. Optimization of the `ccw` function:
   - The `ccw` function can be optimized by removing unnecessary comparisons and computations. The simplified version of the function is as follows:

   ```cpp
   int ccw(P p, P q, P r) {
     double val = cross(q - p, r - p);
     if (val > EPS)
       return COUNTER_CLOCKWISE;
     if (val < -EPS)
       return CLOCKWISE;
     if (dot(q - p, r - p) < -EPS)
       return ONLINE_BACK;
     if (norm(q - p) < norm(r - p))
       return ONLINE_FRONT;
     return ON_SEGMENT;
   }
   ```

2. Replacement of the vector `exist` with a set or unordered_set:
   - Replace the declaration `vector<P> exist;` with `set<P> exist;` or `unordered_set<P> exist;`.
   - Update the code to use `exist.insert(xp)` to insert a new intersection point and `exist.count(xp)` to check if a point already exists.

3. Optimization of the loop structure:
   - Change the loop structure to iterate over the segments in a different order to avoid redundant computations.
   - Use a set or unordered_set to store the intersection points instead of a vector.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the code:
