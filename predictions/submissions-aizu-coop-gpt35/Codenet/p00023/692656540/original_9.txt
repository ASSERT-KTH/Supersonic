The provided code calculates the relationship between two circles given their coordinates and radii. It takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the coordinates and radii of two circles and calculates the distance between their centers. Based on this distance and the radii of the circles, it determines the relationship between the circles and stores the result in an array `ans`. Finally, it prints the elements of `ans` one by one.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoiding unnecessary calculations: The code currently calculates the square root of the sum of squares for the coordinates difference between two circles. We can avoid this expensive calculation by comparing the squared distance with the squared sum of radii.

2. Minimizing memory usage: The code uses an array `d` to store the distances between the centers and the sum/difference of radii. Since we only need to store these values temporarily, we can eliminate the array and calculate the values directly in the conditional statements.

3. Avoiding unnecessary memory allocation: The code currently declares an array `ans` to store the result for each test case. Instead, we can calculate and print the result directly without storing it in an array.

Let's now proceed with the optimization steps:
