To optimize the given code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Replace the AVL tree with a more efficient data structure: The AVL tree used in the code has a complexity of O(log n) for both insertion and deletion operations. We can replace it with a more efficient data structure, such as a segment tree or a Fenwick tree, which can perform these operations in O(log n) time as well.

2. Reduce the number of unnecessary function calls: The current implementation makes multiple recursive calls and function calls to update and fix the AVL tree. We can optimize this by reducing the number of function calls and minimizing unnecessary computations.

3. Optimize the find function: The find function in the current implementation makes recursive calls to find the desired element or range in the AVL tree. We can optimize this function by finding the element or range in a single pass, instead of making multiple recursive calls.

4. Use more efficient I/O operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations are generally slower compared to other I/O operations. We can use `scanf` and `printf` for faster I/O.

Here is the optimized code with explanations of each optimization step:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <limits.h>

struct SegmentTree {
  int* tree;
  int size;

  SegmentTree(int n) {
    size = 1;
    while (size < n) {
      size *= 2;
    }
    tree = (int*)calloc(2 * size, sizeof(int));
  }

  void update(int index, int value) {
    index += size;
    tree[index] = value;
    while (index > 1) {
      index /= 2;
      tree[index] = min(tree[index * 2], tree[index * 2 + 1]);
    }
  }

  int query(int left, int right) {
    int result = INT_MAX;
    left += size;
    right += size;
    while (left <= right) {
      if (left % 2 == 1) {
        result = min(result, tree[left]);
        left++;
      }
      if (right % 2 == 0) {
        result = min(result, tree[right]);
        right--;
      }
      left /= 2;
      right /= 2;
    }
    return result;
  }
};

int main() {
  int n, q;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &q);
  SegmentTree tree(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int a;
    scanf("%d", &a);
    tree.update(i, a);
  }
  while (q--) {
    int x, y, z;
    scanf("%d %d %d", &x, &y, &z);
    if (x == 0) {
      int val = tree.query(z, z);
      tree.update(z, val);
      tree.update(y, val);
    } else if (x == 1) {
      printf("%d\n", tree.query(y, z));
    } else {
      tree.update(y, z);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Replace the AVL tree with a Segment Tree: The AVL tree used in the original code has a complexity of O(log n) for both insertion and deletion operations. We can replace it with a Segment Tree, which has the same complexity for these operations. The Segment Tree is implemented using an array and performs range queries efficiently.

2. Reduce the number of unnecessary function calls: The original code makes multiple recursive calls and function calls to update and fix the AVL tree. In the optimized code, we eliminate these unnecessary calls by updating the Segment Tree directly.

3. Optimize the find function: In the original code, the find function makes recursive calls to find the desired element or range in the AVL tree. In the optimized code, we replace the find function with query function of the Segment Tree, which finds the minimum value in a given range in a single pass.

4. Use more efficient I/O operations: The original code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. In the optimized code, we use `scanf` and `printf` for faster I/O operations.

The optimized code is designed to minimize memory usage and improve running time by using a more efficient data structure and reducing unnecessary function calls.
