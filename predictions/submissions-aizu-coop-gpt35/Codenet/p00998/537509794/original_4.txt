The given code is an implementation of an AVL tree data structure with the ability to perform range minimum queries (RMQ). The program reads an input and performs a sequence of operations on the AVL tree based on the input values.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. The `printf` function call inside the `while` loop can be replaced with `cout` for better performance.
2. The `avl_tree` class uses recursion extensively, which can be inefficient for large data sets. Consider optimizing or replacing recursive calls with iterative approaches.
3. The `avl_tree` class stores the size of each node, which requires additional memory and computation. Consider removing the `size` member variable and calculating the size dynamically when needed.
4. The `avl_tree` class uses a nested struct for nodes, which may lead to inefficient memory usage due to padding. Consider using a packed struct or a class instead.
5. The `avl_tree` class uses a `using` declaration for the type of the AVL tree. Consider using a template parameter to make the class more flexible and reusable.

With these potential optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the optimization strategy.
