The provided code is an implementation of an AVL tree data structure called `avl_tree`. It supports the following operations:

1. `insert(k, b)`: Insert an element `b` at position `k` in the tree.
2. `erase(k)`: Erase the element at position `k` from the tree.
3. `find(k)`: Returns the element at position `k` in the tree.
4. `find(l, r)`: Returns the minimum element between positions `l` and `r` (inclusive) in the tree.

The main function reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers and inserts them into the AVL tree. It then executes `q` queries, each consisting of three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`. The behavior of each query depends on the value of `x`:

- If `x == 0`, it finds the element at position `z`, erases it, and inserts it at position `y`.
- If `x == 1`, it finds the minimum element between positions `y` and `z+1` and prints it.
- If `x == 2`, it erases the element at position `y` and inserts `z` at position `y`.

The overall goal is to optimize the code for efficiency, focusing on reducing running time and minimizing memory usage. 

To achieve this, we can take the following steps:

1. Optimize Memory Usage: The current implementation uses a lot of unnecessary memory. We can reduce memory consumption by making the following changes:
   - Replace the `std::map` implementation of the AVL tree with a more memory-efficient implementation.
   - Use a flat array to store the elements of the AVL tree instead of using dynamically allocated nodes.
   - Remove unnecessary fields from the node structure to reduce memory overhead.

2. Improve Performance: The current implementation can be optimized in several ways to improve performance:
   - Replace the `std::map` implementation with a custom implementation that uses a flat array.
   - Avoid unnecessary recursive calls and improve the efficiency of tree operations.
   - Optimize the input/output operations to reduce their overhead.

Now, let's go step by step and apply these optimizations to the code.
