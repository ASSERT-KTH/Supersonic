Code Analysis:
1. The code uses two recursive functions, `solve` and `solve2`, to solve two related problems.
2. The `solve` function calculates the minimum number of terms from the `p` array that sum up to `n`, using at most `count` terms.
3. The `solve2` function calculates the minimum number of odd terms from the `p` array that sum up to `n`.
4. The code uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
5. The `main` function initializes the `p` array and calls the `solve` and `solve2` functions to solve the two problems for different inputs.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Optimization 1: Use a more efficient data structure for memoization.
    - The current code uses a 2D array `memo` for memoization, which has a size of `1000001` x `6`.
    - Instead of using a 2D array, we can use a 1D array of size `1000001` for memoization.
2. Optimization 2: Remove unnecessary check in `solve` function.
    - The line `if (n <= 0 || !count)` is unnecessary because the condition `if (!n)` covers both cases.
    - We can remove this line to reduce unnecessary checks.
3. Optimization 3: Use loop unrolling in the `solve` and `solve2` functions.
    - The current code uses a loop to iterate over the `p` array.
    - We can unroll the loop by manually iterating over the `p` array for a fixed number of iterations.
    - This can reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
4. Optimization 4: Use pragma directives to enable compiler optimizations.
    - We can use pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
    - For example, we can use `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")` to enable aggressive optimization.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Optimization 1: Use a more efficient data structure for memoization.
    - Replace the `memo` array with a `vector<int>` named `memo` of size `1000001`.
    - This will reduce the memory usage and improve cache locality.
    - Update the references to `memo` array in the code accordingly.
2. Optimization 2: Remove unnecessary check in `solve` function.
    - Remove the line `if (n <= 0 || !count)` from the `solve` function.
    - This condition is already covered by the line `if (!n)`.
3. Optimization 3: Use loop unrolling in the `solve` and `solve2` functions.
    - Replace the `for` loop in `solve` and `solve2` functions with manually unrolled loops.
    - For example, instead of `for (int i = 0; p[i] <= n; i++)`, we can use `for (int i = 0; i <= n; i+=6)`.
    - This will reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
4. Optimization 4: Use pragma directives to enable compiler optimizations.
    - Add `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")` at the beginning of the code.
    - This will enable aggressive optimization by the compiler.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define INF 1 << 28
using namespace std;
int p[1000001];
vector<int> memo(1000001);
int solve(int n, int count) {
  if (!n)
    return 0;
  if (memo[n])
    return memo[n];
  int ans = INF;
  for (int i = 0; i <= n; i+=6) {
    ans = min(ans, solve(n - p[i], count - 1) + 1);
    ans = min(ans, solve(n - p[i + 1], count - 1) + 1);
    ans = min(ans, solve(n - p[i + 2], count - 1) + 1);
    ans = min(ans, solve(n - p[i + 3], count - 1) + 1);
    ans = min(ans, solve(n - p[i + 4], count - 1) + 1);
    ans = min(ans, solve(n - p[i + 5], count - 1) + 1);
  }
  return memo[n] = ans;
}
int solve2(int n) {
  if (!n)
    return 0;
  if (memo[n])
    return memo[n];
  int ans = INF;
  for (int i = 0; i <= n; i+=6) {
    if (!(p[i] % 2))
      continue;
    ans = min(ans, solve2(n - p[i]) + 1);
    ans = min(ans, solve2(n - p[i + 1]) + 1);
    ans = min(ans, solve2(n - p[i + 2]) + 1);
    ans = min(ans, solve2(n - p[i + 3]) + 1);
    ans = min(ans, solve2(n - p[i + 4]) + 1);
    ans = min(ans, solve2(n - p[i + 5]) + 1);
  }
  return memo[n] = ans;
}
int main() {
  #pragma GCC optimize("O3")
  int n;
  for (int i = 0; i <= 1000000; i++)
    p[i] = i * (i + 1) * (i + 2) / 6;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 1000000; i++)
    solve2(i);
  while (cin >> n, n)
    cout << solve(n, 5) << " " << solve2(n) << endl;
}
```

The optimized code makes the following changes:
1. Replaces the `memo` array with a `vector<int>` for more efficient memoization.
2. Removes the unnecessary check in the `solve` function.
3. Unrolls the loop in the `solve` and `solve2` functions.
4. Adds a pragma directive to enable compiler optimizations.

These changes improve the efficiency of the code by reducing memory usage, removing redundant computations, and enabling compiler optimizations.
