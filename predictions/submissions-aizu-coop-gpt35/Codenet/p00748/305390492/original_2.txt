The given code calculates the minimum number of ways to represent a given number `n` as a sum of at most 5 cubes, where the cubes are generated using the formula `p[i] = i * (i + 1) * (i + 2) / 6`. The code uses memoization to avoid redundant computations.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Redundant Calculation of `solve2()` values: The `solve2()` function is called for every number from 1 to 1000000, which results in redundant calculations. Since the function is memoized, we can precompute all the values of `solve2()` at the start and avoid the need for repeated calculations.

2. Inefficient Data Structure for `memo2`: The `memo2` array is used to store the memoized values of `solve2()`. However, since the maximum value of `n` is 1000000, this array can be reduced to a size of 1000001. Additionally, the usage of a separate array for memoization can be replaced with a vector, which can dynamically resize itself as needed.

3. Inefficient Looping in `solve2()`: The `solve2()` function checks if `p[i]` is even or odd using the expression `!(p[i] % 2)`. Since `p[i]` is generated using the formula `i * (i + 1) * (i + 2) / 6`, all values of `p[i]` will be even. Therefore, this check is unnecessary and can be removed.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The code does not currently have any compiler-specific optimizations or pragma directives. By enabling optimization flags during compilation, we can let the compiler perform various optimizations, such as loop unrolling, constant folding, and function inlining, which can improve the performance of the code.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code.
