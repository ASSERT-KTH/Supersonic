The provided code calculates the minimum number of cubes required to form a given number 'n' in two different ways. The first function, `solve()`, calculates the minimum number of cubes required using any combination of cubes. The second function, `solve2()`, calculates the minimum number of cubes required using only odd cubes.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be made:

1. Use a more efficient data structure for storing cubes: The current code uses an array `p[]` to store cube values. However, since the number of cubes is fixed and known in advance, it would be more efficient to use a `std::vector` instead of a fixed-size array.

2. Avoid redundant computations: The code makes redundant computations by recalculating the same values multiple times. We can optimize this by memoizing the results of previous computations using the `memo` and `memo2` arrays. However, the current implementation of memoization is not optimal and can be improved.

3. Optimize the loop: The loop in both `solve()` and `solve2()` can be optimized. Currently, the loop iterates over all cube values until it finds a cube greater than 'n'. However, we can optimize the loop to iterate until the cube value is less than or equal to 'n'. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the overall performance.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to further improve the performance. For example, we can use the `inline` keyword to suggest to the compiler that certain functions should be inlined, or use pragma directives to enable specific compiler optimizations.

Now, let's go step-by-step and apply these optimizations to the code.
