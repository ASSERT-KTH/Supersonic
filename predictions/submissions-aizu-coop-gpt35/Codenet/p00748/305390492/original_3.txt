The provided code calculates the minimum number of cubes required to form a given number `n` using a formula `p[i] = i * (i + 1) * (i + 2) / 6`. The code uses a recursive approach with memoization to solve the problem. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Redundant calculations: The code currently calculates `solve2(i)` for each `i` from 1 to 1,000,000. Since `solve2` is only used in the `while` loop, these calculations can be moved inside the `while` loop to avoid unnecessary computations.

2. Inefficient data structures: The code uses two-dimensional array `memo` to store already computed results for `solve` function. However, we can optimize memory usage by using a one-dimensional array since we only need to store the results for the current `count` value.

3. Memoization implementation: The code uses a separate memoization array for `solve` and `solve2` functions. We can combine these into a single memoization array to reduce memory usage.

4. Loop optimization: The loop in `solve` and `solve2` functions iterates over `p` array to find the minimum value. We can optimize this loop by using a binary search algorithm instead of linear search, as the `p` array is sorted.

5. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations flags, such as `-O2`, to enable compiler optimizations like loop unrolling, inline function calls, and constant folding.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of the optimization strategy.
