The given code is a C++ program that calculates two different values for a given input `n`. The first value is calculated using the `solve` function, and the second value is calculated using the `solve2` function. The program first initializes an array `p` with pre-calculated values. Then, it calculates the second value using the `solve2` function for all values from 1 to 1000000. Finally, it enters a loop that takes user input for `n` until `n` is 0, and it calculates and outputs the first and second values using the `solve` and `solve2` functions, respectively.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The use of the `std::min` function inside the loop in both `solve` and `solve2` functions is not efficient. As the array `p` is sorted in ascending order, we can break the loop when `p[i]` becomes larger than `n`.

2. The use of a 2D array `memo` in the `solve` function is not necessary. We can use a 1D array `memo` instead, as we only need to keep track of the minimum values for each `n` and `count` combination.

3. The use of a separate `memo2` array in the `solve2` function is not necessary. We can reuse the same `memo` array from the `solve` function, as the two functions do not need to store different values.

4. The initialization of the `p` array can be optimized by calculating the values on the fly inside the loop, instead of using the formula.

5. The use of the `std::endl` manipulator to output a newline in the loop can be replaced with a newline character `\n`, which is more efficient.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization strategy step-by-step.
