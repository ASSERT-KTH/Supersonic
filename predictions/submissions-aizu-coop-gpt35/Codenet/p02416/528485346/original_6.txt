The given code reads a series of numbers as strings and calculates the sum of their digits. The program continues reading numbers until it encounters a number starting with '0'. 

While the code appears to be simple and straightforward, there are a few areas that can be optimized to improve performance and memory usage. 

1. Inefficient use of strlen: The code uses strlen to determine the length of the input string in each iteration of the loop. This results in unnecessary computation because the length of the string does not change within the loop. 

2. Redundant computation of sum: The sum variable is initialized to 0 in each iteration of the loop. This is unnecessary as the previous sum is not needed for the next iteration. 

To optimize the code, we can make the following changes:

1. Store the length of the input string before entering the loop and use this value instead of calling strlen in each iteration.

2. Move the initialization of the sum variable outside the loop to avoid redundant computation.

3. Use the more efficient getchar instead of scanf to read individual characters from input.

4. Minimize the use of the std namespace to avoid unnecessary overhead.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  char num[1001];
  while (1) {
    scanf("%s", num);
    if (num[0] == '0')
      break;
      
    int len = 0;
    while (num[len] != '\0')
      len++;
      
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      sum += num[i] - '0';
    }
    printf("%d\n", sum);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the length of the input string is calculated once before entering the loop using a while loop. The sum variable is initialized outside the loop to avoid redundant computation. The getchar function is not used because it introduces unnecessary complexity and doesn't provide any significant performance improvement. The std namespace is minimized to avoid unnecessary overhead.
