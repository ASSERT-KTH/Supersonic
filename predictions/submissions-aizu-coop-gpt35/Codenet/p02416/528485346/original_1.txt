The given code reads a series of numbers as strings from the user until the number "0" is entered. For each number, it calculates the sum of its digits and prints the result. 

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Avoid using the `strlen` function inside the loop: The `strlen` function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string. Since the length of the string does not change inside the loop, we can calculate it once before entering the loop and store it in a separate variable.

2. Use more efficient data types: The `char` type is used to store each digit of the number. However, we can optimize memory usage by using an integer data type instead. This will eliminate the need for converting each character to an integer using `'0'`.

3. Reduce the number of I/O operations: The code currently uses `scanf` to read the input and `printf` to print the output for each number. Instead, we can read the input in batches and process multiple numbers at once before printing the results.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized code will look as follows:
