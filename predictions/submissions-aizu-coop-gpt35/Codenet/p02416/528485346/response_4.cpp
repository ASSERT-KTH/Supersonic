The given code reads a series of numbers as strings and calculates the sum of their digits. It continues reading numbers until the input number starts with '0'. While the code is functional, there are several areas where we can optimize it for better performance and reduced memory usage.

1. Avoid using `strlen` in the loop condition: The `strlen` function is called in each iteration of the loop to check the length of the input string. This results in unnecessary overhead. We can store the length of the string before the loop and use it as the loop condition.

2. Optimize the loop: The loop iterates over each character of the string and calculates the sum of digits. We can improve this by using a pointer to iterate over the characters instead of indexing. Additionally, we can use a precomputed lookup table to avoid subtracting '0' from each character.

3. Minimize memory usage: The `num` array has a fixed size of 1001, which might be excessive for most inputs. We can reduce the size of this array to the maximum expected input length.
