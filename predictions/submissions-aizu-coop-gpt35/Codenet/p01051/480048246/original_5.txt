The given code is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a grid-based game. The grid represents a battlefield where the player needs to navigate from a start position to a goal position while avoiding obstacles and enemies. The code uses a priority queue to select the next position with the minimum cost and updates the distances to each position using the Dijkstra's algorithm.

To optimize the code, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Reducing memory usage by optimizing data structures
2. Reducing redundant computations
3. Optimizing loops and recursive calls
4. Suggesting compiler optimizations

Now let's go through each step in detail.

## 1. Code Analysis

The code initializes a field grid and calculates the cost of moving from one position to another. It then applies Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start position to the goal position. The final distance is printed as the output.

Some potential areas for optimization in the given code include:

- Memory usage: The code uses a vector of edges to store the cost of moving from one position to another. This can be optimized to reduce memory usage.
- Redundant computations: Some computations are repeated unnecessarily, leading to inefficiencies in the code.
- Loop optimization: The nested loops used to calculate the cost can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

## 2. Optimization Strategy

Based on the analysis, the following optimization steps can be taken:

1. Optimize data structures:
   - Replace the vector of edges (`std::vector<Edge>`) with a more memory-efficient data structure.
2. Reduce redundant computations:
   - Avoid unnecessary computations in the cost calculation loop.
3. Optimize loops and recursive calls:
   - Optimize the nested loops used to calculate the cost to reduce the number of iterations.
4. Compiler optimizations:
   - Enable compiler optimizations to help the compiler generate more efficient code.

Now let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization.

## 3. Step-by-Step Explanation

### 3.1 Optimize data structures

The current code uses a vector of edges (`std::vector<Edge>`) to store the cost of moving from one position to another. However, since the number of edges is known in advance, we can use a fixed-size array instead of a vector. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

### 3.2 Reduce redundant computations

The current code performs redundant computations in the cost calculation loop. For each position, it checks the field type multiple times and performs the same calculations multiple times. We can optimize this by avoiding redundant computations and storing the field type in a variable.

### 3.3 Optimize loops and recursive calls

The nested loops used to calculate the cost can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations. Currently, the code checks all four directions for each position, even if it has already encountered a wall. We can optimize this by breaking the loop early when a wall is encountered.

### 3.4 Compiler optimizations

We can suggest enabling compiler optimizations to help the compiler generate more efficient code. This can be done by adding appropriate compiler directives or flags.

Now let's proceed to the optimized code block.

In the optimized code, the following changes have been made:

1. Replaced the vector of edges (`std::vector<Edge>`) with a fixed-size array of edges (`Edge cost[kMaxField][kShotRange]`) to reduce memory usage.
2. Removed redundant computations in the cost calculation loop by storing the field type in a variable and avoiding unnecessary checks and calculations.
3. Optimized the nested loops used to calculate the cost by breaking the loop early when a wall is encountered.
4. No changes have been made to suggest compiler optimizations, as the code is already using standard compiler directives and flags.

These optimizations result in a more memory-efficient and faster version of the original code.
