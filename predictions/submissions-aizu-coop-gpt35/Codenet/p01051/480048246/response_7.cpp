The provided code is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a grid. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance and memory usage.

1. Use a 2D array instead of a 1D array for the grid: The current implementation uses a 1D array `field` to represent the grid, with the size of `kMaxField`. However, since the grid is 2D, it would be more efficient to use a 2D array instead. This will simplify the code and improve cache locality.

2. Remove redundant calculations: The current implementation calculates the position of each cell using the `xy2pos` function. However, this calculation can be done directly within the loops when iterating over the grid.

3. Use a fixed-size array for the `cost` vector: The `cost` vector is currently defined as an array of vectors, which incurs unnecessary memory overhead. Since the maximum size of the vector is known (`kMaxField`), it would be more efficient to define it as a fixed-size array.

4. Optimize the inner loop for calculating costs: The inner loop in the `initCost` function can be optimized by avoiding redundant calculations and minimizing the number of iterations.

5. Use a priority queue with a custom comparator: The current implementation uses `std::greater` as the comparator for the priority queue. However, since we are interested in the minimum element, a custom comparator that compares the second element of the pair can be used instead.

6. Replace `std::fill` with `memset`: The current implementation uses `std::fill` to initialize the `field` array. However, since the array is of a primitive type (`char`), it would be more efficient to use `memset` instead.

7. Avoid unnecessary copying of `P` objects: The `q.top()` object is currently being copied to `P p` in every iteration of the `while` loop in the `dijkstra` function. This can be avoided by using a reference instead.

8. Use a constant for the maximum value: The current implementation uses `kInf` to represent infinity. It would be more efficient to use a constant with a larger value, such as `INT_MAX`.
