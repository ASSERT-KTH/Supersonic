The provided code is an implementation of the Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a grid. The goal is to optimize this code for efficiency, focusing on improving running time and minimizing memory usage.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Reducing memory usage:
   - The `field` array is of size `kMaxField`, which is equal to `kMaxSize * kMaxSize`. However, the actual grid size is `R * C`, which may be smaller than `kMaxSize * kMaxSize`. We can modify the code to use dynamic memory allocation for the `field` array based on the actual grid size.

2. Reducing unnecessary computations:
   - In the `initCost` function, the loop iterates over all the cells in the grid. However, the cells outside the actual grid (defined by `R` and `C`) should be skipped.
   - In the same function, the nested loops iterate over all four directions and up to `kShotRange`, even if there is a wall blocking the path. We can break the inner loop when encountering a wall to avoid unnecessary computations.
   - In the same function, the condition `if (j == 1)` is checked inside the loop, resulting in redundant checks. We can move this condition outside the loop and handle it separately.

3. Compiler optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling, to potentially improve the performance of loops.
   - We can use compiler-specific pragmas or directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
