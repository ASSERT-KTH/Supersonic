The given code is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a grid. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance:

1. Use a char array instead of a struct for Edge: The `Edge` struct is currently defined with two integer fields, `to` and `cost`. Since `to` represents a position in the grid and `cost` represents the cost of moving to that position, we can represent both of them using a single char in the `field` array. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.

2. Use a 1D array instead of a 2D array for the grid: The grid is currently represented using a 2D array (`field`). However, we can flatten the grid into a 1D array to reduce memory usage and improve cache locality. This can be achieved by calculating the position in the 1D array using the formula `pos = x + y * kMaxSize`.

3. Use a vector of pairs instead of a vector of structs for cost: The `cost` array is currently defined as an array of vectors of `Edge` structs. Since each `Edge` struct has only two fields, we can represent them using a pair of integers (`to` and `cost`). This will reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.

4. Avoid unnecessary computations: The code is currently checking for the presence of walls multiple times in the inner loop of the `initCost` function. We can optimize this by moving the wall check outside the inner loop.

5. Use `reserve` to preallocate memory for vectors: The `cost` vector is currently growing dynamically as elements are added to it. We can improve performance by reserving memory for the vectors in advance, based on an estimate of the maximum number of elements.

6. Use a fixed-size array instead of `std::priority_queue`: The `std::priority_queue` data structure is used to implement the priority queue in Dijkstra's algorithm. However, `std::priority_queue` has some overhead associated with it. Since the maximum number of elements in the queue is known in advance (equal to the number of cells in the grid), we can use a fixed-size array instead of `std::priority_queue` to reduce the overhead.

7. Use a simple array for the distance array: The `d` array is currently defined as an array of integers. Since the size of the array is known in advance, we can use a simple array instead of `std::vector` to reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.

8. Use `printf` instead of `std::printf`: The code is currently using `std::printf` to print the final result. We can use the more efficient `printf` function from the C standard library instead.
