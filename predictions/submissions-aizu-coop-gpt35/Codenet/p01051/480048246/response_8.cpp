Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified the following potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage:
   - The `cost` vector is currently being used to store the cost of moving from one position to another. However, this vector is not being efficiently utilized. It is being used to store all possible costs for each position, which leads to unnecessary memory usage.
   - The `field` array is currently being used to store the characters representing the map. However, this array is being filled with the '#' character, which is unnecessary as the wall positions are already being handled separately.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - In the `initCost` function, multiple checks are being performed to determine the type of the field at each position. These checks can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations.

3. Loop Unrolling:
   - The loop in the `dijkstra` function can be unrolled to improve efficiency and reduce loop overhead.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and inlining, can be used to improve the performance of the code.
