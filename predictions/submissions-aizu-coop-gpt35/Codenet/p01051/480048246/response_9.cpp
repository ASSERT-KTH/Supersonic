To optimize the given code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Reduce unnecessary memory usage by using more efficient data structures.
2. Avoid redundant computations by eliminating unnecessary iterations and calculations.
3. Optimize the Dijkstra's algorithm by using a more efficient priority queue implementation.
4. Apply compiler optimizations and directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Let's go through each of these areas in detail and discuss the optimization steps:

1. Reduce unnecessary memory usage:
   - Replace the `std::vector<Edge>` with a more memory-efficient data structure. Since the number of edges for each vertex is fixed, we can use a fixed-size array instead of a vector. This will reduce memory overhead and improve cache locality.
   - Instead of storing the entire graph in the `cost` array, we can calculate the cost on the fly during the Dijkstra's algorithm. This will eliminate the need for storing the graph in memory.

2. Avoid redundant computations:
   - Avoid unnecessary iterations in the `initCost()` function. Currently, for each cell in the grid, the function iterates over all 4 directions and up to `kShotRange` steps. We can optimize this by breaking the loop early if a wall is encountered or if the maximum shot range is reached.
   - Eliminate unnecessary calculations in the inner loop of the `initCost()` function. Currently, the function calculates and stores the cost of each edge in the `cost` array. We can optimize this by calculating the cost on the fly during the loop and only storing the minimum cost.

3. Optimize the Dijkstra's algorithm:
   - Use a more efficient priority queue implementation. Currently, the code uses `std::priority_queue` with a `std::greater` comparator. This implementation has a relatively high time complexity for operations like `push` and `pop`. We can optimize this by using a binary heap-based priority queue implementation, such as `std::priority_queue` with a custom comparator or a custom implementation using a binary heap data structure.

4. Apply compiler optimizations and directives:
   - Use compiler optimizations to optimize the code. For example, using `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flags can enable a set of aggressive optimizations performed by the compiler, such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and instruction scheduling.
   - Use `#pragma` directives to provide hints to the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. For example, we can use `#pragma omp parallel for` to parallelize certain loops if possible.
