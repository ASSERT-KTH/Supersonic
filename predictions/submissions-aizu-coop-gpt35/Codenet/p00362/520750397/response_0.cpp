The given code is written in C++ and appears to implement some kind of graph algorithm. However, the code is highly obfuscated and lacks proper variable names and comments, making it difficult to understand the exact purpose and functionality of the code. 

To optimize this code, we need to first understand its logic and identify potential performance bottlenecks. Let's start by analyzing the code step by step:

1. The code starts by including the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not a standard header and may include unnecessary dependencies.

2. The code defines a macro `U` that seems to define an array of size `7 << 15` and initializes it with zero values. However, the usage of this macro is not clear.

3. The code defines a type alias `L` for `long long` and includes the `map` header file.

4. The code defines a global map `T` with keys and values of type `L`. It's not clear how this map is used.

5. The code defines several global variables of type `L` with single-letter names. These variables are not self-explanatory and make the code difficult to understand.

6. The code defines a function `M` that calculates the sum of the bits set in the binary representation of a number. This function uses a recursive approach and can be optimized.

7. The code defines a function `S` that seems to update an array `B` with values based on some calculations involving `a` and `i`.

8. The code defines a function `D` that updates several arrays (`Z`, `P`, `E`, `C`) and uses recursion to iterate over the elements of the `T` map.

9. The code defines a function `K` that calculates some kind of sum based on array `O` and recursion. The logic of this function is not clear.

10. The code defines the `main` function, which reads input from `cin`, populates the `T` map, and calls the `D` function. The remaining part of the `main` function reads more input and performs some calculations based on the input values.

Given the lack of clarity in the code, it's difficult to provide a specific optimization strategy. However, we can start by addressing some general optimization opportunities:

1. Improve variable naming: Replace the single-letter variable names with more descriptive names. This will improve code readability and make the code easier to understand.

2. Remove unnecessary dependencies: Replace the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header with specific standard headers that are actually needed by the code. This will reduce unnecessary dependencies and potentially improve compilation time.

3. Simplify the `M` function: The `M` function can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm to count the number of set bits in a number. One possible approach is to use bitwise operations to count the bits instead of recursion.

4. Optimize the `S` function: Analyze the purpose of this function and evaluate if there are any unnecessary calculations or redundant operations that can be removed.

5. Improve the `D` function: Understand the purpose and functionality of this function and evaluate if there are any opportunities for optimization, such as eliminating redundant calculations or using more efficient data structures.

6. Evaluate the `K` function: Understand the goal of this function and check if there are any opportunities for optimization, such as eliminating unnecessary recursion or redundant calculations.

7. Simplify the `main` function: Analyze the purpose of this function and identify any areas where the code can be simplified or optimized.
