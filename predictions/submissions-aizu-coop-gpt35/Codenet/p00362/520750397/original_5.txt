The given code is difficult to understand due to its use of non-standard and cryptic variable names, lack of comments, and lack of proper indentation. However, after analyzing the code, it appears to be an implementation of a tree data structure with some operations such as updating nodes and computing the sum of values in a subtree.

Here is the step-by-step optimization strategy for this code:

1. Avoid using non-standard header file: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a non-standard header file that includes all the standard library headers. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard library headers instead of relying on this non-standard header file.

2. Improve variable names and add comments: The code has variable names like `L`, `U`, `G`, `T`, etc., which make it difficult to understand the code. Replace these cryptic variable names with more meaningful names and add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each section of code.

3. Optimize memory usage:
   - The code uses a `map` to represent the tree structure. Since the tree is represented by a map, it takes O(n*log(n)) space complexity. We can optimize this by using an adjacency list representation of the tree, which will reduce the space complexity to O(n).
   - Replace the `map` with a `vector` or `unordered_map` to store the adjacency list representation of the tree.

4. Optimize tree traversal:
   - The code uses a recursive function `D` for depth-first traversal of the tree. We can optimize this function by converting it to an iterative version using a stack. This will reduce the function call overhead and improve performance.

5. Optimize sum computation:
   - The code uses a function `M` to compute the sum of values in a subtree. However, this function has a recursive implementation which can be optimized to an iterative implementation using a stack. This will avoid the function call overhead and improve performance.

6. Use more efficient data structures:
   - The code uses an array `B` to store the cumulative sum of values in the tree. However, this array is not efficiently used. We can optimize this by using a Fenwick tree or a segment tree data structure to efficiently compute and update the sum of values in a subtree.

7. Apply compiler optimizations:
   - Use compiler optimizations like `-O2` to enable aggressive optimizations by the compiler.
   - Use `__attribute__((optimize("O2")))` or `#pragma GCC optimize("O2")` to hint the compiler to optimize specific functions or code blocks.

Now, let's proceed with the optimized code:
