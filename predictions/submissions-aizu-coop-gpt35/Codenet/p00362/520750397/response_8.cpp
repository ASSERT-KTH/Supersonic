The given code appears to be solving a problem related to a tree structure. However, the code is poorly optimized and difficult to understand due to the heavy use of macros and lack of meaningful variable names. To optimize this code, we need to make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros used in the code are not necessary and make the code harder to read. We can replace them with simple function calls or direct code.

2. Optimize data structures: The code uses an array-based approach to represent the tree structure. This approach is inefficient as it requires a lot of memory and performs poorly for large trees. We can optimize this by using a more memory-efficient data structure, such as a vector of vectors or an adjacency list.

3. Reduce redundant computations: The code performs several redundant computations, such as repeatedly calculating the sum of a range of elements in an array. We can optimize this by storing the cumulative sum of elements in an auxiliary array and using it for constant-time range sum calculations.

4. Improve loop efficiency: The code uses nested loops that iterate over the entire tree structure multiple times. We can optimize this by using efficient loop constructs and reducing unnecessary iterations.

5. Enable compiler optimizations: We can enable compiler optimizations to let the compiler generate more efficient code. This can be done by using compiler flags or pragma directives.
