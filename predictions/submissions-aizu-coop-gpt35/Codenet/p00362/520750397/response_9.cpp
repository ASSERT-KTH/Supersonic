Upon analyzing the code, here are some potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. Use of "bits/stdc++.h" header: This header includes a large number of standard library headers, which may not all be necessary for this code. We can replace it with specific headers required by the code to reduce unnecessary overhead.

2. Use of macros: The code extensively uses macros, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain. Replacing the macros with inline functions or regular code can improve readability and potentially allow the compiler to optimize the code better.

3. Use of maps: The code uses a map to store information about nodes in a graph. Maps provide a flexible data structure but can be slower than arrays or vectors for certain operations. We can consider using arrays or vectors instead of maps where possible.

4. Loop optimizations: There are several loops in the code that can potentially be optimized. This includes loop unrolling, reducing redundant computations, and minimizing memory accesses.

5. Function optimizations: The functions in the code can be optimized to reduce unnecessary computations and improve memory usage.

6. Compiler optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code, such as loop vectorization or loop unrolling.
