This code appears to solve a dynamic programming problem where we are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and we need to select a subset of items with a maximum total value, subject to a weight constraint.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant Calculations: The variable `d` is a 2-dimensional array that stores cumulative sums of values for each item. However, these sums are recalculated for each item in the innermost loop. We can optimize this by calculating the cumulative sums only once for each item and storing them in a separate array.

2. Memory Usage: The `dp` array has a size of `2005 x 2005`, which is unnecessarily large given the constraints of the problem statement. We can optimize the memory usage by reducing the size of the `dp` array to `id.size() + 1 x K + 1`, where `id.size()` is the number of unique items and `K` is the weight constraint.

3. Compiler Optimizations: We can leverage compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. This can include enabling compiler optimizations flags (`-O2` or `-O3`), using pragma directives to optimize specific loops, or utilizing compiler-specific optimization features.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Redundant Calculations:
   - Instead of recalculating the cumulative sums in the innermost loop, we can calculate them once for each item and store them in a separate array. This will reduce the number of repetitive calculations.
   - To implement this optimization, we can create a new array `cumulativeSums` of size `id.size() + 1 x 2005` and calculate the cumulative sums for each item in the outer loop.

2. Memory Usage:
   - The `dp` array has a size of `2005 x 2005`, which is unnecessarily large given the constraints of the problem statement. We can reduce the size of the `dp` array to `id.size() + 1 x K + 1`.
   - To implement this optimization, we need to replace the declaration and initialization of `dp` with the new size and update the loop indices accordingly.

3. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations flags (`-O2` or `-O3`) to allow the compiler to apply various optimization techniques that can improve the performance of the code.
   - Additionally, we can use pragma directives to optimize specific loops. For example, we can use `#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")` to hint the compiler to unroll loops and reduce loop overhead.

Now, let's apply these optimization steps to the code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#define REP(i, k, n) for (int i = k; i < n; i++)
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define INF 1 << 30
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> P;

int main() {
  int n, K;
  cin >> n >> K;
  vector<int> id, v[2005];
  rep(i, n) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    id.push_back(b - 1);
    v[b - 1].push_back(a);
  }
  sort(id.begin(), id.end());
  id.erase(unique(id.begin(), id.end()), id.end());
  rep(i, id.size()) {
    int j = id[i];
    sort(v[j].begin(), v[j].end(), greater<int>());
  }

  vector<vector<ll>> cumulativeSums(id.size() + 1, vector<ll>(2005, 0));
  rep(i, id.size()) {
    int j = id[i];
    REP(k, 1, v[j].size() + 1) {
      cumulativeSums[i][k] = cumulativeSums[i][k - 1] + v[j][k - 1] + (k - 1) * 2;
    }
  }

  vector<vector<ll>> dp(id.size() + 1, vector<ll>(K + 1, 0));
  rep(i, id.size()) {
    rep(j, K + 1) {
      ll res = dp[i][j];
      rep(k, v[id[i]].size() + 1) {
        if (j >= k) {
          res = max(res, dp[i][j - k] + cumulativeSums[i][k]);
        }
      }
      dp[i + 1][j] = res;
    }
  }

  cout << dp[id.size()][K] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
