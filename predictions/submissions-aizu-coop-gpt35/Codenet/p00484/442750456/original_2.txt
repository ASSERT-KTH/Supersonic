Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary Includes: The code includes several unnecessary header files such as `<map>`, `<set>`, `<sstream>`, and `<string>`. Since these headers are not used in the code, we can remove them to improve compilation time.

2. Redundant Macros: The code uses macros `REP` and `rep` to iterate over loops. However, these macros can be replaced with regular `for` loops, which are more readable and do not require macro expansion.

3. Unoptimized Sorting: The code uses `std::sort` to sort the `id` vector and the `v[j]` vectors. However, we can use a counting sort instead of a comparison-based sorting algorithm since the input values are integers. This would improve the sorting time complexity from O(n log n) to O(n).

4. Redundant Memory Allocation: The code uses a 2D array `d` to store intermediate results. However, we can optimize memory usage by using a 1D array since we only need to access the previous row of the array.

5. Unnecessary Vector Operations: The code uses the `push_back` function to add elements to vectors `id` and `p`. However, since the size of these vectors is known in advance, we can optimize memory allocation by pre-allocating the required memory.

6. Unnecessary Pair Object Creation: The code creates `pair` objects using the `mp` function. However, we can simplify the code by using the `make_pair` function directly.

7. Unnecessary memset: The code uses `memset` to initialize arrays `d` and `dp` with zeros. However, we can use value initialization to achieve the same result.

8. Inefficient Dynamic Programming Calculation: The code uses nested loops to calculate the dynamic programming values. However, we can optimize this calculation by eliminating the inner loop and using prefix sums to calculate the values directly.

Based on these observations, we can proceed with the optimization steps.
