The provided code seems to solve a dynamic programming problem that involves calculating the maximum score achievable by selecting items from a set, subject to certain constraints. The code initializes some arrays, performs calculations, and outputs the result.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Unnecessary Data Structures: The code uses a `vector<int>` array `v` of size 2005 to store the items. However, the actual number of items used is much smaller, determined by the variable `n`. We can optimize memory usage by resizing the vector to `n` instead of using a fixed size.

2. Redundant Calculations: The code performs some redundant calculations in the `d` array and the `p` vector. We can optimize this by avoiding unnecessary calculations and storing only the required values.

3. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest some compiler optimizations and directives that might help the compiler optimize the code further.

Let's go through each optimization step in detail:

**Optimization 1: Unnecessary Data Structures**

The `v` vector is declared as `vector<int> v[2005]`, which allocates 2005 vectors. However, the actual number of vectors used depends on the input `n`. We can optimize memory usage by resizing the vector to `n` instead of using a fixed size.

```cpp
vector<int> v(n);
```

This change reduces unnecessary memory allocation and improves memory efficiency.

**Optimization 2: Redundant Calculations**

In the original code, the `d` array is calculated using a nested loop and stored in the `p` vector. However, we can optimize this by avoiding unnecessary calculations and storing only the required values.

1. The `d` array is not required for the final calculation, so we can eliminate it completely.

2. The `p` vector is used to store pairs of values `(k, d[j][k])`. However, we can calculate the maximum value directly instead of storing all intermediate values. This reduces memory usage and improves efficiency.

```cpp
ll max_d = 0;
rep(i, id.size()) {
  int j = id[i];
  ll sum = 0;
  REP(k, 1, v[j].size() + 1) {
    sum += v[j][k - 1] + (k - 1) * 2;
    max_d = max(max_d, sum);
  }
}
```

This change eliminates unnecessary memory usage and reduces the number of calculations.

**Optimization 3: Compiler Optimizations**

To further optimize the code, we can suggest some compiler optimizations and directives that might help the compiler optimize the code further. These optimizations can vary based on the specific compiler being used.

1. **Enable Compiler Optimization Flags**: Use compiler-specific flags (e.g., `-O2`, `-O3`, `-Ofast`) to enable optimization levels. These flags allow the compiler to apply various optimizations, such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and instruction reordering.

2. **Use Pragma Directives**: Use pragma directives to provide hints to the compiler for specific optimizations. For example, `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")` enables aggressive optimization for GCC. This can be added at the beginning of the code to suggest optimizations.

With these optimizations in mind, here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#define REP(i, k, n) for (int i = k; i < n; i++)
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define INF 1 << 30
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> P;

int main() {
  int n, K;
  cin >> n >> K;
  vector<int> id, v(n);
  rep(i, n) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    id.push_back(b - 1);
    v[b - 1].push_back(a);
  }
  sort(id.begin(), id.end());
  id.erase(unique(id.begin(), id.end()), id.end());
  rep(i, id.size()) {
    int j = id[i];
    sort(v[j].begin(), v[j].end(), greater<int>());
  }
  
  ll max_d = 0;
  rep(i, id.size()) {
    int j = id[i];
    ll sum = 0;
    REP(k, 1, v[j].size() + 1) {
      sum += v[j][k - 1] + (k - 1) * 2;
      max_d = max(max_d, sum);
    }
  }

  vector<vector<ll>> dp(id.size() + 1, vector<ll>(K + 1, 0));
  rep(i, id.size()) {
    rep(j, K + 1) {
      ll res = dp[i][j];
      rep(k, v[id[i]].size() + 1) {
        if (j >= k) {
          res = max(res, dp[i][j - k] + (k * max_d));
        }
      }
      dp[i + 1][j] = res;
    }
  }
  cout << dp[id.size()][K] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates unnecessary data structures and redundant calculations. It also suggests some compiler optimizations to further improve performance.
