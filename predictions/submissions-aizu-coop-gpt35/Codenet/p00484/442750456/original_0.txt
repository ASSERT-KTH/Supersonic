The given code seems to solve a dynamic programming problem. To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Reducing memory usage:
   - The `vector<int> id` is used to store the unique values of `b-1`. We can replace it with a `set<int> id` to eliminate the need for sorting and erasing duplicates later.
   - The `vector<int> v[2005]` is used to store the values of `a` corresponding to each unique value of `b-1`. Instead of using a 2D vector, we can use a `map<int, vector<int>> v` to store the values, where the key represents the unique value of `b-1`.
   - The `d` array is used to store the cumulative sum of values from `v`. We can eliminate the need for this array by calculating the cumulative sum on the fly while iterating over the values of `v`.

2. Optimizing nested loops:
   - The code contains nested loops that can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations. We can use iterator-based loops instead of index-based loops to improve performance.
   - The innermost loop can be optimized by eliminating the repeated calculation of `dp[i][j - k]` within the loop.

3. Utilizing compiler optimizations:
   - To fully optimize the code, we can use compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling, vectorization, and inline functions. We can use pragmas or compiler flags to enable these optimizations.

Now, let's apply these optimizations step by step:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#define REP(i, k, n) for (int i = k; i < n; i++)
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define INF 1 << 30
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> P;

int main() {
  int n, K;
  cin >> n >> K;
  set<int> id;
  map<int, vector<int>> v;
  rep(i, n) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    id.insert(b - 1);
    v[b - 1].push_back(a);
  }
  vector<P> p;
  for (int j : id) {
    sort(v[j].begin(), v[j].end(), greater<int>());
  }
  vector<ll> dp(K + 1);
  for (int j : id) {
    vector<ll> temp(K + 1);
    for (int k = 1; k <= v[j].size(); k++) {
      ll sum = v[j][k - 1] + (k - 1) * 2;
      dp[k] += sum;
      temp[k] += temp[k - 1] + sum;
      p.push_back(mp(k, temp[k]));
    }
    for (int i = K; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (i >= v[j].size()) {
        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - v[j].size()] + temp[v[j].size()]);
      }
    }
  }
  cout << dp[K] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have made the following changes:

1. Replaced `vector<int> id` with `set<int> id` to eliminate the need for sorting and erasing duplicates.
2. Replaced `vector<int> v[2005]` with `map<int, vector<int>> v` to store the values of `a` corresponding to each unique value of `b-1`.
3. Removed the `d` array and calculated the cumulative sum on the fly while iterating over the values of `v`.
4. Optimized the nested loops by using iterator-based loops instead of index-based loops.
5. Eliminated the repeated calculation of `dp[i][j - k]` within the loop by using a separate `temp` vector to store the cumulative sum.

These optimizations should significantly improve the performance and reduce memory usage of the code.
