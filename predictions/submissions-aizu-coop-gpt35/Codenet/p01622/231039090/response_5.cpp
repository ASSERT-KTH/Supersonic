Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. The use of the `bits/stdc++.h` header file: This header file includes a large number of standard library headers, which can increase compile time and may result in unnecessary code bloat. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard library headers.

2. The use of `using namespace std;`: While convenient, this statement can lead to name clashes and can make the code less readable. It is generally considered best practice to explicitly specify the namespace for each standard library component used.

3. The use of the `pair` type: The code currently uses the `pair` type to store book information. However, using a struct or a class with separate members for `f` and `s` can improve code readability and maintainability.

4. The `solve` function: This function calculates the solution by iterating over the `book` array twice. There might be opportunities to optimize this calculation and reduce the number of iterations.

5. The `dp` array: The `dp` array is initialized with a size of 3000, which may be unnecessarily large. We can potentially optimize the memory usage by determining the maximum size required and allocating only that much memory.

6. The sort operation: The sort operation is currently using the `greater` function as a comparison criterion. We can potentially optimize this by using a custom comparison function that compares the sum of `f` and `s` for each book.
