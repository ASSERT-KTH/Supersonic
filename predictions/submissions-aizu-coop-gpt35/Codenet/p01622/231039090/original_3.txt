Upon analyzing the provided code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Unnecessary `#include` statement: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can slow down compilation time. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard library headers.

2. Use of `std::pair` for book data: The code uses a `std::pair<int, int>` to represent book data, which can be improved for better code readability and maintainability. Instead, a `struct` or `class` can be defined to encapsulate the book data.

3. Redundant computation of `sumf` and `sums`: The code computes the sum of the `f` and `s` values of each book in two separate loops. This can be optimized by computing the sum in a single loop.

4. Inefficient sorting: The code sorts the `book` array using `std::sort` with a custom comparator `greater<P>()`. This can be optimized by using a faster sorting algorithm, such as `std::sort` with a lambda function, or even a counting sort since the book values are integers.

5. Inefficient dynamic programming approach: The code uses a dynamic programming array `dp` of size 3000, which is larger than necessary. The `dp` array can be optimized to use a smaller size based on the maximum possible value of `d`. Additionally, the current approach uses a nested loop to compute the `dp` array, which can be optimized to a single loop by traversing in reverse order.

6. Inefficient book data input: The code reads the book data using a loop and `cin` for each book. This can be optimized by using a faster input method, such as `std::cin` with `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`.

Based on these observations, the following step-by-step optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary standard library headers.

2. Replace the `std::pair<int, int>` with a `struct` or `class` to encapsulate the book data.

3. Optimize the computation of `sumf` and `sums` by computing them in a single loop.

4. Optimize the sorting of the `book` array using a faster sorting algorithm, such as `std::sort` with a lambda function or counting sort.

5. Optimize the dynamic programming array `dp` to use a smaller size based on the maximum possible value of `d`.

6. Optimize the computation of the `dp` array to use a single loop instead of nested loops.

7. Optimize the book data input by using `std::cin` with `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`.

Now, let's implement these optimizations in the code:
