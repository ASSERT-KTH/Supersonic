The provided code seems to solve a problem by calculating the minimum cost of buying a set of books. The goal is to minimize the cost by selecting books that have a higher priority.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Eliminate the unnecessary inclusion of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file. This header file is not standardized and includes all standard library headers, which can negatively impact compilation time and increase memory usage. Instead, only include the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<algorithm>`.

2. Avoid using the `using namespace std` directive. This directive brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less maintainable. Instead, explicitly qualify the standard library names, such as `std::pair` and `std::cout`.

3. Replace the use of `std::pair` with a custom struct. The `std::pair` type is a generic pair of two values, which may result in unnecessary overhead. Since the pair elements are integers, it is more efficient to define a custom struct with integer members.

4. Optimize the book sorting operation. The code currently uses `std::sort` with a custom comparison function to sort the books in descending order. Instead, we can use `std::sort` with a lambda function or a custom functor to achieve the same result with potentially better performance.

5. Use a more efficient data structure for the `dp` array. The current implementation uses a static array of size 3000 to store the dynamic programming values. However, this size is arbitrary and may lead to wasted memory. Instead, we can use a `std::vector<bool>` to dynamically allocate memory only for the required values.

6. Optimize the book selection loop. The current implementation uses a nested loop to iterate over the books and compute the `dp` array. This can be optimized by using a single loop and avoiding unnecessary calculations.

7. Consider enabling compiler optimizations. Depending on the compiler being used, there might be additional optimizations that can be applied. For example, using the `-O3` flag with GCC or Clang can enable aggressive optimization options.
