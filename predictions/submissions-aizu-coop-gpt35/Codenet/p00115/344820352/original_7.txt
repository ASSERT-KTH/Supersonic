The given code seems to define several classes and functions related to 3D geometry and then uses them to solve a problem. Here are some potential areas of improvement:

1. Unnecessary header inclusion: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header and includes many unnecessary headers. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers explicitly.

2. Redundant functions: There are multiple functions defined for rotating a point in 3D space (e.g., `rotateX`, `rorateY`, `rorateZ`, `rotateEuler`, `rotateRollPitchYaw`). These functions perform similar operations and can be consolidated into a single function.

3. Output stream operator `<<` overload: The `<<` overload for `Point3d` and `Segment3d` classes is defined but it does not return the output stream. This can cause incorrect output when these objects are printed using `cout <<`.

4. Use of `equals` function: The `equals` function is used to compare floating-point values for equality, but it uses a fixed epsilon value (`EPS`). It is recommended to use a relative epsilon value or use `std::numeric_limits` to determine the epsilon dynamically.

5. Loop optimizations: The `rep` and `REP` macros are used for looping, but they can be replaced with standard `for` loops to improve code readability.

6. Function parameter passing: Some functions are passing objects by value, which incurs unnecessary copying. It is better to pass objects by const reference to avoid unnecessary copies.

7. Unused code: There are some unused variables and functions in the code, which should be removed to improve code clarity.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be proposed:

1. Remove the unnecessary header inclusion and include only the necessary headers explicitly.

2. Consolidate the rotating functions into a single function.

3. Fix the output stream operator `<<` overload to return the output stream.

4. Replace the `equals` function with a more robust comparison method.

5. Replace the `rep` and `REP` macros with standard `for` loops.

6. Pass objects by const reference instead of by value in function parameters.

7. Remove unused variables and functions.

Now let's implement these optimizations step by step.
