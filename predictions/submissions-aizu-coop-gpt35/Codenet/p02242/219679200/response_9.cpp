The provided code is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. However, there are several areas of the code that can be optimized for better performance and memory usage:

1. Memory Allocation: The graph is currently represented using a 1D array of size n*n. This results in inefficient memory usage, especially when the graph is sparse (i.e., contains few edges). We can optimize this by using a 2D array or a vector of vectors to represent the graph, allocating memory only for the necessary edges.

2. Unnecessary Initialization: The `std::fill_n` function is used to initialize the graph and the `visited` array. However, this is unnecessary because the graph is immediately filled with a specific value using `std::fill_n`, and the `visited` array is later filled with `false` in the loop.

3. Avoiding Repeated Array Access: In the inner loop of the `dijkstra` function, the expression `(*this)[i]` is repeatedly accessed. This can be optimized by storing the pointer to the current row of the graph in a local variable.

4. Avoiding Redundant Comparison: In the inner loop of the `dijkstra` function, the minimum distance is updated using `if (cur_min > dist[j])`. However, this comparison is unnecessary because `cur_min` is initialized with a value greater than any possible distance.

5. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code, such as loop unrolling or vectorization.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail.

1. Memory Allocation:
   - Replace the line `uint *const g_;` with `std::vector<std::vector<uint>> g_;` to represent the graph as a vector of vectors.
   - Update the constructor `Graph(uint n)` to initialize the graph using `g_(n, std::vector<uint>(n, INFINIT))`.
   - Replace the line `delete[] g_;` in the destructor with `g_.clear();`.

2. Unnecessary Initialization:
   - Remove the lines `std::fill_n(g_, (n_ * n_), INFINIT);` and `std::fill_n(visited, n_, false);`.

3. Avoiding Repeated Array Access:
   - Declare a local variable `auto es = (*this)[i];` before the inner loop in the `dijkstra` function.
   - Replace all occurrences of `(*this)[i]` with `es`.

4. Avoiding Redundant Comparison:
   - Remove the line `auto cur_min = INFINIT;`.

5. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Add compiler-specific optimization flags during compilation, such as `-O3` for maximum optimization.
   - Use `#pragma` directives to enable specific compiler optimizations, if available for your compiler.
