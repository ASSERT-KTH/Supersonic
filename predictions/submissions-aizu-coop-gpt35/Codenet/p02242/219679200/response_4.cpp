Upon analyzing the provided code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization have been identified:

1. Memory Allocation: The graph matrix `g_` is currently allocated using the `new` operator. However, this allocation could be optimized for efficiency.

2. Memory Initialization: The graph matrix `g_` is initialized using the `std::fill_n` function, which can be optimized to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

3. Loop Optimization: The loops in the `dijkstra` function can potentially be optimized to reduce unnecessary iterations and improve performance.

4. Compiler Hints: Compiler optimizations or pragma directives can be used to provide hints to the compiler for optimizing certain parts of the code.

Based on these findings, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Memory Allocation: Replace the dynamic memory allocation of the graph matrix `g_` with a `std::vector` to improve memory management and reduce the chances of memory leaks.

2. Memory Initialization: Replace the `std::fill_n` function with a loop to initialize the graph matrix `g_`. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

3. Loop Optimization: Optimize the loops in the `dijkstra` function by removing unnecessary iterations and reducing the number of conditional checks.

4. Compiler Hints: Add compiler-specific optimization flags or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
