The provided code implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. While the code is correct and produces the expected output, there are several areas where it can be optimized for performance:

1. Memory Allocation: The graph is represented as a 2D array using a dynamically allocated memory block. This approach can be memory inefficient for large graphs. Instead, we can use a 1D array and calculate the index of each element using a formula. This will save memory and improve cache locality.

2. Array Initialization: The graph is initialized with the INFINIT value using `std::fill_n`. However, this can be slow for large graphs. We can optimize this by using `std::memset` to initialize the graph array to INFINIT.

3. Distance Array: The distance array is allocated on the stack and passed to the `dijkstra` function. This can be memory inefficient for large graphs. We can allocate the distance array dynamically on the heap to save stack space.

4. Loop Optimization: The outer loop in the `dijkstra` function iterates `n_ - 1` times. We can optimize this by iterating `n_` times and using a conditional check to break out of the loop when all nodes have been visited.

5. Loop Unrolling: The inner loop in the `dijkstra` function can be unrolled to process multiple iterations at once. This can improve performance by reducing loop overhead.

6. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
