The provided code is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance and memory usage:

1. Memory Allocation: The current implementation uses a 1D array to represent a 2D graph. This approach is inefficient in terms of memory usage because it allocates a large contiguous block of memory for the entire graph. Instead, we can use a 1D array of pointers to represent the graph, where each pointer points to a dynamically allocated array representing the row of the graph. This will reduce the memory footprint and improve cache locality.

2. Initialization: The code initializes the graph with a large value (INFINIT) to represent infinite distances. However, this is unnecessary because the graph is filled with this value again in the Dijkstra's algorithm. We can remove the initial fill_n() call in the constructor to save some unnecessary computation.

3. Loop Optimization: The code uses a nested loop to iterate over the graph and update the distances. This can be optimized by using a 1D array and calculating the proper index based on the current row and column. This will reduce the number of pointer dereferences and improve the performance.

4. Loop Unrolling: The inner loop in the Dijkstra's algorithm can be unrolled to process multiple iterations in parallel, reducing the overhead of loop control and branch instructions.

5. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations flags (-O2, -O3) to enable optimization flags such as loop unrolling, inline expansion, and function attribute directives.
