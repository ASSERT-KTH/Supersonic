After analyzing the provided code, I have identified several potential optimizations:

1. Use a priority queue instead of linear search: The code currently uses a linear search to find the vertex with the minimum distance. This can be improved by using a priority queue, which has a lower time complexity for finding the minimum element.

2. Use a better data structure for the adjacency matrix: The code currently uses a 2D array to represent the adjacency matrix. This can be improved by using a sparse matrix representation, such as an adjacency list, to reduce memory usage and improve cache efficiency.

3. Remove unnecessary variable initialization: The code initializes the `minv` variable to `INFTY`, but it is never used. This initialization can be removed to improve performance.

4. Use a sentinel value instead of `INFTY`: The code currently uses `INFTY` to represent infinity. Instead, we can use a sentinel value that is greater than the maximum possible distance, which can help reduce the number of comparisons in the inner loop.

5. Optimize the loop conditions: The code currently uses two conditions in the inner loop to check if the vertex is not black and the edge weight is not infinity. By combining these conditions into a single condition using the logical AND operator (`&&`), we can reduce the number of comparisons.

6. Use the `reserve` function for vectors: The code can use the `reserve` function for vectors to pre-allocate memory, which can improve performance by reducing the number of memory reallocations.
