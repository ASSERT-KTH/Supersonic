Code Analysis:
- The code implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph.
- The graph is represented using an adjacency matrix `M` of size `MAX x MAX`.
- The code initializes the distance array `d` and the color array `color` with default values.
- The algorithm uses a while loop to iterate until all vertices are processed.
- Inside the loop, it selects the vertex with the minimum distance and updates the distances of its neighboring vertices.
- The final distances are printed as output.

Potential Optimizations:
1. Using a Priority Queue: The current implementation finds the minimum distance vertex in a linear scan. This can be improved by using a priority queue data structure to efficiently find the minimum distance vertex.
2. Sparse Graph Representation: The adjacency matrix `M` is inefficient for sparse graphs as it requires a lot of memory. A more efficient representation like an adjacency list can be used to reduce memory usage.
3. Early Termination: If the graph is disconnected, the algorithm unnecessarily processes all vertices. We can optimize this by terminating the algorithm early if there are no more reachable vertices.
4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations like loop unrolling or pragma directives to hint the compiler for better code generation.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the adjacency matrix `M` with an adjacency list representation to handle sparse graphs more efficiently.
2. Use a priority queue to select the vertex with the minimum distance in each iteration.
3. Implement early termination if there are no more reachable vertices.
4. Add compiler optimizations if necessary.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the adjacency matrix `M` with an adjacency list representation:
   - Create a new data structure `vector<pair<int, int>> adjList[MAX]` to represent the adjacency list.
   - Instead of assigning `M[u][v] = c`, append the pair `(v, c)` to the `adjList[u]`.
   - This change reduces memory usage for sparse graphs and improves the runtime complexity of accessing neighbors.
   - Trade-off: The adjacency list representation requires additional memory for storing the linked lists.

2. Use a priority queue to select the vertex with the minimum distance:
   - Include the `<queue>` header to use the `priority_queue` data structure.
   - Create a priority queue `priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq`.
   - Instead of the linear scan to find `minv`, push all vertices with `color[i] != BLACK` into the priority queue with their distances as the keys.
   - Replace the `minv` selection with `pair<int, int> p = pq.top(); pq.pop(); int u = p.second; int minv = p.first;`.
   - This change improves the runtime complexity of finding the minimum distance vertex.
   - Trade-off: The priority queue requires additional memory and introduces some overhead for maintaining the heap structure.

3. Implement early termination if there are no more reachable vertices:
   - Add a flag variable `bool flag = true;` before the while loop.
   - Inside the loop, check if `u` is not `-1` (i.e., a reachable vertex) and set `flag = false`.
   - After the loop, check if `flag` is still true and break the loop if it is.
   - This change avoids unnecessary iterations if the graph is disconnected.
   - Trade-off: No trade-offs as this change only adds a few extra conditional checks.

4. Add compiler optimizations if necessary:
   - No specific compiler optimizations are proposed at this stage. The code is already relatively simple and straightforward.
