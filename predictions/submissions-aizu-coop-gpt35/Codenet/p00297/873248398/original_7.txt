Code Analysis:
- The code includes several unnecessary includes that are not used in the program.
- The code defines multiple macros that are not used in the program.
- The code includes unnecessary function templates that are not used.
- The code uses a struct called SegTree to implement a segment tree data structure, which is used to perform range minimum and maximum queries. However, the implementation of the segment tree is not efficient and can be optimized.
- The code uses a vector of pairs to store the input data, which can be replaced with arrays for better performance.
- The code calls the sort function multiple times, which is not necessary and can be optimized.
- The code uses the "all" and "rall" macros to pass the entire vector to functions, which can be replaced with the vector itself.
- The code calculates the answer using a brute-force approach, which can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the unnecessary includes that are not used in the program.
2. Remove unnecessary macros: Remove the unnecessary macros that are not used in the program.
3. Remove unnecessary function templates: Remove the unnecessary function templates that are not used in the program.
4. Optimize the segment tree implementation:
   a. Use arrays instead of vectors: Replace the vectors used in the segment tree implementation with arrays to improve performance.
   b. Initialize segment tree arrays with INT_MAX and INT_MIN: Initialize the segment tree arrays with INT_MAX and INT_MIN, instead of using a loop to initialize them to inf and -inf.
   c. Separate update functions for minimum and maximum: Separate the update functions for minimum and maximum values in the segment tree to avoid unnecessary comparisons.
5. Replace vector of pairs with arrays: Replace the vector of pairs used to store the input data with arrays to improve performance.
6. Optimize the sorting process: Sort the input data once using a custom comparator instead of sorting it multiple times.
7. Replace "all" and "rall" macros with vectors: Replace the "all" and "rall" macros with the vectors themselves to improve readability.
8. Optimize the calculation of the answer:
   a. Calculate the answer using a sliding window approach: Instead of performing a range query for each element, use a sliding window approach to calculate the answer in a single loop.
   b. Use precalculated values for minimum and maximum: Use precalculated arrays for minimum and maximum values to avoid repeated segment tree queries.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the unnecessary includes to declutter the code and improve readability.
2. Remove unnecessary macros: Remove the unnecessary macros to simplify the code and improve readability.
3. Remove unnecessary function templates: Remove the unnecessary function templates to simplify the code and improve readability.
4. Optimize the segment tree implementation:
   a. Use arrays instead of vectors: Replace the vectors used in the segment tree implementation with arrays to improve performance. This avoids the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
   b. Initialize segment tree arrays with INT_MAX and INT_MIN: Initialize the segment tree arrays with INT_MAX and INT_MIN, instead of using a loop to initialize them to inf and -inf. This reduces the number of comparisons and assignments.
   c. Separate update functions for minimum and maximum: Separate the update functions for minimum and maximum values in the segment tree to avoid unnecessary comparisons. This improves performance by reducing the number of conditional statements.
5. Replace vector of pairs with arrays: Replace the vector of pairs used to store the input data with arrays to improve performance. This avoids the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
6. Optimize the sorting process: Sort the input data once using a custom comparator instead of sorting it multiple times. This reduces the number of comparisons and improves performance.
7. Replace "all" and "rall" macros with vectors: Replace the "all" and "rall" macros with the vectors themselves to improve readability. This simplifies the code and improves code understanding.
8. Optimize the calculation of the answer:
   a. Calculate the answer using a sliding window approach: Instead of performing a range query for each element, use a sliding window approach to calculate the answer in a single loop. This reduces the number of segment tree queries and improves performance.
   b. Use precalculated values for minimum and maximum: Use precalculated arrays for minimum and maximum values to avoid repeated segment tree queries. This reduces the number of segment tree queries and improves performance.

The optimized code retains the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance and reducing memory usage. The changes made are minimal yet effective, focusing on improving data structures, reducing unnecessary computations, and optimizing loops and queries. The optimized code is also well-commented to highlight the changes made and make it easily understandable.
