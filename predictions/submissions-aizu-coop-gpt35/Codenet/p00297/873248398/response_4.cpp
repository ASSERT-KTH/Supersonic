The provided code appears to be solving a problem related to finding the maximum area of a rectangle given a set of points in a 2D plane. The code uses a segment tree data structure to efficiently calculate the minimum and maximum values of the x and y coordinates of the points within a given range.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Unnecessary includes: There are several unnecessary include statements in the code. We should remove them to improve compile time and reduce unnecessary code size.

2. Redundant data structures and functions: The code defines several unnecessary data structures and functions that are not used. We should remove them to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

3. Unoptimized segment tree initialization: The current implementation of the segment tree initialization is not efficient. It iterates over all elements of the tree and sets their initial values to specific values. We can optimize this initialization step to reduce the time complexity.

4. Inefficient sorting: The code sorts the 'hoge' vector using the std::sort function. However, we can optimize this sorting step by using a counting sort algorithm, as the input values are integers within a known range.

5. Redundant calculations: The code calculates the minimum and maximum values of the x and y coordinates within a given range multiple times. We can optimize this by calculating these values only once and storing them in variables.

6. Unnecessary use of the 'omajinai' macro: The 'omajinai' macro is used to synchronize standard input/output with C-style input/output. However, since the code only uses C++ input/output, we can remove this macro.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Unnecessary includes:
   - Remove the include statements for unnecessary headers: <algorithm>, <climits>, <cmath>, <cstdio>, <cstdlib>, <cstring>, <deque>, <functional>, <iostream>, <map>, <queue>, <set>, <sstream>, <stack>, <string>, <utility>.
   - Keep the necessary include statements: <vector>.

2. Redundant data structures and functions:
   - Remove the unused typedefs: ll, ld, vvi, vpii.
   - Remove the unused functions: rev, sort, get, min, max, chmin, chmax.

3. Unoptimized segment tree initialization:
   - Instead of initializing all elements of the segment tree with specific values, we can use the std::fill function to initialize them with the initial values.
   - Replace the initialization loop in the 'init' function with the following code:
     ```
     std::fill(all(Max), -inf);
     std::fill(all(Min), inf);
     ```

4. Inefficient sorting:
   - Instead of using std::sort to sort the 'hoge' vector, we can use a counting sort algorithm.
   - Count the frequency of each value in the 'hoge' vector using a separate counting array.
   - Iterate over the counting array to reconstruct the sorted 'hoge' vector.
   - Replace the sorting code with the following code:
     ```
     const int MAX_VALUE = 200020;
     int count[MAX_VALUE] = {0};
     for (const auto& h : hoge) {
         count[h.fst]++;
     }
     hoge.clear();
     for (int i = 0; i < MAX_VALUE; ++i) {
         for (int j = 0; j < count[i]; ++j) {
             hoge.PB(pii(i, j));
         }
     }
     ```

5. Redundant calculations:
   - Replace the repetitive calls to x_seg.get_min, x_seg.get_max, y_seg.get_min, and y_seg.get_max with single calls and store the results in variables.
   - Replace the following lines:
     ```
     int min_x = x_seg.get_min(i, idx);
     int max_x = x_seg.get_max(i, idx);
     int min_y = y_seg.get_min(i, idx);
     int max_y = y_seg.get_max(i, idx);
     ```
     with the following lines:
     ```
     int min_x = x_seg.get_min(i, idx);
     int max_x = x_seg.get_max(i, idx);
     int min_y = y_seg.get_min(i, idx);
     int max_y = y_seg.get_max(i, idx);
     ```

6. Unnecessary use of the 'omajinai' macro:
   - Remove the 'omajinai' macro.
