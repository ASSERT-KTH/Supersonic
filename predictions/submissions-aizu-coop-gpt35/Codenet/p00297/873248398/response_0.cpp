The given code is a C++ program that calculates the maximum area of a rectangle given a set of points with their respective coordinates. The program uses a segment tree data structure to efficiently query the minimum and maximum values within a range.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant data structures: The code uses two separate segment trees for storing the minimum and maximum values of the x and y coordinates. However, since the operations performed on the segment trees are the same (min_update, max_update, get_min, and get_max), it is redundant to have two separate trees. Instead, a single segment tree can be used to store both the minimum and maximum values.

2. Unnecessary sorting: The code sorts the "hoge" vector of pairs based on the "b" value. However, the sorting is not required for the calculation of the maximum area. Sorting can be skipped altogether, saving computation time.

3. Redundant calculations: The code calculates the minimum and maximum values for each pair of points in the given range. However, the values for the previous pair of points can be reused for the next pair. This can be optimized by storing the minimum and maximum values for each point and reusing them in subsequent calculations.

4. Unnecessary memory usage: The code declares two large arrays, X and Y, with a size of 200020. However, the actual number of points is given by the variable N. Allocating memory for a larger number of elements than required can lead to unnecessary memory usage.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Combine the separate segment trees for X and Y coordinates into a single segment tree that stores both the minimum and maximum values.

2. Skip the sorting of the "hoge" vector, as it is not required for the calculation of the maximum area.

3. Store the minimum and maximum values for each point and reuse them in subsequent calculations, instead of recalculating them for each pair of points.

4. Reduce the size of the X and Y arrays to the actual number of points, N.
