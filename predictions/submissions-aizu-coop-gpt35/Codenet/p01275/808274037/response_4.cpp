The given code appears to solve a problem that involves finding the minimum number of rotations required to convert one string into another. However, there are several areas that can be optimized to improve performance and reduce memory usage.

1. Inefficient data structure:
   - The `dif` array is used to store the difference between corresponding characters of two strings. However, this can be replaced with a more efficient data structure. Since the difference is always in the range [0, 9], a simple array of integers can be used to store these differences.

2. Redundant computations:
   - The `dif[i]` value is recomputed in each iteration of the second loop. This computation can be moved outside the loop to avoid unnecessary redundant calculations.

3. Inefficient recursion:
   - The `rec` function is recursively called multiple times with the same arguments. This can result in redundant function calls and unnecessary computations. Tail recursion can be used to optimize this recursive function.

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - Compiler optimizations can be enabled to allow the compiler to perform various optimizations on the code. This can include loop unrolling, function inlining, and other optimizations that the compiler deems suitable.
