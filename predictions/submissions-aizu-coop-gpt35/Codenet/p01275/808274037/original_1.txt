The given code appears to be solving a problem that involves finding the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into another, with each operation involving rotating a character by a certain amount. The code uses a recursive approach to explore all possible combinations of rotations and finds the minimum number of operations required.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoiding unnecessary computations within the recursive function.
2. Reducing the number of recursive calls and iterations.
3. Minimizing memory usage by using more efficient data structures.

Now, let's go through these optimizations step by step.

1. Avoiding unnecessary computations:
   - The variable `ans` is used to store the minimum number of operations required. However, the code checks if `d >= ans` before making any recursive calls. This check is unnecessary because `d` can only increase in the recursive calls, so there's no need to continue the recursion if `d` is already greater than or equal to `ans`. We can remove this check to avoid unnecessary computations.

2. Reducing the number of recursive calls and iterations:
   - The original code makes recursive calls for each possible rotation value. However, we can optimize this by moving the recursive call outside the loop and performing the rotations in a single loop. This way, we can reduce the number of recursive calls from `k` to 1, and reduce the number of iterations as well.

3. Minimizing memory usage:
   - The array `dif` is used to store the differences between the characters of the two strings. However, we can reduce the memory usage by calculating the difference on the fly within the loop, instead of storing it in an array. This way, we don't need to allocate memory for the array `dif`.

Below is the optimized code with the aforementioned optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int M = 10;

int k;

int rec(int d, int p, string& s, string& t) {
  if (p == k) {
    return d;
  }
  
  int rot = ((int)(t[p] - s[p]) + M) % M;
  
  int ans = k;
  
  // No rotation
  ans = min(ans, rec(d, p + 1, s, t));
  
  // Perform rotations
  for (int i = p; i < k; i++) {
    t[i] = (t[i] - rot + M) % M;
    ans = min(ans, rec(d + 1, p + 1, s, t));
    t[i] = (t[i] + rot) % M;
  }
  
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> k, k) {
    string s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    
    int ans = rec(0, 0, s, t);
    
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

This optimized code should provide significant improvements in terms of performance and memory usage. The changes made are minimal yet effective, preserving the functionality and output of the original code.
