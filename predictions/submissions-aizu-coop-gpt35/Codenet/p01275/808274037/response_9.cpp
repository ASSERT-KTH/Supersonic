The given code appears to solve a problem that involves finding the minimum number of rotations required to transform one string into another. However, there are several areas of the code that can be optimized for better performance and memory usage.

1. Unnecessary use of global variables: The variables `k` and `ans` are declared as global variables, which can lead to potential bugs and hinder optimization. It is recommended to pass them as arguments to the `rec` function and return the result instead of updating a global variable.

2. Inefficient memory usage: The `dif` array is used to store the differences between characters in the input strings. However, this array can be replaced with a single integer variable since we only need to keep track of the current difference.

3. Redundant computations: The code performs multiple calculations to compute the modulo of a number. By using the modulo operator directly in the calculation, we can avoid unnecessary operations.

4. Recursive function calls: The recursive function `rec` is called multiple times with the same parameters. This can be optimized by using a loop instead of recursive calls, which eliminates the overhead of function calls.

5. Compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and pragma directives, can be used to further optimize the code. By providing hints to the compiler, it can perform optimizations at the assembly level.
