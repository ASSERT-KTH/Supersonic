Code Analysis:

The given code is solving a problem where it calculates the minimum number of rotations required to transform one string into another. The code uses a recursive approach to calculate the minimum number of rotations.

However, there are a few potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage in the code:

1. Inefficient Memory Usage: The `dif` array is declared globally with a fixed size of 12. This approach is inefficient because it uses extra memory even when the size of the input strings is smaller than 12. A dynamically allocated array would be a better alternative.

2. Redundant Computation: The code calculates the difference between the characters of the two input strings for each rotation. This calculation can be performed once and stored in an array to avoid redundant computations.

3. Recursive Calls: The recursive function `rec` is called multiple times with the same parameters. This can be optimized by using memoization or dynamic programming to store intermediate results and avoid redundant recursive calls.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Efficient Data Structure: Instead of using the globally declared `dif` array, use a dynamically allocated array with a size equal to the maximum length of the input strings.

2. Avoid Redundant Computation: Calculate the character differences between the input strings once and store them in the array. This will eliminate the need for repeated computations.

3. Memoization: Use memoization or dynamic programming to store intermediate results and avoid redundant recursive calls.

4. Compiler Optimization: Enable compiler optimizations using appropriate flags or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Efficient Data Structure:
   - Replace the global `dif` array with a dynamically allocated array.
   - Calculate the maximum length of the input strings and allocate memory accordingly.
   - Update the code to delete the dynamically allocated memory when it is no longer needed.

2. Avoid Redundant Computation:
   - Calculate the differences between the characters of the input strings once and store them in the `dif` array before the recursive function is called.

3. Memoization:
   - Use a memoization table to store intermediate results and avoid redundant recursive calls.
   - Create a 2D array to store the results of the recursive calls. Initialize all values to -1.
   - Before making a recursive call, check if the result for the given parameters is already stored in the memoization table. If yes, return the stored result instead of making a recursive call.
   - After calculating the result for a set of parameters, store it in the memoization table for future use.

4. Compiler Optimization:
   - Enable compiler optimizations using appropriate flags or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize the code.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int k, ans;
int M = 10;
int* dif;
int** memo;

int rec(int d, int p) {
  if (p == k) {
    ans = d;
    return ans;
  }
  if (d >= ans)
    return ans;
  if (memo[d][p] != -1)
    return memo[d][p];
  
  int rot = dif[p];
  if (rot == 0) {
    memo[d][p] = rec(d, p + 1);
    return memo[d][p];
  }

  memo[d][p] = rec(d + 1, p + 1);
  for (int i = p; i < k; i++) {
    dif[i] = (dif[i] - rot) % M;
    memo[d][p] = min(memo[d][p], rec(d + 1, p + 1));
  }
  for (int i = p; i < k; i++)
    dif[i] = (dif[i] + rot + M) % M;

  return memo[d][p];
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> k, k) {
    string s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    dif = new int[k];
    memo = new int*[k];
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      dif[i] = ((int)(t[i] - s[i]) + M) % M;
      memo[i] = new int[k];
      for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
        memo[i][j] = -1;
      }
    }
    ans = k;
    rec(0, 0);
    cout << ans << endl;

    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      delete[] memo[i];
    }
    delete[] memo;
    delete[] dif;
  }
}
```

In the optimized code:

1. The `dif` array is dynamically allocated based on the length of the input strings. A 2D array, `memo`, is also dynamically allocated to store intermediate results.

2. The `memo` array is initialized with -1. The value of `-1` indicates that the result for a set of parameters is not yet calculated.

3. Before making a recursive call, the code checks if the result for the given parameters is already stored in the `memo` array. If yes, it returns the stored result instead of making a recursive call.

4. The code uses the `min` function to update the minimum result for each set of parameters.

5. After calculating the result for a set of parameters, it stores the result in the `memo` array for future use.

6. The dynamically allocated memory is properly deleted at the end of each iteration.

The optimized code reduces redundant computations and improves memory usage by dynamically allocating memory. It also uses memoization to avoid redundant recursive calls.
