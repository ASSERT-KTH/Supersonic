The given code appears to solve a problem involving rotating strings. However, the code could be optimized to improve its running time and memory usage. 

Let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. Recursive Function: The code uses a recursive function `rec()` to calculate the minimum number of rotations required to make two strings equal. However, the recursive function can be computationally expensive and may lead to unnecessary computations.

2. Memory Usage: The code uses an array `dif[]` to store the differences between the characters of the two strings. This array can be optimized to reduce memory usage.

Now, let's formulate the optimization strategy:

1. Eliminate Unnecessary Computations: Currently, the code makes unnecessary recursive calls and computations when the current number of rotations exceeds the current minimum number of rotations (`ans`). We can eliminate these computations to improve efficiency.

2. Optimize Memory Usage: Instead of using an array to store the differences between characters, we can calculate the differences on the fly during the recursive function call. This will save memory and reduce the need for array manipulations.

3. Use Compiler Optimization: We can use compiler optimization flags or pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize the code further.

Now, let's proceed to explain each optimization step in detail:

1. Eliminate Unnecessary Computations:
   - In the `rec()` function, if the current number of rotations (`d`) is greater than or equal to the current minimum number of rotations (`ans`), we can return immediately without making any further recursive calls. This will eliminate unnecessary computations.
   - Additionally, after each recursive call to `rec()`, we can update the current minimum number of rotations (`ans`) only if it is smaller than the previous minimum value. This will ensure that we always have the minimum number of rotations at the end.

2. Optimize Memory Usage:
   - Instead of using an array `dif[]` to store the differences between characters, we can calculate the difference on the fly during the recursive function call.
   - We can modify the function signature of `rec()` to pass the differences as arguments, eliminating the need for the `dif[]` array.
   - This modification will reduce memory usage and eliminate the need for array manipulations.

3. Use Compiler Optimization:
   - We can use compiler optimization flags or pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize the code further. These flags can vary depending on the compiler being used.
   - For example, we can use the `-O2` flag for GCC to enable optimization at level 2, which includes various optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, and common subexpression elimination.

Now, let's update the code to incorporate these optimizations:
