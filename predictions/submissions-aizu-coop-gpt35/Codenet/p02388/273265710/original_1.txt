Analysis:

1. The code reads an input number from the user and calculates its cube using a loop.
2. The input number is checked to be within the range of 0 to 100.
3. The result is printed to the console.

Potential optimizations:

1. Remove the unnecessary check for the input number range.
2. Replace the loop with a simple multiplication operation.
3. Add compiler optimizations to hint the compiler to optimize the code.

Optimization strategy:

1. Remove the unnecessary check for the input number range since the prompt suggests that the input should always be within the range of 0 to 100.
2. Replace the loop with a simple multiplication operation, as raising a number to the power of 3 can be done in one step.
3. Add the `-O3` compiler optimization flag to enable aggressive optimization.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove the unnecessary check for the input number range:
   - The prompt specifies that the input number should always be within the range of 0 to 100, so the check is not necessary. Removing it will save some execution time.

2. Replace the loop with a simple multiplication operation:
   - Instead of using a loop to calculate the cube of the input number, we can simply use the multiplication operator (`*`) three times to calculate the cube in one step. This eliminates the need for the loop and reduces the number of iterations.

3. Add the `-O3` compiler optimization flag:
   - Compiler optimization flags can significantly improve the performance of the code. Adding the `-O3` flag tells the compiler to apply aggressive optimization strategies, such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and vectorization. This can result in faster and more efficient code execution.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void cubedNum() {
  int inputNum;
  cin >> inputNum;
  
  int result = inputNum * inputNum * inputNum;
  
  cout << result << endl;
}

int main() {
  cubedNum();
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The `-O3` compiler optimization flag is not reflected in the code block since it is a compiler option and not a code change. It should be added when compiling the code.
