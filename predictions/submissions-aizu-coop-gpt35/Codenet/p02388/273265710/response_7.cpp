This code calculates the cube of a given number. However, there are several areas where it can be optimized for efficiency:

1. The use of `using namespace std;`: This directive brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, potentially causing naming conflicts and making the code less readable. It is better to explicitly qualify the names from the `std` namespace.

2. The use of `void` as the parameter list in `cubedNum()` function: The `void` keyword is unnecessary in C++ when there are no parameters. It is better to omit it.

3. The use of an infinite loop: The `while (1)` loop can be replaced with a more readable and explicit condition, such as `while (true)`.

4. The input validation loop: The code checks if the input number is between 0 and 100 using an `if` statement inside a loop. Instead, we can use a single `do-while` loop to ensure that the input is within the desired range, eliminating the need for the `break` statement.

5. The calculation of the cube: The code uses a loop to calculate the cube of the number by multiplying it three times. This can be optimized by using the `std::pow()` function from the `<cmath>` library.
