The provided code reads an integer from the user, checks if it is within the range of 0 to 100, and then calculates the cube of the input number. The result is then printed to the console.

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` statement: This statement is not required in this code since we are explicitly using the `std::` namespace prefix for the `cin`, `cout`, and `endl` objects.

2. Avoid the use of the `while (1)` loop: Instead of using an infinite loop, we can use a `do-while` loop to ensure that the input is valid. This way, we don't need to initialize `inputNum` with an arbitrary value of -1.

3. Use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the cube: Instead of using a loop to multiply the input number three times, we can directly calculate the cube by multiplying the number with itself twice.

4. Avoid unnecessary variable assignments: The `result` variable can be directly printed to the console without assigning it to another variable.

With these optimizations in mind, let's update the code:
