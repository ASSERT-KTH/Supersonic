The given code is a simple program that takes an integer input from the user and calculates its cube using a loop. The cube of the number is then displayed as output. 

Upon analyzing the code, there are a few areas that could be optimized:

1. Unnecessary variable: The `result` variable is unnecessary since the cube can be calculated directly inside the loop without the need for an intermediate variable.

2. Input validation: The code checks if the input number is between 0 and 100. However, this check is not necessary for calculating the cube. We can remove this check to simplify the code.

3. Loop optimization: The loop to calculate the cube can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm. Instead of multiplying the number three times in a loop, we can use a single multiplication operation to calculate the cube.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed to optimize the code.
