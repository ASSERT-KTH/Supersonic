The provided code reads an integer input from the user and calculates the cube of that number. However, there are several areas of improvement that can be made to optimize this code:

1. Remove the `using namespace std;` directive: This directive brings all the names in the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to name clashes and potential performance issues. Instead, explicitly qualify the names from the `std` namespace when used.

2. Avoid unnecessary `void` parameter in `cubedNum` function: The `void` parameter in the function declaration is unnecessary and can be removed.

3. Use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the cube: The current implementation uses a loop to multiply the input number three times. This can be optimized by using a single multiplication operation.

4. Optimize input validation: The current code checks if the input number is between 0 and 100 using an if statement inside a while loop. This can be improved by using a do-while loop and removing the if statement.

5. Remove unnecessary `return` statement: The `return` statement at the end of the `cubedNum` function is unnecessary and can be removed.
