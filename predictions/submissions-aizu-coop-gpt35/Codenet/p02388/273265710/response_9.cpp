The given code prompts the user to enter a number between 0 and 100, and then calculates and prints the cube of that number. However, there are several areas where this code can be optimized for better efficiency:

1. The input validation loop can be improved. Instead of using a while loop with a break statement, we can use a do-while loop. This way, we avoid the unnecessary check of the condition twice.

2. The cubing of the number can be optimized by using a single multiplication instead of a loop. This can be achieved by multiplying the number by itself twice.

3. The 'using namespace std;' statement is not necessary in this code as there is no need to use the std namespace. It is recommended to avoid using the 'using namespace' directive in order to prevent potential naming conflicts.

4. The 'void' keyword in the function declaration 'void cubedNum(void)' is not necessary. It is sufficient to declare the function as 'void cubedNum()'.
