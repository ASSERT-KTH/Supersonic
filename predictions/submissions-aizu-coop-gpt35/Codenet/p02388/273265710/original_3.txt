Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies can be identified:

1. The use of `using namespace std` brings all the names from the std namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts and decrease code readability. It's better to avoid this practice and use the std namespace explicitly where needed.

2. The function `cubedNum` uses a while loop to continuously read input until a valid number is entered. This can lead to inefficient memory usage and unnecessary CPU cycles. It would be better to validate the input using a single if condition before entering the loop.

3. The for loop in `cubedNum` calculates the cube of the input number by multiplying it three times. This can be optimized by using a single multiplication instead.

4. The `return` statement at the end of the `cubedNum` function is unnecessary, as the function has a void return type.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be proposed:

1. Remove the `using namespace std` line and use the std namespace explicitly where needed.

2. Modify the input validation logic to eliminate the need for a while loop. This can be done by using a do-while loop instead.

3. Replace the for loop with a single multiplication to calculate the cube of the input number.

Taking these steps into account, the optimized code can be written as follows:
