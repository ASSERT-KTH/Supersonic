The provided code is a simple C program that reads an integer input, computes the cube of the input, and prints the result. 

Upon initial analysis, there are no major performance bottlenecks or inefficient memory usages in the code. However, we can still make some optimizations to improve the program's efficiency.

Here is an optimization strategy for the code:

1. Remove unnecessary code: The code is already minimal, so there are no unnecessary computations or redundant sections to remove.

2. Compiler optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations to help improve the code's performance. For example, we can use optimization flags while compiling the code to enable compiler optimizations like loop unrolling and inline function expansion.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of the optimizations.

Step 1: Remove unnecessary code
The provided code is already minimal, so there is no unnecessary code to remove.

Step 2: Compiler optimizations
To enable compiler optimizations, we can use optimization flags while compiling the code. For example, using the `-O3` flag with GCC will enable aggressive optimizations that can significantly improve the code's performance.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  printf("%d\n", x * x * x);
  return 0;
}
```

By following this optimization strategy, we have made minimal yet effective changes to the original code. The optimized code preserves the functionality and output of the original code, while potentially improving its performance through compiler optimizations.
