The provided code is a simple program that takes an integer input from the user, calculates its cube, and then prints the result. This code is already quite efficient as it only performs a single mathematical operation. However, there are a few potential areas where we can make some optimizations.

1. Remove the `using namespace std;` directive: This directive brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts. It is generally considered a better practice to use the `std::` prefix when accessing names from the `std` namespace.

2. Optimize input/output operations: The current code uses `cin` to read the input and `cout` to write the output. While these operations are generally efficient, they can be further optimized by disabling the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. This can be achieved by adding the following lines of code before the `main` function:

```cpp
static const auto fast_io = []() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    return 0;
}();
```

3. Use a more efficient multiplication technique: The current code calculates the cube of the input number by multiplying it three times. We can optimize this calculation by using a more efficient multiplication technique, such as exponentiation by squaring. This technique reduces the number of multiplications required to calculate the cube. Here's an optimized version of the multiplication:

```cpp
int cube = n * n;
int result = cube * n;
```

4. Update the variable names: The variable name `n` is not very descriptive. We can update it to `input` to improve code readability.

Taking all these optimizations into account, here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

static const auto fast_io = []() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(nullptr);
    return 0;
}();

int main() {
    int input;
    std::cin >> input;
    
    int cube = input * input;
    int result = cube * input;
    
    std::cout << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

These optimizations aim to improve the performance and readability of the code without significantly altering its functionality.
