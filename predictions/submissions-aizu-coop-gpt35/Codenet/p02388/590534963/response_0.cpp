The provided code is a simple program that takes an integer input from the user, calculates its cube, and prints the result. This code is already quite efficient and does not have any major performance bottlenecks. However, there are a few optimizations that can be made to further improve its efficiency.

1. Avoiding namespace import:
   In the original code, the `using namespace std;` directive is used to import the entire `std` namespace. While this can make the code more concise, it also introduces the risk of name conflicts. To minimize this risk, it is generally recommended to explicitly qualify names from the `std` namespace. Therefore, we will remove the `using namespace std;` line and modify the code accordingly.

2. Avoiding unnecessary input/output operations:
   While the input and output operations (`cin` and `cout`) are necessary for this program, they can be quite slow compared to other computations. To minimize the impact of input/output operations on the overall performance, we can reduce the number of times these operations are performed. Currently, the input is taken and the output is printed in separate statements. We can combine these statements into a single one to avoid unnecessary function calls.

3. Using `std::pow` for exponentiation:
   In the original code, the cube of the input number is calculated by multiplying it three times. However, this can be optimized by using the `std::pow` function from the `<cmath>` library. The `std::pow` function calculates the power of a number more efficiently than multiple multiplications.
