The given code is a simple C++ program that reads an integer from the user and prints its cube. While this program is straightforward, there are a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The program uses the `iostream` library, which can be inefficient for input/output operations. We can improve performance by using the more efficient `cstdio` library instead.
2. The program uses the `using namespace std;` directive, which brings the entire `std` namespace into scope. This can lead to name clashes and can make the code less readable. It's better to use the `std::` prefix explicitly for the standard library functions and types.
3. The program performs unnecessary calculations by taking the cube of the input number. We can optimize this by directly multiplying the number by itself twice (n * n * n).

Based on these observations, let's proceed with optimizing the code.
