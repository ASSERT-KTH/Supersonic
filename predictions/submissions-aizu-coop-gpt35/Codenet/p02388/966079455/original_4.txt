Analysis:
The given code is a simple program that takes an integer as input, calculates its cube, and then prints the result. There are not many performance bottlenecks in this code since it is quite simple. However, we can still optimize it to improve efficiency.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary memory usage: In the given code, the variable y is used to store the cube of x. However, since we only need to print the result, we can directly print the cube of x without storing it in a separate variable.

2. Enable compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to let the compiler automatically optimize the code for us. We can enable compiler optimizations by passing appropriate flags to the compiler.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the variable y and directly print the cube of x:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int x;
  
  std::cin >> x;
  std::cout << x * x * x << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```
By directly printing the cube of x without storing it in a separate variable, we avoid unnecessary memory usage.

2. Enable compiler optimizations:
To enable compiler optimizations, we can pass appropriate flags to the compiler. For example, if we are using GCC, we can use the -O2 flag to enable level 2 optimizations. The optimized code will look like this:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int x;
  
  std::cin >> x;
  std::cout << x * x * x << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```
Enabling compiler optimizations allows the compiler to apply various optimizations, such as loop unrolling, constant propagation, and dead code elimination, to improve the performance of the code.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int x;
  
  std::cin >> x;
  std::cout << x * x * x << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized code removes unnecessary memory usage and enables compiler optimizations to improve efficiency.
