The provided code is a simple program that takes an integer as input, computes the cube of that integer, and then outputs the result. While the code is straightforward, there are a few optimizations that can be made to improve its efficiency.

1. Remove unnecessary variable:
   The variable `y` is unnecessary and can be eliminated. Instead, we can directly output the result of `x * x * x` without storing it in a separate variable.

2. Use more efficient input and output functions:
   The `std::cin` and `std::cout` functions are convenient, but they can be slow for large inputs/outputs. Instead, we can use the `scanf` function for input and `printf` function for output, which are generally faster.

3. Enable compiler optimizations:
   We should enable compiler optimizations to allow the compiler to apply various optimization techniques. This can be done by passing appropriate compiler flags during compilation, such as `-O2` for level 2 optimizations.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the optimized code.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  printf("%d\n", x * x * x);
  return 0;
}
```

By eliminating the unnecessary variable, using more efficient input/output functions, and enabling compiler optimizations, we have improved both the running time and memory usage of the program.
