The given code appears to solve a geometric problem involving circles and rectangles. The main function repeatedly reads input values for the width and height of a rectangle (`W` and `H`, respectively), as well as three areas (`sa`, `sb`, and `sc`) that represent the areas of three circles.

The code then attempts to find two circles that can fit inside the rectangle without overlapping each other or extending outside the rectangle. If such circles exist, their positions and radii are printed; otherwise, the string "impossible" is printed.

Let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The `calc` function calculates the distance between the centers of two circles given their radii and the area of overlap between them. This function uses a binary search to find the distance that corresponds to the desired area of overlap. This binary search is repeated 80 times, which might be excessive and can potentially be optimized.

2. The `judge` function checks if a circle with center `(x, y)` and radius `r` is completely contained within a rectangle with width `W` and height `H`. The function performs several inequality checks, which can be optimized.

3. The `solve` function attempts to find two circles that can fit inside the rectangle without overlapping. It uses nested loops and conditionals to iterate through possible positions and orientations of the circles. However, the nested loops and conditionals can be simplified and optimized.

4. The `main` function repeatedly reads input values and calls the `solve` function to find the circles. It outputs the results using `printf` or `cout`, depending on whether the solution is reversed. This part of the code does not require optimization.

Based on this analysis, let's formulate an optimization strategy and propose specific optimizations.
