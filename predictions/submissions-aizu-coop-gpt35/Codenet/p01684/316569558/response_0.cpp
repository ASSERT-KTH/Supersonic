The provided code is a program that solves a geometry problem. It takes input values for the width and height of a rectangle, and three areas of three circles. The program then tries to find a configuration of three circles inside the rectangle such that their areas match the given input areas.

Upon initial analysis, the following potential performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies can be identified:

1. The `calc` function performs a binary search to find the value of `d` that satisfies a certain condition. This binary search is repeated 80 times in a loop. The number of iterations can potentially be reduced without affecting the accuracy of the result.

2. The `judge` function checks if a circle is completely contained within a rectangle by comparing its coordinates and radius with the rectangle's dimensions. The current implementation uses floating-point comparisons, which can be slow and imprecise.

3. The `solve` function contains nested loops that iterate over possible positions of the circles. These loops can potentially be optimized to reduce the number of iterations.

4. The `printf` function is called multiple times to output the coordinates and radii of the circles. Using `printf` for output can be slow and inefficient compared to other output methods.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be devised:

1. Optimize the binary search in the `calc` function by reducing the number of iterations.

2. Replace the floating-point comparisons in the `judge` function with integer comparisons.

3. Optimize the nested loops in the `solve` function to reduce the number of iterations.

4. Replace the use of `printf` with a more efficient output method.
