Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified several areas for optimization:

1. The use of the `bzero` function: This function is used to set all elements of the `t` array to zero. However, it is unnecessary to set the entire array to zero every time the loop runs. We can optimize this by initializing `t` to zero outside the loop.

2. The use of `scanf`: The current implementation of `scanf` is not very efficient. It can be improved by specifying the format string to read integers directly instead of reading characters and then converting them to integers. Additionally, the use of `scanf` to read characters individually can be optimized by reading the entire line as a string and then processing the characters.

3. The use of `puts` and `putchar`: The output of the program is printed character by character using `putchar`. This can be improved by storing the output in a buffer and then printing the entire buffer at once using `puts`.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of the optimization strategy.
