After analyzing the provided code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Input and Output:
   - The inputArray() function reads the input values one by one using the >> operator, which can be slow for large inputs. Instead, we can use the `std::istream::read()` function to read the entire input buffer at once.
   - The printArray() function prints the array elements one by one, which can be slow for large arrays. Instead, we can use the `std::ostream::write()` function to write the entire array to the output buffer at once.

2. Memory Usage:
   - The code uses two global vectors, L and R, to store temporary arrays during the merge operation. These vectors are preallocated with a fixed size of 250,000 elements, which may be larger than necessary and result in wasted memory. Instead, we can allocate these temporary arrays dynamically based on the size of the input array.

3. Merge Sort:
   - The mergeSort() function uses a recursive approach to implement the merge sort algorithm. While recursive implementations are elegant, they can consume a significant amount of stack space for large input sizes. We can optimize this by converting the recursive implementation to an iterative one using a stack data structure.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations to allow the compiler to perform additional optimizations on the code. This can be achieved by adding appropriate compiler flags or pragma directives.
