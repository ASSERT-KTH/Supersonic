Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several areas where optimizations can be made:

1. Inefficient memory usage: The code uses two vectors, `L` and `R`, to store the left and right subarrays during the merge sort process. However, these vectors are unnecessarily created and resized for each recursive call of `mergeSort()`. This can lead to significant memory overhead and slow down the sorting process.

2. Redundant memory assignments: The code assigns `UINT32_MAX` to the last elements of `L` and `R` arrays before merging. However, this assignment is unnecessary as the merge loop terminates when either `L` or `R` is exhausted. Therefore, we can eliminate these assignments to improve efficiency.

3. Inefficient loop termination condition: The condition `left + 1 < right` is used to determine if the array `A` has more than one element. However, this condition is not optimal as it requires two comparisons and a subtraction operation. We can optimize this condition to `left < right - 1`, which only requires one comparison.

4. Lack of loop unrolling: The merge loop can be further optimized by unrolling the loop, which reduces the number of loop iterations and improves cache utilization.

5. Compiler optimizations: We can suggest the use of compiler optimizations such as loop vectorization and function inlining to further improve the performance of the code.

Based on these observations, I will now provide a step-by-step explanation of each optimization and implement the optimized code.
