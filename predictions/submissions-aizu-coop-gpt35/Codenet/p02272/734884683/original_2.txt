Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structure: The code uses `vector<uint32_t>` for `L` and `R` arrays. However, these arrays are always of fixed size 250000. Using a dynamically resizing vector introduces unnecessary memory overhead. We can replace these vectors with fixed-size arrays to improve memory usage.

2. Redundant vector assignment: The code assigns `L` and `R` vectors at the beginning of the `merge` function. However, these vectors are overwritten within the loop. This assignment is redundant and can be removed to improve performance.

3. Unnecessary vector resizing: The code assigns `UINT32_MAX` to the last elements of `L` and `R` vectors. However, since we are already using fixed-size arrays, we can assign `UINT32_MAX` directly to the last indices of the arrays without resizing.

4. Unnecessary function calls: The code uses two separate functions, `inputArray` and `printArray`, to input and print the array elements. However, these functions are simple and can be replaced with direct input/output operations within the `main` function itself.

5. Inefficient loop condition: The loop condition in the `mergeSort` function checks if `left + 1 < right`. However, this condition can be simplified to `left < right` since the `merge` function handles the case when there is only one element in the range.

Based on these observations, I will proceed with the following optimization steps:

1. Replace `vector<uint32_t>` with fixed-size arrays for `L` and `R`.
2. Remove the redundant vector assignment in the `merge` function.
3. Assign `UINT32_MAX` directly to the last indices of `L` and `R` arrays.
4. Replace the `inputArray` and `printArray` functions with direct input/output operations.
5. Simplify the loop condition in the `mergeSort` function.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

static int compared = 0;
static uint32_t L[250000];
static uint32_t R[250000];

static inline void merge(uint32_t A[], uint32_t left, uint32_t mid, uint32_t right) {
  uint32_t n1 = mid - left;
  uint32_t n2 = right - mid;
  
  for (uint32_t i = 0; i < n1; i++) {
    L[i] = A[left + i];
  }
  
  for (uint32_t i = 0; i < n2; i++) {
    R[i] = A[mid + i];
  }
  
  L[n1] = R[n2] = UINT32_MAX;
  
  for (uint32_t i = 0, j = 0, k = left; k < right; k++) {
    compared++;
    if (L[i] <= R[j]) {
      A[k] = L[i];
      i++;
    } else {
      A[k] = R[j];
      j++;
    }
  }
}

static inline void mergeSort(uint32_t A[], uint32_t left, uint32_t right) {
  if (left < right) {
    uint32_t mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergeSort(A, left, mid);
    mergeSort(A, mid, right);
    merge(A, left, mid, right);
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  uint32_t A[250000];
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  
  mergeSort(A, 0, n);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << (i != 0 ? " " : "") << A[i];
  }
  
  cout << endl;
  cout << compared << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have reduced unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations, eliminated redundant assignments, and simplified the code. The optimized code should now run more efficiently and with improved performance.
