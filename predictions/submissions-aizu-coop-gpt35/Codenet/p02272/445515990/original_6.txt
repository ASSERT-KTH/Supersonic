Code Analysis:
1. The code implements the merge sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.
2. The merge function merges two sorted subarrays into a single sorted array.
3. The mergesort function recursively divides the array into two halves and calls merge to combine them.
4. The main function reads the input, performs the sorting, and outputs the sorted array along with the number of comparisons made during the sorting process.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use pointers instead of arrays for L and R: The current code uses fixed-size arrays for L and R. Since the size of these arrays depends on the input size, using pointers and dynamic memory allocation can save memory and make the code more efficient.
2. Avoid unnecessary assignments in the merge function: The merge function unnecessarily assigns the value of INF to L[n1] and R[n2] in each recursive call. This can be moved outside the loop and assigned only once.
3. Optimize the merge loop: The current merge loop performs unnecessary assignments of L[i] or R[j] to A[left + k] even when one of them has reached the end of its subarray. This can be optimized by using separate loops for the remaining elements of L and R after one of them has been exhausted.
4. Use a better algorithm for merging: The current merge algorithm performs comparisons for all elements in L and R, even if one of the subarrays has been fully merged. This can be optimized by using a sentinel value at the end of each subarray and terminating the loop when one of the subarrays has been fully merged.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Use pointers instead of arrays for L and R:
   - Replace the array declarations `int L[1 + MAX / 2] = {0}` and `int R[1 + MAX / 2] = {0}` with the corresponding pointer declarations `int *L = new int[1 + MAX / 2]` and `int *R = new int[1 + MAX / 2]`.
   - Remember to deallocate the memory at the end of the program using `delete[] L` and `delete[] R`.

2. Avoid unnecessary assignments in the merge function:
   - Move the assignment of INF to L[n1] and R[n2] outside the loop in the merge function.
   - Update the merge function as follows:

```cpp
void merge(int *A, int left, int mid, int right) {
  int n1, n2, n, i, j;
  n1 = mid - left;
  n2 = right - mid;
  for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {
    L[i] = A[left + i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n2; i++) {
    R[i] = A[mid + i];
  }
  L[n1] = INF;
  R[n2] = INF;
  i = 0;
  j = 0;
  for (int k = 0; k < right - left; k++) {
    if (L[i] <= R[j]) {
      A[left + k] = L[i];
      i++;
    } else {
      A[left + k] = R[j];
      j++;
    }
    cnt++;
  }
}
```

3. Optimize the merge loop:
   - Add separate loops to merge the remaining elements of L or R when one of them has been exhausted.
   - Update the merge function as follows:

```cpp
void merge(int *A, int left, int mid, int right) {
  int n1, n2, n, i, j;
  n1 = mid - left;
  n2 = right - mid;
  for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {
    L[i] = A[left + i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n2; i++) {
    R[i] = A[mid + i];
  }
  L[n1] = INF;
  R[n2] = INF;
  i = 0;
  j = 0;
  for (int k = 0; k < right - left; k++) {
    if (j >= n2 || (i < n1 && L[i] <= R[j])) {
      A[left + k] = L[i];
      i++;
    } else {
      A[left + k] = R[j];
      j++;
    }
    cnt++;
  }
  // Merge remaining elements of L or R
  while (i < n1) {
    A[left + i + j] = L[i];
    i++;
    cnt++;
  }
  while (j < n2) {
    A[left + i + j] = R[j];
    j++;
    cnt++;
  }
}
```

4. Use a better algorithm for merging:
   - Remove the assignment of INF to L[n1] and R[n2] in the merge function, as it is no longer needed.
   - Update the merge function as follows:

```cpp
void merge(int *A, int left, int mid, int right) {
  int n1, n2, n, i, j;
  n1 = mid - left;
  n2 = right - mid;
  for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {
    L[i] = A[left + i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n2; i++) {
    R[i] = A[mid + i];
  }
  i = 0;
  j = 0;
  while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
    if (L[i] <= R[j]) {
      A[left + i + j] = L[i];
      i++;
    } else {
      A[left + i + j] = R[j];
      j++;
    }
    cnt++;
  }
  // Merge remaining elements of L or R
  while (i < n1) {
    A[left + i + j] = L[i];
    i++;
    cnt++;
  }
  while (j < n2) {
    A[left + i + j] = R[j];
    j++;
    cnt++;
  }
}
```

5. Add compiler optimization flags:
   - Add compiler optimization flags to hint the compiler to optimize the code.
   - Update the main function as follows:

```cpp
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int N;
  cnt = 0;
  cin >> N;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> S[i];
  }
  mergesort(S, 0, N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (i == N - 1) {
      cout << S[i] << endl;
    } else {
      cout << S[i] << " ";
    }
  }
  cout << cnt << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 1000000001;
const int MAX = 500000;
int cnt;
int S[MAX] = {0}, *L = new int[1 + MAX / 2], *R = new int[1 + MAX / 2];
void merge(int *A, int left, int mid, int right) {
  int n1, n2, n, i, j;
  n1 = mid - left;
  n2 = right - mid;
  for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {
    L[i] = A[left + i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n2; i++) {
    R[i] = A[mid + i];
  }
  i = 0;
  j = 0;
  while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
    if (L[i] <= R[j]) {
      A[left + i + j] = L[i];
      i++;
    } else {
      A[left + i + j] = R[j];
      j++;
    }
    cnt++;
  }
  // Merge remaining elements of L or R
  while (i < n1) {
    A[left + i + j] = L[i];
    i++;
    cnt++;
  }
  while (j < n2) {
    A[left + i + j] = R[j];
    j++;
    cnt++;
  }
}
void mergesort(int *A, int left, int right) {
  int mid;
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergesort(A, left, mid);
    mergesort(A, mid, right);
    merge(A, left, mid, right);
  }
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int N;
  cnt = 0;
  cin >> N;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> S[i];
  }
  mergesort(S, 0, N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (i == N - 1) {
      cout << S[i] << endl;
    } else {
      cout << S[i] << " ";
    }
  }
  cout << cnt << endl;

  delete[] L;
  delete[] R;

  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:
1. The use of pointers instead of arrays for L and R improves memory efficiency but adds the complexity of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. However, the trade-off is worth it considering the potential memory savings for large input sizes.
2. The optimization of the merge loop reduces unnecessary assignments and comparisons, improving the efficiency of the algorithm. The trade-off is a slightly more complex merge function, but the performance gain outweighs the increased complexity.
3. The use of compiler optimization flags can improve the performance of the code, but it might also increase the compilation time. However, the trade-off is acceptable considering the potential runtime performance improvement.
