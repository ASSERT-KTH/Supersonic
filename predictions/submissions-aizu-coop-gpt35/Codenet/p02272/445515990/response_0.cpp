Upon analyzing the given code, the following optimizations can be made:

1. Replace the `using namespace std;` statement with explicit namespace usage to avoid namespace pollution and improve code readability.

2. The `merge` function can be optimized by using iterators instead of array indices. This will eliminate the need for separate variables to keep track of indices.

3. Instead of using a global variable `cnt` to count the number of comparisons, we can pass it as a parameter to the `merge` function and update it directly.

4. The `merge` function can be further optimized by using a temporary array to store the merged subarrays, instead of using separate `L` and `R` arrays.

5. The `mergesort` function can be optimized by using a cutoff for small subarrays. When the size of the subarray is below a certain threshold, we can switch to a more efficient sorting algorithm like insertion sort.

6. The `mergesort` function can be optimized by using an iterative approach instead of recursion. This will reduce the function call overhead and improve performance.

7. Compiler optimizations like loop unrolling and compiler directives like `#pragma` can be used to further optimize the code.
