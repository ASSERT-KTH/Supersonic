1. Code Analysis:
   - The program is using the merge sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.
   - The merge function is used to merge two subarrays into a single sorted array.
   - The mergesort function is recursively called to divide the array into subarrays until the subarrays have only one element.
   - The merge and mergesort functions have a time complexity of O(nlogn), where n is the number of elements in the array.
   - The program counts the number of comparisons made during the sorting process and outputs it.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Use a more efficient data structure to store the temporary subarrays during the merge sort process.
   - Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations.
   - Optimize the merge function to reduce redundant computations and improve cache locality.
   - Enable compiler optimizations to improve code generation.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Replace the arrays L and R with dynamically allocated memory.
      - The current implementation uses fixed-size arrays to store the subarrays. Instead, we can allocate memory dynamically based on the size of the subarrays.
      - This will reduce memory usage when sorting large arrays and avoid potential buffer overflows.
   2. Remove the redundant initialization of L and R arrays.
      - The current implementation initializes the L and R arrays with zeros before copying the elements. This is unnecessary since the arrays will be completely overwritten.
   3. Replace the merge loop with a while loop and separate the loop condition from the element assignment.
      - The current implementation uses a for loop with a loop counter `k`. Instead, we can use a while loop with separate loop counters `i` and `j`.
      - This will simplify the loop condition and improve cache locality by reducing the number of array accesses.
   4. Use `std::vector` instead of dynamic memory allocation.
      - Instead of manually allocating and deallocating memory using `new` and `delete[]`, we can use `std::vector` to manage the memory automatically.
      - This will simplify the code and ensure proper memory management without the risk of memory leaks.
   5. Enable compiler optimizations.
      - Use compiler-specific optimization flags or pragma directives to enable additional optimizations.
      - This will allow the compiler to perform various optimizations, such as loop unrolling and function inlining, to improve the performance of the code.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int INF = 1000000001;
const int MAX = 500000;

int cnt;
vector<int> S(MAX);
vector<int> L, R;

void merge(int *A, int left, int mid, int right) {
  int n1, n2, n, i, j;
  n1 = mid - left;
  n2 = right - mid;

  L.resize(n1 + 1);
  R.resize(n2 + 1);

  for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {
    L[i] = A[left + i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n2; i++) {
    R[i] = A[mid + i];
  }

  L[n1] = INF;
  R[n2] = INF;

  i = 0;
  j = 0;
  int k = left;

  while (i < n1 || j < n2) {
    if (L[i] <= R[j]) {
      A[k] = L[i];
      i++;
    } else {
      A[k] = R[j];
      j++;
    }
    cnt++;
    k++;
  }
}

void mergesort(int *A, int left, int right) {
  int mid;
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergesort(A, left, mid);
    mergesort(A, mid, right);
    merge(A, left, mid, right);
  }
}

int main() {
  int N;
  cnt = 0;
  cin >> N;

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> S[i];
  }

  mergesort(S.data(), 0, N);

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (i == N - 1) {
      cout << S[i] << endl;
    } else {
      cout << S[i] << " ";
    }
  }

  cout << cnt << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Note: The code changes are minimal yet effective, focusing on improving memory management and reducing redundant computations. The use of `std::vector` simplifies memory allocation and deallocation, while the optimized merge loop improves cache locality. Compiler optimizations can be enabled separately based on the specific compiler and build settings.
