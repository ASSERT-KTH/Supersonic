The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The code reads the number of elements in the array, followed by the array itself, from the input. It then performs the merge sort algorithm on the array and prints the sorted array followed by the number of comparisons made during the sorting process.

Upon analysis, the following potential optimizations can be made:

1. Use `vector` instead of built-in arrays: The code uses built-in arrays `S`, `L`, and `R` to store the input array and temporary arrays for merging. However, using `vector` instead of built-in arrays can improve memory usage and simplify the code. `vector` automatically manages the memory allocation, which eliminates the need to specify the maximum size of the array.

2. Remove the global variable `cnt`: The global variable `cnt` is used to count the number of comparisons made during the sorting process. It is better to pass the count as a parameter to the `merge` function and update it locally within the function. This avoids the use of a global variable and improves code readability.

3. Avoid unnecessary copies in the `merge` function: The `merge` function currently copies the elements from the input array `A` to temporary arrays `L` and `R`. This unnecessary copying can be avoided by using iterators to represent the left and right subarrays instead of separate temporary arrays.

4. Modify the termination condition in `mergesort`: The termination condition in the `mergesort` function `if (left + 1 < right)` can be modified to `if (left < right)` since the base case of a single element array is already handled correctly.

5. Optimize memory usage in `mergesort`: The `mergesort` function is currently implemented recursively, which can result in stack overflow for large input sizes. To optimize memory usage, we can use an iterative approach using a stack or switch to a hybrid approach that switches to insertion sort for small subarrays.
