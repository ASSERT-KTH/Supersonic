The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance and memory usage:

1. Inefficient use of global variables: The variables `count`, `n`, `Left`, `Right`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `n1`, and `n2` are declared as global variables, which can lead to confusion and potential bugs. It is better to declare these variables within the appropriate scope, such as within the `main` function or as local variables in the `mergesort` and `merge` functions.

2. Unnecessary array allocation: The arrays `Left` and `Right` are allocated with a fixed size of 250001 elements, even though they are only used for temporary storage during the merge operation. This can lead to unnecessary memory usage. Since the maximum size of the array `S` is 500000, we can allocate `Left` and `Right` with a maximum size of `n/2 + 1` to ensure they have enough space.

3. Redundant calculations in the merge sort function: The merge sort function calculates the middle index (`mid`) of the array multiple times, which is inefficient. We can calculate it once and reuse the value in the subsequent recursive calls.

4. Inefficient merge operation: The merge operation uses a while loop to compare and merge elements from the `Left` and `Right` arrays. However, we can optimize this loop by using a `for` loop instead. By iterating from `left` to `right` directly, we can avoid unnecessary comparisons and assignments.

5. Lack of optimization hints for the compiler: The code does not provide any optimization hints to the compiler. We can use compiler-specific pragmas or optimization flags to enable additional compiler optimizations.

To optimize the code, let's follow these steps:
