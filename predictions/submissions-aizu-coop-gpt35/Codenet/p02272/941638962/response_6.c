The given code implements the merge sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Inefficient Memory Usage:
   - The `Left` and `Right` arrays have fixed sizes of 250001 each, regardless of the input size. This leads to wasted memory when the input size is smaller. We can optimize this by dynamically allocating memory for these arrays based on the input size.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The variable `MAX` is defined as 1000000001, but it is only used as a sentinel value in the `merge` function. We can eliminate this variable and use `INT_MAX` from the `<limits.h>` library instead.

3. Inefficient Loop:
   - The loop in the `merge` function compares the elements from the `Left` and `Right` arrays one by one until all elements are merged. However, we can optimize this loop by using two separate loops for merging the remaining elements from `Left` and `Right` when one of the arrays is exhausted.

4. Compiler Optimization:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations using pragmas or compiler flags to further improve the performance of the code.
