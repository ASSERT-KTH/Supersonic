The given code seems to solve a problem related to finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. However, there are several areas where performance improvements can be made. Let's analyze the code and propose optimization steps.

1. Inefficient Memory Usage:
   - The code initializes two-dimensional arrays `b` and `x` with size `n`. This can be inefficient if `n` is large. Instead, we can use dynamic memory allocation to allocate memory only when needed.
   - The code uses a set `rei` to store unique elements. However, a vector can be more efficient in terms of memory usage and iteration speed.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The code calculates the shortest path using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm twice. We can optimize this by calculating it only once and reusing the results.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The code uses nested loops to iterate over the elements of arrays `b` and `x`. We can optimize these loops by using loop unrolling, which reduces loop overhead and improves cache utilization.

4. Compiler Optimization:
   - We can suggest using compiler optimizations, such as loop vectorization and function inlining, to further improve performance.
