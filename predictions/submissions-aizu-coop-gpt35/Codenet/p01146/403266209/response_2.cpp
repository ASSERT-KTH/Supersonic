The given code calculates the minimum distance between two nodes in a graph using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance and memory usage. 

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header and includes unnecessary libraries. Instead, we should include the specific headers that are required for the program.

2. Replace `set<int>` with a `vector<int>`: The code uses a `set<int>` to store the nodes. However, since the nodes are integers and there is no need for sorting or uniqueness, a `vector<int>` would be a more efficient data structure.

3. Use a 1D array instead of a 2D array for `b[][]` and `x[][]`: The code uses a 2D array to store the distance between nodes. However, since the size of the array is known at compile-time, it can be replaced with a 1D array for better memory efficiency.

4. Optimize the Floyd-Warshall algorithm: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used twice in the code, but it can be optimized to reduce redundant computations. We can avoid recalculating the minimum distance between nodes that have already been calculated.

5. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The code uses `rei.count()` to check if a node is present in the set. Instead, we can use a boolean array to check if a node is present.

6. Use `constexpr` for constants: The code uses the `#define` directive for constants. However, using `constexpr` would be a better option as it allows the compiler to optimize the code further.

7. Add compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization, to improve the performance of the code.
