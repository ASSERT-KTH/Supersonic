The given code calculates the minimum time required to travel between two cities, `a` and `h`, given a set of intermediate cities that can be visited. The code uses the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to calculate the shortest path between all pairs of cities. However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized:

1. Use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes every standard library in C++. It is more efficient to include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<set>`.

2. Use of `set<int>` to store the cities: The set data structure has a time complexity of O(log n) for insertion and search operations. Since the number of cities is limited, it is more efficient to use an array or vector to store the cities and use a boolean flag to mark the visited cities.

3. Unnecessary initialization of `b` and `x` arrays: The arrays `b` and `x` are initialized with `INF` values, but only a subset of values are assigned during the algorithm. Initializing the arrays with `INF` is unnecessary and wastes memory.

4. Redundant check for `rei.count(i)` and `rei.count(j)`: The code checks if `i` and `j` are present in the `rei` set twice. This check can be combined into a single condition.

5. Use of `r` macro for loops: The `r` macro is used to define loops, but it adds unnecessary complexity to the code. It is better to use standard for loops for better readability.

6. Use of `endl` instead of `'\n'`: The code uses `endl` to print a new line, but it flushes the output stream every time. It is more efficient to use `'\n'` instead.

Based on these observations, we can proceed with the following optimization steps:
