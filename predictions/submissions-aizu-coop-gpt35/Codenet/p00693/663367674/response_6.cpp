Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential optimizations:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The code includes several unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<cfloat>`, `<cmath>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, and `<stack>`. These headers are not used in the code and can be safely removed.

2. Replace raw character arrays with `std::string`: The code uses character arrays to store strings. By replacing them with `std::string`, we can simplify the code and avoid manual string manipulation functions like `strcpy`. This will also eliminate the need to calculate the length of strings manually.

3. Optimize string comparison functions: The code currently uses two string comparison functions, `strCmp` and `ambiguousCmp`, which iterate over characters in a string. We can optimize these functions by using `std::string`'s built-in comparison operators (`==` and `!=`) instead.

4. Use `std::vector` instead of fixed-size arrays: The code uses fixed-size arrays (`Info OK[N]` and `Info NOT[N]`), which may limit the maximum number of elements. By using `std::vector`, we can eliminate this limitation and make the code more flexible.

5. Optimize the erasing loop: The code contains two nested loops to erase elements from the `OK` and `NOT` arrays. This can be optimized by using the `std::remove_if` algorithm along with a lambda function to mark elements as erased.

6. Avoid unnecessary string copying in the loop: The code currently copies strings in each iteration of the loop, which is unnecessary. We can avoid this by iterating over the input directly without copying the strings.
