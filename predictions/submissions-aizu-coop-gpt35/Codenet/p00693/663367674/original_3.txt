The given code is a C++ program that reads input from the user and performs some operations based on the input. The code appears to implement a messaging system where users can send messages to each other. The program takes two inputs: N (the number of rules) and M (the number of messages). It then reads N rules and M messages from the user, applies the rules to the messages, and outputs the filtered messages.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several areas where performance optimizations can be made:

1. String Comparison: The code uses a custom string comparison function `strCmp()` to compare two strings character by character. This function could be optimized to use the `strcmp()` function from the C standard library, which is generally faster.

2. Ambiguous Comparison: The code uses a custom function `ambiguousCmp()` to compare strings with wildcard characters (`?`). This function can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm to handle the wildcard characters.

3. Data Structures: The code uses arrays of structures (`Info` and `Data`) to store information about rules and messages. These arrays could be replaced with more efficient data structures, such as vectors or linked lists.

4. Erasing Rules: The code uses nested loops to check and erase rules based on certain conditions. These loops can be optimized to reduce unnecessary iterations and improve performance.

5. Input/Output: The code uses the `scanf()` and `printf()` functions for input and output operations. These functions can be slow, especially when used repeatedly. Using a faster input/output method, such as `cin` and `cout`, may improve performance.

Now let's discuss each optimization step in detail.
