The given code seems to implement a program that processes a series of input data and applies certain rules to filter and output the valid data. However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized to improve performance and reduce memory usage. 

Let's go through the code and identify potential optimizations:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes several unnecessary header files, such as `bits/stdc++.h` and `cfloat`, which are not used in the code. These can be removed to reduce compilation time and unnecessary dependencies.

2. Avoid using `struct` for small data types: The code defines two structs, `Info` and `Data`, to store information. However, these structs only contain character arrays, which can be directly stored as variables without the need for a struct. This will reduce memory usage and eliminate unnecessary struct operations.

3. Optimize string comparison functions: The code includes two string comparison functions, `strCmp` and `ambiguousCmp`, which compare string arrays character by character. These functions can be optimized by using the `strcmp` function from the `<cstring>` header, which is a standard library function that efficiently compares two strings.

4. Avoid unnecessary string copy operations: The code includes a custom `strcpy` function that copies one string to another. However, this function is not necessary as the standard library provides the `strcpy` function from the `<cstring>` header. By using the standard `strcpy` function, we can avoid unnecessary string copy operations and reduce memory usage.

5. Use more efficient data structures: The code uses arrays to store the `OK` and `NOT` structures. However, using arrays requires constant shifting of elements when erasing elements, resulting in inefficient time complexity. Instead of arrays, we can use a more efficient data structure, such as `std::vector`, which allows for dynamic resizing and efficient element insertion and deletion.

6. Optimize the erasing loop: The code includes two loops for erasing elements from the `OK` and `NOT` structures. These loops can be optimized by using the `std::remove_if` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` header, which efficiently removes elements from a container based on a condition.

7. Avoid unnecessary checks in the message processing loop: The loop that processes the messages checks for the erased flag of the `OK` and `NOT` structures in each iteration. However, this check is unnecessary as the erased elements have already been removed. Removing this unnecessary check will improve the performance of the loop.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization steps.
