The given code appears to be a program that reads input data and performs some operations based on that data. However, the code could be optimized for performance and memory usage. Let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization.

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The `Info` struct stores character arrays for `from` and `to` fields. Using character arrays for strings can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and string comparisons. It would be more efficient to use `std::string` instead.
   - The `Data` struct also uses character arrays for `from`, `to`, and `message` fields. Again, using `std::string` would be more efficient.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `strCmp` function compares two strings character by character. This can be replaced with the built-in `std::strcmp` function, which is more efficient.
   - The `ambiguousCmp` function checks if two strings are equal or if there are any `?` characters in the first string. This can be simplified by using the `std::strcmp` function and checking for the presence of `?` in the first string separately.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The nested loops in the `func` function can be optimized to reduce unnecessary iterations. For example, the loops that check for erasing `Info` structs can be terminated early if the condition is met.
   - The loops that check for ambiguous comparisons can be optimized by checking for erasing conditions before performing the comparison.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Using compiler optimizations can help improve the performance of the code. For example, enabling optimizations like loop unrolling and function inlining can improve the execution time.

Based on this analysis, let's proceed with the optimization steps.
