The given code is a program that processes a series of inputs and maintains a priority queue to keep track of the highest score for each number. The program reads two integers, `n` and `m`, followed by `m` pairs of integers. The first integer in each pair represents a number, and the second integer represents a score. The program updates the score for each number and outputs the number with the highest score.

Upon analyzing the code, several potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Memory Usage: The program uses an array `S` of size `MAX` to store the scores for each number. However, the actual number of unique numbers encountered is not known in advance. Therefore, the array `S` may be allocating more memory than necessary. This can be optimized by using a data structure that dynamically grows as new numbers are encountered.

2. Priority Queue Operations: The program uses a priority queue `Q` to keep track of the highest score for each number. However, after updating the score for a number, the program performs a linear search in the priority queue to find the number with the highest score. This linear search can be expensive, especially when the number of elements in the priority queue is large. Instead, we can modify the data structure to store the maximum score separately and update it whenever necessary.

3. Input/Output Operations: The program uses the `scanf` and `printf` functions for input and output operations. These functions can be slow, especially when used in a loop. Switching to faster input/output methods, such as `cin` and `cout`, can improve performance.
