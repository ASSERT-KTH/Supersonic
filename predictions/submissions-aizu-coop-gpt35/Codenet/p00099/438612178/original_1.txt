Code Analysis:
1. The code uses a priority queue to keep track of the highest-scoring element.
2. It updates the score of element a and pushes it into the priority queue.
3. It then pops elements from the priority queue until it finds an element whose score matches the updated score.
4. The process is repeated for each input.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The code can be optimized by using a more efficient data structure to track the highest-scoring element.
2. The unnecessary "data" struct can be removed, as it only contains two integer fields.
3. The priority queue can be replaced with a simple max heap.
4. The "while (1)" loop can be eliminated, and the program can directly print the highest-scoring element when its score matches the updated score.
5. Compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and optimization flags, can be used to further improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the unnecessary "data" struct and modify the code accordingly. This eliminates the need for the "<" operator overload and reduces memory usage.
2. Replace the priority queue with a max heap. This can be implemented using an array and a separate size variable to keep track of the number of elements in the heap.
3. Modify the code to update the heap when the score of an element is updated. This can be done by either pushing the updated element into the heap or by percolating it up to its correct position.
4. Replace the "while (1)" loop with a direct print statement when the highest-scoring element's score matches the updated score.
5. Enable compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and optimization flags, to further improve performance.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
const int MAX = 1000001;
int S[MAX];
int heap[MAX];
int size = 0;

void percolateUp(int idx) {
  int parent = idx / 2;
  while (parent > 0 && S[heap[parent]] < S[heap[idx]]) {
    swap(heap[parent], heap[idx]);
    idx = parent;
    parent = idx / 2;
  }
}

void percolateDown(int idx) {
  int child = idx * 2;
  while (child <= size) {
    if (child + 1 <= size && S[heap[child + 1]] > S[heap[child]]) {
      child++;
    }
    if (S[heap[idx]] >= S[heap[child]]) {
      break;
    }
    swap(heap[idx], heap[child]);
    idx = child;
    child = idx * 2;
  }
}

void updateHeap(int num) {
  for (int i = 1; i <= size; i++) {
    if (heap[i] == num) {
      percolateUp(i);
      percolateDown(i);
      break;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  heap[0] = 0;  // dummy element
  while (m--) {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    S[a] += b;
    updateHeap(a);
    if (S[heap[1]] == S[a]) {
      cout << heap[1] << " " << S[a] << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code uses a max heap implemented as an array to track the highest-scoring element. The percolateUp and percolateDown functions maintain the heap property after updates. The updateHeap function finds the index of the element in the heap and updates it accordingly. The main loop updates the score of an element, updates the heap, and prints the highest-scoring element if its score matches the updated score.

The optimized code reduces memory usage by removing the unnecessary "data" struct and using a simple array as the max heap. It also improves performance by eliminating the "while (1)" loop and using a direct print statement. Compiler optimizations can be applied by using appropriate compiler flags during compilation.
