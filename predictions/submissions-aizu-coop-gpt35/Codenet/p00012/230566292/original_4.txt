To optimize the given code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The `ccwise` function performs multiple calculations and comparisons, which can be simplified and optimized.

2. Optimize input/output operations: The current implementation uses `scanf` and `printf` for input/output, which can be slow. We can use a faster alternative, such as `cin` and `cout`.

3. Code simplification and readability: The code can be simplified and made more readable by removing unnecessary code, improving variable names, and adding comments.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and pragma directives, to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now let's go through each step and optimize the code accordingly.

Optimization Steps:

1. Simplify the `ccwise` function:
   - Instead of calculating `cross_prod(b, c)` and `dot_prod(b, c)` twice, we can calculate them once and store the results in variables.
   - We can remove the `norm(b) < norm(c)` comparison as it is not required.
   - We can simplify the conditions by using a switch statement.

2. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` for faster input/output.

3. Simplify variable names and add comments for better readability.

4. Enable compiler optimizations by adding pragmas and using loop unrolling.
