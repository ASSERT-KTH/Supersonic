Analysis:

1. The code uses complex numbers to represent points on a plane, and vectors to represent lines and line segments. This can make calculations involving points, lines, and line segments more convenient. However, complex numbers may have some overhead compared to working directly with floating-point numbers.

2. The code defines several helper functions for calculating the cross product and dot product of points, and for determining the orientation of three points. These functions are used in the `ccwise` function to check if a point P lies inside a triangle formed by three other points A, B, and C. The result of this check determines whether the program outputs "YES" or "NO".

3. The `testcase_ends` function reads input from standard input and performs the point orientation check. It returns true if the end of the input is reached, and false otherwise.

4. The main function repeatedly calls `testcase_ends` until the end of the input is reached, and counts the number of test cases solved.

Potential optimizations:

1. The use of complex numbers may introduce some overhead. We can consider using simple structures or arrays to represent points instead of complex numbers.

2. The `ccwise` function calculates the cross product and dot product of two vectors. These calculations can be expensive, especially when performed repeatedly in a loop. We can optimize these calculations by avoiding repeated calculations and simplifying the logic.

3. The `ccwise` function uses multiple if-else statements to determine the orientation of three points. This can be simplified and optimized by using a lookup table or a switch statement.

4. The `testcase_ends` function reads input from standard input using the `scanf` function. This can be slow, especially when reading large inputs. We can consider using a faster input reading method, such as reading the entire input into a buffer and parsing it manually.

Optimization strategy:

1. Replace the usage of complex numbers with a simple structure or array to represent points. This can reduce the overhead of complex number operations.

2. Simplify and optimize the calculations in the `ccwise` function by avoiding repeated calculations and simplifying the logic.

3. Use a lookup table or a switch statement to determine the orientation of three points in the `ccwise` function.

4. Replace the usage of `scanf` in the `testcase_ends` function with a faster input reading method, such as reading the entire input into a buffer and parsing it manually.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Replace the usage of complex numbers with a simple structure or array to represent points. Modify the `using Point = complex<double>;` line to `struct Point { double x, y; };`. Update the code to use the `x` and `y` members of the `Point` structure instead of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

```cpp
struct Point {
  double x, y;
};
```

2. Simplify and optimize the calculations in the `ccwise` function. Instead of calculating the cross product and dot product separately, we can calculate the cross product directly as `(b.x - a.x) * (c.y - a.y) - (b.y - a.y) * (c.x - a.x)`. This avoids the need for complex number operations.

```cpp
CCWiseState ccwise(Point a, Point b, Point c) {
  double cross = (b.x - a.x) * (c.y - a.y) - (b.y - a.y) * (c.x - a.x);
  if (cross > 0) {
    return COUNTER_CLOCKWISE;
  } else if (cross < 0) {
    return CLOCKWISE;
  } else if ((b.x - a.x) * (c.x - a.x) + (b.y - a.y) * (c.y - a.y) < 0) {
    return ONLINE_BACK;
  } else if ((b.x - a.x) * (c.x - a.x) + (b.y - a.y) * (c.y - a.y) > 0) {
    return ONLINE_FRONT;
  } else {
    return ON_SEGMENT;
  }
}
```

3. Use a lookup table or a switch statement to determine the orientation of three points in the `ccwise` function. This can simplify the logic and potentially improve performance.

```cpp
CCWiseState ccwise(Point a, Point b, Point c) {
  double cross = (b.x - a.x) * (c.y - a.y) - (b.y - a.y) * (c.x - a.x);
  double dot = (b.x - a.x) * (c.x - a.x) + (b.y - a.y) * (c.y - a.y);
  
  if (cross > 0) {
    return COUNTER_CLOCKWISE;
  } else if (cross < 0) {
    return CLOCKWISE;
  } else {
    if (dot < 0) {
      return ONLINE_BACK;
    } else if (dot > 0) {
      return ONLINE_FRONT;
    } else {
      return ON_SEGMENT;
    }
  }
}
```

4. Replace the usage of `scanf` in the `testcase_ends` function with a faster input reading method. Read the input into a buffer using `fgets` and parse it manually using `sscanf`.

```cpp
bool testcase_ends() {
  char buffer[100];
  if (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin) == NULL)
    return true;
  
  double x, y;
  sscanf(buffer, "%lf %lf", &x, &y);
  Point A = {x, y};
  
  fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
  sscanf(buffer, "%lf %lf", &x, &y);
  Point B = {x, y};
  
  fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
  sscanf(buffer, "%lf %lf", &x, &y);
  Point C = {x, y};
  
  fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
  sscanf(buffer, "%lf %lf", &x, &y);
  Point P = {x, y};
  
  CCWiseState tmp = ccwise(A, P, B);
  if (tmp != ccwise(B, P, C) || tmp != ccwise(C, P, A)) {
    printf("NO\n");
  } else {
    printf("YES\n");
  }
  
  return false;
}
```

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

struct Point {
  double x, y;
};

enum CCWiseState {
  ONLINE_FRONT = -2,
  CLOCKWISE,
  ON_SEGMENT,
  COUNTER_CLOCKWISE,
};

CCWiseState ccwise(Point a, Point b, Point c) {
  double cross = (b.x - a.x) * (c.y - a.y) - (b.y - a.y) * (c.x - a.x);
  double dot = (b.x - a.x) * (c.x - a.x) + (b.y - a.y) * (c.y - a.y);
  
  if (cross > 0) {
    return COUNTER_CLOCKWISE;
  } else if (cross < 0) {
    return CLOCKWISE;
  } else {
    if (dot < 0) {
      return ONLINE_BACK;
    } else if (dot > 0) {
      return ONLINE_FRONT;
    } else {
      return ON_SEGMENT;
    }
  }
}

bool testcase_ends() {
  char buffer[100];
  if (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin) == NULL)
    return true;
  
  double x, y;
  sscanf(buffer, "%lf %lf", &x, &y);
  Point A = {x, y};
  
  fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
  sscanf(buffer, "%lf %lf", &x, &y);
  Point B = {x, y};
  
  fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
  sscanf(buffer, "%lf %lf", &x, &y);
  Point C = {x, y};
  
  fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
  sscanf(buffer, "%lf %lf", &x, &y);
  Point P = {x, y};
  
  CCWiseState tmp = ccwise(A, P, B);
  if (tmp != ccwise(B, P, C) || tmp != ccwise(C, P, A)) {
    printf("NO\n");
  } else {
    printf("YES\n");
  }
  
  return false;
}

int main() {
  while (!testcase_ends())
    ;
  
  return 0;
}
```
