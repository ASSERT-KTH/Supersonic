The given code calculates the number of pairs of nodes in a graph that have a distance of `shortest - 1` from the source node `s` and the target node `t`. The code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to calculate the shortest distances from `s` and `t` to all other nodes in the graph. 

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Input/Output:
   - The code uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations. These functions can be slow compared to other input/output methods, such as `cin` and `cout` in C++. Consider switching to faster input/output functions for better performance.

2. Data Structures:
   - The code uses a `vector<vector<int>>` to represent the graph. This data structure has a high memory overhead and can be inefficient for large graphs. Consider using a more memory-efficient data structure, such as an adjacency list or a compressed sparse row (CSR) representation.
   - The code uses a `queue` to store nodes during the BFS. While this is a valid choice, an alternative data structure, such as a `deque`, may offer better performance. It is worth testing different data structures to determine the most efficient option.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The code uses two separate loops to calculate the frequency of distances in `r1` and `r2`. These loops can be combined into a single loop to reduce redundant computations.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - The code can benefit from enabling compiler optimizations. Consider using compiler-specific optimization flags or pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize the code. This can include loop unrolling, function inlining, and other optimizations.

Based on these observations, I will now present an optimized version of the code.
