Code Analysis:

1. The code reads an input graph and calculates the shortest distance between two given nodes `s` and `t`.
2. It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to calculate the shortest distance from `s` to every other node in the graph, and another BFS to calculate the shortest distance from `t` to every other node.
3. It then counts the number of nodes at each distance from `s` and `t` that are less than the shortest distance, and calculates the number of paths that can be formed by combining these nodes.
4. Finally, it prints the total number of paths.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use vectors instead of queues: The code currently uses a queue to implement the BFS algorithm. However, using a vector with two indices (one for the front and one for the back) will be more efficient in terms of memory usage and access time.

2. Use a single BFS loop: Instead of using two separate BFS loops to calculate the shortest distances from `s` and `t`, we can combine them into a single loop. This will reduce the time complexity from O(N) to O(N/2).

3. Use a single vector for distance calculations: Instead of using separate vectors `d1` and `d2` to store the shortest distances, we can reuse a single vector and update it accordingly.

4. Optimize the counting of nodes at each distance: The code currently uses two separate loops to count the number of nodes at each distance from `s` and `t`. We can combine these loops into a single loop to improve efficiency.

5. Use `int` instead of `long long` for counting: The variable `ret` is currently declared as `long long`, but it can be declared as `int` since the maximum value it can hold is within the range of an `int`.
