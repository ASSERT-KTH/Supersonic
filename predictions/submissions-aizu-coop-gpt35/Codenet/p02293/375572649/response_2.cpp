The given code seems to be a program that takes input for a number of test cases and then calculates the intersection of two line segments. The intersection is determined based on the cross product of the two line segments.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which is unnecessary for this code. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using the `complex` data type: The code uses the `complex` data type to represent points in a Cartesian coordinate system. However, this data type is not necessary for this particular problem. We can simply use individual variables to store the coordinates.

3. Optimize input/output operations: The code currently uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output. These functions are relatively slow compared to other input/output methods in C++. We can use the `cin` and `cout` streams instead, which are faster.

4. Optimize the calculation of the cross product: The code calculates the cross product of two line segments using complex numbers. However, this calculation can be simplified to improve performance.
