The given code calculates the cross product between two vectors and determines the type of intersection between two given line segments. The type of intersection is determined based on the value of the cross product. 

Here is the optimization strategy for the given code:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can slow down the compilation process. We can remove it and include only the required headers.

2. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The `scanf` and `printf` functions have a higher overhead compared to `std::cin` and `std::cout`. By using the standard input/output streams, we can improve the performance of the code.

3. Replace the `complex` type with a custom struct: The `complex` type is used to represent 2D points, but it comes with a lot of overhead due to its generality. We can create a custom struct to represent 2D points, which will be more efficient.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code calculates the cross product between two vectors using the `complex` type. However, we can simplify this calculation by directly calculating the cross product using the x and y coordinates of the vectors. This will eliminate the need to create `complex` objects and perform complex number arithmetic.

5. Use integer types instead of floating-point types: The code uses `double` to represent the coordinates of the points. However, since the points are given as inputs, they can be assumed to have integer coordinates. Using integer types instead of floating-point types can improve performance.

6. Use a more efficient approach for determining intersection type: The code currently checks if the imaginary part of the cross product is zero to determine if the line segments are parallel. Instead, we can directly check if the cross product is zero to determine if the line segments are collinear. This will avoid the need to perform complex number comparisons.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Point {
  int x;
  int y;
};

int main() {
  int n;
  int ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;
  std::cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    std::cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by;
    std::cin >> cx >> cy >> dx >> dy;
    
    int k = (bx - ax) * (cy - dy) - (by - ay) * (cx - dx);
    if (k == 0)
      std::cout << "2\n";
    else if ((bx - ax) * (dx - cx) == (by - ay) * (dy - cy))
      std::cout << "1\n";
    else
      std::cout << "0\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

By following the optimization steps, we have reduced unnecessary overhead, eliminated unnecessary calculations, and improved the efficiency of the code.
