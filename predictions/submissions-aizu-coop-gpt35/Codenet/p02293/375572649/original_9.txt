The given code calculates the cross product of two line segments and determines the orientation of the resulting vector. Based on the orientation, it prints either 0, 1, or 2 as the output. 

To optimize this code, we can make the following changes:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers, such as `<cstdio>` for `printf` and `scanf`, and `<complex>` for `complex<double>`.

2. Avoid unnecessary complex number operations: The code currently uses the `complex<double>` type to perform the cross product calculation. However, this is unnecessary since we are only interested in the imaginary part of the result. We can replace the complex number calculations with simple arithmetic operations.

3. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The C++ standard input/output streams (`std::cin` and `std::cout`) are generally faster than their C counterparts (`scanf` and `printf`). By using C++ streams, we can potentially improve the input/output performance.

4. Use a more efficient data structure for storing the input: The code currently stores each input coordinate as a separate double variable. This can be improved by using a data structure such as a `std::vector` or an array to store the coordinates in a more compact and cache-friendly way.

5. Use a loop to process multiple test cases: The code currently uses a `while` loop with a decrementing counter to process multiple test cases. We can replace this with a `for` loop to make the code more readable and concise.

Here is the optimized version of the code with the above optimizations implemented:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::vector<double> input(8);
    for (double& val : input) {
      std::cin >> val;
    }

    double k = (input[2] - input[0]) * (input[7] - input[5]) - (input[3] - input[1]) * (input[6] - input[4]);

    if (k == 0)
      std::cout << "2\n";
    else if (k == 0)
      std::cout << "1\n";
    else
      std::cout << "0\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations improve the efficiency of the code by reducing unnecessary operations and improving memory usage. The code is also more concise and easier to understand.
