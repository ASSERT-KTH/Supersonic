The given code calculates the value of `z * z * z - ans` for each given input `z`. It uses nested loops to iterate over all possible values of `x` and `y`, calculates `x * x * x + y * y * y`, and keeps track of the maximum value in the variable `ans`. Finally, it outputs the result.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Loop bounds: The current loops iterate from `1` to `z`, which is unnecessary. We can optimize the loop bounds to reduce the number of iterations.

2. Redundant calculations: The expression `x * x * x` and `y * y * y` are calculated multiple times in the inner loop. We can store these values in variables to avoid redundant calculations.

3. Data types: The variables `x`, `y`, and `ans` are of type `ll`, which stands for `long long`. We can consider using a smaller data type if the range of values allows it, as smaller data types generally consume less memory and can improve performance.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  int z;  // Change data type to int as the input constraint is not mentioned
  while (cin >> z && z) {
    int ans = 0;  // Change data type to int
    int z_cubed = z * z * z;  // Store z * z * z in a variable for reuse
    int x_cubed_max = cbrt(z_cubed);  // Calculate the maximum value of x in the loop bound
    int y_cubed_max = cbrt(z_cubed - x_cubed_max * x_cubed_max * x_cubed_max);  // Calculate the maximum value of y in the loop bound
    for (int x = 1; x <= x_cubed_max; x++) {
      int x_cubed = x * x * x;  // Store x * x * x in a variable for reuse
      for (int y = 1; y <= y_cubed_max; y++) {
        int y_cubed = y * y * y;  // Store y * y * y in a variable for reuse
        int sum = x_cubed + y_cubed;
        if (sum <= z_cubed) {
          ans = max(ans, sum);
        } else {
          break;  // No need to continue the loop if sum > z_cubed
        }
      }
    }
    cout << z_cubed - ans << endl;
  }
}
```

In the optimized code:

1. We changed the data type of `z` and `ans` to `int` as the input constraint is not mentioned. This reduces the memory usage compared to `long long`.

2. We store the value of `z * z * z` in the variable `z_cubed` for reuse. This avoids redundant calculations and makes the code more efficient.

3. We calculate the maximum values of `x` and `y` using the `cbrt` function, which computes the cube root. This allows us to optimize the loop bounds and reduce the number of iterations.

4. We store the values of `x * x * x` and `y * y * y` in variables `x_cubed` and `y_cubed` respectively. This avoids redundant calculations in the inner loop.

5. We check if the sum `x_cubed + y_cubed` is less than or equal to `z_cubed` before updating the maximum `ans`. This prevents unnecessary calculations and comparisons for values that are already greater than `z_cubed`.

6. We break out of the inner loop if the sum `x_cubed + y_cubed` is greater than `z_cubed` since we know that further values of `y` will also be greater than `z_cubed`. This further optimizes the code by avoiding unnecessary iterations.

By following these optimization steps, we have reduced memory usage and improved the efficiency of the code.
