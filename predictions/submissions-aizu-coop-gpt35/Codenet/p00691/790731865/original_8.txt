The code provided calculates the minimum sum of two cubes whose sum is greater than a given number. It precomputes an array `tb` containing cube values for numbers from 1 to 1111, and then calculates the minimum sum using the `calc` function for each input.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several potential optimizations:

1. Redundant Calculation: The `nr` function is used to find the largest cube value less than or equal to a given number. However, this calculation can be avoided by using a binary search algorithm on the `tb` array. This will reduce the time complexity of the function from O(1112) to O(log N).

2. Loop Optimization: The `calc` function uses a loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to z. However, we can optimize this loop by starting from 1 and incrementing the loop index by the cube root of z instead of 1. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

3. Unnecessary Memory Usage: The `ans` array is preallocated with a size of 1112, but it is only used up to index N. We can reduce the memory usage by allocating the `ans` array dynamically based on the input value N.

4. Compiler Optimization: We can suggest compiler optimizations, such as enabling loop unrolling and enabling compiler optimizations with `-O3` flag, to allow the compiler to optimize the code further.

Now, let's proceed with implementing these optimization steps in the code.
