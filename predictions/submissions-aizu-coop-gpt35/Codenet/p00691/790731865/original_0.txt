This is the given code which calculates the minimum difference between a given number and the sum of two cubes. The code works correctly, but there are several areas where it can be optimized for performance and memory usage. 

Let's start by analyzing the code step by step:

1. The `nr` function finds the largest number in the `tb` array that is less than or equal to the given parameter `a`. This function can be optimized by using binary search instead of linear search. Linear search has a time complexity of O(n), while binary search has a time complexity of O(log n).

2. The `calc` function calculates the minimum difference between `z` and the sum of two cubes. It iterates from 1 to `z`, and for each `i`, it finds the largest number in the `tb` array that is less than `z^3 - i^3`. This can be optimized by using binary search instead of linear search, similar to the `nr` function.

3. The `main` function initializes the `tb` array with cube values, and then calculates and stores the answers in the `ans` array. Finally, it reads input from the user and prints the corresponding answer from the `ans` array. There is no major optimization opportunity in this part.

Now let's formulate the optimization strategy:

1. Optimize the `nr` function by replacing linear search with binary search.
2. Optimize the `calc` function by replacing linear search with binary search.
3. No major optimization opportunity in the `main` function.

Next, we will implement the optimization steps one by one and explain the rationale behind each step.
