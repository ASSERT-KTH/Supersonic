The given code calculates the minimum number of coins required to make a sum of 'n' using a given set of 'm' coins. The code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few areas that can be optimized:

1. Unnecessary inclusion of header files: The code includes `<cstdio>` and `<math.h>` headers, which are not required for the current code. We can remove these unnecessary headers for better compile-time performance.

2. Unnecessary `using namespace std;`: The `using namespace std;` statement is not needed in this code as it only uses a few specific objects from the `std` namespace. We can remove this statement and specify the namespace explicitly for those objects to improve code readability and avoid potential naming conflicts.

3. Redundant sorting: The code sorts the array `c` before using it. However, the sorting is unnecessary since the problem does not require the coins to be in any specific order.

4. Avoiding global constant: The code defines the constant `INF` as a global constant, which is not necessary. We can define it within the `main` function to limit its scope and improve code organization.

5. Removing unnecessary inclusion of `<algorithm>`: The code includes the `<algorithm>` header, but it only uses the `min` function from that header. We can directly include `<iostream>` and use `std::min` instead.

6. Loop optimization: The inner loop in the code performs redundant calculations by iterating from 0 to `n - c[i]`. We can optimize this loop by starting from `c[i]` instead, as the previous values would have already been computed.
