The provided code calculates the minimum number of coins required to make a sum of `n` using `m` different coin denominations. The code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem, but there are several areas where it can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Unnecessary Inclusion of Headers: The code includes unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<cstdio>`, and `<math.h>`. These headers are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Namespace Usage: The code uses the `using namespace std;` directive, which is generally considered bad practice. It is better to explicitly use the `std` namespace when required instead of importing the entire namespace.

3. Magic Numbers: The code uses the magic number `21` for the size of the `c` array and `50001` for the size of the `mini` array. These numbers can be replaced with constants to improve code readability and maintainability.

4. Sorting the Coin Array: The code sorts the `c` array using the `std::sort` function. However, the sorting is unnecessary for solving the problem, as the order of the coins does not affect the result. Removing the sorting step can potentially improve performance.

5. Dynamic Programming Initialization: The code initializes the `mini` array with a large value `INF` for all indices. However, this is not necessary as the dynamic programming algorithm will update the values accordingly. Initializing the array with zeros would be sufficient.

6. Optimization of Inner Loop: The inner loop iterates from `0` to `n - c[i]`. However, this can be optimized to iterate from `c[i]` to `n`. This change eliminates the need for adding `c[i]` in every iteration, resulting in a more efficient loop.

7. Memory Usage Optimization: The `mini` array can be optimized to use a 1-dimensional array instead of a 2-dimensional array. This reduces memory usage and potentially improves cache performance.

8. Compiler Optimizations: Compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and compiler-specific pragmas, can be used to further improve the performance of the code. However, these optimizations are compiler-dependent and may require additional code modifications.
