The provided code is a dynamic programming solution that solves the minimum number of coins problem. It calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make a given sum using a set of coins with different denominations.

Here are some optimizations that can be made to improve the performance and memory usage of the code:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The code includes unnecessary headers like `<cstdio>`, `<iostream>`, and `<math.h>`. Since we are not using any functions or features from these headers, we can remove them.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std`: The `using namespace std` directive is generally considered bad practice because it pollutes the global namespace. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix to explicitly specify the namespace for the standard library functions and types.

3. Replace `cin` and `cout` with faster I/O methods: The `cin` and `cout` objects are associated with the standard input/output streams, which can be slow for large inputs or outputs. Instead, we can use the faster I/O methods provided by `scanf` and `printf`.

4. Use a more efficient data structure for `mini[]`: The array `mini[]` is used to store the minimum number of coins needed to make the sum `i`. Since the maximum value of `n` is 50000, we can use a vector instead of an array to avoid wasting memory.

5. Optimize the inner loop: The inner loop iterates from 0 to `n - c[i]`. However, we can start the loop from `c[i]` instead of 0, as any sum less than `c[i]` is not possible with a single coin of denomination `c[i]`. This optimization will reduce the number of iterations in the loop.

6. Use `memset` instead of a loop to initialize `mini[]`: Instead of using a loop to initialize the `mini[]` array with `INF` values, we can use the `memset` function to set all the elements to `INF` in a more efficient manner.

7. Use `constexpr` for constant values: The constant `INF` is used to represent infinity. We can define it as a `constexpr` value to ensure that it is evaluated at compile-time, which may result in better performance.

With these optimizations in mind, here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdio>

constexpr int INF = 2000000000;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);

  std::vector<int> c(m + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    std::scanf("%d", &c[i]);
  }

  std::sort(c.begin() + 1, c.end());

  std::vector<int> mini(n + 1, INF);
  mini[0] = 0;

  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (int j = c[i]; j <= n; j++) {
      mini[j] = std::min(mini[j], mini[j - c[i]] + 1);
    }
  }

  std::printf("%d\n", mini[n]);
  return 0;
}
```

By following these optimizations, we have reduced unnecessary memory usage, improved I/O performance, and made the code more readable.
