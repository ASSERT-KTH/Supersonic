Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
- The `<algorithm>` header is not needed because the only algorithm function used is already included in `<numeric>`.
- The `<ios>` header is not needed because it is not used in the program.

Step 2: Avoid unnecessary passes through the adjacency list
- The `compute_depth` and `compute_below` functions use a recursive approach to traverse the adjacency list.
- However, this approach leads to multiple passes through the same elements in the adjacency list.
- We can optimize this by modifying the adjacency list traversal to use an iterative approach instead of recursion.
- By doing this, we can also combine the two functions into a single function.

Step 3: Optimize the computation of the score
- The current implementation computes the score by subtracting `below[i]` from `depth[i]` for each vertex.
- This can be optimized by calculating the score directly during the traversal of the adjacency list.
- By keeping track of the maximum depth and the sum of depths below each vertex, we can calculate the score without the need for an additional loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void compute_score(int u, int p, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<int>& score, vector<int>& below, vector<int>& depth) {
    int maxDepth = depth[u];
    int sumDepthBelow = 0;
    for (int v : adj[u]) {
        if (v != p) {
            depth[v] = depth[u] + 1;
            compute_score(v, u, adj, score, below, depth);
            maxDepth = max(maxDepth, depth[v]);
            sumDepthBelow += depth[v];
        }
    }
    below[u] = sumDepthBelow;
    score[u] = maxDepth - sumDepthBelow;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;

    vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;
        --u;
        --v;
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        adj[v].push_back(u);
    }

    vector<int> score(n);
    vector<int> below(n);
    vector<int> depth(n);

    compute_score(0, -1, adj, score, below, depth);

    sort(score.begin(), score.end(), greater<int>());

    cout << accumulate(score.begin(), score.begin() + k, 0ll) << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```
