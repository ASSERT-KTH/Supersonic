Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
In the given program, the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard C++ library headers. Since only a few of these headers are actually used in the program, we can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove the following lines:
```cpp
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
#define fi first
#define se second
#define lll long long
#define llf __float128
#define lld long double
```

Step 3: Optimize the dfs1 function
The dfs1 function is used to calculate the size of each subtree rooted at a node and find the largest subtree size for each node. Currently, it uses recursion to traverse the tree, which can be time-consuming for large trees.

We can optimize this function by using an iterative approach instead of recursion. We can use a stack to store the nodes to be processed and use a while loop to process each node one by one. This will reduce the function call overhead and improve the running time.

Step 4: Optimize the dfs2 function
The dfs2 function is used to calculate the maximum sum of colors in a subtree for each node. Currently, it uses recursion to traverse the tree, which can be time-consuming for large trees.

We can optimize this function by using an iterative approach instead of recursion. We can use a stack to store the nodes to be processed and use a while loop to process each node one by one. This will reduce the function call overhead and improve the running time.

Step 5: Optimize the main function
The main function reads input from the user and calls the dfs1 and dfs2 functions to calculate the answers. Currently, it uses the `map` data structure to store the color counts, which can be memory-consuming for large inputs.

We can optimize this function by using an array instead of a `map` to store the color counts. Since the color values are integers, we can use an array of size `MOD` to store the counts. This will reduce the memory usage and improve the running time.

Based on these optimization steps, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

const long long NR = 5e5 + 10, oo = 1e18 + 10, MOD = 1e9 + 7;

vector<long long> v[NR];
long long n, sz[NR], big[NR], ans[NR], c[NR];

void dfs1(long long nod) {
    vector<long long> stack;
    stack.push_back(nod);
    while (!stack.empty()) {
        long long curr = stack.back();
        stack.pop_back();
        sz[curr] = 1;
        for (auto it : v[curr]) {
            if (sz[it] == 0) {
                stack.push_back(it);
                sz[curr] += sz[it];
                big[curr] = max(big[curr], sz[it]);
            }
        }
    }

    vector<long long> stack;
    map<long long, long long> mapp;
    stack.push_back(nod);
    while (!stack.empty()) {
        long long curr = stack.back();
        stack.pop_back();
        long long nod_boss = -1, l = 0, max_ = 0, sum = 0;

                map<long long, long long> temp;
                while (!stack.empty()) {
                    long long curr2 = stack.back();
                    stack.pop_back();
                    for (auto it2 : v[curr2]) {
                        if (it2 != curr && it2 != curr2) {
                            stack.push_back(it2);
                        }
