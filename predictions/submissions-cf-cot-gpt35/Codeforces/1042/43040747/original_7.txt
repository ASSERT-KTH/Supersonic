To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, which are not needed for this specific program. We can remove these header files to reduce compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove unused typedefs: The program defines `typedef long long ll` and `typedef tree<pair<ll, ll>, null_type, less<pair<ll, ll>>, rb_tree_tag, tree_order_statistics_node_update> pbdsm`, but they are not used in the program. We can remove these typedefs to improve readability and reduce unnecessary code.

3. Remove unnecessary file I/O operations: The program includes code to read input from "input.txt" and write output to "output.txt". However, these operations are not required for this specific program. We can remove these file I/O operations to improve running time.

4. Optimize the calculation of `ans`: The program calculates `ans` by subtracting the order of the key `{v[i] - t, 2e6}` from the size of the tree `A` for each iteration of the loop. However, we can optimize this calculation by storing the order of the key in a variable and updating it for each iteration. This will avoid multiple lookups in the tree and improve running time.

5. Remove unnecessary increment of `k`: The program increments `k` for each insertion into the tree `A`. However, `k` is not used anywhere else in the program. We can remove this increment to reduce unnecessary code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n, t;
    long long ans = 0;
    cin >> n >> t;
    vector<long long> v(n + 1);
    v[0] = 0;
    set<long long> A;
    A.insert(0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        cin >> v[i];
        v[i] += v[i - 1];
        ans += A.size() - distance(A.lower_bound(v[i] - t), A.end());
        A.insert(v[i]);
    }
    cout << ans;

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary header files: The program no longer includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, as they are not required for this specific program.

2. Removed unused typedefs: The program no longer defines `typedef long long ll` and `typedef tree<pair<ll, ll>, null_type, less<pair<ll, ll>>, rb_tree_tag, tree_order_statistics_node_update> pbdsm`, as they are not used in the program.

3. Removed unnecessary file I/O operations: The program no longer includes code to read input from "input.txt" and write output to "output.txt", as they are not required for this specific program.

4. Optimized the calculation of `ans`: Instead of performing multiple lookups in the tree `A` for each iteration of the loop, the program now uses the `lower_bound` function to find the first key greater than or equal to `v[i] - t` and calculates the distance from that iterator to the end of the set. This avoids repeated lookups and improves running time.

5. Removed unnecessary increment of `k`: The program no longer increments `k` for each insertion into the tree `A`, as `k` is not used anywhere else in the program.
