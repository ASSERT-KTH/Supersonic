Optimization Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files

The program includes two header files <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp> and <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp> which are not used in the program. Therefore, we can remove these unnecessary header files.

Optimization Step 2: Avoid unnecessary I/O synchronization

The program includes the line "ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);" which disables the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams. However, this is not necessary in this program since there is no mixed use of C and C++ I/O functions. Therefore, we can remove this line.

Optimization Step 3: Remove unnecessary freopen calls

The program includes the lines "#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE", "freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);" and "freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);". These lines are meant for redirecting standard input and output to files when running the program locally. However, in the context of this optimization problem, we don't need to consider file I/O. Therefore, we can remove these lines.

Optimization Step 4: Use a more efficient data structure

The program uses the std::vector and std::map data structures to store and manipulate the input values. However, we can use the std::unordered_map data structure instead, which has better average case time complexity for insertion and lookup operations.

Optimization Step 5: Avoid unnecessary calculations

The program uses the line "v[i] += v[i - 1];" to calculate the prefix sum of the input values. However, this calculation is not necessary for the given problem. We can directly use the input values without calculating the prefix sum.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll n, t, ans = 0, k = 1;
  cin >> n >> t;
  unordered_map<ll, ll> v;
  v[0] = 0;
  unordered_map<ll, ll> A;
  A[0] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    ll val;
    cin >> val;
    ans += A.size() - A.count(val - t);
    A[val] = k++;
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
