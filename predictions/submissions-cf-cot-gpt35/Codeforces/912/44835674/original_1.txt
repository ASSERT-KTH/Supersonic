The given program calculates the k-th smallest number that can be expressed as the product of two numbers, one from the set A and one from the set B. The program generates all possible numbers from sets A and B, sorts them, and then uses binary search to find the k-th smallest number.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes unnecessary header files such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`. We can remove these includes and only include the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros such as `cn`, `cauto`, `FOR`, etc. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Remove unused typedefs: The program defines several typedefs such as `ll`, `ull`, `uint`, etc. These typedefs are not used in the program and can be removed.

4. Optimize the `prime` function: The `prime` function checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to x-1 and checking if x is divisible by any number. We can optimize this function by checking if x is divisible by any number from 2 to sqrt(x). This reduces the time complexity of the function from O(x) to O(sqrt(x)).

5. Optimize the `gen_all` function: The `gen_all` function generates all possible numbers from a given set of numbers. This function currently uses recursion to generate all combinations of numbers. We can optimize this function by using a non-recursive approach such as iteration or backtracking.

6. Optimize the `cnt` function: The `cnt` function calculates the number of pairs (a, b) where a is from set A, b is from set B, and a*b is less than or equal to a given value val. This function currently uses binary search to find the upper bound of val/e in set B. We can optimize this function by using a two-pointer approach to find the upper bound of val/e in set B. This reduces the time complexity of the function from O(log(N)) to O(N), where N is the size of set B.

7. Remove unnecessary sorting: The program sorts sets A and B before performing the binary search. Since the sets are generated in sorted order, we can remove the sorting step.

8. Optimize the binary search: The binary search in the program currently uses a while loop to find the k-th smallest number. We can optimize this binary search by using a more efficient algorithm such as interpolation search or exponential search.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cassert>

using namespace std;

bool prime(int x) {
  if (x < 2) {
    return false;
  }
  for (int d = 2; d * d <= x; ++d) {
    if (x % d == 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

void gen_all(const vector<int>& src, vector<long long>& dest) {
  int n = src.size();
  dest.push_back(1);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int m = dest.size();
    for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
      long long cur = dest[j];
      while (cur != -1) {
        dest.push_back(cur);
        cur *= src[i];
      }
    }
  }
}

long long cnt(const vector<long long>& A, const vector<long long>& B, long long val) {
  int n = B.size();
  int i = 0, j = n - 1;
  long long res = 0;
  while (i < n && j >= 0) {
    if (A[i] * B[j] <= val) {
      res += j + 1;
      ++i;
    } else {
      --j;
    }
  }
  return res;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> p(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> p[i];
  }

  const int B_sz = 9;
  vector<int> pA(p.begin() + B_sz, p.end());
  vector<long long> A, B;
  gen_all(pA, A);
  gen_all(vector<int>(p.begin(), p.begin() + min(B_sz, n)), B);

  int k;
  cin >> k;
  long long l = 0, r = 1e18;
  while (l + 1 != r) {
    long long m = (l + r) / 2;
    if (cnt(A, B, m) >= k) {
      r = m;
    } else {
      l = m;
    }
  }
  cout << r << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
