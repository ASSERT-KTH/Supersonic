Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can increase compile time and memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unused macros and constants

The program defines several macros and constants that are not used. These can be removed to simplify the code.

Step 3: Optimize the sorting

The program sorts a vector of pairs using the `sort` function. By default, this uses the `operator<` for the pairs, which compares the first element and then the second element. However, the program only needs to sort based on the first element. We can optimize the sorting by using a custom comparator that compares only the first element of the pairs.

Step 4: Optimize memory usage

The program uses a vector of vectors to store the indices of the elements in groups. This can be optimized to use a single vector instead, by storing the group number directly in the `res` vector.

Step 5: Optimize counting the number of non-zero elements

The program uses a loop to count the number of non-zero elements in the `res` vector. This can be optimized by using the `count` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` header.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  int n, k;
  n = s.size(), k = 2;
  vector<pair<char, int>> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    a[i].second = i;
    a[i].first = s[i];
  }
  sort(a.begin(), a.end(), [](const auto& x, const auto& y){
    return x.first < y.first;
  });

  vector<int> res(n, 0);
  vector<int> g(k + 1, 0);
  for (int i = 0, p = 0; i < n; ++i, ++p) {
    int pos = p % k + 1;
    if (g[pos] == 0)
      g[pos] = a[i].second;
    else if (a[i - k].first != a[i].first)
      g[pos] = a[i].second;
    else
      --p;
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
    for (int j = g[i]; j < n; j += k) {
      res[j] = i;
    }
  }
  int ans = count(res.begin(), res.end(), 0);
  cout << ans / 2 << '\n';
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
}
```
