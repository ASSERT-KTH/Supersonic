To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a lot of standard library headers. However, not all of these headers are needed for this program. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: Using the `using namespace std;` directive introduces all the names in the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts. It is better to use the `std::` prefix when using names from the `std` namespace.

3. Remove unused macros: The `init()` and `db_problem()` macros are defined but not used in the program. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

4. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The `ll`, `vt`, and `us` typedefs are defined but not used in the program. We can remove these typedefs.

5. Use `reserve()` instead of `resize()`: In the `vt<int> res(n, 0);` line, the `resize()` function is used to initialize the `res` vector with `n` elements, all set to 0. However, since the size of the vector is known in advance, we can use the `reserve()` function instead to allocate memory for `n` elements without initializing them.

6. Avoid unnecessary copying: In the `for (auto x : res)` loop, the `res` vector is copied element by element. However, we only need to count the number of non-zero elements in the vector, so we can use a reference to avoid unnecessary copying.

7. Use prefix increment and decrement operators: In the `for (int i = 0; i < n; a[i].se = i, a[i].fi = s[i], ++i)` loop, the postfix increment operator is used. However, the prefix increment operator is more efficient as it avoids creating a temporary copy of the object.

8. Use `emplace_back()` instead of `push_back()`: In the `g[pos].pb(a[i].se);` lines, the `push_back()` function is used to add elements to the `g` vector. However, since we know the size of the vector in advance, we can use the `emplace_back()` function to construct the elements in-place without unnecessary copying.

9. Avoid unnecessary calculations: In the `for (int i = 0, p = 0; i < n; ++i, ++p)` loop, the `p` variable is incremented in each iteration, but it is only used to calculate the `pos` variable. We can directly calculate the `pos` variable without using `p`.

10. Optimize the counting loop: In the `for (int j = 0; j < mn; ++j)` loop, the `mn` variable is used as the loop condition. However, since `mn` is not modified inside the loop, we can calculate it once before the loop and store it in a local variable.

11. Use `size_t` for loop counters: In the `for` loops, the loop counters `i` and `j` are of type `int`. However, since they are used for indexing vectors, it is better to use the `size_t` type, which is guaranteed to be able to hold the size of any vector.

12. Avoid unnecessary division: In the `cout << ans / 2 << '\n';` line, the `ans` variable is divided by 2. However, since `ans` is an integer, the division is already integer division, so the `/ 2` operation is unnecessary.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

void solve() {
    std::string s;
    std::cin >> s;
    int n = s.size();
    int k = 2;

    std::vector<std::pair<char, int>> a(n);
    for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        a[i].second = i;
        a[i].first = s[i];
    }
    std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());

    std::vector<int> res;
    res.reserve(n);

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> g(k + 1);
    for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int pos = i % k + 1;
        if (g[pos].empty()) {
            g[pos].emplace_back(a[i].second);
        } else if (a[i - k].first != a[i].first) {
            g[pos].emplace_back(a[i].second);
        }
    }

    size_t mn = g[k].size();
    for (size_t i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
        for (size_t j = 0; j < mn; ++j) {
            res[g[i][j]] = i;
        }
    }

    int ans = 0;
    for (int x : res) {
        ans += (x != 0);
    }
    std::cout << ans << '\n';
}

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(nullptr);
    std::cout.tie(nullptr);

    int t;
    std::cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we can improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
