The given program is a C++ program that reads a string and performs some operations on it. However, there are several areas where the program can be optimized:

1. Unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is a non-standard and implementation-specific header file. It includes many other standard headers, which can slow down the compilation process. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Frequent I/O sync: The program sets the `sync_with_stdio` flag to false and ties the I/O streams to improve performance. However, in this program, there are no interleaved input and output operations, so these settings can be removed.

3. Unnecessary vector initialization: The program initializes the `a` vector with default values of `(0, 0)`. This is unnecessary because the vector will be populated with values in the next loop. We can simply declare the vector without initializing it.

4. Unnecessary vector of vectors: The program uses a 2D vector `g` to store indices of elements. However, since the outer dimension of `g` is fixed at `k + 1`, we can use a 1D vector instead. This will save memory and improve cache efficiency.

5. Counting non-zero elements: The program counts the number of non-zero elements in `res` by iterating over the vector and incrementing a counter. This can be optimized by using the `count` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` header.

6. Unnecessary exit call: The program calls `exit(0)` at the end of `main()`. This is unnecessary because the program will exit automatically when `main()` returns.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

void solve() {
  std::string s;
  std::cin >> s;
  int n = s.size(), k = 2;
  std::vector<std::pair<char, int>> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    a[i].second = i;
    a[i].first = s[i];
  }
  std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  std::vector<int> res(n, 0);
  std::vector<int> g(k + 1);
  for (int i = 0, p = 0; i < n; ++i, ++p) {
    int pos = p % k + 1;
    if (g[pos] == 0)
      g[pos] = a[i].second;
    else if (a[i - k].first != a[i].first)
      g[pos] = a[i].second;
    else
      --p;
  }
  int mn = g[k];
  for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < mn; ++j)
      res[g[i] + j * k] = i;
  }
  int ans = std::count_if(res.begin(), res.end(), [](int x) { return x != 0; });
  std::cout << ans / 2 << '\n';
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
}
```

This optimized program makes the following modifications:

1. Removed unnecessary includes.
2. Removed unnecessary I/O synchronization settings.
3. Removed unnecessary vector initialization.
4. Replaced the vector of vectors with a single vector.
5. Replaced the loop for counting non-zero elements with the `std::count_if` algorithm.
6. Removed the unnecessary `exit(0)` call.
