To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not a standard header file and includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary standard headers.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unused typedefs: The program typedefs `ll`, `vt`, and `us` which are not used. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code.

4. Remove unnecessary I/O redirection: The program uses the `init()` macro to redirect input and output to files. Since the program reads input from `stdin` and writes output to `stdout`, we can remove this macro.

5. Remove unnecessary I/O synchronization: The program uses the `fastio()` macro to disable synchronization between C and C++ standard IO streams. Since the program only uses C++ IO streams, we can remove this macro.

6. Simplify the input/output operators: The input/output operators for `pair` and `vector` are defined using templates, but they are not necessary for this program. We can simplify the input/output operators for `vector` to use the standard `<<` and `>>` operators.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

void solve() {
  std::string s;
  std::cin >> s;
  int n = s.size(), k = 2;
  std::vector<std::pair<char, int>> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    a[i].second = i;
    a[i].first = s[i];
  }
  std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  std::vector<int> res(n, 0);
  std::vector<std::vector<int>> g(k + 1);
  for (int i = 0, p = 0; i < n; ++i, ++p) {
    int pos = p % k + 1;
    if (g[pos].empty())
      g[pos].push_back(a[i].second);
    else if (a[i - k].first != a[i].first)
      g[pos].push_back(a[i].second);
    else
      --p;
  }
  int mn = g[k].size();
  for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < mn; ++j)
      res[g[i][j]] = i;
  }
  int ans = 0;
  for (auto x : res)
    ans += (x != 0);
  std::cout << ans / 2 << '\n';
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations simplify the code and remove unnecessary parts, making it more efficient in terms of both running time and memory usage.
