The given program has the following steps:

1. It reads an integer `n` from the input.
2. It reads `n` integers and stores them in the array `p`.
3. It reads `n` integers and stores them in the array `a`.
4. It initializes a binary search tree with nodes representing ranges of indices from 0 to `n`.
5. It builds the binary search tree by recursively splitting the range into two halves until each node represents a single index. The value of each node is the sum of the elements in the corresponding range of `a`.
6. It initializes a variable `ans` with the minimum of the first and last elements of `a`.
7. It initializes a variable `mus` as 0.
8. It iterates over each element in `p` and performs the following steps:
   - It updates the binary search tree by subtracting 2 times the value of the corresponding element in `a` from each node starting from the corresponding index to the end.
   - It adds the value of the corresponding element in `a` to `mus`.
   - It calculates the minimum value in the binary search tree.
   - It calculates the current sum as the minimum value plus `mus`.
   - It updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and the current sum.
9. It prints the value of `ans` to the output.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<iostream>`, `<set>`, `<string>`, `<vector>` which are not used. We can remove them.
2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program typedefs `ll` as `long long` and `ld` as `long double`, but they are not used. We can remove them.
3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros `pll` and `pb` but they are not used. We can remove them.
4. Remove unused variables and constants: The program defines constants `maxn`, `inf`, and `mod` but they are not used. We can remove them. The variable `n` is also not used after reading from the input. We can remove it.
5. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The program uses a binary search tree to store the cumulative sums of `a`, but we can avoid this by calculating the cumulative sums on the fly during the iteration over `p`.
6. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The program calls the `push` function multiple times unnecessarily. We can remove these calls to improve performance.
7. Use a more efficient way to calculate the minimum value: The program uses a recursive function `get_min` to calculate the minimum value in the binary search tree. We can optimize this by calculating the minimum value during the iteration over `p` instead of using a binary search tree.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<int> p(n), a(n), pref(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> p[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    if (i == 0) {
      pref[i] = a[i];
    } else {
      pref[i] = pref[i - 1] + a[i];
    }
  }

  int ans = min(a[0], a[n - 1]);
  int mus = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    mus += a[p[i] - 1];
    int cur = pref[n - 1] - pref[p[i] - 1] + mus;
    ans = min(ans, cur);
  }

  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Unnecessary header files are removed.
2. Unnecessary typedefs are removed.
3. Unnecessary macros are removed.
4. Unused variables and constants are removed.
5. The binary search tree is replaced with a simpler approach to calculate the cumulative sums on the fly during the iteration over `p`.
6. Unnecessary calls to the `push` function are removed.
7. The minimum value is calculated during the iteration over `p` by subtracting the cumulative sum from the total sum. This avoids the need for a binary search tree and the recursive `get_min` function.
