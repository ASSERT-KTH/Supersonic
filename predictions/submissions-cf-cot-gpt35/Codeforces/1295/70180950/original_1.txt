The given program is solving a problem that involves manipulating a binary tree-like data structure. The main function `solve()` builds the tree, calculates the minimum value in the tree, and outputs the result.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files (`<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<set>`, `<string>`, `<vector>`) that are not used. We can remove them to reduce unnecessary compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines `typedef` for `ll`, `ld`, and `pll`, which are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

3. Remove unnecessary global variables: The program declares global variables `a`, `ps`, `p`, and `pref`, which are only used within the `solve()` function. We can move these variable declarations inside the `solve()` function to reduce the scope and memory usage.

4. Optimize the `build()` function: The `build()` function builds the binary tree by recursively creating nodes. However, it can be optimized by using a loop instead of recursion. This will reduce the function call overhead and improve performance.

5. Optimize the `add_val()` and `get_min()` functions: The `add_val()` and `get_min()` functions are recursively called to update and query the binary tree. However, these functions can be optimized by using a loop instead of recursion. This will reduce the function call overhead and improve performance.

6. Remove unnecessary `push()` calls: The `push()` function is called before each recursive call in `add_val()` and `get_min()`. However, these calls are not necessary since we can ensure that the nodes are pushed before entering the loop in the optimized versions of these functions.

7. Optimize the `solve()` function: The `solve()` function can be optimized by removing unnecessary calculations and loop iterations. We can calculate `ans` and `mus` values inside the loop that builds the tree, eliminating the need for a separate loop to calculate them.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

2. Removed unnecessary typedefs to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.
3. Moved global variable declarations inside the `solve()` function to reduce the scope and memory usage.
4. Optimized the `build()` function by using a loop instead of recursion, reducing the function call overhead.
5. Optimized the `add_val()` and `get_min()` functions by using a loop instead of recursion, reducing the function call overhead. Also removed unnecessary `push()` calls.
6. Optimized the `solve()` function by removing unnecessary calculations and loop iterations. Calculated `ans` and `mus` values inside the loop that builds the tree, eliminating the need for a separate loop to calculate them.
