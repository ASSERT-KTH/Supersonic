To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes a large number of standard library header files. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines `typedef` for `ll`, `ull`, and `ld` types, but these types are not used in the program. We can remove these typedefs.

3. Remove unused macros: The program defines macros for `fast`, `INF`, `pb`, `pob`, `ff`, `ss`, `PI`, `setbits`, `sz`, and `all`. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

4. Remove debug print statements: The program includes debug print statements using the `bug` macro, which prints the variable values to `cerr`. Since these print statements are not necessary for the program's functionality, we can remove them.

5. Optimize the `g` function: The `g` function calculates the number of digits in a number. It uses a while loop and divides the number by 10 in each iteration until the number becomes 0. This can be optimized by converting the number to a string and calculating the length of the string.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int g(int n) {
  return to_string(n).length();
}

void solve() {
  int a, b, c;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  int x = 1;
  while (g(x) != c) {
    x *= 2;
  }
  int ans1, ans2;
  int i = x;
  int j = x;
  while (g(i) != a) {
    i *= 2;
  }
  ans1 = i;
  while (g(j) != b) {
    j *= 5;
  }
  ans2 = j;
  cout << ans1 << " " << ans2 << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary code and optimizes the `g` function, resulting in improved performance and reduced memory usage.
