Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and typedefs

The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

The typedefs `ll`, `ull`, and `ld` are not used in the program. We can remove them.

Step 2: Remove unused macros and functions

The macros `INF`, `PI`, `pb`, `pob`, `ff`, `ss`, and `setbits` are not used in the program. We can remove them.

The functions `_print`, `bug`, and all the overloadings of `_print` are not used in the program. We can remove them.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary loops

The while loop inside the `g` function is not necessary. It can be replaced with a simple mathematical expression.

The while loop inside the `solve` function can be optimized by using a single loop instead of two separate loops.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary variables

The variables `ans1` and `ans2` are not necessary. We can directly print `i` and `j` instead.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives

The `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` and `#endif` directives are not used in the program. We can remove them.

Step 6: Optimize I/O operations

The program uses the `cin` and `cout` objects for I/O operations. These objects are slower than the standard C I/O functions `scanf` and `printf`. We can replace `cin` with `scanf` and `cout` with `printf` to improve the performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int g(int n) {
    return (n == 0) ? 1 : 1 + g(n / 10);
}

void solve() {
    int a, b, c;
    scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
    int x = 1;
    while (g(x) != c) {
        x *= 2;
    }
    int i = x;
    int j = x;
    while (g(i) != a) {
        i *= 2;
    }
    while (g(j) != b) {
        j *= 5;
    }
    printf("%d %d\n", i, j);
}

int main() {
    int t;
    scanf("%d", &t);
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```
