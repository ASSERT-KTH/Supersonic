Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and using statements.

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not standard and may include unnecessary libraries. We should remove this line and only include the necessary headers.

Similarly, the `using namespace std;` statement is considered bad practice and can lead to naming conflicts. We should remove this statement and use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and objects.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary typedefs.

The program defines `typedef` aliases for `long long`, `unsigned long long`, and `long double`. These aliases are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary macros.

The program defines macros for various constants like `INF` and `PI`, but these constants are not used in the program. We should remove these macros.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary debugging code.

The program includes a lot of debugging code that prints the values of variables. These debugging statements are not required for the optimization of the program and can be removed.

Step 5: Optimize the `g` function.

The `g` function counts the number of digits in a given number `n`. It achieves this by repeatedly dividing `n` by 10 until `n` becomes zero. However, this approach is not efficient and can be optimized by using logarithmic functions.

The number of digits in a number `n` can be calculated as `floor(log10(n)) + 1`. We can modify the `g` function to use this formula instead of the loop.

Step 6: Optimize the main `solve` function.

The `solve` function calculates two integers `ans1` and `ans2` based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The calculation of `ans1` and `ans2` can be optimized by using a binary search approach instead of the current linear search approach.

Instead of starting from `x` and multiplying it by 2 or 5 until the desired number of digits is reached, we can use binary search to find the smallest number with the desired number of digits.

The binary search approach involves setting the lower bound (`low`) to 1 and the upper bound (`high`) to `x`, and repeatedly calculating the middle value (`mid`) as the average of `low` and `high`. We check the number of digits in `mid` using the `g` function and adjust `low` or `high` accordingly. We continue this process until `low` becomes greater than or equal to `high`, at which point we have found the desired number.

Step 7: Final optimized program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int g(int n) {
  return std::floor(std::log10(n)) + 1;
}

void solve() {
  int a, b, c;
  std::cin >> a >> b >> c;
  
  int x = std::pow(10, c - 1);

  int ans1, ans2;

  int low = 1;
  int high = x;

  while (low < high) {
    int mid = (low + high) / 2;
    if (g(mid) < a) {
      low = mid + 1;
    } else {
      high = mid;
    }
  }
  ans1 = low;

  low = 1;
  high = x;

  while (low < high) {
    int mid = (low + high) / 2;
    if (g(mid) < b) {
      low = mid + 1;
    } else {
      high = mid;
    }
  }
  ans2 = low;

  std::cout << ans1 << " " << ans2 << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

Step 1: Removed unnecessary includes and using statements to reduce unnecessary code and potential naming conflicts.

Step 2: Removed unnecessary typedefs to simplify the code.

Step 3: Removed unnecessary macros that were not used in the program.

Step 4: Removed unnecessary debugging code to reduce code size and improve readability.

Step 5: Optimized the `g` function by using logarithmic functions to calculate the number of digits in a number.

Step 6: Optimized the main `solve` function by using a binary search approach to find the smallest number with the desired number of digits.

Step 7: Final optimized program with all the above optimizations applied.
