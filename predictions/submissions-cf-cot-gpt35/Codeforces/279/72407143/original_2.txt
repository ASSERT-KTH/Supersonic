To optimize the given program, I would suggest the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several header files that are not used. Removing these unnecessary includes will improve compile time.
2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. Removing these unnecessary macros will improve readability and reduce any potential errors.
3. Optimize the loops: The program uses nested loops to iterate over the array `a[]` and calculate the values of `si[]` and `sd[]`. However, this can be optimized by using a single loop and calculating the values in a single pass.
4. Optimize the string comparisons: The program compares strings `s1` and `s2` multiple times in the loop. This can be optimized by using a single string comparison outside the loop and storing the result in a variable.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  vector<int> a(n + 1), si(n + 1), sd(n + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    si[i] = sd[i] = 1;
  }
  
  for (int j = n - 1; j >= 1; j--) {
    if (a[j + 1] >= a[j])
      si[j] += si[j + 1];
    if (a[j] >= a[j + 1])
      sd[j] += sd[j + 1];
  }
  
  string result;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int l, r;
    cin >> l >> r;
    if (r - l <= 1)
      result = "Yes";
    else {
      int x = l + si[l] - 1;
      x += sd[x] - l;
      result = (x >= r - l + 1) ? "Yes" : "No";
    }
    cout << result << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary header files: The unnecessary header files were removed from the program to improve compile time.

2. Removed unnecessary macros: The unnecessary macros were removed from the program to improve readability and reduce any potential errors.

3. Optimized the loops: The nested loops for calculating `si[]` and `sd[]` were replaced with a single loop. This reduces the number of iterations and improves performance.

4. Optimized the string comparisons: The string comparisons `s1` and `s2` were replaced with a single string variable `result`. This reduces the number of string comparisons and improves performance.
