Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files

- The program includes several header files that are not used in the code. We can remove them to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unused macros

- The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove them to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

Step 3: Optimize the loop conditions

- The program uses a nested loop to iterate over the range [1, n] and [n-1, 1]. We can optimize the loop conditions to reduce the number of iterations.

Step 4: Optimize the loop variables

- The program uses the loop variables i and j in multiple loops. We can rename them to improve code readability.

Step 5: Optimize the if conditions

- The program uses if conditions to check the values of a[j+1] and a[j]. We can optimize these conditions to reduce the number of comparisons.

Step 6: Optimize the string comparisons

- The program compares two strings using the equality operator. We can optimize these comparisons to improve code performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  vector<int> a(n + 1), si(n + 1), sd(n + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    si[i] = sd[i] = 1;
  }
  
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
    if (a[i + 1] >= a[i])
      si[i] += si[i + 1];
    if (a[i] >= a[i + 1])
      sd[i] += sd[i + 1];
  }
  
  const string s1 = "Yes", s2 = "No";
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int l, r;
    cin >> l >> r;
    if (r - l <= 1)
      cout << s1 << endl;
    else {
      int x = l + si[l] - 1;
      x += sd[x] - l;
      if (x >= r - l + 1)
        cout << s1 << endl;
      else
        cout << s2 << endl;
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of Optimizations:
- Removed unnecessary header files to reduce memory usage.
- Removed unused macros to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.
- Optimized the loop conditions by using a single loop variable instead of nested loops.
- Optimized the if conditions to reduce the number of comparisons.
- Optimized the string comparisons by declaring the strings as constants outside the loop.
