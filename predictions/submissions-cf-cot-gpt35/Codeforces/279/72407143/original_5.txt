The given program is a code that checks if a given sequence of numbers is a zigzag sequence or not. It takes as input the length of the sequence and the sequence itself, and then for each query, it checks if a given subsequence of the sequence is a zigzag sequence or not.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files that are not used. We can remove them to improve the compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

3. Remove unnecessary variables: The program defines several variables that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

4. Change the data type of variables: The program uses the "int" data type for array indices and loop variables. Since the maximum length of the sequence is given by the variable "n" (which is of type "int"), we can change the data type of array indices and loop variables to "int" to avoid potential overflow issues.

5. Optimize the zigzag sequence check: The program checks if a given subsequence is a zigzag sequence by iterating over the subsequence and comparing adjacent elements. This can be optimized by checking if the first and last elements of the subsequence are different. If they are different, then the subsequence is a zigzag sequence. Otherwise, it is not a zigzag sequence. This optimization eliminates the need for the "si" and "sd" arrays and reduces the running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;

  int *a = new int[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }

  string s1 = "Yes", s2 = "No";
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int l, r;
    cin >> l >> r;
    if (r - l <= 1) {
      cout << s1 << endl;
    } else {
      if (a[l - 1] != a[r - 1]) {
        cout << s1 << endl;
      } else {
        cout << s2 << endl;
      }
    }
  }

  delete[] a;

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary header files.
2. Removed unnecessary macros.
3. Removed unnecessary variables.
4. Changed the data type of variables to "int".
5. Optimized the zigzag sequence check by comparing the first and last elements of the subsequence.
