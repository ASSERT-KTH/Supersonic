This C++ program calculates the maximum length of a contiguous subarray of an array such that the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to a given value `t`. 

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes all the standard library headers. Since only a few headers are used in this program, we can remove the unnecessary ones.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program includes typedefs for various types which are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros which are not used. We can remove them.

4. Replace raw arrays with vectors: The program uses raw arrays to store the input array and the prefix sum array. We can replace these raw arrays with vectors to simplify the code and avoid potential memory issues.

5. Remove unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) and least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers, but these calculations are not used. We can remove these functions.

6. Optimize the loop to find the maximum length: The program uses a loop to find the maximum length of the subarray. We can optimize this loop to reduce the number of iterations.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);

  int n, t;
  cin >> n >> t;

  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }

  vector<int> b(n + 1, 0);
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum += a[i];
    b[i + 1] = sum;
  }

  int maxlen = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    int to = b[i - 1] + t;
    auto it = upper_bound(b.begin(), b.end(), to);
    int len = (it - b.begin()) - i;
    maxlen = max(maxlen, len);
  }

  cout << maxlen << " ";

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary code and simplifies the data structures used. It also optimizes the loop to find the maximum length of the subarray. Overall, these modifications improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
