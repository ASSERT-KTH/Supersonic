To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes a large number of unnecessary header files. We can remove this line and only include the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs that are not used. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code.

3. Remove unused functions: The program defines several helper functions (`gcd`, `lcm`, `pow`, `modexp`, `popcount`) that are not used. We can remove these functions to reduce memory usage.

4. Use `reserve` instead of dynamic allocation: Instead of dynamically allocating memory for the array `a`, we can use `reserve` to reserve memory for `n` elements in advance. This can improve memory usage and reduce the number of reallocations.

5. Use `vector<int>` instead of array `b`: Instead of using a fixed-size array `b`, we can use a `vector<int>` to dynamically store the prefix sums. This can simplify the code and avoid potential buffer overflow.

6. Use iterators instead of array indices: Instead of using array indices to access elements of `b`, we can use iterators. This can improve code readability and avoid potential off-by-one errors.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int n, t;
    cin >> n >> t;

    vector<int> a;
    a.reserve(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        a.push_back(x);
    }

    vector<int> b(n + 1, 0);
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum += a[i];
        b[i + 1] = sum;
    }

    int maxlen = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int to = b[i - 1] + t;
        auto it = upper_bound(b.begin(), b.end(), to);
        int len = distance(b.begin() + i, it);
        maxlen = max(maxlen, len);
    }

    cout << maxlen << " ";

    return 0;
}
```
