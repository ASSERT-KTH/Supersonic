The given program calculates the maximum length of a subarray whose sum is less than or equal to a given threshold. The program uses a prefix sum array to calculate the sum of each subarray quickly.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove it.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program includes several typedefs for common types. However, these typedefs are not used in the program. We can remove them.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program includes several macros that are not used. We can remove them.

4. Optimize the `gcd` function: The `gcd` function uses recursion to calculate the greatest common divisor. This can be optimized by using a loop instead of recursion.

5. Optimize the `lcm` function: The `lcm` function uses the `gcd` function to calculate the least common multiple. We can optimize this function by using a direct formula to calculate the lcm.

6. Optimize the `pow` function: The `pow` function uses a loop to calculate the power of a number. We can optimize this function by using the `std::pow` function from the `<cmath>` library.

7. Optimize the `modexp` function: The `modexp` function calculates the modular exponentiation of a number. We can optimize this function by using the `std::pow` function from the `<cmath>` library.

8. Optimize the `popcount` function: The `popcount` function calculates the number of set bits in a number. We can optimize this function by using the `std::bitset` class from the `<bitset>` library.

9. Use `std::vector` instead of fixed-size arrays: The program uses fixed-size arrays for `a` and `b`. We can use `std::vector` instead, which allows for dynamic resizing and easier manipulation.

10. Use iterators instead of indexing: The program uses indexing to access elements of `b`. We can use iterators instead, which can improve performance.

11. Use a single loop instead of two loops: The program uses two loops to calculate the maximum length of the subarray. We can use a single loop to avoid redundant calculations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);

  int n, t;
  std::cin >> n >> t;

  std::vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }

  std::vector<int> b(n + 1, 0);
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum += a[i];
    b[i + 1] = sum;
  }

  int maxlen = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    int to = b[i - 1] + t;
    auto it = std::upper_bound(b.begin(), b.end(), to);
    int len = std::distance(b.begin() + i, it);
    maxlen = std::max(maxlen, len);
  }

  std::cout << maxlen << " ";

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program achieves the same result as the original program but with improved running time and memory usage.
