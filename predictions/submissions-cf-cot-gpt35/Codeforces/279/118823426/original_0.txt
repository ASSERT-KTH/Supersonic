To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes all standard library header files. However, this can lead to increased compile times and unnecessary inclusion of unused headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program includes typedefs for various types such as `VI`, `VLL`, `PII`, `PLL`, and `db`. However, these typedefs are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Remove unnecessary defines: The program includes defines for `MOD`, `pb`, `mp`, `DOTEST`, and `TEST`. However, these defines are not used in the program and can be removed.

4. Remove unnecessary functions: The program includes functions such as `gcd`, `lcm`, `pow`, `modexp`, and `popcount`. However, these functions are not used in the program and can be removed.

5. Optimize the loop to calculate `b[]`: The program uses a loop to calculate the cumulative sum array `b[]`. However, we can optimize this loop by using a prefix sum approach. Instead of iterating over the array `a[]` and calculating the sum at each index, we can directly calculate the sum by adding the current element to the previous sum. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).

6. Optimize the loop to find `maxlen`: The program uses a loop to find the maximum length `maxlen`. However, we can optimize this loop by using a binary search approach. Instead of iterating over the array `b[]` to find the upper bound, we can use the `upper_bound` function to find the iterator pointing to the first element greater than `to`. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    
    int n, t;
    cin >> n >> t;
    
    int a[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    
    int b[n + 1] = {0};
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum += a[i];
        b[i + 1] = sum;
    }
    
    int maxlen = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int to = b[i - 1] + t;
        auto it = upper_bound(b, b + n + 1, to);
        int len = (it - b) - i;
        maxlen = max(maxlen, len);
    }
    
    cout << maxlen << " ";
    
    return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have improved the running time and reduced the memory usage of the program.
