Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files and typedefs.

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a large number of standard C++ headers. This can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary headers. Additionally, the program defines several typedefs that are not used. Let's remove them.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros.

The program defines several macros, such as `fastIO()`, `MOD`, `DOTEST`, and `TEST`, which are not used. We can remove them.

Step 3: Optimize the `gcd` function.

The `gcd` function can be optimized by using the Euclidean algorithm. The current implementation uses recursion, which can be slower and uses more memory. Let's rewrite the `gcd` function using the iterative version of the Euclidean algorithm.

Step 4: Optimize the `lcm` function.

The `lcm` function can be optimized by using the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)`. The current implementation calculates the gcd and then divides the product of `a` and `b` by the gcd. We can simplify this by directly calculating the product of `a` and `b` and dividing it by the gcd.

Step 5: Optimize the `pow` function.

The `pow` function can be optimized by using exponentiation by squaring. The current implementation uses a simple loop to multiply `n` by itself `k` times. We can improve this by using a binary exponentiation algorithm.

Step 6: Optimize the `modexp` function.

The `modexp` function can be optimized by using exponentiation by squaring and taking the modulus at each step. The current implementation calculates the exponentiation and then takes the modulus at the end. We can simplify this by taking the modulus at each step of the exponentiation.

Step 7: Optimize the `popcount` function.

The `popcount` function can be optimized by using the built-in `__builtin_popcount` function, which calculates the number of set bits in a number using hardware instructions. This can be faster than the current implementation.

Step 8: Optimize the main function.

The main function can be optimized by removing the unnecessary curly braces and using a more efficient data structure for the `b` array. The current implementation uses a regular array, but we can use a vector instead, which can dynamically resize as needed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}

int lcm(int a, int b) {
    return (a * b) / gcd(a, b);
}

int pow(int n, int k) {
    if (k < 0)
        return 0;
    int ret = 1;
    int now = n;
    while (k > 0) {
        if (k & 1)
            ret *= now;
        now *= now;
        k /= 2;
    }
    return ret;
}

int modexp(int n, int k, int md) {
    int ret = 1;
    int now = n % md;
    while (k > 0) {
        if (k % 2 == 1) {
            ret *= now;
            ret %= md;
        }
        now *= now;
        now %= md;
        k /= 2;
    }
    return ret;
}

int popcount(int n) {
    return __builtin_popcount(n);
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int n, t;
    cin >> n >> t;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> a[i];
    vector<int> b(n + 1, 0);
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum += a[i];
        b[i + 1] = sum;
    }
    int maxlen = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int to = b[i - 1] + t;
        auto it = upper_bound(b.begin(), b.end(), to);
        int len = (it - b.begin()) - i;
        maxlen = max(maxlen, len);
    }
    cout << maxlen << " ";

    return 0;
}
```
