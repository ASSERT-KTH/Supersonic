Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes many unnecessary headers. We can remove the following headers as they are not used in the program:

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <bitset>
#include <cctype>
#include <climits>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <map>
#include <numeric>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <stack>
#include <stdlib.h>
```

Step 2: Remove unused macros

The program defines some macros that are not used. We can remove the following macros:

```
#define double long double
#define ll int
#define ibs ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)
#define cti cin.tie(0)
#define bp __builtin_popcount
#define koto_memory(a) cout << (sizeof(a) / 1048576.0) << " MB";
#define timer                                                                  \
  cerr << "Time elapsed : " << 1.0 * clock() / CLOCKS_PER_SEC << " sec "       \
       << endl;
```

Step 3: Optimize the loop conditions

The program uses nested loops to calculate the DP values. We can optimize the loop conditions to reduce the number of iterations. Instead of iterating from `1` to `100 * 100 + 10` and `n` to `1`, we can iterate from `cap` to `a[i]` (decrementing by `a[i]`) and `k` to `1` (decrementing by `1`). This reduces the number of iterations and improves the runtime.

Step 4: Remove unused variables and code

The program has some unused variables and dead code. We can remove the following lines:

```
int xx = 0;
int t;
cin >> t;
while (t--) {
    ;
    solve();
    cout << endl;
}
```

Step 5: Optimize the calculation of `total`

The program uses the `accumulate` function to calculate the sum of elements in the `b` array. We can optimize this by using a variable `total` and updating it in the loop instead of using `accumulate`.

Step 6: Optimize the calculation of `ans`

The program calculates the value of `ans` by iterating from `1` to `100 * 100 + 10` and taking the maximum value. We can optimize this by initializing `ans` to the maximum value of `tmp[c][k]` and then updating it if necessary.

Step 7: Remove unnecessary vector typedefs

The program defines some unnecessary typedefs for vectors. We can remove the following lines:

```
using vi = std::vector<double>;
using vvi = std::vector<vi>;
using pii = std::pair<int, int>;
using vpii = std::vector<pii>;
using vvpii = std::vector<vpii>;
```

Step 8: Remove unused variables and code (again)

The program has some unused variables and dead code. We can remove the following lines:

```
const int N = 2e2 + 10;
const int inf = 1e18 + 10;
const double Pi = 3.14159265;
```

Now let's generate the optimized program:
