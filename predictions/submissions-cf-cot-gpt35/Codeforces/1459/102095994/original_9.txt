The given C/C++ program has a lot of unnecessary header files, macros, and unused variables. These can be removed to improve the clarity and performance of the program.

Here is the step-by-step optimization process:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes many unnecessary header files like `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<bitset>`, `<cctype>`, `<cmath>`, etc. These can be removed as they are not required for this specific program.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros like `double long double`, `int long long int`, `ll int`, etc., which are not used in the program. These macros can be removed to simplify the code.

3. Remove unused variables: The program defines variables `xx` and `t` which are not used anywhere in the program. These variables can be removed to improve clarity.

4. Optimize the `solve` function: The `solve` function can be optimized by removing unnecessary variables and using more meaningful variable names. The nested loop that calculates the `tmp` array can also be simplified.

5. Remove unnecessary code: The program contains unreachable code after the `return 0;` statement in the `main` function. This code can be removed as it will never be executed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

const int N = 2e2 + 10;

int n, a[N], b[N];

void solve() {
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i] >> b[i];
  }

  double total = accumulate(b + 1, b + 1 + n, 0.0);
  vector<vector<double>> dp(N * N, vector<double>(N, -1e18));
  dp[0][0] = 0.0;

  double ans = -1e18;
  int cap = 0;

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cap += a[i];
    for (int c = 100 * 100 + 10; c >= a[i]; c--) {
      for (int k = n; k >= 1; k--) {
        dp[c][k] = max(dp[c - a[i]][k - 1] + b[i], dp[c][k]);
      }
    }
  }

  for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
    ans = -1e18;
    for (int c = 1; c <= 100 * 100 + 10; c++) {
      ans = max(min(dp[c][k] + (total - dp[c][k]) / 2.0, static_cast<double>(c)), ans);
    }
    cout << fixed << setprecision(20) << ans << " ";
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  solve();

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program removes unnecessary header files, macros, and unused variables. It simplifies the `solve` function by removing unnecessary variables and simplifying the nested loop. It also removes unreachable code after the `return 0;` statement.
