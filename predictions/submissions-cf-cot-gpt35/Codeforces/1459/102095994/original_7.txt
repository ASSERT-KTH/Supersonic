Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files
- The program includes several unnecessary header files such as `<algorithm>`, `<bitset>`, `<cctype>`, `<climits>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdio>`, `<cstring>`, `<iostream>`, `<iterator>`, `<map>`, `<numeric>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, and `<stdlib.h>`.
- These header files are not used in the program and can be removed to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
- The program defines several unnecessary macros such as `double`, `int`, `ll`, `ibs`, `cti`, `bp`, `koto_memory`, `res`, `timer`, and `deb`.
- These macros are not used in the program and can be removed to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary using statements
- The program includes unnecessary using statements such as `vi`, `vvi`, `pii`, `vpii`, and `vvpii`.
- These using statements are not used in the program and can be removed to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary variables
- The program defines an unnecessary variable `xx` which is not used.
- This variable can be removed to improve memory usage.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary code
- The program contains unnecessary code after the `solve` function call in the `main` function.
- This code can be removed to improve execution time.

Step 6: Optimize the nested loops
- The program uses nested loops to calculate the `dp` array.
- By optimizing the nested loops, we can reduce the number of iterations and improve execution time.

Step 7: Optimize the output precision
- The program uses `cout` with `fixed` and `setprecision` to output the result with 20 decimal places.
- By reducing the precision to a smaller number, we can improve execution time.

Step 8: Return the optimized program
