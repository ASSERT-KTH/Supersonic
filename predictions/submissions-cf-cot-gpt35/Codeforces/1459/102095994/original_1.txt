The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files that are not used in the code. Removing these header files will improve the compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several unnecessary macros that are not used in the code. Removing these macros will simplify the code and improve readability.

3. Optimize the use of vectors: The program uses vectors extensively, but it does not specify the initial size of the vectors. By specifying the initial size of the vectors, we can avoid unnecessary reallocations and improve performance.

4. Optimize the use of the accumulate function: The program uses the accumulate function to calculate the sum of the elements in the 'b' array. However, it can be optimized by using a simple for loop to calculate the sum.

5. Remove unused variables: The program defines two unused variables 'xx' and 't'. Removing these unused variables will improve the readability of the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int N = 2e2 + 10;

int n, a[N], b[N];

void solve() {
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i] >> b[i];
  }
  
  double total = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    total += b[i];
  }
  
  vector<vector<double>> dp(N * N, vector<double>(N, -1e18));
  dp[0][0] = 0;
  
  double ans = -1e18;
  int cap = 0;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cap += a[i];
    
    for (int c = 100 * 100 + 10; c >= a[i]; c--) {
      for (int k = n; k >= 1; k--) {
        dp[c][k] = max(dp[c - a[i]][k - 1] + (double)b[i], dp[c][k]);
      }
    }
  }
  
  for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
    ans = -1e18;
    
    for (int c = 1; c <= 100 * 100 + 10; c++) {
      ans = max(min(dp[c][k] + (total - dp[c][k]) / 2.0, (double)c), ans);
    }
    
    cout << fixed << setprecision(20) << ans << " ";
  }
}

int main() {
  solve();
  
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program removes unnecessary header files, macros, and unused variables. It also optimizes the use of vectors and the accumulate function. These optimizations improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
