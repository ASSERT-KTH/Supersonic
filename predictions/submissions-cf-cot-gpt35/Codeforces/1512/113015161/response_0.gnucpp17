The given code has several issues that can be optimized:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended and can slow down the compilation process. We can remove this and include the necessary headers individually.

2. Excessive type aliases: The code defines multiple type aliases, which are not used in the program. We can remove these unnecessary type aliases to simplify the code.

3. Unused variables: The variables `dx`, `dy`, and `c` are declared but not used in the program. We can remove these unused variables to improve readability.

4. Redundant function declarations: The functions `_pow()`, `pow_mod()`, `mod_inverse()`, `factorial()`, `is_prime()`, `sieve_prime_generator()`, `prime_factorization()`, `total_divisors()`, `dfs()`, and `bfs()` are declared but not used in the program. We can remove these redundant function declarations to reduce clutter.

5. Unoptimized loops: The function `sum_of_divisors()` has two nested loops, which can be optimized. We can reduce the number of iterations by starting the inner loop from `i` instead of `1`. Additionally, we can remove the check `if (a[i] <= 1e7)` inside the second loop, as it is unnecessary.

6. Unnecessary global variables: The variables `a` and `mp` are declared as global variables, but they are only used inside the `sum_of_divisors()` function. We can move these variables inside the function to limit their scope and improve code organization.

7. Redundant output statements: The code includes several output statements (`co()`, `cy`, `cn`, `case()`, `go`, `Good_Bye`) that are not used in the program. We can remove these redundant output statements to simplify the code.

8. Unnecessary macros: The code includes several unnecessary macros (`Test`, `input`, `lp`, `rlp`, `nl`, `nll`, `sp`, `sl`, `Faster`, `Input_txt`). We can remove these macros to improve code readability.

9. Unused input/output file handling: The code includes the macros `Input_txt()`, which redirects input and output to files. However, these macros are not used in the program. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.
