The given program is quite long and contains a lot of unnecessary code. It includes unnecessary typedefs, unnecessary macros, and unnecessary header files.

To optimize the program, we can follow these steps:

1. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs that are not used anywhere. We can remove them to simplify the code.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used anywhere. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes all standard library headers. This can increase the compilation time and is not recommended. We can include only the necessary headers instead.

4. Simplify the code: The program contains some unnecessary code, such as unused functions and unused variables. We can remove them to simplify the code.

5. Optimize the sum_of_divisors function: The sum_of_divisors function calculates the sum of divisors for each number from 1 to 1e7. This can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

6. Optimize the case_i function: The case_i function checks if a number is present in the mp array and prints the corresponding value. This can be optimized by using the find function of the map container.

7. Remove unnecessary code: The main function contains some unnecessary code, such as the _pow function, pow_mod function, mod_inverse function, factorial function, is_prime function, sieve_prime_generator function, prime_factorization function, total_divisors function, dfs function, and bfs function. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

const int mX = 1e7 + 12;
int c, a[mX];
map<int, int> mp;

void sum_of_divisors() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 1e7; i++) {
        for (int j = i; j <= 1e7; j += i) {
            a[j] += i;
        }
    }
    for (int i = 1e7; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (a[i] <= 1e7) {
            mp[a[i]] = i;
        }
    }
}

void case_i() {
    cin >> c;
    auto it = mp.find(c);
    if (it != mp.end()) {
        cout << it->second << '\n';
    } else {
        cout << -1 << '\n';
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    cout.tie(nullptr);

    sum_of_divisors();

    int _;
    cin >> _;
    while (_--) {
        case_i();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

By following these optimization steps, we have simplified the code and improved its efficiency.
