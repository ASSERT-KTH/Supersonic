The given program has various unnecessary typedefs and using declarations that make the code harder to read and understand. These aliases can be removed to simplify the code.

The program also includes many unnecessary header files like `<bits/stdc++.h>`. We can remove this and include only the necessary header files.

The program includes a large number of unnecessary macros. These macros can be removed to improve code readability.

The program defines a large number of unnecessary variables. These variables can be removed to improve memory usage.

The program has unnecessary functions like `_pow`, `pow_mod`, `mod_inverse`, `factorial`, `is_prime`, `sieve_prime_generator`, `prime_factorization`, `total_divisors`, `dfs`, and `bfs`. These functions are not used in the main program and can be removed.

The program defines unnecessary arrays like `a` and `mp` that are not used in the main program and can be removed.

The program uses the `Faster` macro, which is unnecessary and can be removed.

The program uses the `Test` macro, which is unnecessary and can be removed.

The program uses the `case_i` function, which can be simplified.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

const int MAX = 1e7 + 12;
int a[MAX];

void sum_of_divisors() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX; i++) {
        for (int j = i; j <= MAX; j += i) {
            a[j] += i;
        }
    }
}

void case_i() {
    int c;
    cin >> c;
    if (a[c] <= MAX) {
        cout << a[c] << endl;
    } else {
        cout << -1 << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    sum_of_divisors();
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        case_i();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized program, unnecessary aliases, macros, functions, and variables have been removed to improve code readability and memory usage. The program now only includes the necessary header files and uses standard library functions and data structures to achieve the desired functionality.
