The given code can be optimized in two main areas:

1. Reducing memory usage: The code currently uses two arrays `v1` and `mp1` to store values. However, the `mp1` vector is not required since it is already declared as a global array. We can remove the `vector<long long> mp1(N, 0);` line from the `main()` function to avoid unnecessary memory usage.

2. Optimizing the inner loop: The inner loop `for (int j = i; j < N; j += i)` can be optimized. Currently, it iterates from `i` to `N` with a step size of `i`. However, we can reduce the number of iterations by starting the loop from `i` and incrementing `j` by `i` until `j` is less than or equal to `N`. This way, we only iterate up to `N/i` times instead of `N` times.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
const long long N = 10000001;
long long v1[N];
long long mp1[N];

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j <= N; j += i) {
      v1[j] += i;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    if (v1[i] < N && mp1[v1[i]] == 0)
      mp1[v1[i]] = i;
  }
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int c;
    cin >> c;
    if (mp1[c])
      cout << mp1[c];
    else
      cout << -1;
    cout << endl;
  }
}
```

This optimized code reduces the memory usage by removing the unnecessary `vector<long long> mp1(N, 0);` line and optimizes the inner loop by starting from `i` and incrementing `j` by `i` until `j` is less than or equal to `N`.
