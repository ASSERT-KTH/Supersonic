Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and definitions
- The program includes unnecessary headers such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`. Since the program only uses `iostream`, we can remove the other include.
- The program defines macros for various types and operations, but these are not used in the code. We can remove these definitions.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary variable initialization
- The variable `t` is initialized to 1 and then immediately overwritten with the user input. We can remove the initialization.

Step 3: Optimize the loop
- The current loop calculates the value of `moves` by incrementing it until `moves * (moves + 1) / 2` is greater than or equal to `x`. However, this can be optimized to a simple mathematical formula: `moves = ceil((-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * x)) / 2)`.
- The loop also checks if `moves * (moves + 1) / 2` is equal to `x + 1` and increments `moves` in this case. However, this condition can be simplified to `moves = moves + (moves * (moves + 1) / 2 == x + 1)`.
- By using these optimizations, we can remove the loop entirely.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary headers and using directives
- The program includes `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`, but these headers are not used. We can remove these includes.
- The program also uses the `std` namespace, but only for `cin` and `cout`. We can remove the `using namespace std` directive and use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    long long x;
    std::cin >> x;

    long long moves = static_cast<long long>(std::ceil((-1 + std::sqrt(1 + 8 * x)) / 2));
    moves = moves + (moves * (moves + 1) / 2 == x + 1);
    
    std::cout << moves << std::endl;
  }
}
```
