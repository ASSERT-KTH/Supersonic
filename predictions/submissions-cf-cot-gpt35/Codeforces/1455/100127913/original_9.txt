Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>` headers, but they are not used in the program. We can remove them to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
- The program defines several macros (e.g., `ll`, `ull`, `ui`, `vi`, `vll`, etc.) that are not used in the program. We can remove them to improve code readability.

Step 3: Optimize the loop condition
- The program uses a `while(1)` loop to find the value of `moves`. However, we can optimize the loop condition to make it more efficient.
- Instead of checking the condition `moves * (moves + 1) / 2 < x` in each iteration, we can calculate the maximum value of `moves` using the formula `moves * (moves + 1) / 2 <= x`.
- By doing this, we can reduce the number of iterations required to find the value of `moves`.

Step 4: Optimize the calculation of `moves`
- The program calculates the value of `moves` using the formula `moves * (moves + 1) / 2`. This calculation can be optimized.
- Instead of calculating the value of `moves` in each iteration, we can use binary search to find the value of `moves` more efficiently.
- We can start with a range of possible values for `moves` (e.g., 0 to x) and perform binary search to find the exact value of `moves` that satisfies the condition `moves * (moves + 1) / 2 <= x`.
- This optimization will reduce the number of calculations required to find the value of `moves`.

Step 5: Optimize the output statement
- The program uses `cout` to print the value of `moves`. However, we can optimize the output statement to improve the running time.
- Instead of printing the value of `moves` using `cout << moves << endl`, we can use `printf` function to print the value more efficiently.
- This optimization will reduce the running time of the program.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize "trapv"

#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    int t = 1;
    scanf("%d", &t);
    while (t--) {
        long long x;
        scanf("%lld", &x);
        long long moves = 0;
        long long low = 0, high = x;
        while (low <= high) {
            long long mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (mid * (mid + 1) / 2 <= x) {
                moves = mid;
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        if (moves * (moves + 1) / 2 == x + 1)
            moves++;
        printf("%lld\n", moves);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:
- Removed unnecessary headers (`<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`) to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.
- Removed unnecessary macros to improve code readability.
- Optimized the loop condition by using the formula `moves * (moves + 1) / 2 <= x` instead of `moves * (moves + 1) / 2 < x`.
- Optimized the calculation of `moves` using binary search to find the exact value more efficiently.
- Optimized the output statement by using `printf` function instead of `cout` to improve the running time.
