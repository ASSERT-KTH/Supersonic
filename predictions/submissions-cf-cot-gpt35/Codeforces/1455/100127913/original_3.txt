The given program calculates the minimum number of moves required to reach a given number `x` by incrementing a variable `moves` in each move. The calculation of the minimum number of moves is done by iterating over `moves` until `moves * (moves + 1) / 2` is greater than or equal to `x`. 

The program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes unnecessary header files `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`. We can remove these header files as they are not used in the program.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary namespaces: The program includes the namespace `std` and `__gnu_pbds`, but only the `std` namespace is used. We can remove the `__gnu_pbds` namespace as it is not used in the program.

4. Simplify the calculation of moves: The program calculates `moves * (moves + 1) / 2` in each iteration of the while loop. We can simplify this calculation by using a variable `sum` that keeps track of the sum of the series `1 + 2 + ... + moves`. We can update `sum` in each iteration by adding `moves` to it. This will eliminate the need for the multiplication and division operations in each iteration.

5. Optimize the loop condition: The while loop condition `while (1)` can be optimized by changing it to `while (moves <= x)` to avoid unnecessary iterations when `moves` becomes greater than `x`.

6. Optimize the calculation of moves: The if condition `if (moves * (moves + 1) / 2 == x + 1)` can be optimized by changing it to `if (sum == x + 1)` to avoid the multiplication operation.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    long long x;
    std::cin >> x;

    long long moves = 0;
    long long sum = 0;

    while (sum <= x) {
      moves++;
      sum += moves;
    }

    if (sum == x + 1)
      moves++;

    std::cout << moves << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary header files `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`.
2. Removed unnecessary macros.
3. Removed unnecessary namespace `__gnu_pbds`.
4. Simplified the calculation of moves by using a variable `sum` to keep track of the sum of the series.
5. Optimized the loop condition to avoid unnecessary iterations.
6. Optimized the calculation of moves by checking if `sum` is equal to `x + 1`.
