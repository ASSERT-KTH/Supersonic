The given C/C++ program calculates the minimum number of moves required to reach a certain position x. The program uses a while loop to increment the variable "moves" until the condition (moves * (moves + 1) / 2 < x) is satisfied.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes <bits/stdc++.h> and <iostream> which are not required. We can remove these includes.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros.

3. Simplify the while loop condition: The condition in the while loop can be simplified to (moves * (moves + 1) < 2 * x). This avoids the need for division and allows for faster comparison.

4. Remove unnecessary check for (moves * (moves + 1) / 2 == x + 1): The program checks if (moves * (moves + 1) / 2 == x + 1) and increments "moves" if true. However, this check is not necessary as the condition (moves * (moves + 1) / 2 < x) already ensures that "moves" is incremented to the correct value.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    long long x;
    std::cin >> x;

    long long moves = 0;
    while (moves * (moves + 1) < 2 * x)
      moves++;

    std::cout << moves << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have simplified the program and improved its running time and memory usage.
