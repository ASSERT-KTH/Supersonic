The given C++ program calculates a sum based on the input values and then multiplies the sum by 2000 and prints the result. To optimize this program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a large number of other headers, which can slow down compiling. Since we are not using any specific headers from this include, we can remove it.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for `ll`, `mod`, `pii`, `pll`, `N`, `forn`, `pb`, and `ld`. However, these macros are not used in the program, so we can remove them.

3. Remove unnecessary `fio` macro: The `fio` macro disables synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve I/O performance. However, in this program, it is not necessary as there is no significant I/O operation.

4. Use `std::vector` instead of arrays: The program uses fixed-size arrays for `ar` and `pref`, but the size of these arrays is determined at runtime. It is more efficient to use `std::vector` instead, which can dynamically resize itself as needed.

5. Use integer division instead of floating-point division: The program performs division using `ld` (long double) type, but the division results are assigned to integer variables. It is more efficient to perform integer division using the `/` operator.

6. Simplify the calculation of `pref`: The calculation of `pref` can be simplified by using the previously calculated value of `pref[i - 1]` instead of multiplying all the previous values again.

7. Simplify the calculation of `sum`: The calculation of `sum` can be simplified by removing unnecessary divisions and multiplications.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, p;
  cin >> n >> p;
  vector<pair<long long, long long>> ar(n);
  ar[0].first = 1;
  ar[0].second = 1;
  vector<long long> pref(n);
  pref[0] = 1;
  long double sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    long long a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    ar[i].second = b / p - (a - 1) / p;
    ar[i].first = b - a + 1;
    if (i != 0)
      pref[i] = pref[i - 1] * ar[i].first;
  }
  sum += 1 / (long double)ar[0].first;
  sum *= 2;
  sum *= ar[0].second;
  sum += ar[n - 1].second / ar[n - 1].first / ar[n - 2].first *
         (ar[n - 2].first - ar[n - 2].second);
  sum += ar[n - 1].second / ar[n - 1].first / ar[0].first *
         (ar[0].first - ar[0].second);
  for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    sum += ar[i].second / ar[i].first;
    sum += ar[i].second / ar[i].first / ar[i - 1].first *
           (ar[i - 1].first - ar[i - 1].second);
  }
  cout << setprecision(6) << fixed;
  cout << (long double)sum * 2000 << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary includes, macros, and uses `std::vector` instead of arrays. It also simplifies the calculations of `pref` and `sum` for improved efficiency.
