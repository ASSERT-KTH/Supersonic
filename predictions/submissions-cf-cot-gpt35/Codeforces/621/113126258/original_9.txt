Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file inclusion.

The program includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which includes almost all the standard library header files. This can increase the compilation time and memory usage. Since the program does not use all the included header files, we can remove this line and include only the required header files.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary preprocessor definitions.

The program defines several preprocessor macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

Step 3: Optimize memory usage.

The program uses two arrays, `ar` and `pref`, of size `n`. However, the indices used for these arrays are incorrect. The program accesses `ar[-1]` and `pref[-1]`, which are out of bounds. We can modify the code to use indices starting from 0 to `n-1` instead.

Step 4: Simplify the calculation of `sum`.

The calculation of `sum` can be simplified by removing unnecessary type casting and division operations. We can also remove the multiplication by 2, as it cancels out with the division by 2 later.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int n, p;
  cin >> n >> p;
  long long ar[n][2];
  ar[0][0] = 1;
  ar[0][1] = 1;
  long long pref[n];
  pref[0] = 1;
  long double sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    long long a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    ar[i][1] = b / p - (a - 1) / p;
    ar[i][0] = b - a + 1;
    if (i > 0)
      pref[i] = pref[i - 1] * ar[i][0];
  }
  sum += 1.0 / ar[0][0];
  sum += ar[0][1];
  sum += ar[n - 1][1] / (ar[n - 1][0] * ar[n - 2][0]) * (ar[n - 2][0] - ar[n - 2][1]);
  sum += ar[n - 1][1] / (ar[n - 1][0] * ar[0][0]) * (ar[0][0] - ar[0][1]);
  for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    sum += ar[i][1] / ar[i][0];
    sum += ar[i][1] / (ar[i][0] * ar[i - 1][0]) * (ar[i - 1][0] - ar[i - 1][1]);
  }
  cout << setprecision(6) << fixed;
  cout << sum * 2000.0 << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```
