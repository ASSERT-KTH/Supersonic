To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files such as `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdio>`, `<cstring>`, `<ctime>`, `<iostream>`, `<queue>`, and `<stack>`. We can remove them to reduce memory usage.

2. Use `constexpr` instead of `#define`: Instead of using `#define` to define constant values like `maxn` and `M`, we can use `constexpr` to define compile-time constants. This is a more modern and type-safe approach.

3. Avoid unnecessary function calls: Instead of calling the `Gcd` function for every element of the array, we can calculate the greatest common divisor (`g`) while reading the input numbers. This will reduce the number of function calls and improve performance.

4. Use a more efficient method to count occurrences: Instead of using an array (`num`) to count the occurrences of each number, we can use a `std::unordered_map` to store the count of each number. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

5. Use a more efficient method to find the maximum element: Instead of iterating over all elements to find the maximum element, we can keep track of the maximum element while reading the input numbers. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

6. Use a more efficient method to find the prime numbers: Instead of checking divisibility for all numbers from `2` to `maxx`, we can use a more efficient algorithm like the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find the prime numbers. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <unordered_map>

constexpr int maxn = 300010;
constexpr int M = 15000010;

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);

  int a[maxn];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
  }

  int g = a[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    g = __gcd(g, a[i]);
  }

  std::unordered_map<int, int> num;
  int maxx = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int t = a[i] / g;
    num[t]++;
    if (t > maxx) {
      maxx = t;
    }
  }

  int cnt = 0;
  int t = 0;
  std::unordered_map<int, bool> vis;
  for (int i = 2; i <= maxx; i++) {
    if (vis[i] == 0) {
      t = 0;
      for (int j = i; j <= maxx; j += i) {
        t += num[j];
        vis[j] = 1;
      }
      if (t > cnt) {
        cnt = t;
      }
    }
  }

  if (cnt == 0) {
    printf("-1\n");
  } else {
    printf("%d\n", n - cnt);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, the program should run faster and use less memory compared to the original version.
