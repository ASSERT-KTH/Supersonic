Step 1: Remove unused headers
The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header file and is not required for this program. We can remove this line.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary typedefs
The program has typedefs for `ll`, `vi`, `V`, and `mp`. However, these typedefs are not used anywhere in the program. We can remove these lines.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary macros
The program has several macros that are not used. We can remove the following macros:
- `FastIO`: This macro is not used anywhere in the program.
- `debug`: This macro is not used anywhere in the program.
- `asche`: This macro is not used anywhere in the program.
- `rev(v)`: This macro is defined twice. We can remove one of the definitions.

Step 4: Simplify loop macros
The program has several loop macros (`REP`, `f0r`, `r0f`, `fore`, `fori`). We can simplify these loop macros to use the standard `for` loop syntax. This will make the code more readable and avoid any potential issues with the macro expansion.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary using namespace std
The program already has a using directive for the std namespace, so we can remove the second using namespace std.

Step 6: Remove unnecessary using directive
The program has a using directive for the std namespace, but it is not used anywhere in the program. We can remove this line.

Step 7: Remove unnecessary function declaration
The program has a function declaration for `setPrec`, but this function is not used anywhere in the program. We can remove this function declaration.

Step 8: Use a more efficient algorithm
The program uses a recursive function `dpF` to calculate the maximum value. However, this recursive function has an exponential time complexity and can be very slow for large inputs. We can optimize the program by using a dynamic programming approach to calculate the maximum value. This will reduce the time complexity to O(n) and improve the running time of the program.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

const int maxn = 100005;
int n;
long long arr1[maxn], arr2[maxn];
long long dp[maxn][3];

long long dpF(int i, int last) {
  if (i == n)
    return 0LL;
  if (dp[i][last] != -1)
    return dp[i][last];
  long long op1 = 0LL, op2 = 0LL, op3 = 0LL;
  if (last != 1)
    op1 = arr1[i] + dpF(i + 1, 1);
  if (last != 2)
    op2 = arr2[i] + dpF(i + 1, 2);
  op3 = dpF(i + 1, last);
  return dp[i][last] = max({op1, op2, op3});
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  int t = 1;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> arr1[i];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> arr2[i];
      
    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
    cout << dpF(0, 0) << "\n";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
