Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which includes a large number of header files. This can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. Since the program doesn't use any specific headers from this library, we can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary variable initializations

The variables `base` and `mod` are declared as constant but are not used in the program. We can remove these declarations to reduce unnecessary memory usage.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives

The preprocessor directive `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` and `#define TASK "C"` are used to handle input/output file redirection. Since we are optimizing for running time and memory usage, we can assume that the program will be run directly in the console without file redirection. Therefore, we can remove these preprocessor directives.

Step 4: Optimize the loop

The loop `for (int i = 1; i <= cnt; ++i)` is used to calculate the sum of values stored in the `v` array. However, this loop can be optimized by storing the sum directly in the `o` variable during the previous loop. This eliminates the need for the sum loop and reduces the number of iterations.

Step 5: Optimize the calculation of `res`

The calculation of `res` can be simplified by using the modulo operator `%` on `k` and `cnt` instead of a separate loop. This reduces the number of iterations and improves the running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int q;
  cin >> q;

  while (q--) {
    long long n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    long long k = n / m;
    long long d = m % 10;
    long long cnt = 1;
    long long _d = (d + d) % 10;
    long long o = d;
    
    while (_d != d) {
      ++cnt;
      _d = (_d + d) % 10;
      o += _d;
    }
    
    long long res = (k / cnt) * o + o * (k % cnt);
    cout << res << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
