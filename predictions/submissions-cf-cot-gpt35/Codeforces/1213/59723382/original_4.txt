To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes multiple standard C++ header files. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary constant variables: The program declares `base` and `mod` constants but they are not used anywhere. We can remove these variables.

3. Avoid using the `freopen` function: The program uses `freopen` to redirect the standard input and output to files. This is not necessary for optimization. We can remove these lines.

4. Avoid using the `sync_with_stdio` function: The program uses `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0)` to disable the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams. This is not necessary for optimization. We can remove this line.

5. Avoid unnecessary array initialization: The program initializes the `v` array with zeros, but only a few elements are actually used. We can remove the initialization and update the code accordingly.

6. Optimize the loop for calculating `res`: The loop that calculates the value of `res` can be optimized. Instead of iterating `k % cnt` times, we can calculate the sum of the elements in `v` using a formula. This will reduce the time complexity of the loop.

Here's the optimized program with the above modifications:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int v[20][20];

int main() {
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    long long n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    long long k = n / m;
    long long d = m % 10;
    long long cnt = 1;
    long long _d = (d + d) % 10;
    v[1][d] = d;
    while (_d != d) {
      ++cnt;
      v[cnt][d] = _d;
      _d = (_d + d) % 10;
    }
    long long o = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= cnt; ++i)
      o += v[i][d];
    long long res = (k / cnt) * o + ((k % cnt) * (k % cnt + 1) / 2) * v[k % cnt][d];
    cout << res << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of Optimization Steps:

1. Removed unnecessary header files to reduce the size of the included header files and improve compilation time.

2. Removed unnecessary constant variables to reduce memory usage.

3. Removed the `freopen` function calls as they are not necessary for optimization.

4. Removed the `sync_with_stdio` function call as it is not necessary for optimization.

5. Removed unnecessary array initialization to optimize memory usage.

6. Optimized the loop for calculating `res` by using a formula to calculate the sum of the elements in `v`. This reduces the time complexity of the loop.
