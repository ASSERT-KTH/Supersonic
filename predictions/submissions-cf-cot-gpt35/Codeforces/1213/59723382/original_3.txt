The given program calculates the sum of a sequence of numbers based on some input values. It uses a nested loop to calculate the sum by iterating through the sequence and adding the corresponding values to the sum.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not needed. We can remove it and include only the necessary libraries.
2. Remove file input/output operations: The program includes code for file input/output operations, which may not be necessary for the optimization process. We can remove this code to simplify the program.
3. Use integer arithmetic instead of floating-point arithmetic: The program uses floating-point arithmetic for division and modulus operations. We can change these operations to integer arithmetic to improve performance.
4. Use a more efficient algorithm: The program uses a nested loop to calculate the sum, which can be optimized to a single loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 20;
const int MAX_M = 20;

int v[MAX_N][MAX_M];

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int q;
    cin >> q;

    while (q--) {
        int n, m;
        cin >> n >> m;

        int k = n / m;
        int d = m % 10;
        int cnt = 1;
        int _d = (d + d) % 10;

        v[1][d] = d;

        while (_d != d) {
            ++cnt;
            v[cnt][d] = _d;
            _d = (_d + d) % 10;
        }

        int o = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= cnt; ++i)
            o += v[i][d];

        int res = (k / cnt) * o;

        for (int i = 1; i <= k % cnt; ++i)
            res += v[i][d];

        cout << res << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:
1. Removed unnecessary includes: The program originally included the `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which includes many unnecessary headers. By removing this and including only `<iostream>`, we reduce the overhead of unnecessary code.
2. Removed file input/output operations: The original program included code for file input/output operations, which may not be necessary for the optimization process. By removing this code, we simplify the program and improve readability.
3. Used integer arithmetic instead of floating-point arithmetic: The original program used floating-point arithmetic for division and modulus operations. By changing these operations to integer arithmetic, we avoid the overhead of floating-point calculations and improve performance.
4. Optimized the loop: The original program used a nested loop to calculate the sum, which can be optimized to a single loop. By using a single loop, we reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.
