To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a lot of other headers. This can increase the compile time and memory usage. We can remove this header and include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std`: This statement imports the entire `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can cause naming conflicts and make the code less readable. We can remove this statement and use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.

3. Minimize I/O operations: The program calls `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0)` and `cin.tie(0)` to improve I/O performance. However, these calls are not necessary for this specific program. We can remove these calls to reduce the runtime overhead.

4. Optimize the loop: The program uses a while loop to calculate the values of `v` array. However, we can optimize this loop by using the formula `v[i][d] = (v[i-1][d] + d) % 10`. This way, we can avoid unnecessary iterations and reduce the runtime.

5. Use integer arithmetic: The program uses floating-point arithmetic for division (`k / cnt`). However, since `k` and `cnt` are integers, we can use integer division (`k / cnt`) to improve the runtime performance.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

const int MAX_SIZE = 20;

int main() {
    int q;
    std::cin >> q;
  
    while (q--) {
        long long n, m;
        std::cin >> n >> m;
      
        long long k = n / m;
        long long d = m % 10;
        long long cnt = 1;
        long long v[MAX_SIZE][10] = {0};
        v[1][d] = d;
      
        for (int i = 2; i < MAX_SIZE; ++i) {
            v[i][d] = (v[i-1][d] + d) % 10;
            if (v[i][d] == d) {
                cnt = i;
                break;
            }
        }
      
        long long o = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= cnt; ++i)
            o += v[i][d];
      
        long long res = (k / cnt) * o;
        for (int i = 1; i <= k % cnt; ++i)
            res += v[i][d];
      
        std::cout << res << '\n';
    }
  
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program eliminates unnecessary headers, avoids using `using namespace std`, minimizes I/O operations, optimizes the loop, and uses integer arithmetic where possible.
