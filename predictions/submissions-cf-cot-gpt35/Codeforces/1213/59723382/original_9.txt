The given program calculates and prints the value of `res` for each test case. The value of `res` is calculated using a loop that iterates over the `cnt` number of rows in the `v` array. For each row, it adds the value at `v[i][d]` to the variable `o`. Finally, the value of `res` is calculated by multiplying `o` with `k / cnt` and adding the remaining values from the last row of the `v` array.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the loop that iterates over the `cnt` number of rows in the `v` array. Instead of storing all the values in the `v` array, we can calculate the sum directly using a mathematical formula.

The sum of the values in the `v` array can be calculated using the formula:

```
sum = (cnt * (cnt + 1) / 2) * d
```

where `cnt` is the number of rows in the `v` array and `d` is the value at `v[1][d]`.

Using this formula, we can simplify the calculation of `res` as follows:

1. Calculate the sum of the values in the `v` array using the formula.
2. Calculate the value of `res` by multiplying the sum with `k / cnt`.
3. Add the remaining values from the last row of the `v` array to `res` by multiplying them with `k % cnt`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long base = 31;
const long long mod = 1e9 + 7;

int main() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
#define TASK "C"
  freopen(TASK ".inp", "r", stdin);
  freopen(TASK ".out", "w", stdout);
#endif
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    long long n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    long long k = n / m;
    long long d = m % 10;
    long long cnt = 1;
    long long _d = (d + d) % 10;
    long long sum = (cnt * (cnt + 1) / 2) * d;
    while (_d != d) {
      ++cnt;
      _d = (_d + d) % 10;
    }
    long long res = (k / cnt) * sum;
    for (int i = 1; i <= k % cnt; ++i)
      res += ((_d + d * (i - 1)) % 10);
    cout << res << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized program, we calculate the sum of the values in the `v` array using a mathematical formula instead of storing all the values in the array. This reduces the time complexity of the program and improves its running time. Additionally, we eliminate the unnecessary loop that iterates over the `cnt` number of rows in the `v` array.
