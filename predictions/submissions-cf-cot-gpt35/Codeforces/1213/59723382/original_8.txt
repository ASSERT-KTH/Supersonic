To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused variables: The variables `n` and `m` are declared but not used. We can remove these variables to improve readability.

3. Reduce memory usage: The 2D array `v` is declared with a fixed size of 20x20. However, we only use a small portion of this array. We can reduce the size of the array to the minimum required size.

4. Remove unused code: The code inside the `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` block is not necessary for optimization. We can remove this block.

5. Use more efficient data types: The variables `k`, `d`, `cnt`, `_d`, `o`, and `res` can be declared as `int` instead of `long long` since their values do not exceed the range of `int`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_SIZE = 10;

int v[MAX_SIZE][MAX_SIZE];

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int q;
  cin >> q;

  while (q--) {
    int k, m;
    cin >> k >> m;

    int d = m % 10;
    int cnt = 1;
    int _d = (d + d) % 10;
    v[1][d] = d;

    while (_d != d) {
      ++cnt;
      v[cnt][d] = _d;
      _d = (_d + d) % 10;
    }

    int o = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= cnt; ++i)
      o += v[i][d];

    int res = (k / cnt) * o;
    for (int i = 1; i <= k % cnt; ++i)
      res += v[i][d];

    cout << res << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
