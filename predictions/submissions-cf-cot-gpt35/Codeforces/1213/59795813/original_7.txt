The given program calculates the prefix sum of the weights of the minimum spanning tree formed by Kruskal's algorithm. The program reads the input, constructs the graph, sorts the edges, performs the union-find operations, and calculates the prefix sum.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes all standard library headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for commonly used operations such as `push_back`, `first`, `second`, `gcd`, etc. However, these macros are not used in the code. We can remove these macro definitions.

3. Use `int` instead of `long long`: The program uses `long long` as the data type for integers (`int`). However, the problem statement does not require such large integers. We can use `int` instead of `long long` to save memory.

4. Optimize the `root` function: The `root` function is used to find the root of a given node using the union-find algorithm. Currently, it uses path compression by assigning the root of a node directly to its parent. We can optimize this function by using the iterative version of path compression, which assigns the root of a node to all its ancestors in a single iteration.

5. Optimize the `mrg` function: The `mrg` function merges two sets and returns the product of their sizes. Currently, it updates the size of the root node after merging. We can optimize this function by calculating the product of the sizes before updating the size of the root node.

6. Optimize the `dsu` function: The `dsu` function performs the union-find operations to construct the minimum spanning tree and calculates the prefix sum. Currently, it iterates over the edges and performs union-find operations. We can optimize this function by using a disjoint set data structure, which performs union-find operations in O(1) time complexity.

7. Optimize the loop bounds: The loops in the program iterate from 0 to n-1. However, the indices used in the loops are 1-based. We can modify the loop bounds to iterate from 1 to n.

8. Remove unnecessary output buffering: The program calls `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams. However, there is no need to disable this synchronization.

9. Optimize the sorting operation: The program sorts the edges using `std::sort` algorithm. The edges can be sorted using a linear time complexity algorithm such as counting sort, radix sort, or bucket sort since the weights are limited to the range [1, MAX].

Based on the above optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:
