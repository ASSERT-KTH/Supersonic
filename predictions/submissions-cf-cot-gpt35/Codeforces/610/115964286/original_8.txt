Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and defines.

The program includes the header `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not needed. This header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can increase the compilation time and memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

The program defines the macro `ll` as `long long`. This macro is not used in the program, so it can be removed.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary optimization flags.

The program uses the optimization flag `FASTIO` to speed up the input/output operations. However, this flag is not necessary as the program only performs a single input and output operation.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary operations.

The program performs unnecessary calculations when the input is odd. It checks if `n` is odd and prints `0`. This check and the subsequent calculation can be removed, as the result will always be `0` for odd values of `n`.

Step 4: Simplify the calculation.

The program calculates `((n / 2) - 1) / 2` for even values of `n`. This can be simplified to `n / 4 - 1`, which will give the same result.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  if (n % 2 != 0) {
    std::cout << "0";
  } else {
    std::cout << n / 4 - 1;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
