Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove it and only include the necessary libraries.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines a macro `ll` for `long long` and `FASTIO` for input/output optimization. However, these macros are not being used in the program. We can remove them.

3. Simplify the calculation: The program calculates `((n / 2) - 1) / 2` to find the result. However, this can be simplified to `(n / 4) - 1`. We can make this modification to improve the efficiency of the calculation.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);

  long long n;
  std::cin >> n;

  if (n % 2 != 0) {
    std::cout << "0";
  } else {
    std::cout << (n / 4) - 1;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
