Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file inclusion.

The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard C++ header file and includes a large number of other header files. It is not necessary for this program and can be removed.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros.

The program defines macros `ll` and `FASTIO`. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 3: Optimize input/output operations.

The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output, which are slower compared to C-style input/output functions. We can optimize this by using `scanf` and `printf` functions instead.

Step 4: Simplify the computation.

The program checks if `n` is odd, and if so, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it computes `(n / 2 - 1) / 2` and prints the result. We can simplify this computation by directly computing `(n - 2) / 4` if `n` is even.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  if (n % 2 != 0) {
    printf("0");
  } else {
    printf("%d", (n - 2) / 4);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
