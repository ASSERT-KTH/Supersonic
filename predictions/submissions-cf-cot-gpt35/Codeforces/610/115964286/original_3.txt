Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes almost all the standard library headers. This can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. Since the code doesn't actually use any specific features from this header, it can be safely removed.

2. Remove unnecessary macro definitions: The code defines two macros, `ll` and `FASTIO`, but they are not used in the program. Removing these macro definitions will simplify the code and improve readability.

3. Remove unnecessary input/output synchronization: The code uses `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`, which disables synchronization between C and C++ standard streams. However, this synchronization is not needed in this program since there is no mixed input/output using C and C++ streams. Removing this line will not affect the functionality of the program.

4. Simplify the conditional statement: The code checks if `n` is odd using `n % 2 != 0`. However, we can simplify this condition by checking if `n` is even using `n % 2 == 0`. This will eliminate the need for an else block and make the code more concise.

5. Simplify the calculation: The code calculates the result using `((n / 2) - 1) / 2`. We can optimize this calculation by using `(n - 2) / 4`. This will avoid two divisions and a subtraction, resulting in faster execution.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  if (n % 2 == 0) {
    std::cout << (n - 2) / 4;
  } else {
    std::cout << "0";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
