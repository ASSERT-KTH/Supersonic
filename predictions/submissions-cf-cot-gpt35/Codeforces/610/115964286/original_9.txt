The given program calculates the result of the expression ((n / 2) - 1) / 2, where n is an input integer. The program first checks if n is odd, and if so, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the result of the expression.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the unnecessary check for oddness and simplify the expression to improve both running time and memory usage.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary include statement for the entire standard library header `<bits/stdc++.h>`. We can include only the necessary headers for this program, which are `<iostream>` and `<ios>`.
2. Remove the unused `#define ll long long`, as it is not used in the optimized program.
3. Remove the `FASTIO` macro and its invocation, as it is not necessary for this program.
4. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` statement.
5. Simplify the expression `((n / 2) - 1) / 2` to `(n - 2) / 4`, which provides the same result.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ios>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::cout << (n - 2) / 4;
  
  return 0;
}
```
