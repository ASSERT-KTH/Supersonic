The given program is a simple C++ program that takes an integer input, performs some calculations, and prints the result.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove it.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines two macros, `ll` and `FASTIO`, which are not used. We can remove them.

3. Simplify the calculation: The program calculates `(n / 2) - 1` and then divides it by 2. We can simplify this calculation to `n / 4`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  if (n % 2 != 0) {
    std::cout << "0";
  } else {
    std::cout << n / 4;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
