Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file is not standard and includes a large number of other header files, which can increase compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove the unused `using namespace std;` statement. This statement brings all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts.

3. Remove the unnecessary `FASTIO` macro. The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(0)` statements are used to disable the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, but they are not required in this program.

4. Remove the unnecessary `ll` macro. The `ll` macro is used to define `long long` type, but it is not necessary in this program since `long long` is only used once.

5. Simplify the calculation of the output. Instead of calculating `((n / 2) - 1) / 2`, we can calculate `(n - 2) / 4`. This simplification reduces the number of operations and improves readability.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  if (n % 2 != 0) {
    std::cout << "0";
  } else {
    std::cout << (n - 2) / 4;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
