Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not needed for this program. It is a non-standard header file and including it can increase compilation time. Additionally, it includes many other header files which are not required for this program.

2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives: The program defines `ll` as `long long` and includes the `FASTIO` macro. However, these are not used in the program. Therefore, we can remove these definitions and the `FASTIO` macro.

3. Simplify the logic: The program checks if `n` is odd and prints "0" if true. Otherwise, it calculates `(n / 2 - 1) / 2` and prints the result. However, we can simplify this calculation by directly calculating `n / 4`.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  if (n % 2 != 0) {
    std::cout << "0";
  } else {
    std::cout << n / 4;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
