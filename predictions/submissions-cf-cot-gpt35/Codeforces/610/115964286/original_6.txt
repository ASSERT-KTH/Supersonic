The given program calculates the value of ((n / 2) - 1) / 2 if n is even, otherwise it prints 0.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. We can remove the unnecessary include statement for the entire bits/stdc++.h library. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers, such as iostream.

2. We can remove the unnecessary preprocessor macros for long long and FASTIO. They are not used in the program.

3. We can remove the unnecessary ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(0), and cout.tie(0) statements. They are not needed in this case.

4. We can remove the namespace std declaration. It is not required and can be avoided to prevent namespace conflicts.

5. We can simplify the calculation of ((n / 2) - 1) / 2 to (n - 2) / 4. This will result in the same value.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    long long n;
    std::cin >> n;
    
    if (n % 2 != 0) {
        std::cout << "0";
    } else {
        std::cout << (n - 2) / 4;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
