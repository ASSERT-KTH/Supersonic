Explanation:

1. The program reads an integer `n` from the input.
2. If `n` is odd, it prints "0".
3. Otherwise, it calculates and prints `((n / 2) - 1) / 2`.

Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary include statement: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove this include statement to reduce unnecessary compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary macro definitions: The program defines macros `ll` and `FASTIO`, which are not used in the program. We can remove these macro definitions to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary input/output stream optimizations: The program uses `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`, which disables the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams. However, this optimization is not needed for this program. We can remove this optimization to simplify the code.

4. Simplify the calculation of the result: The program calculates `((n / 2) - 1) / 2` to obtain the result. However, we can simplify this calculation to `(n - 2) / 4` without changing the result. This simplification reduces the number of divisions and simplifies the code.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  if (n % 2 != 0) {
    std::cout << "0";
  } else {
    std::cout << (n - 2) / 4;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
