The given program calculates the maximum sum of a subarray of length at most m from an array of length n, with the constraint that each element in the subarray should be reduced by k.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not necessary. We can remove this include statement.

2. Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`: The `cin` and `cout` functions in C++ have additional overhead compared to `scanf` and `printf` functions in C. By replacing `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`, we can improve the input/output performance of the program.

3. Use a more efficient data type for array indices: The program uses `int` data type for array indices. Since the maximum value of `n` and `m` is not given, we can assume that it can be larger than the maximum value of `int`. Therefore, we can use `long long` data type for array indices to avoid any potential overflow issues.

4. Optimize the inner loop condition: The inner loop condition `i - j <= m` can be optimized by changing it to `j >= i - m` which avoids the subtraction operation in every iteration.

5. Initialize `dp` array to 0: The `dp` array is not initialized before using it. We should initialize it to 0 to avoid any potential garbage values.

Taking these optimizations into consideration, the optimized program is as follows:

```c++
#pragma GCC optimize("O3", "unroll-loops")
#pragma GCC target("avx2")
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define ll long long

const int MAXN = 1005000;
ll n, m, k, ans, sum, a[MAXN], dp[MAXN];

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    scanf("%lld %lld %lld", &n, &m, &k);
    for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        scanf("%lld", &a[i]);
    for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        sum = a[i];
        for (ll j = i - 1; j >= 0 && j >= i - m; j--) {
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + sum - k);
            sum += a[j];
        }
        ans = max(ans, dp[i]);
    }
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should help improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
