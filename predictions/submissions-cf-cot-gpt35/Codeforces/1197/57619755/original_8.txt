Optimization Steps:
1. Remove unnecessary header files. The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes a lot of unnecessary standard library headers, which can slow down compilation time. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers.
2. Avoid using `using namespace std`. It is considered a good practice to avoid using `using namespace std` as it can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for the standard library functions and types.
3. Avoid unnecessary global variables. In this case, `n`, `m`, `k`, `ans`, `sum`, `a`, and `dp` can be declared within the `main` function, as they are not used outside of it.
4. Optimize the loop conditions. In the second loop, the condition `i >= 0` can be changed to `j > 0` to avoid unnecessary iterations.
5. Optimize the loop initialization. In the second loop, the initialization `sum = a[i]` can be moved inside the loop as `sum` is modified in each iteration.
6. Optimize the loop increment. In the second loop, the increment `sum += a[j]` can be moved to the end of the loop body to avoid unnecessary additions.
7. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` with `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` for faster input/output.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);

  int n, m, k;
  std::cin >> n >> m >> k;
  
  long long ans = 0;
  long long sum = 0;
  long long dp[1005000] = {0};
  long long a[1005000] = {0};
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sum = a[i];
    for (int j = i - 1; j > 0 && i - j <= m; j--) {
      dp[i] = std::max(dp[i], dp[j] + sum - k);
      sum += a[j];
    }
    ans = std::max(ans, dp[i]);
  }
  
  std::cout << ans;
  
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimizations mentioned above may not have a significant impact on the program's performance, as the original program is already quite efficient. However, these optimizations can improve the code's readability and maintainability.
