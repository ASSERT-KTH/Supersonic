Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage. Since we are not using any specific header from this collection, we can remove it.

Step 2: Optimize I/O
The program currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output. These I/O operations can be slow, especially when processing large inputs. We can optimize the I/O by using `scanf` and `printf` instead.

Step 3: Optimize the loop
The loop for counting the even and odd numbers can be optimized by using bitwise operations instead of the modulo operator. This can improve the performance of the loop.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    long long temp, n, m, a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0;
    scanf("%lld", &n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%lld", &temp);
      (temp & 1) ? a++ : c++;
    }
    scanf("%lld", &m);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      scanf("%lld", &temp);
      (temp & 1) ? b++ : d++;
    }
    printf("%lld\n", a * b + c * d);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
