Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not required. We can remove it and only include the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: The statement `using namespace std;` imports all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts. It is better to use the `std::` prefix when accessing names from the `std` namespace.

3. Replace `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: The statement `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` is used to disable the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams. However, it is not necessary in this program as it does not mix C and C++ I/O operations. We can remove this line.

4. Avoid unnecessary variable declarations: The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are only used within the `while` loop and their values are reset in each iteration. We can move the declaration of these variables inside the loop to avoid unnecessary memory usage.

5. Avoid unnecessary modulus operation: The modulus operation `temp % 2` is used to check if a number is odd or even. Instead of using the modulus operation, we can use bitwise AND operation with 1 (`temp & 1`) to achieve the same result.

6. Avoid unnecessary newline character: The statement `"\n"` is used to print a newline character after each output. Instead of using `"\n"`, we can use `endl` which not only inserts a newline character but also flushes the output buffer.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    long long n, m, a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0;
    std::cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      long long temp;
      std::cin >> temp;
      a += temp & 1;
      c += !(temp & 1);
    }
    std::cin >> m;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      long long temp;
      std::cin >> temp;
      b += temp & 1;
      d += !(temp & 1);
    }
    std::cout << a * b + c * d << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
