To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of `<bits/stdc++.h>`.
2. Avoid using `using namespace std`.
3. Remove the synchronization of `cin` and `cout` with `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`, as it is not needed in this program.
4. Remove the usage of `cin.tie(NULL)` and `cout.tie(NULL)` as they are not required in this program.
5. Instead of using four separate variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, we can use two variables `odd` and `even` to keep track of the odd and even numbers respectively.
6. Instead of using a loop to calculate the count of odd and even numbers, we can calculate them in a single pass while reading the input numbers.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    long long temp, n, m, odd = 0, even = 0;
    cin >> n;
    while (n--) {
      cin >> temp;
      temp % 2 ? odd++ : even++;
    }
    cin >> m;
    while (m--) {
      cin >> temp;
      temp % 2 ? odd++ : even++;
    }
    cout << odd * even << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
