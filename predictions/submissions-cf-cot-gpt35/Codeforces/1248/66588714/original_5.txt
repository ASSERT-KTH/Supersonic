Explanation of the optimization steps:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of libraries, which can slow down the compilation process. We only need the `iostream` library for this program, so we can remove the unnecessary includes.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: It is considered a good practice to avoid using `using namespace std;` as it can lead to name conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix before standard library functions and objects.

3. Optimize input/output: The program currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output. These functions are slower compared to the C-style `scanf` and `printf` functions. We can use `scanf` and `printf` to optimize the input/output operations.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` in every iteration of the for loops. However, these values are not needed outside the for loops. We can move the variables declaration and initialization inside the for loops to avoid unnecessary calculations.

5. Use integer division instead of modulus: The program uses the modulus operator `%` to check if a number is odd or even. However, we can optimize this by using integer division `/` instead. If a number `x` is odd, then `x / 2 * 2` will be equal to `x - 1`. If a number `x` is even, then `x / 2 * 2` will be equal to `x`.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  std::scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    long long temp, n, m, a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0;
    std::scanf("%lld", &n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::scanf("%lld", &temp);
      a += temp / 2;
      c += (temp + 1) / 2;
    }
    std::scanf("%lld", &m);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      std::scanf("%lld", &temp);
      b += temp / 2;
      d += (temp + 1) / 2;
    }
    std::printf("%lld\n", a * b + c * d);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
