Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file inclusion.

The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file includes a large number of other header files, which can increase compilation time and memory usage. In this program, only the `<iostream>` header file is required, so we can remove the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file and include `<iostream>` instead.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary synchronization.

The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` line is not necessary in this program. It is used to synchronize the C and C++ standard streams, but it is not needed in this case. We can remove this line.

Step 3: Optimize the loop for calculating a, b, c, and d.

In the original program, for each input number, the remainder is calculated using the modulo operator (`%`) and then the appropriate counter is incremented. This can be optimized by using bitwise operations instead of modulo. 

We can use the bitwise AND operator (`&`) with 1 to check if the number is odd or even. If the result is 1, then the number is odd, otherwise it is even. By using this approach, we can avoid the modulo operation and improve the efficiency of the program.

Step 4: Optimize the multiplication and addition.

In the original program, the result of `a * b + c * d` is calculated and then printed. We can optimize this calculation by avoiding the intermediate calculation and directly printing the result.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    long long temp, n, m, a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0;
    cin >> n;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> temp;
      temp & 1 ? a++ : c++;
    }
    
    cin >> m;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      cin >> temp;
      temp & 1 ? b++ : d++;
    }
    
    cout << a * b + c * d << "\n";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
