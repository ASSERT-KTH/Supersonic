Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The original program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary synchronization: The original program uses `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to unsynchronize the standard streams with C I/O functions. This is not necessary for this program as it does not mix C and C++ I/O operations.

3. Avoid unnecessary variable declarations: The original program declares the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` outside the loop, even though they are only used within the loop. We can move the declarations inside the loop to avoid unnecessary variable scope.

4. Optimize calculation of even and odd counts: The original program uses conditional statements to check if `temp` is odd or even and increments the corresponding count variables. We can optimize this by using bitwise operations. We can use `temp & 1` to check if `temp` is odd (bitwise AND with 1) and increment the corresponding count variables accordingly.

5. Remove unnecessary return statement: The `return 0;` statement at the end of the program is not necessary as the `main` function is of type `int` and will automatically return 0 if no return statement is provided.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    long long n, m, a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0;
    std::cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      long long temp;
      std::cin >> temp;
      a += temp & 1;
      c += !(temp & 1);
    }
    std::cin >> m;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      long long temp;
      std::cin >> temp;
      b += temp & 1;
      d += !(temp & 1);
    }
    std::cout << a * b + c * d << "\n";
  }
}
```
