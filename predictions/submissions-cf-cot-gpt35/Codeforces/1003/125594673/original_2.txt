The given program is already using some compiler optimizations flags, such as "-O3", "-sse4", and "-Ofast", which can help improve the performance of the program. However, there are still some areas that can be optimized further:

1. The program is using `pow(2, 31)` to calculate the largest power of 2. However, this can be optimized by directly assigning the value `1 << 31` to the variable `t`.

2. The program is using a map to count the occurrences of each value in the input array. However, since the range of values is limited to `2^31`, we can use an array of size `2^31` to store the counts. This would be more memory-efficient and also faster for lookup operations.

3. The program is using a loop to iterate over the bits of `t` and calculate the sum and remaining value. This can be optimized by using bitwise operations instead of division and multiplication.

4. The program is using `cout` for each output. This can be slow, especially when there are a large number of queries. It would be more efficient to store the results in a vector and then print them all at once after the loop.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("O3")
#pragma GCC target("sse4")
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define int long long
#define mod 1000000007
#define yes cout << "YES" << endl
#define no cout << "NO" << endl
#define pb push_back
#define all(v) (v).begin(), (v).end()
#define read(a, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i]
#define print(a, n) for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) cout << a[i] << " "
#define RUN ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);
#define debug(output) cout << #output << "=" << output << endl
using namespace std;

const int MAX_VALUE = 1 << 31;

signed main() {
  RUN;
  int test = 1;
  while (test--) {
    int n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;
    vector<int> value(n);
    read(value, n);
    
    vector<int> count(MAX_VALUE, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      count[value[i]]++;
    }
    
    vector<int> results;
    while (q--) {
      int b;
      cin >> b;
      int sum = 0;
      int t = MAX_VALUE;
      for (; t >= 1; t >>= 1) {
        int l = min(count[t], b / t);
        sum += l;
        b -= l * t;
      }
      results.push_back((b == 0) ? sum : -1);
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
      cout << results[i] << "\n";
    }
  }
}
```

In this optimized version, we have made the following changes:

1. We changed the size of the `value` vector to `n` instead of `n + 1`. The extra space was not necessary.

2. We replaced the `map` with a `vector` called `count` to store the counts of each value. The size of the `count` vector is set to `MAX_VALUE` to accommodate the range of values. We initialize all elements to 0 and increment the count for each value encountered.

3. We replaced the `pow(2, 31)` with `MAX_VALUE` and used bitwise shifting (`>>`) instead of division (`/`) to calculate the next power of 2.

4. We stored the results of each query in a `results` vector instead of printing them immediately. This allows us to avoid the overhead of multiple `cout` calls. After the loop, we iterate over the `results` vector and print all the results at once.

These optimizations should help improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
