Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes all standard headers, which can increase the compilation time and memory usage. We should only include the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
- The `#define int long long` macro is not used in the program, so we can remove it.
- The `#define mod 1000000007` macro is not used in the program, so we can remove it.
- The `#define yes cout << "YES" << endl` macro is not used in the program, so we can remove it.
- The `#define no cout << "NO" << endl` macro is not used in the program, so we can remove it.
- The `#define pb push_back` macro is not used in the program, so we can remove it.
- The `#define all(v) (v).begin(), (v).end()` macro is not used in the program, so we can remove it.
- The `#define read(a, n) ...` and `#define print(a, n) ...` macros are not used in the program, so we can remove them.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary optimization pragmas
- The `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")` pragma optimizes the code for speed, but it can also increase the memory usage. Since we want to optimize for both running time and memory usage, we can remove this pragma.
- The `#pragma GCC target("sse4")` pragma optimizes the code for a specific instruction set, but it may not be necessary for this program. We can remove this pragma.
- The `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")` pragma optimizes the code for speed, but it can also increase the memory usage. Since we want to optimize for both running time and memory usage, we can remove this pragma.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary debug statement
- The `#define debug(output) cout << #output << "=" << output << endl` macro is not used in the program, so we can remove it.

Step 5: Optimize the loop for calculating the sum
- The loop `for (; t >= 1; t = t / 2)` can be optimized by using a bitwise shift operation instead of division by 2. This can improve the running time of the loop.

Step 6: Use a faster input/output method
- The `RUN` macro is not necessary for the program, so we can remove it.
- We can use `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout` for faster input/output.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  int test = 1;
  while (test--) {
    int n, q;
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &q);
    std::vector<int> value(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%d", &value[i]);
    std::map<int, int> mp;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      mp[value[i]]++;
    }
    while (q--) {
      int b;
      scanf("%d", &b);
      int sum = 0;
      int t = 1 << 31;
      for (; t >= 1; t >>= 1) {
        int l = std::min(mp[t], b / t);
        sum += l;
        b -= l * t;
      }
      if (b == 0)
        printf("%d\n", sum);
      else
        printf("-1\n");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
