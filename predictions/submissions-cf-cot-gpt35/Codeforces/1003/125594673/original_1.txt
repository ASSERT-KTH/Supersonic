The given program calculates the number of elements in an array that can be used to sum up to a given value. The program uses a map to store the frequency of each element in the array and then performs a binary search for each query to find the number of elements that can be used to sum up to the given value.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives: The `#pragma` directives for optimizing the code are not necessary as we are not using any specific compiler optimizations. We can remove these directives.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros `yes` and `no` are not used in the program, so we can remove them.

3. Use `vector` instead of `map`: Instead of using a `map` to store the frequency of each element, we can use a `vector` of size `2^31` to store the frequency directly. This will reduce the memory usage and also improve the performance.

4. Use a pre-calculated array for powers of 2: Instead of using the `pow` function to calculate powers of 2, we can pre-calculate an array of powers of 2 up to `2^31`. This will avoid the overhead of calling the `pow` function for each query.

5. Replace the binary search with a linear search: Instead of performing a binary search for each query, we can iterate over the powers of 2 in descending order and check if the current power of 2 can be used to sum up to the given value. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the performance.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int test = 1;
    while (test--) {
        int n, q;
        cin >> n >> q;
        vector<int> value(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            cin >> value[i];
        
        vector<int> freq(32, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            freq[value[i]]++;
        }
        
        vector<int> powers(32);
        powers[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < 32; i++) {
            powers[i] = powers[i-1] * 2;
        }
        
        while (q--) {
            int b;
            cin >> b;
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
                int l = min(freq[powers[i]], b / powers[i]);
                sum += l;
                b -= l * powers[i];
            }
            if (b == 0)
                cout << sum << "\n";
            else
                cout << -1 << "\n";
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces memory usage by using a vector instead of a map and pre-calculating the powers of 2. It also improves the running time by replacing the binary search with a linear search.
