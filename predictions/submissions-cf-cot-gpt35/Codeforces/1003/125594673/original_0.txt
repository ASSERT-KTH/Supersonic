Step 1: Remove unnecessary optimization directives
The program includes unnecessary optimization directives, such as `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")` and `#pragma GCC target("sse4")`. These directives are not required for the optimization process.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
The program includes unnecessary macros, such as `#define int long long` and `#define mod 1000000007`. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 3: Optimize the input loop
The program uses a `for` loop to read input values into the `value` vector. This loop can be optimized by using the `read` macro. However, the `read` macro is implemented incorrectly, as it does not set the value of the last element in the array. This can be fixed by changing the loop condition from `i < n` to `i <= n`.

Step 4: Optimize the output loop
The program uses a `for` loop to print the values in the `a` array. This loop can be optimized by using the `print` macro. However, the `print` macro is implemented incorrectly, as it starts the loop from index 1 instead of index 0. This can be fixed by changing the loop condition from `i < n` to `i <= n`.

Step 5: Optimize the calculation of the sum
The program calculates the sum by iterating over powers of 2 and checking how many times each power can be used to reduce the remaining value. This can be optimized by using bitwise operations instead of the `pow` function. Additionally, the program unnecessarily calculates the maximum power of 2 (2^31) on each iteration of the `while` loop. This can be optimized by calculating this value only once before the loop.

Step 6: Remove unnecessary code
The program includes unnecessary code, such as unused `yes` and `no` macros, as well as the `debug` macro. These can be removed to improve code readability.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int test = 1;
    while (test--) {
        int n, q;
        cin >> n >> q;
        vector<int> value(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            cin >> value[i];
        
        map<int, int> mp;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            mp[value[i]]++;
        }
        
        while (q--) {
            int b;
            cin >> b;
            int sum = 0;
            int t = (1 << 31);
            for (; t >= 1; t >>= 1) {
                int l = min(mp[t], b / t);
                sum += l;
                b -= (l * t);
            }
            if (b == 0)
                cout << sum << "\n";
            else
                cout << -1 << "\n";
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
