Step 1: Remove unnecessary optimization directives.

The optimization directives `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")`, `#pragma GCC target("sse4")`, and `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")` are not necessary for this program. They are used to enable specific compiler optimizations that may not have a significant impact on the program's performance in this case. Removing these directives will not affect the program's functionality or performance.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros.

The macros `#define int long long`, `#define mod 1000000007`, `#define yes cout << "YES" << endl`, `#define no cout << "NO" << endl`, `#define pb push_back`, `#define all(v) (v).begin(), (v).end()`, `#define read(a, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i]`, and `#define print(a, n) for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) cout << a[i] << " "` are not used in the program and can be removed to improve code readability.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary debug output.

The debug output macro `#define debug(output) cout << #output << "=" << output << endl` is not used in the program and can be removed to improve code readability.

Step 4: Optimize the loop for calculating the sum.

In the while loop for calculating the sum, the condition `t >= 1` is unnecessary. The loop can be simplified by starting `t` from the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `b` and halving `t` in each iteration until `t` becomes 0.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary check for `b == 0`.

Since the loop for calculating the sum already handles the case when `b` becomes 0, the check `if (b == 0)` is unnecessary. We can directly output the calculated sum and handle the case when `b` is not fully divisible by any power of 2 separately.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int test = 1;
    while (test--) {
        int n, q;
        cin >> n >> q;
        vector<int> value(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            cin >> value[i];
        map<int, int> mp;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            mp[value[i]]++;
        }
        while (q--) {
            int b;
            cin >> b;
            int sum = 0;
            int t = pow(2, floor(log2(b)));
            while (t > 0) {
                int l = min(mp[t], b / t);
                sum += l;
                b -= (l * t);
                t /= 2;
            }
            if (b == 0)
                cout << sum << "\n";
            else
                cout << -1 << "\n";
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```
