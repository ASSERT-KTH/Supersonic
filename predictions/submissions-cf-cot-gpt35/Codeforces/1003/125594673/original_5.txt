Step 1: Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives
The `#pragma GCC optimize` directives are unnecessary and can be removed.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
The macros `yes` and `no` are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 3: Optimize input/output
The `RUN` macro is used to optimize input/output, but it is not necessary for this program. We can remove it.

Step 4: Optimize loop variables
The loop variables in the `print` and `read` macros start from 1 instead of 0. We can change them to start from 0.

Step 5: Optimize vector initialization
The vector `value` is initialized with a size of `n + 1`, but the loop to read values only goes up to `n`. We can change the initialization to `vector<int> value(n)`.

Step 6: Optimize map initialization
The map `mp` is initialized with a size of `n`, but it can be initialized without a size.

Step 7: Optimize power calculation
The calculation of `pow(2, 31)` can be replaced with the constant `1 << 31`.

Step 8: Optimize loop termination condition
The loop termination condition `t >= 1` can be changed to `t > 0` for better readability.

Step 9: Optimize loop variable update
The loop variable `t` is divided by 2 in each iteration. We can optimize this by using a bit shift operation `t >>= 1`.

Step 10: Optimize loop variable initialization
The loop variable `sum` is initialized to 0 in each iteration of the while loop. We can move the initialization outside the loop.

Step 11: Optimize output
Instead of using `cout` multiple times, we can store the results in a vector and print them at once after the while loop.

The optimized program is shown below:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int test = 1;
  
  while (test--) {
    int n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;
    vector<int> value(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> value[i];
    map<int, int> mp;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      mp[value[i]]++;
    }
    vector<int> results;
    while (q--) {
      int b;
      cin >> b;
      int sum = 0;
      int t = 1 << 31;
      for (; t > 0; t >>= 1) {
        int l = min(mp[t], b / t);
        sum += l;
        b = b - (l * t);
      }
      if (b == 0)
        results.push_back(sum);
      else
        results.push_back(-1);
    }
    for (int result : results) {
      cout << result << "\n";
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
