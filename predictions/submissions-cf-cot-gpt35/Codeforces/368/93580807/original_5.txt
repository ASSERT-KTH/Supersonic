The given program reads an integer n, followed by an integer m. It then reads n integers into a vector, and for each of the m queries, it reads an integer q and outputs v[q-1].

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line, as it includes a large number of unnecessary header files.
2. Change the function `read` to take the vector by reference to avoid unnecessary copying.
3. Avoid using the `set` container and instead use a `vector<bool>` to keep track of the encountered values.
4. Remove the unnecessary `cont` variable and use the `size()` function of the `set` (or `vector<bool>`) to get the count.
5. Avoid using the `endl` output manipulator and use a newline character instead.
6. Remove the unnecessary `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`, `cin.tie(NULL)`, and `cout.tie(NULL)` lines as they are not needed in this program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void read(vector<int>& v) {
  for (auto& x : v)
    cin >> x;
}

void solve(int n, int m) {
  vector<int> v(n);
  read(v);

  vector<bool> encountered(1000001, false);
  int count = 0;
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (!encountered[v[i]]) {
      encountered[v[i]] = true;
      count++;
    }
    v[i] = count;
  }

  int q;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> q;
    cout << v[q - 1] << '\n';
  }
}

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  solve(n, m);
}
```

This optimized program avoids the unnecessary overhead of the `set` container and uses a `vector<bool>` instead, which can save memory and improve performance. It also removes unnecessary code and uses more efficient techniques for counting and output.
