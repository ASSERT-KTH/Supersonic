The given program calculates the probability of winning a game based on the initial conditions of the game. The program uses recursion and dynamic programming to solve the problem.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a lot of unnecessary standard library headers. We can replace it with the necessary headers such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros such as `present`, `cpresent`, and `tr` which are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Use `const` for constant variables: The variables `eps` and `dp` are not modified in the program. We can declare them as `const` to indicate that they are constant variables.

4. Use integer arithmetic instead of double: The program uses `double` for some variables and calculations. Since the problem statement mentions that the input values are integers, we can convert the input values to integers and use integer arithmetic instead of double arithmetic. This will improve both the running time and memory usage.

5. Use a 2D array instead of a vector for dp table: The program uses a vector of vectors to store the dp table. Since the size of the dp table is fixed and known at compile-time, we can use a 2D array instead. This will improve the memory usage and access time.

6. Optimize the recursion: The recursion in the `getAns` function can be optimized by memoization. We can store the results of previously computed subproblems in the dp table and reuse them instead of recomputing. This will avoid redundant computations and improve the running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <iomanip>

const int MAX_N = 1005;
const double EPS = 1e-14;

int nc, nm, nv;
int mx, mc;
double dp[MAX_N][MAX_N];

double getAns(int cntC, int cntM, int c, int m, int p, int v) {
    if (c <= 0 && m <= 0) {
        return cntC + cntM + 1;
    }
    if (dp[cntC][cntM] != -1) {
        return dp[cntC][cntM];
    }
    double temp = 0;
    if (c > 0 && m > 0) {
        temp += c * getAns(cntC + 1, cntM, c - v, m + std::min(c / 2, v / 2),
                           p + std::min(c / 2, v / 2), v) +
                m * getAns(cntC, cntM + 1, c + std::min(m / 2, v / 2), m - v,
                           p + std::min(m / 2, v / 2), v) +
                (cntC + cntM + 1) * p;
    } else if (c > 0) {
        temp += c * getAns(cntC + 1, cntM, c - v, m, p + std::min(c, v), v) +
                (cntC + cntM + 1) * p;
    } else {
        temp += m * getAns(cntC, cntM + 1, c, m - v, p + std::min(m, v), v) +
                (cntC + cntM + 1) * p;
    }
    return dp[cntC][cntM] = temp;
}

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);
    std::cout.tie(NULL);

    int t;
    std::cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        double c, m, p, v;
        std::cin >> c >> m >> p >> v;
        nc = static_cast<int>(c * 10000);
        nm = static_cast<int>(m * 10000);
        nv = static_cast<int>(v * 10000);
        mx = (nc + nv - 1) / nv + (nc + nm + nv - 1) / nv + 1;
        mc = (nc + nm + nv - 1) / nv;
        for (int i = 0; i <= mc; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= mc; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = -1;
            }
        }
        std::cout << std::setprecision(15) << getAns(0, 0, nc, nm, static_cast<int>(p * 10000), nv) << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. Removed unnecessary includes and macros.
2. Changed `lli` to `int` for the variables `nc`, `nm`, `nv`, `mx`, and `mc`.
3. Changed `double` to `int` for the variables `c`, `m`, `p`, and `v` in the `getAns` function.
4. Replaced `dp` vector with a 2D array.
5. Added memoization to the `getAns` function by using the dp table.
6. Converted the input values `c`, `m`, `p`, and `v` to integer values by multiplying them by 10000.
7. Changed the precision of the output using `std::setprecision`.
