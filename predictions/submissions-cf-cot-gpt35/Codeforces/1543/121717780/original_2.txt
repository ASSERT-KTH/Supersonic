The given program calculates and prints the value of a certain function for a given number of test cases. The main function calls the getAns function for each test case and prints the result.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can increase compilation time and may include unnecessary functionality. We can remove this include and only include the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for container operations (`present`, `cpresent`, `all`, `tr`). These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Use a smaller data type for loop variables: The loop variables `i` and `j` in the nested `for` loop in the main function are of type `int`, but they are only used to access the `dp` array, which has a size of 1005. We can change the loop variables to be of type `size_t` to save memory.

4. Use a smaller data type for array size: The `dp` array has a size of 1005x1005, but the loop variables in the nested `for` loop only go up to 1000. We can change the size of the `dp` array to be 1001x1001 to save memory.

5. Use a smaller data type for intermediate calculations: The `nc`, `nm`, `nv`, `mx`, and `mc` variables are of type `lli` (long long int), but they are only used for calculations involving multiplication and division. We can change their type to `int` to save memory.

6. Use a smaller precision for floating point calculations: The `eps` variable is used as a threshold for floating point comparisons. The current value of `1e-14` may be unnecessarily high precision. We can reduce it to a smaller value, such as `1e-9`, to save memory.

7. Remove unnecessary type casting: The return statement in the `getAns` function casts the result to `double`. Since the function already returns a `double`, the type casting is unnecessary and can be removed.

Here is the optimized program with the above modifications:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

double getAns(int cntC, int cntM, double c, double m, double p, double v) {
  double eps = 1e-9;
  if (c <= eps && m <= eps) {
    return cntC + cntM + 1;
  }
  double temp = 0;
  if (c > eps && m > eps) {
    temp += c * getAns(cntC + 1, cntM, c - v, m + min(c / 2, v / 2), p + min(c / 2, v / 2), v)
            + m * getAns(cntC, cntM + 1, c + min(m / 2, v / 2), m - v, p + min(m / 2, v / 2), v)
            + (cntC + cntM + 1) * p;
  } else if (c > eps) {
    temp += c * getAns(cntC + 1, cntM, c - v, m, p + min(c, v), v)
            + (cntC + cntM + 1) * p;
  } else {
    temp += m * getAns(cntC, cntM + 1, c, m - v, p + min(m, v), v)
            + (cntC + cntM + 1) * p;
  }
  return temp;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    double c, m, p, v;
    cin >> c >> m >> p >> v;

    int nc = c * 10000;
    int nm = m * 10000;
    int nv = v * 10000;
    int mx = (nc + nv - 1) / nv + (nc + nm + nv - 1) / nv + 1;
    int mc = (nc + nm + nv - 1) / nv;

    vector<vector<double>> dp(1001, vector<double>(1001, -1));

    cout << fixed << setprecision(15) << getAns(0, 0, c, m, p, v) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
