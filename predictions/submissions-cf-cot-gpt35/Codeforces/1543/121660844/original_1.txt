To optimize the given C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes `bits/stdc++.h` which is not a standard header file and can be replaced with the required standard header files like `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, and `<utility>`.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros like `ll`, `fast`, `eb`, `pb`, `ff`, `ss`, and `gcd` which are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Use `constexpr` instead of `const` for `mod`: The constant `mod` is used in the `pow` function for modulo operations. We can use `constexpr` instead of `const` to indicate that `mod` is a compile-time constant.

4. Optimize the `pow` function: The `pow` function is used to calculate the power of a number with modulo. We can optimize this function by using exponentiation by squaring algorithm. This algorithm reduces the number of multiplications and modulo operations.

5. Optimize the `prime` function: The `prime` function is used to calculate the number of prime factors of a given number. We can optimize this function by using a more efficient algorithm like trial division.

6. Avoid unnecessary swaps: The program swaps the values of `a` and `b` if `b` is greater than `a`. However, this swap is not necessary as we only need to calculate the difference between `a` and `b`, which can be done without swapping.

7. Simplify the calculation of modulo: The program calculates `a % (a - b)` and `a - b - a % (a - b)` multiple times. We can simplify these calculations by storing the result of `a - b` in a variable and using it in the subsequent calculations.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

constexpr int mod = 1e9 + 7;

int pow(int x, int n) {
  int result = 1;
  while (n > 0) {
    if (n % 2 == 1) {
      result = (1LL * result * x) % mod;
    }
    x = (1LL * x * x) % mod;
    n >>= 1;
  }
  return result;
}

int prime(int x) {
  int res = 0;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= x; i++) {
    while (x % i == 0) {
      x /= i;
      res++;
    }
  }
  if (x > 1)
    res++;
  return res;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);

  int N;
  cin >> N;
  while (N--) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    if (a == 0 || b == 0) {
      cout << max(a, b) << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    if (a == b && a != 0) {
      cout << 0 << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    int diff = abs(a - b);
    cout << diff << ' ' << min(a % diff, diff - a % diff) << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have improved the running time and memory usage of the program. The `pow` function now uses exponentiation by squaring algorithm and the `prime` function uses trial division algorithm for efficient computation.
