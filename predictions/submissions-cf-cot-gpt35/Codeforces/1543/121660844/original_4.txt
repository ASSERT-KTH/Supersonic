The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not recommended as it includes a lot of unnecessary standard library headers. We can remove it and include only the required headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines some macros like `ll`, `fast`, `eb`, `pb`, `ff`, `ss`, and `gcd` which are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Optimize the `pow` function: The `pow` function is used to calculate the power of a number. We can optimize it by using the exponentiation by squaring algorithm, which reduces the number of multiplications and modulo operations.

4. Optimize the `prime` function: The `prime` function is used to calculate the number of prime factors of a given number. We can optimize it by using a more efficient algorithm like trial division.

5. Optimize the main loop: The main loop reads input values and performs some calculations. We can optimize it by avoiding unnecessary calculations and using more efficient operations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int mod = 1e9 + 7;

int pow(ll x, ll n) {
  ll result = 1;
  while (n != 0) {
    if ((n & 1) == 1) {
      result = (result * x) % mod;
    }
    x = (x * x) % mod;
    n >>= 1;
  }
  return result;
}

int prime(int x) {
  int res = 0;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= x; i++) {
    while (x % i == 0) {
      x /= i;
      res++;
    }
  }
  if (x > 1)
    res++;
  return res;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);

  int N;
  cin >> N;
  while (N--) {
    ll a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    if (a == 0 || b == 0) {
      cout << max(a, b) << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    if (a == b && a != 0) {
      cout << 0 << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    if (b > a)
      swap(a, b);
    cout << a - b << ' ' << min(a % (a - b), a - b - a % (a - b)) << '\n';
  }
}
```

By removing unnecessary header file inclusion, macros, and optimizing the functions and main loop, we have simplified and optimized the program for better running time and memory usage.
