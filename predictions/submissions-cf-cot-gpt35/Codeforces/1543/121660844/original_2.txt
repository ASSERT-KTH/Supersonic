To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not recommended because it includes a large number of header files, many of which are unnecessary for this program. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Replace `ll` with `int` where possible: The program uses the `ll` type for long long integers, but it is not necessary for this program. We can replace `ll` with `int` to save memory.

4. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines two functions, `pow` and `prime`, but neither of them is called. We can remove these functions to simplify the code.

5. Optimize the loop condition: The loop in the `prime` function iterates until `i * i <= x`, but we can optimize it to `i <= sqrt(x)`. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

6. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment: The loop in the `prime` function uses post-increment (`res++`) inside the loop. We can use pre-increment (`++res`) instead, which is generally more efficient.

7. Optimize the calculation of `min(a % (a - b), a - b - a % (a - b))`: The program calculates this expression twice. We can optimize it by assigning it to a variable and using the variable in the output statement.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);

  int N;
  cin >> N;
  
  while (N--) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    
    if (a == 0 || b == 0) {
      cout << max(a, b) << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    
    if (a == b && a != 0) {
      cout << 0 << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    
    if (b > a)
      swap(a, b);
    
    int diff = a - b;
    int rem = a % diff;
    cout << diff << ' ' << min(rem, diff - rem) << '\n';
  }
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
