To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines macros `eb`, `pb`, `ff`, and `ss` which are not used. We can remove them.

3. Remove unused function: The program defines a `gcd` function using the `__gcd` built-in function, but it is not used. We can remove it.

4. Optimize the `pow` function: The `pow` function uses the binary exponentiation algorithm to calculate `x` raised to the power `n`. However, it is not used in the program. We can remove it.

5. Optimize the `prime` function: The `prime` function calculates the number of prime factors of a given number `x`. However, it is not used in the program. We can remove it.

6. Optimize the main loop: The main loop reads `N` from input and performs `N` iterations. For each iteration, it reads `a` and `b` and performs some calculations. We can optimize this loop by avoiding unnecessary calculations and improving the logic.

7. Optimize the output: The program outputs the results using `cout` and `'\n'` for each iteration. We can optimize the output by using `printf` instead of `cout` and `'\n'`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  
  while (N--) {
    long long a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    
    if (a == 0 || b == 0) {
      printf("%lld 0\n", max(a, b));
      continue;
    }
    
    if (a == b && a != 0) {
      printf("0 0\n");
      continue;
    }
    
    if (b > a)
      swap(a, b);
    
    printf("%lld %lld\n", a - b, min(a % (a - b), a - b - a % (a - b)));
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The original program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers, which in this case are `<iostream>`.

2. Removed unused macros: The original program defines macros `eb`, `pb`, `ff`, and `ss` but they are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Removed unused function: The original program defines a `gcd` function but it is not used. We can remove it to reduce unnecessary code.

4. Optimized `pow` function: The `pow` function is not used in the program, so we can remove it to reduce unnecessary code.

5. Optimized `prime` function: The `prime` function is not used in the program, so we can remove it to reduce unnecessary code.

6. Optimized main loop: The main loop reads `N` from input and performs `N` iterations. For each iteration, it reads `a` and `b` and performs some calculations. We can optimize this loop by avoiding unnecessary calculations and improving the logic.

7. Optimized the output: The original program uses `cout` and `'\n'` for output. We can optimize the output by using `printf` instead of `cout` and `'\n'` to improve the performance.

These optimizations should result in improved running time and reduced memory usage.
