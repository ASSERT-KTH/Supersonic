This program calculates and prints the difference and the remainder of two numbers for multiple test cases. The program uses a loop to read the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads two numbers `a` and `b` and performs some calculations to get the desired output.

To optimize this program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines some macros (`ll`, `fast`, `eb`, `pb`, `ff`, `ss`, `gcd`, `mod`) that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary function: The program defines a `pow` function, but it is not used. We can remove this function to reduce the code complexity.

4. Improve the prime function: The `prime` function checks if a number is prime by counting the number of prime factors. We can optimize this function by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, to calculate the prime factors.

5. Simplify the logic for printing the output: The program uses multiple `if` statements to determine the output values. We can simplify this logic to make it more readable.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);

  int N;
  cin >> N;

  while (N--) {
    long long a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;

    if (a == 0 || b == 0) {
      cout << max(a, b) << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }

    if (a == b) {
      cout << 0 << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }

    if (b > a)
      swap(a, b);

    long long diff = a - b;
    long long remainder = min(a % diff, diff - a % diff);

    cout << diff << ' ' << remainder << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program removes unnecessary includes, macros, and functions. It also simplifies the logic for printing the output. Overall, these changes should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
