Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros.

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a non-standard header file that includes all standard library headers. It is not necessary and can be replaced with the specific headers that are actually used in the program.

The macros `vi`, `pb`, `ppb`, `all(x)`, `rall(x)`, `fr`, `sc`, `rep`, and `repb` are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 2: Optimize the input and output operations.

The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations are relatively slower compared to the C-style `scanf` and `printf` functions. Therefore, we can replace `cin` with `scanf` and `cout` with `printf` to improve the performance.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary variables and calculations.

The variable `avg` is declared but not used in the program. It can be safely removed.

The calculation of the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the `gcd` function is not used in the program. The function and its calls can be removed.

Step 4: Optimize the loop variables.

The loop variables `i` in the `rep` and `repb` loops are declared as `int` but they are only used for indexing the array. Changing them to `size_t` can improve the performance slightly.

Step 5: Simplify the conditional statements.

The condition `if (!x)` is redundant because it is the opposite of the previous condition `if (x)`. We can remove the `else if (!x)` condition and move its code block to the `else` block.

Now, let's generate the optimized program:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n, sum = 0;
  bool x = false;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int a[n];
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    sum += a[i];
  }
  if (sum % n == 0)
    x = true;
  if (sum < n) {
    printf("%d\n", sum * (n - sum));
  } else if (x) {
    printf("0\n");
  } else {
    int x = sum % n;
    printf("%d\n", x * (n - x));
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  #ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
  #endif
  int t = 1;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```
