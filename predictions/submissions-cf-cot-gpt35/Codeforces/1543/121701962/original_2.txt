Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and is generally not recommended to use. It is better to include only the necessary standard headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
- The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. These macros can be safely removed.

Step 3: Optimize the loop for calculating the sum
- The program uses a loop to calculate the sum of the array elements. Instead of using a loop, we can use the `accumulate` function from the `<numeric>` header to calculate the sum in a more concise way.

Step 4: Optimize the conditions for calculating the result
- The program has multiple conditions to calculate the result based on the sum. We can simplify the conditions to make the code more readable and potentially optimize the execution.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary variable declaration
- The program declares an unnecessary variable `avg`. Since it is not used, we can remove it.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
using namespace std;

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    int sum = accumulate(a.begin(), a.end(), 0);
    if (sum % n == 0) {
        cout << 0 << endl;
    } else if (sum < n) {
        cout << sum * (n - sum) << endl;
    } else {
        int x = sum % n;
        cout << x * (n - x) << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```
