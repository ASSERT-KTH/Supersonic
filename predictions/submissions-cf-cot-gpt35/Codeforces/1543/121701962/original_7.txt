The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of header files, which can slow down the compilation process. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for commonly used constructs like `vector`, `push_back`, `pop_back`, etc. These macros add unnecessary complexity to the code. We can remove these macros and use the original constructs directly.

3. Avoid unnecessary variable assignments and calculations: The program unnecessarily assigns a value of `false` to the variable `x` and performs unnecessary calculations to determine if `x` is true or false. We can simplify this logic.

4. Avoid using variable shadowing: The program declares a variable `x` inside the `solve` function, which shadows the variable `x` declared outside the function. This can lead to confusion and bugs. We can rename the variable inside the function to avoid shadowing.

5. Avoid dynamic array allocation: The program declares an array `a` with a dynamic size `n`. Dynamic arrays can be inefficient in terms of memory usage. We can use a `vector` instead, which dynamically resizes itself.

6. Simplify the calculation of the result: The program calculates the result using multiple conditions and calculations. We can simplify this logic to directly calculate the result in a single step.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    int sum = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
        sum += a[i];
    }

    int result = 0;
    if (sum % n == 0) {
        result = 0;
    } else {
        int x = sum % n;
        result = x * (n - x);
    }

    cout << result << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    cout.tie(nullptr);
    
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes unnecessary includes, macros, variable assignments, and calculations. It also replaces the dynamic array with a `vector` and simplifies the logic to calculate the result.
