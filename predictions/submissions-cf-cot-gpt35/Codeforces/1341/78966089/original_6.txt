The given program can be optimized by making the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage. We can remove this include and include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: The program currently uses the `using namespace std;` statement, which brings all symbols from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and make the code harder to understand. It is better to explicitly qualify the used symbols with the `std::` prefix.

3. Avoid using `typedef`: The program uses `typedef` to define the type `ll` as `long long`. Instead of using `typedef`, we can directly use the `long long` type.

4. Use pre-increment operator: In the for loop where `sum` is calculated, the post-increment operator `++` is used. However, the pre-increment operator `++` is more efficient as it does not require a temporary copy of the variable. We can use the pre-increment operator instead.

5. Remove unnecessary variable initialization: The variable `left` is initialized to 1, but it is immediately overwritten in the for loop. We can remove this unnecessary initialization.

6. Optimize the loop condition: In the for loop that calculates the maximum sum, the condition `l <= v.size() - k + 1` is used. However, this condition can be simplified to `l < v.size() - k + 1` without affecting the correctness of the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k;
    std::cin >> n >> k;
    std::vector<int> v(n), t(n, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> v[i];
    }
    for (int f = 1; f < n - 1; f++) {
      if (v[f] > v[f - 1] && v[f] > v[f + 1]) {
        t[f] = 1;
      }
    }
    int sum = 0;
    for (int o = 0; o < n; o++) {
      sum += t[o];
      v[o] = sum;
    }
    int ans = 0, left;
    for (int l = 0; l < n - k + 1; l++) {
      if (ans < v[l + k - 2] - v[l]) {
        ans = v[l + k - 2] - v[l];
        left = l + 1;
      }
    }
    std::cout << ans + 1 << " " << left << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
