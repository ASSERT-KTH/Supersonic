Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes.

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard header and includes a lot of unnecessary libraries. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Avoid using `using namespace std;`.

Using the `using namespace std;` statement brings all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can cause naming conflicts. It's better to use the `std::` prefix for specific names, such as `std::cin` and `std::cout`.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary vector resizing.

The program initializes the vector `t` with size `n` and then resizes it to 0 in the next line. We can remove the resizing step and directly initialize `t` as an empty vector.

Step 4: Optimize the loop conditions.

The loop condition `f < v.size() - 1` can be simplified to `f < v.size() - 1` since the loop variable `f` is of type `ll` (long long) and `v.size()` returns a value of type `ll`.

The loop condition `o < v.size()` can be simplified to `o < v.size()` for the same reason.

The loop condition `l <= v.size() - k + 1` can be simplified to `l < v.size() - k + 1` since the variable `l` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

Step 5: Optimize the inner loop.

The inner loop `for (ll l = 0; l <= v.size() - k + 1; l++)` can be optimized by keeping track of the maximum value and its index instead of updating the `left` variable in each iteration. This reduces the number of comparisons and assignments.

Step 6: Remove unnecessary variable initialization.

The variable `left` is initialized with the value 1, but it is immediately updated in the loop. We can remove the initialization step.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll t;
  std::cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    ll j, k, n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::cin >> k;
    
    std::vector<ll> v, t;
    t.reserve(n);
    
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> j;
      v.push_back(j);
      t.push_back(0);
    }
    
    for (ll f = 1; f < v.size() - 1; f++) {
      if ((v[f] > v[f - 1]) && (v[f] > v[f + 1]))
        t[f] = 1;
    }
    
    ll sum = 0;
    for (ll o = 0; o < v.size(); o++) {
      sum = sum + t[o];
      v[o] = sum;
    }
    
    ll ans = 0;
    ll max_diff = v[k - 2] - v[0];
    ll left = 0;
    
    for (ll l = 1; l <= v.size() - k; l++) {
      ll diff = v[l + k - 2] - v[l];
      if (diff > max_diff) {
        max_diff = diff;
        left = l;
      }
    }
    
    std::cout << max_diff + 1 << " ";
    std::cout << left + 1 << " \n";
  }
}
```
