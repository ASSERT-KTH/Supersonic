Step 1: Reduce unnecessary includes
The program currently includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary and can increase compile time and memory usage. We can replace it with the specific headers that are actually needed.

Step 2: Optimize loops
There are two loops in the program that can be optimized. 

In the first loop, instead of iterating from 1 to `v.size() - 1`, we can start from 1 and end at `v.size() - 2`. This is because the condition `(v[f] > v[f - 1]) && (v[f] > v[f + 1])` checks the element at index `f`, as well as its neighboring elements at indices `f - 1` and `f + 1`. So there is no need to check the last element.

In the second loop, we can change the condition from `l <= v.size() - k + 1` to `l < v.size() - k + 1`. This is because the loop should stop when `l` reaches the index `v.size() - k`.

Step 3: Optimize vector initialization
The program initializes a vector `t` with size `n` and all elements set to 0. However, since the program later assigns 1 to some elements of `t`, we can just initialize it with all elements set to 1. This saves the step of assigning 0 to all elements initially.

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary variable assignment
The variable `left` is initially set to 1, but it is immediately overwritten in the loop. We can remove the initial assignment and directly assign `l + 1` to `left` in the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ll j, k, n;
    cin >> n;
    cin >> k;
    vector<ll> v, t(n, 1);
    while (n--) {
      cin >> j;
      v.push_back(j);
    }
    for (ll f = 1; f < v.size() - 1; f++) {
      if ((v[f] > v[f - 1]) && (v[f] > v[f + 1]))
        t[f] = 1;
    }
    ll sum = 0;
    for (ll o = 0; o < v.size(); o++) {
      sum = sum + t[o];
      v[o] = sum;
    }
    ll ans = 0;
    ll left;
    for (ll l = 0; l < v.size() - k + 1; l++) {
      if (ans < v[l + k - 2] - v[l]) {
        ans = v[l + k - 2] - v[l];
        left = l + 1;
      }
    }
    cout << ans + 1 << " ";
    cout << left << "\n";
  }
}
```
