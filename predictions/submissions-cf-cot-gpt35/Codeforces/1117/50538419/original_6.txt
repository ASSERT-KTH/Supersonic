The given program reads an integer `n` and an array `arr` of size `n`. It finds the maximum element in the array, and then counts the number of times the maximum element appears consecutively. Finally, it outputs the maximum count.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and replace it with only the necessary headers, like `iostream`.

2. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` directive and explicitly prefix the standard library calls with `std::`.

3. Instead of using a fixed-size array `arr` of size `M`, we can use a dynamic array or a `std::vector` to save memory.

4. Initialize `mx` to the minimum possible value instead of -1, since the input elements are positive integers.

5. Initialize `cnt` to 1 instead of 0, since we are counting the current maximum element as well.

6. Combine the two loops into a single loop to avoid iterating over the array twice.

7. Move the check for a new maximum element outside the loop and update `mx` only when necessary, to avoid unnecessary comparisons.

Here is the optimized program incorporating these modifications:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::vector<int> arr(n);
  int mx = 0, cnt = 1, ans = 1;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> arr[i];
    if (arr[i] > mx) {
      mx = arr[i];
      cnt = 1;
    } else if (arr[i] == mx) {
      cnt++;
    } else {
      ans = std::max(ans, cnt);
      cnt = 1;
    }
  }

  std::cout << std::max(ans, cnt) << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have reduced the memory usage by using a dynamic array or `std::vector` instead of a fixed-size array. We have also reduced unnecessary comparisons and combined the loops, resulting in improved running time.
