Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can significantly increase the compilation time and memory usage. In this program, only the `iostream` header is needed, so we can remove the unnecessary includes.

2. Use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl`: The `std::endl` manipulator not only inserts a newline character, but it also flushes the output buffer. Flushing the output buffer can be an expensive operation, especially if it is done frequently. In this program, we can replace `std::endl` with `'\n'`, which only inserts a newline character without flushing the output buffer.

3. Use a more appropriate data type: The array `arr` is declared as an `int` array with a size of `M`. However, the program only uses `n` elements of the array. Instead of using a fixed-size array, we can use a `std::vector<int>` to dynamically allocate memory for the array based on the input size `n`.

4. Initialize variables with their first usage: The variable `cnt` is used before it is initialized. It is better to initialize it to `0` before the loop starts to avoid undefined behavior.

5. Avoid unnecessary comparisons inside the loop: In the second loop, there is an unnecessary comparison `arr[i] == mx` inside the loop. We can move this comparison outside the loop and only update `cnt` if the condition is true.

6. Optimize the loop conditions: The loops in this program start from `1` and go up to `n`, which means the loop index is `1`-based. It is more idiomatic in C/C++ to use `0`-based indices. We can modify the loop conditions to start from `0` and go up to `n-1`.

7. Avoid redundant variable assignments: The variable `ans` is initialized to `1` but it is never updated inside the loop. We can remove the assignment and simply initialize it to `0` to avoid the redundant assignment.

Based on these optimization steps, here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<int> arr(n);
  int mx = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> arr[i];
    mx = max(mx, arr[i]);
  }

  int cnt = 0;
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (arr[i] == mx) {
      cnt++;
    } else {
      ans = max(ans, cnt);
      cnt = 0;
    }
  }

  cout << max(cnt, ans) << '\n';
}
```
