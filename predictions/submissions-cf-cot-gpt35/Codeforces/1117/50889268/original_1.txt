The given program is a solution to a problem that involves finding the minimum number of days required to reach a destination point (x2, y2) starting from an initial point (x1, y1). The movement is restricted to four directions: up, down, left, and right.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not standard and includes a large number of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line since we don't need it for this program.

2. Remove unused variables: The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are declared but not used in the program. We can remove these variables to improve readability.

3. Use `const` instead of `#define`: Instead of using the `#define` macro to define the constant `ll`, we can use a `const` declaration. This is considered a better practice in C++.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations in the `check` function: The `check` function calculates the current position for each day using full periods and the remainder. However, we can optimize this by calculating the current position directly using the modulo operator. This will avoid unnecessary multiplications and additions.

5. Optimize the binary search: The binary search in the `main` function can be optimized by using the lower bound and upper bound as initial values for the search range. This will reduce the number of iterations required for the binary search.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const long long INF = 1e18;

bool check(vector<long long>& x, vector<long long>& y, int n, long long pos) {
  long long current_x = x[pos % n] + (pos / n) * x[n];
  long long current_y = y[pos % n] + (pos / n) * y[n];
  return abs(x[n] - current_x) + abs(y[n] - current_y) <= pos;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  string s;
  cin >> n >> s;
  
  vector<long long> x(n + 1, 0), y(n + 1, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (s[i] == 'U')
      y[i + 1]++;
    if (s[i] == 'D')
      y[i + 1]--;
    if (s[i] == 'L')
      x[i + 1]--;
    if (s[i] == 'R')
      x[i + 1]++;
    x[i + 1] += x[i];
    y[i + 1] += y[i];
  }
  
  long long l = 0, r = INF;
  while (r - l > 1) {
    long long mid = (l + r) / 2;
    if (check(x, y, n, mid)) {
      r = mid;
    } else {
      l = mid;
    }
  }
  
  if (r >= INF) {
    cout << -1;
  } else {
    cout << r;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
