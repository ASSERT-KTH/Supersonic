Step 1: Avoid unnecessary includes
- The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header file and is not recommended to use in production code.
- Remove the unnecessary includes and only include the necessary standard headers.

Step 2: Optimize input/output operations
- Currently, the program reads input using `cin` and writes output using `cout` for each test case.
- This can be optimized by using `scanf` and `printf` functions, which are generally faster for reading and writing integers.

Step 3: Optimize the sorting operation
- The program currently uses the `sort` function to sort the `vec` vector.
- However, since the vector contains pairs of integers, we can optimize the sorting by using a custom comparator.
- The custom comparator can compare the first element of the pair and break ties using the second element.
- This will avoid the need for swapping pairs during the sorting process.

Step 4: Optimize the calculation of the total sum
- The program currently calculates the total sum by iterating over the `vec` vector and adding up the second elements of each pair.
- This can be optimized by calculating the total sum during the input loop itself.

Step 5: Optimize the calculation of the answer
- The program currently calculates the answer by iterating over the `vec` vector and performing calculations for each unique first element.
- This can be optimized by calculating the answer during the input loop itself.
- We can keep track of the minimum value of `temp` and update it whenever we encounter a new unique first element.

Step 6: Optimize the memory usage
- The program currently uses a vector of pairs to store the input data.
- However, we only need to store the second element of each pair in the `timeSum` map.
- We can modify the input loop to directly update the `timeSum` map and eliminate the need for the vector.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int T;
  scanf("%d", &T);
  while (T--) {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    map<int, int> timeSum;
    int total = 0;
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int a;
      scanf("%d", &a);
      total += a;
      timeSum[a] = 0;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int b;
      scanf("%d", &b);
      timeSum[vec[i].first] += b;
    }
    for (auto it = timeSum.begin(); it != timeSum.end(); ++it) {
      int temp = it->first + max(0, total - it->second - it->first);
      if (ans == 0 || temp < ans) {
        ans = temp;
      }
      total -= it->second;
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
  }
}
```
