Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The given program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary. We can remove this include statement and only include the necessary headers.

Step 2: Optimize vector initialization

In the original program, the vector `vec` is initialized with default pairs `{a, 0}` and then modified in the second loop. Instead of initializing with default pairs and then modifying, we can directly initialize the vector with the correct pairs in a single loop.

Step 3: Optimize total calculation

In the original program, the variable `total` is calculated by iterating over the vector `vec` and summing the second element of each pair. We can optimize this by calculating `total` while initializing the vector in the first loop.

Step 4: Optimize timeSum calculation

In the original program, the map `timeSum` is populated by iterating over the vector `vec` and updating the value for each key. We can optimize this by using the `unordered_map` instead of `map`. This will give us constant time complexity for insertion and lookup.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary loop

In the original program, there is an unnecessary loop to calculate the total sum of the second elements of the vector `vec`. We can remove this loop by subtracting the previous time sum from the total in the last loop.

Step 6: Optimize ans calculation

In the original program, the variable `ans` is calculated by iterating over the vector `vec` and calculating a temporary value. We can optimize this by calculating `ans` in the same loop where we calculate `temp`.

Step 7: Optimize total calculation in the last loop

In the original program, the variable `total` is updated in each iteration of the last loop by subtracting the time sum from `vec[i].first`. We can optimize this by subtracting the current time sum from `total` before the loop starts.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  
  while (T--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    vector<pair<int, int>> vec(n);
    unordered_map<int, int> timeSum;
    int total = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int a;
      cin >> a;
      vec[i] = {a, 0};
      total += a;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int b;
      cin >> b;
      vec[i].second = b;
      timeSum[vec[i].first] += b;
    }
    
    sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
    
    int ans = total;
    total -= timeSum[vec[0].first];
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (i > 0 && vec[i].first == vec[i - 1].first)
        continue;
      
      int temp = vec[i].first + max(0LL, (total - timeSum[vec[i].first] - vec[i].first));
      ans = min(ans, temp);
      total -= timeSum[vec[i].first];
    }
    
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
