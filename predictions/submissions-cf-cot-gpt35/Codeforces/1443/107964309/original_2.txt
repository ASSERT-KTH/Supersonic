Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is not necessary and can be removed. This include statement is not part of the C++ standard library and can lead to longer compile times.

Step 2: Optimize input/output operations
The current program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, respectively. These operations are known to be relatively slow. We can improve the performance by using faster input/output functions.

Step 3: Optimize data structures and algorithms
The current program uses a vector of pairs to store the input values, and then sorts the vector. This can be improved by using a multiset instead of a vector. A multiset automatically sorts its elements, so we don't need to explicitly sort the vector. This will improve the overall efficiency of the program.

Step 4: Simplify the calculation of `temp`
The calculation of `temp` can be simplified by using the total sum of the second values in the vector instead of subtracting `timeSum[vec[i].first]` and `vec[i].first` separately.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#define int long long

using namespace std;

signed main() {
  int T;
  scanf("%lld", &T);
  while (T--) {
    int n;
    scanf("%lld", &n);
    multiset<pair<int, int>> s;
    int total = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int a;
      scanf("%lld", &a);
      s.insert({a, 0});
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int b;
      scanf("%lld", &b);
      s.insert({s.find({b, 0})->first, b});
      total += b;
    }
    int ans = total;
    int sum = 0;
    for (const auto& p : s) {
      int cur = p.first;
      ans = min(ans, cur + max(0LL, total - sum - cur));
      sum += p.second;
    }
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
