The given program reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a vector `a` of size `n`. The program then solves the problem based on the input and outputs the result.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary template for the `operator>>` function. We can use `int` instead of `T` as the type for the vector elements, as specified in the problem.
2. Use `const int` instead of `size_t` for the loop counters and indices, as the input size is limited to `10^5` and can be represented by an `int`.
3. Change the `answer` function to take a `bool` parameter by value, as passing by value is faster than passing by reference for a small type like `bool`.
4. Replace the `constexpr` array `s` in the `answer` function with a simple `if` statement to output "NO" or "YES".
5. Change the `solve` function to take the vector `a` by const reference, as it doesn't modify the vector.
6. Remove the unnecessary `return` statement before calling the `answer` function, as it is not needed.
7. Combine the `solve` and `test_case` functions into a single function, as the separation is not necessary.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &input, std::vector<int> &v) {
  for (int &a : v)
    input >> a;
  return input;
}

void answer(bool v) {
  if (v)
    std::cout << "YES\n";
  else
    std::cout << "NO\n";
}

void test_case() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> a(n);
  std::cin >> a;

  for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    if (a[i - 1] < a[i]) {
      int d = a[i] - a[i - 1];
      for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
        if (a[j] < d) {
          answer(false);
          return;
        }
        a[j] -= d;
      }
    }
  }

  answer(true);
}

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0)
    test_case();
  return 0;
}
```
