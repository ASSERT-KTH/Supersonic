Step 1: Remove unnecessary template usage
The program currently uses a template for the `operator>>` function. However, since it is only used for `std::vector<unsigned>`, we can remove the template and make it specific to `unsigned` type.

Step 2: Optimize the loop condition
In the `solve` function, the loop condition `i < n` can be optimized by precalculating `n` and storing it in a separate variable. This will avoid the overhead of calculating the size of the vector in each iteration of the loop.

Step 3: Optimize the second loop condition
In the inner loop of the `solve` function, the loop condition `j < n` can be optimized by using the already calculated value of `n` instead of recalculating it in each iteration.

Step 4: Early return on failure
In the inner loop of the `solve` function, if `a[j]` is less than `d`, we can return `false` immediately instead of continuing the loop and subtracting `d` from `a[j]`. This will save unnecessary iterations when the condition is already false.

Step 5: Minimize function call overhead
In the `answer` function, instead of using a `constexpr` array to store the strings "NO" and "YES", we can directly output the result using a conditional statement. This will avoid the overhead of array indexing and function call.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void solve(std::vector<unsigned>& a) {
  const size_t n = a.size();
  for (size_t i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    if (a[i - 1] < a[i]) {
      const unsigned d = a[i] - a[i - 1];
      for (size_t j = i; j < n; ++j) {
        if (a[j] < d) {
          std::cout << "NO\n";
          return;
        }
        a[j] -= d;
      }
    }
  }
  std::cout << "YES\n";
}

void test_case() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<unsigned> a(n);
  for (unsigned& ai : a) {
    std::cin >> ai;
  }
  solve(a);
}

int main() {
  size_t t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0) {
    test_case();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
