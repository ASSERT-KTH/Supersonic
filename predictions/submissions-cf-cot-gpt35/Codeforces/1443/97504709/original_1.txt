Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
- The program includes the `<iostream>` and `<vector>` libraries, but only uses a few functions from them. We can remove the unnecessary includes to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary template specialization
- The program includes a template specialization for the `operator>>` function, but it is not used in the program. We can remove this specialization to simplify the code.

Step 3: Optimize the solve function
- Currently, the solve function has a time complexity of O(n^2) because of the nested loop. We can optimize this by using a single loop and keeping track of the maximum value encountered so far.
- We can initialize the maximum value `max_val` to the first element of the vector `a`, and then iterate through the vector from the second element. If we encounter a value greater than `max_val`, we update `max_val` to that value. If we encounter a value less than `max_val`, we return false. At the end of the loop, if we haven't returned false, we can return true.

Step 4: Optimize the test_case function
- Currently, the test_case function reads the input values from the standard input and stores them in a vector. We can optimize this by directly processing the input values without storing them in a vector.
- Instead of reading the size of the vector `n` and then reading `n` values into the vector `a`, we can read the first value into a variable `n` and then directly process the next `n` values without storing them.

Step 5: Optimize the main function
- Currently, the main function reads the number of test cases from the standard input and then calls the test_case function that many times. We can optimize this by directly processing the test cases without storing the number of test cases in a variable.
- Instead of reading the number of test cases `t` and then calling the test_case function `t` times, we can use a for loop to directly process each test case without storing the number of test cases in a variable.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void answer(bool v) {
  constexpr const char *s[2] = {"NO", "YES"};
  std::cout << s[v] << '\n';
}

void solve() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;

  unsigned max_val;
  std::cin >> max_val;

  for (size_t i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    unsigned a;
    std::cin >> a;

    if (a < max_val) {
      answer(false);
      return;
    }

    max_val = a;
  }

  answer(true);
}

int main() {
  size_t t;
  std::cin >> t;

  for (size_t i = 0; i < t; ++i) {
    solve();
  }

  return 0;
}
```
