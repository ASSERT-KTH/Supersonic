Step 1: Remove unnecessary template function

The template function `operator>>` is not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 2: Optimize input and output operations

The program currently uses `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input and output operations. These operations are slow and can be optimized by using `scanf` and `printf` instead.

Step 3: Optimize the solve function

The current implementation of the `solve` function has a nested loop that iterates over the vector `a`. This nested loop can be optimized by keeping track of the minimum element in `a` and the maximum difference between adjacent elements. We can then iterate over `a` and check if the difference between the current element and the minimum element is less than the maximum difference. If it is, we can return false immediately. Otherwise, we update the minimum element and continue iterating.

Step 4: Optimize the test_case function

The current implementation of the `test_case` function creates a vector `a` and passes it to the `solve` function. Instead of passing the vector by reference, we can pass it by value to avoid unnecessary memory operations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>

void answer(bool v) {
  constexpr const char *s[2] = {"NO", "YES"};
  printf("%s\n", s[v]);
}

void solve(std::vector<unsigned> a) {
  unsigned min_elem = a[0];
  unsigned max_diff = 0;
  const size_t n = a.size();
  
  for (size_t i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    if (a[i - 1] < a[i]) {
      unsigned d = a[i] - a[i - 1];
      if (d > max_diff) {
        max_diff = d;
        min_elem = a[i];
      }
    }
  }
  
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (a[i] < min_elem) {
      answer(false);
      return;
    }
    a[i] -= min_elem;
  }
  
  answer(true);
}

void test_case() {
  size_t n;
  scanf("%zu", &n);
  
  std::vector<unsigned> a(n);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%u", &a[i]);
  }
  
  solve(std::move(a));
}

int main() {
  size_t t;
  scanf("%zu", &t);
  
  while (t-- > 0)
    test_case();
  
  return 0;
}
```
