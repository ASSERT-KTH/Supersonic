The given program has several areas that can be optimized:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. These headers are not used in the program and can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several unnecessary typedefs, such as `ll`, `pii`, `pll`. These typedefs are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several unnecessary macros, such as `CS`, `vi`, `loop`, `For`, `Rev`, `Rep`, `F`, `S`, `pb`, `em`, `all`, `mems`, `sz`, `mp`, `pf`, `ar`, `endl`, `PI`, `umap`, `gmap`, `F_OR`, `F_OR1`, `F_OR2`, `F_OR3`, `F_OR4`, `GET5`, `F_ORC`, `FOR`, `EACH`. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

4. Remove unnecessary debug and print functions: The program defines several unnecessary debug and print functions, such as `__print`, `_print`, `mdebug`, `debug`, `pff`, `print`. These functions are not used in the program and can be removed.

5. Remove unnecessary hash functions: The program defines several unnecessary hash functions, such as `PH`, `custom_hash`. These hash functions are not used in the program and can be removed.

6. Remove unnecessary template functions: The program defines several unnecessary template functions, such as `to_string`, `offset`, `read`. These template functions are not used in the program and can be removed.

7. Remove unnecessary global constants: The program defines several unnecessary global constants, such as `M`, `INF`, `mxN`. These constants are not used in the program and can be removed.

8. Remove unnecessary struct and class definitions: The program defines unnecessary struct and class definitions, such as `digraph`, `oset`. These definitions are not used in the program and can be removed.

9. Remove unnecessary variable declarations: The program declares unnecessary variables, such as `T`, `_`. These variables are not used in the program and can be removed.

10. Simplify the main function: The main function can be simplified by removing the unnecessary for loop and directly calling the solve function.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized program will look as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n), b(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> b[i];
  }
  vector<vector<int>> adj(n), adj2(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (b[i] != -1) {
      adj[i].push_back(b[i] - 1);
      adj2[b[i] - 1].push_back(i);
    }
  }
  vector<int> d(n), ans1;
  queue<int> qu;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    d[i] = adj2[i].size();
    if (d[i] == 0) {
      qu.push(i);
    }
  }
  vector<int> t;
  while (!qu.empty()) {
    int u = qu.front();
    qu.pop();
    for (int v : adj[u]) {
      d[v]--;
      if (d[v] == 0) {
        qu.push(v);
      }
    }
    t.push_back(u);
  }
  if (t.size() < n) {
    t.clear();
  }
  int ans = 0;
  for (int x : t) {
    if (a[x] > 0) {
      ans1.push_back(x);
      ans += a[x];
      if (b[x] >= 0) {
        a[b[x] - 1] += a[x];
      }
    } else {
      ans += a[x];
      ans1.push_back(x);
    }
  }
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (a[i] <= 0) {
      ans += a[i];
      ans1.push_back(i);
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ans1[i]++;
    cout << ans1[i] << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

By removing the unnecessary code and simplifying the program, the optimized version will have better performance in terms of running time and memory usage.
