The given program can be optimized by reducing the number of function calls and unnecessary variables.

1. Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header includes all the standard C++ libraries, which is not necessary for this program.

2. Remove the `using namespace std;` line. It is a good practice to avoid using `using namespace std;` to prevent potential naming conflicts.

3. Instead of using a loop with `t--`, we can use a more idiomatic approach by using a range-based for loop with `cin >> t` as the loop condition.

4. We can simplify the calculation of `max1` and `max2` by directly assigning the maximum values of `a1` and `b1`, and `a2` and `b2` respectively.

5. Instead of calling `min(a1, b1)` and `min(a2, b2)` in the `if` condition, we can store the minimum values in separate variables before the condition.

6. Replace the `endl` with `"\n"` for faster output, as `endl` flushes the output stream.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int t;
    std::cin >> t;

    while (t--) {
        int a1, b1, a2, b2;
        std::cin >> a1 >> b1 >> a2 >> b2;

        int max1 = std::max(a1, b1);
        int max2 = std::max(a2, b2);
        int min1 = std::min(a1, b1);
        int min2 = std::min(a2, b2);

        if (max1 == max2 && min1 + min2 == max1)
            std::cout << "YES\n";
        else
            std::cout << "NO\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
