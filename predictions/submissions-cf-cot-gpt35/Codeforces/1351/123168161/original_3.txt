The given program reads an integer `t`, and for each test case, it reads four integers `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`. It compares the maximum of `a1` and `b1` with the maximum of `a2` and `b2`. If the maximum values are equal and the sum of the minimum values is equal to the maximum value, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header. Instead, include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`.
2. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl` for printing a newline, as `'\n'` is faster.
3. Instead of calculating the maximum values twice, calculate them only once.
4. Instead of calculating the minimum values twice, calculate them only once.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int a1, b1, a2, b2;
    cin >> a1 >> b1 >> a2 >> b2;

    int max_val = max(max(a1, b1), max(a2, b2));
    int min_val = min(min(a1, b1), min(a2, b2));

    if (max_val == min_val + min(a1, b1) + min(a2, b2))
      cout << "YES\n";
    else
      cout << "NO\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```
