The given program reads an integer `t` as the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, and `b2`. It then checks if the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is equal to the maximum of `a2` and `b2`, and if the sum of the minimums is equal to the maximum. If both conditions are true, it prints "YES", otherwise, it prints "NO".

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of including the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, we can include only the necessary headers. In this case, we need `iostream`, `algorithm`, and `string`.

2. We can avoid using the `using namespace std` directive and qualify the standard library functions with `std::` instead. This helps to avoid potential naming conflicts.

3. We can eliminate the use of temporary variables `max1` and `max2` and directly compare the maximums in the if condition.

4. Instead of calculating the minimums using the `min` function, we can use simple comparisons to find the minimums.

5. We can use `"\n"` instead of `endl` to flush the output buffer, as `"\n"` is sufficient in most cases.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int a1, b1, a2, b2;
    std::cin >> a1 >> b1 >> a2 >> b2;
    if (std::max(a1, b1) == std::max(a2, b2) && (a1 < b1 ? a1 : b1) + (a2 < b2 ? a2 : b2) == std::max(a1, b1))
      std::cout << "YES\n";
    else
      std::cout << "NO\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
