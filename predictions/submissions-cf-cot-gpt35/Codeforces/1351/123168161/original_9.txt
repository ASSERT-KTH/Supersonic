The given program reads the number of test cases 't' and for each test case, it reads four integers 'a1', 'b1', 'a2', 'b2'. It then calculates the maximum of 'a1' and 'b1' as 'max1' and the maximum of 'a2' and 'b2' as 'max2'. It checks if 'max1' is equal to 'max2' and if the sum of the minimum of 'a1' and 'b1' and the minimum of 'a2' and 'b2' is equal to 'max1'. If both conditions are true, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the need to calculate the maximum and minimum values of 'a1', 'b1', 'a2', 'b2'. Instead, we can directly compare the values and check if they satisfy the given conditions.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int a1, b1, a2, b2;
    cin >> a1 >> b1 >> a2 >> b2;
    if ((a1 == a2 && b1 + b2 == a1) || (a1 == b2 && b1 + a2 == a1) || (b1 == a2 && a1 + b2 == b1) || (b1 == b2 && a1 + a2 == b1))
      cout << "YES" << endl;
    else
      cout << "NO" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- We directly compare the values of 'a1', 'b1', 'a2', 'b2' with the conditions mentioned in the original program.
- Instead of calculating 'max1' and 'max2', we directly check if 'a1' is equal to 'a2' and if the sum of 'b1' and 'b2' is equal to 'a1'. If true, we print "YES".
- Similarly, we check for three other conditions: 'a1' with 'b2', 'b1' with 'a2', and 'b1' with 'b2'.
- If none of the conditions are true, we print "NO".
