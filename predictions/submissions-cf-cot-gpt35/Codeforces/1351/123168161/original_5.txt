Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file inclusion
The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not necessary for this program. It is a non-standard header file and includes many other header files, which can increase the compilation time and memory usage. We can remove this line.

Step 2: Optimize the input and output operations
The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations respectively. These operations can be slow, especially when dealing with large inputs. We can optimize the input and output operations by using `scanf` and `printf` functions instead. These functions are generally faster than the corresponding `cin` and `cout` operations.

Step 3: Simplify the condition for checking if the numbers are valid
The program checks if the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is equal to the maximum of `a2` and `b2`, and also checks if the sum of the minimums is equal to the maximum. This condition can be simplified by directly checking if `a1 + b1` is equal to `max1`, where `max1` is the maximum of `a1` and `b1`.

Step 4: Optimize the `max` and `min` function calls
The program uses the `max` and `min` functions to find the maximum and minimum of two numbers. These function calls can be slow, especially when used in a loop. We can optimize these function calls by directly comparing the numbers using the ternary operator `? :`.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    int a1, b1, a2, b2;
    scanf("%d %d %d %d", &a1, &b1, &a2, &b2);
    int max1 = (a1 > b1) ? a1 : b1;
    int max2 = (a2 > b2) ? a2 : b2;
    if (a1 + b1 == max1 && a2 + b2 == max1)
      printf("YES\n");
    else
      printf("NO\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
