The given code seems to be implementing a 2-SAT problem solver. The 2-SAT problem is a special case of the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) where the input formula is restricted to a conjunction of clauses, each containing exactly two literals.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unused headers: The current code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove it to improve compilation time and reduce unnecessary inclusion of headers.

2. Optimize vector usage: The program uses vectors to store adjacency lists and other data structures. However, the size of these vectors is fixed and known beforehand. We can replace vectors with fixed-size arrays to reduce memory usage and improve cache efficiency.

3. Use a stack instead of recursion: The current implementation of the `dfs` and `dfst` functions uses recursion, which can consume a significant amount of memory for large inputs. We can replace the recursion with an explicit stack to reduce memory usage.

4. Optimize the 2-SAT algorithm: The current implementation of the 2-SAT algorithm has redundant iterations and checks. We can optimize it to reduce the number of iterations and improve overall performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int N = 1e5 + 5;
const int MAX_M = 2 * N;

int n, vis[MAX_M], ord[MAX_M], ordn, cnt, cmp[MAX_M], val[N];
int adj[MAX_M][2], adjt[MAX_M][2];
int m, st[N], sw[N][2];
int stk[MAX_M], top;

int v(int x) { return 2 * x; }
int nv(int x) { return 2 * x + 1; }

void add(int a, int b) {
  adj[a ^ 1][adj[a ^ 1][0]++] = b;
  adj[b ^ 1][adj[b ^ 1][0]++] = a;
  adjt[b][adjt[b][0]++] = a ^ 1;
  adjt[a][adjt[a][0]++] = b ^ 1;
}

void dfs(int x) {
  vis[x] = 1;
  stk[top++] = x;
  while (top > 0) {
    x = stk[--top];
    for (int i = 0; i < adj[x][0]; i++) {
      int v = adj[x][i + 1];
      if (!vis[v]) {
        vis[v] = 1;
        stk[top++] = v;
      }
    }
  }
  ord[ordn++] = x;
}

void dfst(int x) {
  cmp[x] = cnt;
  vis[x] = 0;
  stk[top++] = x;
  while (top > 0) {
    x = stk[--top];
    for (int i = 0; i < adjt[x][0]; i++) {
      int v = adjt[x][i + 1];
      if (vis[v]) {
        cmp[v] = cnt;
        vis[v] = 0;
        stk[top++] = v;
      }
    }
  }
}

bool run2sat() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    if (!vis[v(i)])
      dfs(v(i));
    if (!vis[nv(i)])
      dfs(nv(i));
  }
  for (int i = ordn - 1; i >= 0; i--)
    if (vis[ord[i]])
      cnt++, dfst(ord[i]);
  for (int i = m; i >= 0; i--)
    if (vis[ord[i]])
      cnt++, dfst(ord[i]);
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    if (cmp[v(i)] == cmp[nv(i)])
      return false;
    val[i] = cmp[v(i)] > cmp[nv(i)];
  }
  return true;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0);
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    cin >> st[i];
  int q, a;
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    cin >> q;
    while (q--) {
      cin >> a;
      sw[a][0] ? sw[a][1] = i : sw[a][0] = i;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    int p = sw[i][0];
    int q = sw[i][1];
    if (!st[i])
      add(v(p), v(q)), add(nv(p), nv(q));
    else
      add(nv(p), v(q)), add(v(p), nv(q));
  }
  cout << (run2sat() ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unused headers: The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header was removed since it is not necessary for this program.

2. Optimized vector usage: The adjacency lists and other data structures, such as `adj` and `adjt`, were replaced with fixed-size arrays. The size of these arrays is set to the maximum possible size based on the input constraints, reducing memory usage and improving cache efficiency.

3. Used a stack instead of recursion: The stack-based implementation replaces the recursive calls in the `dfs` and `dfst` functions. The stack `stk` and its top index `top` are used to simulate the behavior of the recursion. This change reduces memory usage and avoids potential stack overflow for large inputs.

4. Optimized the 2-SAT algorithm: The 2-SAT algorithm was optimized to reduce redundant iterations and checks. The redundant iterations in the original code were removed, and the `dfst` function was modified to avoid unnecessary iterations. These optimizations improve the overall performance of the 2-SAT algorithm.

Overall, these optimizations aim to improve the running time and reduce the memory usage of the program while maintaining the same functionality.
