To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the "bits/stdc++.h" header file, which includes a lot of standard library headers. This can slow down the compilation process. We can remove this line and include only the necessary standard library headers.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs for different data types. These typedefs are not used anywhere in the program and can be safely removed.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines two macros, "all(v)" and "FASTBOI", but these macros are not used anywhere in the program. We can remove these macro definitions.

4. Optimize the gcd and lcm functions: The gcd and lcm functions can be optimized using the Euclidean algorithm. We can replace the existing gcd and lcm functions with optimized versions.

5. Optimize the check function: The check function can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary calculations. We can remove the "s" vector and calculate the current sum using a variable "cur". We can also remove the "mm" variable and check the condition "mm > m" inside the loop. This will reduce the number of iterations in the loop.

6. Use scanf and printf instead of cin and cout: The program currently uses cin and cout for input and output operations. These operations are slower compared to scanf and printf. We can replace cin and cout with scanf and printf for faster input and output.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

const int N = 1e5 + 70;

int n, m, w;
vector<int> h;

int gcd(int a, int b) {
  return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

int lcm(int a, int b) {
  return (a / gcd(a, b)) * b;
}

bool check(int x) {
  int cur = 0;
  int mm = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (i - w >= 0)
      cur -= h[i - w];
    if (h[i] >= x)
      continue;
    if (h[i] + cur < x) {
      int s = x - h[i] - cur;
      cur += s;
      mm += s;
    }
    if (mm > m)
      return false;
  }
  return true;
}

void solve() {
  scanf("%d%d%d", &n, &m, &w);
  int mn = 1e9;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &h[i]);
    mn = min(mn, h[i]);
  }
  int l = 0, r = mn + m, ans = 0;
  while (l <= r) {
    int md = l + ((r - l) >> 1);
    if (check(md)) {
      ans = max(ans, md);
      l = md + 1;
    } else {
      r = md - 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", ans);
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  for (int tt = 1; tt <= t; ++tt) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
