Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire "bits/stdc++.h" library, which is not necessary for this specific code. We can remove it to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Replace the `scanf` and `printf` functions with `cin` and `cout`: The C++ standard I/O streams (`cin` and `cout`) are generally faster than the C-style `scanf` and `printf` functions. By using `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`, we can improve the program's running time.

3. Replace the `vector` with a fixed-size array: The program uses a `vector` to store the values of `s`. However, since the size of `s` is known in advance (equal to `n`), we can use a fixed-size array instead. This can improve memory usage and reduce the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

4. Optimize the `check` function: In the `check` function, there is a loop that iterates over the elements of `h`. Inside the loop, there are two conditions that can be simplified:
   - The condition `if (h[i] >= x) continue;` can be removed. This is because if `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `x`, we know that it will not contribute to `mm`.
   - The condition `if (h[i] + cur < x)` can be simplified to `if (cur < x - h[i])`. This is because if `cur` is already greater than or equal to `x - h[i]`, we don't need to calculate `s[i]` and update `cur` and `mm`.

5. Optimize the binary search loop: In the `solve` function, there is a binary search loop that searches for the maximum value of `md` for which `check(md)` returns `true`. This loop can be optimized by replacing the `while (l <= r)` condition with `while (l < r)`. This is because when `l` becomes equal to `r`, we have already found the maximum value and there is no need to continue the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pll;

const int N = 1e5 + 70;

ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
    return !b ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

ll lcm(ll a, ll b) {
    return (a / gcd(a, b)) * b;
}

ll n, m, w, h[N];

bool check(ll x) {
    ll s[N] = {0};
    ll cur = 0, mm = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (i - w >= 0)
            cur -= s[i - w];
        if (cur < x - h[i]) {
            s[i] = x - h[i] - cur;
            cur += s[i];
            mm += s[i];
        }
        if (mm > m)
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}

void solve() {
    cin >> n >> m >> w;
    ll mn = 1e18;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> h[i];
        mn = min(mn, h[i]);
    }
    ll l = 0, r = mn + m, ans = 0;
    while (l < r) {
        ll md = l + ((r - l) >> 1);
        if (check(md)) {
            ans = max(ans, md);
            l = md + 1;
        } else {
            r = md;
        }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
    int t = 1;
    for (int tt = 1; tt <= t; ++tt) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```
