The given program is used to solve a problem using binary search. The program takes input values for `n`, `m`, and `w`, and an array `h` of size `n`. It then finds the maximum height `x` such that it is possible to make at most `m` modifications to the array `h` such that every element in `h` becomes greater than or equal to `x`.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the header file `bits/stdc++.h`, which includes a large number of other header files. This can increase the compilation time and memory usage. Instead, we can include only the required header files.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program includes typedefs for `ll`, `ull`, `ld`, `pii`, `pll`, `vi`, and `vl`. These typedefs are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The program calls the `gcd` and `lcm` functions, but these functions are not used in the program. We can remove these function definitions.

4. Use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The program uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations. However, `cin` and `cout` are generally faster and more convenient for input and output operations in C++. We can modify the program to use `cin` and `cout` instead.

5. Avoid unnecessary array initialization: The program initializes the array `s` with all zeros, but only a portion of the array is used. We can avoid initializing the entire array and only initialize the required portion.

6. Optimize the binary search loop: The current binary search loop uses the condition `l <= r` to continue the loop. However, we can modify the condition to `l < r` to reduce the number of iterations by one.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int N = 1e5 + 70;

int n, m, w;
vector<int> h(N);

bool check(int x) {
  vector<int> s(n, 0);
  int cur = 0, mm = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (i - w >= 0)
      cur -= s[i - w];
    if (h[i] >= x)
      continue;
    if (h[i] + cur < x) {
      s[i] = x - h[i] - cur;
      cur += s[i];
      mm += s[i];
    }
    if (mm > m)
      return false;
  }
  return true;
}

void solve() {
  cin >> n >> m >> w;
  int mn = 1e9;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> h[i];
    mn = min(mn, h[i]);
  }
  int l = 0, r = mn + m, ans = 0;
  while (l < r) {
    int md = l + ((r - l) >> 1);
    if (check(md)) {
      ans = max(ans, md);
      l = md + 1;
    } else {
      r = md;
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  for (int tt = 1; tt <= t; ++tt) {
    solve();
  }
}
```

The optimized program makes small modifications to the original one to improve running time and memory usage. It removes unnecessary header files, typedefs, function calls, and initializes only the required portion of the array. It also uses `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations. The binary search loop is optimized by modifying the condition.
