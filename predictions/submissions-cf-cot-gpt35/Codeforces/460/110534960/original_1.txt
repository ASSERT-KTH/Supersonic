The given program is a C++ program that solves a problem using binary search.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the header file "bits/stdc++.h", which includes all standard library header files. However, this can increase compilation time and memory usage. We can replace it with the specific header files that are actually used in the program.

2. Replace vector with array: The program uses a vector "s" to store intermediate values. However, since the size of "s" is fixed and known in advance, we can replace it with an array to reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.

3. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines two functions "gcd" and "lcm", but they are not used in the program. We can remove these functions to simplify the code.

4. Use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout: The program uses cin and cout for input/output, which can be slower than scanf and printf. We can replace them with scanf and printf to improve the running time of the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int N = 1e5 + 70;

int n, m, w, h[N];

bool check(int x) {
  long long s[N] = {0};
  long long cur = 0, mm = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (i - w >= 0)
      cur -= s[i - w];
    if (h[i] >= x)
      continue;
    if (h[i] + cur < x) {
      s[i] = x - h[i] - cur;
      cur += s[i];
      mm += s[i];
    }
    if (mm > m)
      return false;
  }
  return true;
}

void solve() {
  scanf("%d%d%d", &n, &m, &w);
  long long mn = 1e18;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    scanf("%d", &h[i]), mn = min(mn, (long long)h[i]);
  int l = 0, r = mn + m, ans = 0;
  while (l <= r) {
    int md = l + ((r - l) >> 1);
    if (check(md)) {
      ans = max(ans, md);
      l = md + 1;
    } else {
      r = md - 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%d", ans);
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  for (int tt = 1; tt <= t; ++tt) {
    solve();
    puts("");
  }
}
```
