Step 1: Avoid unnecessary include statement
The program includes the entire bits/stdc++.h library, which is unnecessary. We can remove this include statement and include only the necessary libraries.

Step 2: Avoid unnecessary variable initialization
The variables `min_n`, `col`, and `max_n` are not being used in the program. We can remove these variable declarations.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary variable assignment
The variable `s_n` is initialized with a very large value (10e10) in each iteration of the while loop. This is unnecessary and can be moved outside the while loop.

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary variable reassignment
The variable `max_n` is assigned the value of `N` at the beginning of the program but is never modified. We can remove this assignment.

Step 5: Use more descriptive variable names
The variable names `N` and `M` are not very descriptive. We can rename them to `num_n` and `num_m`, respectively, to make the code more readable.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_SIZE = 2001;

long long n[MAX_SIZE], m[MAX_SIZE];

int main() {
  long long s_n, s_m, t, num_n, num_m, x, mid_n, min_m = 1, max_m, mid_m, ans = 0;

  cin >> num_n >> num_m;

  for (int i = 1; i <= num_n; i++) {
    cin >> t;
    n[i] = t + n[i - 1];
  }

  for (int j = 1; j <= num_m; j++) {
    cin >> t;
    m[j] = t + m[j - 1];
  }

  cin >> x;

  for (int n_i = 1; n_i <= num_n; n_i++) {
    min_m = 1;
    max_m = num_m;
    s_n = 10e10; // Initialize s_n with a very large value

    while (min_m <= max_m) {
      mid_m = (min_m + max_m) / 2;

      s_m = 10e10; // Initialize s_m with a very large value

      for (int i = mid_m; i <= num_m; i++) {
        s_m = min(s_m, m[i] - m[i - mid_m]);
      }

      for (int i = n_i; i <= num_n; i++) {
        s_n = min(s_n, n[i] - n[i - n_i]);
      }

      if (s_m * s_n <= x) {
        ans = max(ans, mid_m * n_i);
        min_m = mid_m + 1;
      } else {
        max_m = mid_m - 1;
      }
    }
  }

  cout << ans;

  return 0;
}
```
