The given program is a brute force approach to solve a problem. It uses nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of n_i and mid_m values and calculates s_n and s_m for each combination. The program then checks if the product of s_n and s_m is less than or equal to x and updates the ans variable accordingly.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary. We can remove this line.

2. Use `int` instead of `long long`: The program uses `long long` data type for variables `n`, `m`, `s_n`, `s_m`, and `ans`, which is not necessary. We can use `int` data type instead, as the problem constraints do not exceed the range of `int`.

3. Use prefix sum arrays: The program calculates the prefix sums for arrays `n` and `m` in the nested loops. We can pre-calculate the prefix sums before the loops to avoid repeated calculations.

4. Use a single loop instead of nested loops: Instead of using nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of n_i and mid_m, we can use a single loop to iterate over all possible values of mid_m. We can then calculate the corresponding value of n_i based on the current value of mid_m.

5. Optimize the calculation of s_n and s_m: The program calculates s_n and s_m in each iteration of the nested loops. We can optimize this calculation by using the prefix sums and a sliding window approach. We can maintain two pointers for n_i and mid_m and update the window sum based on the current pointers.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 2001;

int n[MAX_N], m[MAX_N];
int prefix_n[MAX_N], prefix_m[MAX_N];

int main() {
  int N, M, x;
  cin >> N >> M;

  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> n[i];
    prefix_n[i] = n[i] + prefix_n[i - 1];
  }

  for (int j = 1; j <= M; j++) {
    cin >> m[j];
    prefix_m[j] = m[j] + prefix_m[j - 1];
  }

  cin >> x;

  int ans = 0;
  for (int mid_m = 1; mid_m <= M; mid_m++) {
    int n_i = 1;
    int min_m = 1;
    int max_m = M;

    int s_n = prefix_n[N];
    int s_m = prefix_m[mid_m];

    while (n_i <= N && min_m <= max_m) {
      s_n = min(s_n, prefix_n[N] - prefix_n[N - n_i]);
      s_m = min(s_m, prefix_m[mid_m] - prefix_m[mid_m - n_i]);

      if (s_m * s_n <= x) {
        ans = max(ans, mid_m * n_i);
        min_m = mid_m + 1;
        n_i++;
      } else {
        max_m = mid_m - 1;
        n_i--;
      }
    }
  }

  cout << ans;

  return 0;
}
```
