Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a non-standard header and includes all the standard headers. This can lead to unnecessary code bloat. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary variables
There are several variables that are declared but not used in the program, such as `min_n`, `max_n`, `col`, and `s_n`. We can remove these variables to simplify the code.

Step 3: Optimize the inner loops
The inner loops calculate the values of `s_n` and `s_m` for each combination of `n_i` and `mid_m`. However, we can optimize this by calculating these values only once and reusing them. This can significantly reduce the number of calculations and improve performance.

Step 4: Use a more efficient data type
The program uses `long long` for array indices and loop variables. However, for the given constraints, a `int` data type can be used instead to save memory.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 2001;

int n[MAX_N], m[MAX_N];

int main() {
  int N, M, x, ans = 0;
  cin >> N >> M;

  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> n[i];
    n[i] += n[i - 1];
  }

  for (int j = 1; j <= M; j++) {
    cin >> m[j];
    m[j] += m[j - 1];
  }

  cin >> x;

  for (int n_i = 1; n_i <= N; n_i++) {
    int min_m = 1, max_m = M;
    int s_n = 10e10, s_m = 10e10;

    for (int i = n_i; i <= N; i++)
      s_n = min(s_n, n[i] - n[i - n_i]);

    for (int i = 1; i <= M; i++)
      s_m = min(s_m, m[i] - m[i - 1]);

    for (int mid_m = 1; mid_m <= M; mid_m++) {
      if (s_m * s_n <= x) {
        ans = max(ans, mid_m * n_i);
        min_m = mid_m + 1;
      } else
        max_m = mid_m - 1;
    }
  }

  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
