The given program calculates the maximum possible speed after a certain amount of time, given the initial speed, the final speed, the time duration, and the maximum change in speed.

To optimize the program, we can use dynamic programming to eliminate redundant calculations.

1. Instead of recalculating the same values for `dp[tt][speed]`, we can store the results in a memoization table. This will avoid redundant function calls and improve the running time.

2. We can further optimize the program by calculating the maximum possible change in speed only once, rather than in every iteration of the loop. This can be done by finding the maximum change in speed at the beginning of the function.

3. We can also optimize the loop by starting the loop from the maximum possible change in speed (`min(d, v2 - speed)`) and decrementing `i` until 0. This way, we only consider valid changes in speed and avoid unnecessary iterations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;
const int N = 1234;
long long dp[N][N];
int v1, v2, t, d;

long long f(int tt, int speed) {
  if (tt == t) {
    return speed == v2 ? v2 : -1e10;
  }
  
  if (dp[tt][speed] != -1) {
    return dp[tt][speed];
  }
  
  long long maxChange = min(d, v2 - speed);
  
  long long x = -1e9;
  for (int i = maxChange; i >= 0; --i) {
    x = max(x, f(tt + 1, speed + i));
    if (speed - i >= 0) {
      x = max(x, f(tt + 1, speed - i));
    }
  }
  
  return dp[tt][speed] = speed + x;
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d %d %d %d", &v1, &v2, &t, &d);
  memset(dp, -1, sizeof dp);
  printf("%lld\n", f(1, v1));
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations and optimizes the loop by starting from the maximum possible change in speed. This should result in improved running time and memory usage.
