To optimize the given program, we can use memoization to avoid redundant calculations. Currently, the program uses a 2D array `dp` to store the computed values of `f(tt, speed)`. However, the program initializes the `dp` array with `-1` and checks if `dp[tt][speed]` is equal to `-1` to determine if the value has been computed or not. This approach is not efficient because `-1` is a valid value for `dp[tt][speed]` and it may lead to incorrect results. 

To fix this issue, we can use a 2D array of boolean values `visited` to keep track of whether a particular state has been visited or not. Instead of checking if `dp[tt][speed]` is equal to `-1`, we can check if `visited[tt][speed]` is true or false.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

const int N = 1234;
long long dp[N][N];
bool visited[N][N];
int v1, v2, t, d;

long long f(int tt, int speed) {
  if (tt == t) {
    return speed == v2 ? v2 : -1e10;
  }
  if (visited[tt][speed]) {
    return dp[tt][speed];
  }
  visited[tt][speed] = true;
  long long x = -1e9;
  for (int i = 0; i <= d; ++i) {
    x = max(x, f(tt + 1, speed + i));
    if (speed - i >= 0) {
      x = max(x, f(tt + 1, speed - i));
    }
  }
  return dp[tt][speed] = speed + x;
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d %d %d %d", &v1, &v2, &t, &d);
  memset(visited, false, sizeof visited);
  printf("%lld\n", f(1, v1));
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we have replaced the usage of `dp[tt][speed]` with `visited[tt][speed]` to check if a state has been visited or not. We also initialize the `visited` array with `false` in the `memset` call.
