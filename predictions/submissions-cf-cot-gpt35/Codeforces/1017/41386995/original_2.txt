The given program calculates the sum of f(i) for all i from 2 to n, where f(i) is a function defined as A * i^3 + B * i^2 + C * i + D. The program uses a prime sieve to optimize the calculation by skipping unnecessary iterations.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove the unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C/C++ header. We can remove this include statement.

2. Remove the unused variables: The variables F and P are not used in the program, so we can remove these declarations.

3. Improve the prime sieve: The prime sieve is used to skip unnecessary iterations in the for loop. However, the current implementation is not very efficient. We can improve it by using a more optimized prime sieve algorithm.

4. Remove unnecessary calculations: The function qwq is used to perform some arithmetic calculations, but these calculations are not necessary. We can remove the qwq function and simplify the code accordingly.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

inline int read() {
  char s;
  int k = 0, base = 1;
  while ((s = getchar()) != '-' && s != EOF && !(isdigit(s)))
    ;
  if (s == EOF)
    exit(0);
  if (s == '-')
    base = -1, s = getchar();
  while (isdigit(s)) {
    k = k * 10 + (s ^ '0');
    s = getchar();
  }
  return k * base;
}

int n, A, B, C, D;
int ans;

inline int f(int x) {
  return A * x * x * x + B * x * x + C * x + D;
}

int main() {
  ans = 0;
  n = read();
  A = read(), B = read(), C = read(), D = read();
  
  vector<bool> isPrime(n + 1, true);
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  
  for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
  
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i] || i == 2 || i == 3 || i == 5) {
      int j = i;
      int F1 = f(i);
      while (j <= n) {
        ans += (n / j) * F1;
        if (j > n / i)
          break;
        j *= i;
      }
    }
  }
  
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. The unnecessary includes are removed, as mentioned in step 1.

2. The unused variables F and P are removed.

3. The prime sieve implementation is replaced with a more optimized algorithm. We use a vector `isPrime` to store whether each number from 0 to n is prime or not. Initially, all numbers are assumed to be prime. Then, we iterate from 2 to the square root of n and mark all multiples of each prime number as non-prime. This reduces the number of iterations in the for loop and improves the efficiency of the prime sieve.

4. The qwq function and the corresponding calculations are removed. These calculations are not necessary for the program.

Overall, these optimizations improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
