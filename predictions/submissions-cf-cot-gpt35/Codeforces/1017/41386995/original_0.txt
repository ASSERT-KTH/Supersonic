The given program performs prime factorization of numbers up to `n` and calculates a summation based on a quadratic equation. The program uses an array `p` to store prime numbers and a function `qwq` to determine if a number is prime.

To optimize the program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes a large number of standard library headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Improve input reading: The `read()` function reads input digit by digit, which is inefficient. We can use `scanf()` to read integers directly.

3. Replace bitwise operations with arithmetic operations: The program uses bitwise operations to calculate indices and bit positions in the arrays `p` and `P`. We can replace these operations with arithmetic operations for better readability and maintainability.

4. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables `F` and `qwq` are not used in the program. We can remove them to simplify the code.

5. Remove unnecessary conditions: The conditions `(i == 2 || i == 3 || i == 5)` and `(i & 1) && i % 3 != 0 && i % 5 != 0` are redundant. Since the loop starts from `2`, these conditions are always true for the first iteration.

6. Simplify the prime factorization loop: The loop that performs prime factorization can be simplified. We can iterate from `2` to `sqrt(n)` and check if `i` is a factor of `n`. If it is, we can calculate the number of occurrences of `i` in `n` and update the answer accordingly.

7. Avoid unnecessary multiplications: The program calculates `(n / j) * F1` in each iteration of the prime factorization loop. We can calculate `(n / j)` only once and store it in a variable to avoid unnecessary multiplications.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

unsigned int n, A, B, C, D;
unsigned int ans;

inline unsigned int f(unsigned int x) {
  return A * x * x * x + B * x * x + C * x + D;
}

int main() {
  ans = 0;
  unsigned int i, j, x;
  bool flag = false;

  cin >> n >> A >> B >> C >> D;

  unsigned int sqrtN = sqrt(n);
  for (i = 2; i <= sqrtN; i++) {
    if (n % i == 0) {
      unsigned int cnt = 0;
      while (n % i == 0) {
        n /= i;
        cnt++;
      }
      ans += cnt * f(i);
    }
  }

  if (n > 1) {
    ans += f(n);
  }

  cout << ans;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program eliminates unnecessary operations and simplifies the prime factorization loop, resulting in improved running time and memory usage.
