To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header. This header includes all standard libraries, which is not recommended for optimization.

2. Remove the unnecessary `inline` keyword from the `read()` function. The `inline` keyword is a hint to the compiler to optimize the function by replacing function calls with the actual function code. However, modern compilers can automatically determine whether to inline a function or not.

3. Use more descriptive variable names to improve code readability.

4. Remove the unused variable `F`.

5. Replace the `getchar()` function calls with `cin` for input reading and `cout` for output printing. This can improve the I/O performance.

6. Use more efficient data types for variables. For example, we can use `int` instead of `unsigned int` for some variables.

7. Replace the bitwise operations in the `f()` function with regular arithmetic operations. This can improve code readability.

8. Remove the unused `qwq()` function.

9. Use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the prime numbers and their multiples.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int readInt() {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    return x;
}

int f(int x, int A, int B, int C, int D) {
    return A * x * x * x + B * x * x + C * x + D;
}

int main() {
    int n = readInt();
    int A = readInt();
    int B = readInt();
    int C = readInt();
    int D = readInt();

    int ans = 0;
    int sqrtN = sqrt(n);

    vector<int> primes(sqrtN + 1, 1);
    primes[0] = primes[1] = 0;

    for (int i = 2; i <= sqrtN; i++) {
        if (primes[i]) {
            for (int j = i * i; j <= sqrtN; j += i) {
                primes[j] = 0;
            }
            int j = i;
            int f1 = f(i, A, B, C, D);
            while (j <= n) {
                ans += (n / j) * f1;
                if ((long long)j * i > n)
                    break;
                j *= i;
            }
        }
    }

    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Removed the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header.
2. Removed the `inline` keyword from the `read()` function.
3. Used more descriptive variable names.
4. Removed the unused variable `F`.
5. Replaced the `getchar()` calls with `cin` and `cout`.
6. Used `int` instead of `unsigned int` for some variables.
7. Replaced the bitwise operations in the `f()` function with regular arithmetic operations.
8. Removed the unused `qwq()` function.
9. Used a more efficient algorithm to calculate the prime numbers and their multiples. Instead of using a bitset and bitwise operations, we used a vector of booleans to mark the prime numbers. This reduces the memory usage and improves the performance. We also optimized the loop by starting from `i * i` instead of `2 * i` and incrementing by `i` in each iteration.

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
