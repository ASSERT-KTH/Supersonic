The given program has a few areas where optimization can be done:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header which is not necessary and can be replaced with the specific headers that are required.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines macros such as `el`, `PI`, `_test_`, etc. These macros are not used in the code and can be removed to improve readability.

3. Remove unnecessary function declarations: The program declares two functions `gcd` and `lcm` which are not used in the code. These function declarations can be removed.

4. Remove unused variables: The variables `dx`, `dy`, `k`, `ans` are declared but not used in the code. These variables can be removed to reduce memory usage.

5. Use unordered_set instead of set: The program uses a set to store unique elements. However, for better performance, we can use an `unordered_set` instead of a `set` as it provides constant-time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.

6. Use unordered_map instead of map: The program uses a map to count the occurrences of elements. However, for better performance, we can use an `unordered_map` instead of a `map` as it provides constant-time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.

7. Use range-based for loop: Instead of using a traditional for loop, we can use a range-based for loop to iterate over the array `a`. This can improve code readability and reduce the chances of off-by-one errors.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

const int mx = 1e6 + 123;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  int a[mx];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }

  sort(a, a + n);

  unordered_set<int> s;
  unordered_map<int, int> m;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (a[i] != 1 && m[a[i] - 1] == 0) {
      s.insert(a[i] - 1);
      m[a[i] - 1]++;
    } else if (m[a[i]] == 0) {
      s.insert(a[i]);
      m[a[i]]++;
    } else if (m[a[i] + 1] == 0) {
      s.insert(a[i] + 1);
      m[a[i] + 1]++;
    }
  }

  cout << s.size() << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
