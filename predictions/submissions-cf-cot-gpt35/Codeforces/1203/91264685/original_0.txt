The given program seems to be a program that counts the number of unique elements in an array `a`, with the condition that if an element `x` is in the array, then `x-1` and `x+1` should also be counted as unique elements.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a large number of header files which may not be necessary for this program. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary typedef: The `typedef long long ll;` line is not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Remove unnecessary define statements: The `#define el << endl` and `#define PI 3.141592653589793238` lines are not used in the program and can be removed.

4. Remove unnecessary IO optimization: The `optimize()` function is not necessary for this program and can be removed.

5. Remove unnecessary file IO: The `file()` function is not used in the program and can be removed.

6. Use unordered_set instead of set: Since the order of elements doesn't matter in this program, we can use `unordered_set` instead of `set` to improve performance.

7. Use unordered_map instead of map: Since the order of elements doesn't matter in this program, we can use `unordered_map` instead of `map` to improve performance.

Taking all these optimizations into account, the optimized program would look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

const int mx = 1e6 + 123;
int n, a[mx], ans, k;
unordered_set<int> s;
unordered_map<int, int> m;

void _case_() {
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  sort(a, a + n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (a[i] != 1 and m[a[i] - 1] == 0) {
      s.insert(a[i] - 1);
      m[a[i] - 1]++;
    } else if (m[a[i]] == 0) {
      s.insert(a[i]);
      m[a[i]]++;
    } else if (m[a[i] + 1] == 0) {
      s.insert(a[i] + 1);
      m[a[i] + 1]++;
    }
  }
  cout << s.size() << endl;
}

int main() {
  _case_();
  return 0;
}
```

These modifications should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
