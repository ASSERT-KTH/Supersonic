The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header includes almost all the standard C++ libraries. However, including only the necessary headers can improve compilation time and reduce memory usage. In this case, we only need `<iostream>`, `<algorithm>`, `<set>`, and `<map>` headers.

2. Remove unused macros: The macros `el`, `PI`, `_test_`, `file()` are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Remove unused variables: The variables `dx[]`, `dy[]`, `k`, and `ans` are not used in the program and can be removed.

4. Remove unnecessary function calls: The `gcd()` and `lcm()` functions are not used in the program and can be removed.

5. Optimize input/output: The `optimize()` function is not necessary for this program because it disables synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can cause issues in multi-threaded programs. We can remove the `optimize()` function and use the default input/output streams instead.

6. Remove unnecessary file I/O: The `file()` function is not used in the program and can be removed.

7. Optimize set and map operations: The set `s` and map `m` are used to keep track of unique elements and their occurrences. However, we can optimize the program by using a vector instead of a set to store unique elements, and an array instead of a map to store their occurrences. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

8. Optimize sorting: The program sorts the array `a` using the `sort()` function. We can optimize the sorting by using the `partial_sort()` function instead, which only partially sorts the array up to a given index. Since we only need the smallest unique elements, we can partially sort the array up to the maximum possible element.

9. Optimize loop conditions: The second loop in the `_case_()` function iterates over the array `a` and performs three conditional checks for each element. We can optimize this loop by using a single loop that iterates over the array from the second element to the second-to-last element. Inside the loop, we can check if the current element is unique and add it to the vector `s`.

10. Optimize output: Instead of printing the size of the set `s` using `cout`, we can directly output the size without using a new line character.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <set>
#include <map>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

const int mx = 1e6 + 123;
int n, a[mx];
vector<int> s;
int m[mx];

void _case_() {
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  partial_sort(a, a + n, a + n);
  
  for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if (a[i] != 1 && m[a[i] - 1] == 0) {
      s.push_back(a[i] - 1);
      m[a[i] - 1]++;
    } else if (m[a[i]] == 0) {
      s.push_back(a[i]);
      m[a[i]]++;
    } else if (m[a[i] + 1] == 0) {
      s.push_back(a[i] + 1);
      m[a[i] + 1]++;
    }
  }
  
  cout << s.size();
}

int main() {
  _case_();
  return 0;
}
```
