The given program performs some operations on a string to ensure that each digit appears in the string the same number of times. It does this by swapping digits in the string. However, the current implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2) and uses additional memory for the count vector.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Instead of using a vector to store the count of each digit, we can use an array of size 3. This will reduce the overhead of the vector and improve memory usage.

2. We can combine the forward and backward functions into a single function. This will reduce code duplication and improve code readability.

3. Instead of iterating over the string twice, we can iterate over it once and perform the necessary operations in a single pass.

4. We can remove the unnecessary #define statements and include only the necessary headers.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void optimizeString(string &s, int n) {
  int count[3] = {0};
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    count[s[i] - '0']++;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (count[0] < n / 3 && s[i] - '0' > 0 && count[s[i] - '0'] > n / 3) {
      count[0]++;
      count[s[i] - '0']--;
      s[i] = '0';
    } else if (count[2] < n / 3 && s[i] - '0' < 2 && count[s[i] - '0'] > n / 3) {
      count[2]++;
      count[s[i] - '0']--;
      s[i] = '2';
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  string s;
  cin >> n;
  cin >> s;

  optimizeString(s, n);

  cout << s;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces the time complexity to O(n) and improves memory usage by using an array instead of a vector.
