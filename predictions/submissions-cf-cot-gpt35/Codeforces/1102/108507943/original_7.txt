The given program is trying to modify a string `s` such that it contains equal number of '0', '1', and '2'. It does this by performing two functions `forward` and `backward`. The `forward` function increases the count of '0' and decreases the count of '1' if '1' appears after '0'. The `backward` function increases the count of '2' and decreases the count of '1' if '1' appears before '2'.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a non-standard header file and includes a lot of unnecessary standard library headers. We can remove this include and include only the necessary standard headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros `IOS`, `int`, and `Mod` which are not used. We can remove these macros.

3. Remove unnecessary `using` directive: The program has a `using namespace std` directive which is not necessary. We can remove this directive and use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.

4. Pass `count` vector by reference: The `forward` and `backward` functions take `count` vector by value, which creates unnecessary copies of the vector. We can pass the vector by reference to avoid this unnecessary copy.

5. Optimize loop conditions: The loops in the `forward` and `backward` functions iterate over the entire string `s` even if the count condition is already satisfied. We can optimize the loop conditions to break out of the loop early if the count condition is satisfied.

6. Optimize count condition: The condition `count[x] < n / 3` is checked in every iteration of the loop. We can move this check outside the loop and store the value of `n / 3` in a variable to avoid the division operation in every iteration.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

void forward(std::string& s, int x, int n, std::vector<int>& count) {
  int target_count = n / 3;
  for (int i = 0; i < n && count[x] < target_count; i++) {
    if (count[x] < target_count && s[i] - '0' > x && count[s[i] - '0'] > target_count) {
      count[x]++;
      count[s[i] - '0']--;
      s[i] = x + '0';
    }
  }
}

void backward(std::string& s, int x, int n, std::vector<int>& count) {
  int target_count = n / 3;
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0 && count[x] < target_count; i--) {
    if (count[x] < target_count && s[i] - '0' < x && count[s[i] - '0'] > target_count) {
      count[x]++;
      count[s[i] - '0']--;
      s[i] = x + '0';
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);
  std::cout.tie(nullptr);

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::string s;
  std::cin >> s;

  std::vector<int> count(3, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    count[s[i] - '0']++;
  }

  forward(s, 0, n, count);
  forward(s, 1, n, count);
  backward(s, 2, n, count);
  backward(s, 1, n, count);

  std::cout << s;

  return 0;
}
```
