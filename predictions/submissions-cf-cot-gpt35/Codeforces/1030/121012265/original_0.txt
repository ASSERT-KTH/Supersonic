The given program reads an integer n, followed by n more integers. If any of the integers is equal to 1, it outputs "HARD". Otherwise, it outputs "EASY". The program seems straightforward and does not have any major performance issues.

However, there is a small optimization that can be made. Currently, the program uses the `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` function to disable the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams. While this can improve the performance of C++ streams, it is unnecessary in this particular program since we are only using `cin` and `cout`. Therefore, we can remove this line to simplify the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, a;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a;
    if (a == 1) {
      cout << "HARD" << endl;
      return 0;
    }
  }
  cout << "EASY" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
