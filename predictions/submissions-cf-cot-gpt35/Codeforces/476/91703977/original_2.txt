The given program is already optimized in terms of using compiler flags for faster execution and reducing the size of the standard input/output streams. However, there are still some areas where further optimization can be done:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes several unnecessary headers that are not used in the code. Removing these headers can slightly improve the compile time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. Removing these macros can reduce the memory usage.

3. Simplify the calculation of `apos` and `r`: The program calculates the values of `apos` and `r` by iterating over the input string `a` and `b` respectively. This can be simplified by using the `count` function from the algorithm library, which counts the number of occurrences of a specific character in a string.

4. Use a more efficient algorithm for calculating the binomial coefficient: The program uses a 2D array `l` to calculate the binomial coefficient. This can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm, such as Pascal's triangle or the combinatorial formula.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program performs several unnecessary calculations, such as checking if `amb` is 0 multiple times and calculating `q` and `p` even when `amb` is 0 or `diff` is not 0.

Below is the optimized program with the mentioned improvements:

```cpp
#pragma comment(linker, "/stack:200000000")

int nCr(int n, int r) {
    int num = 1, den = 1;
    for(int i = 1; i <= r; i++) {
        num *= (n - i + 1);
        den *= i;
    }
    return num / den;
}

void solve() {
    string a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    ld prob;
    
    int apos = count(a.begin(), a.end(), '+') - count(a.begin(), a.end(), '-');
    int amb = count(b.begin(), b.end(), '?');
    
    if (amb == 0 and apos == 0) {
        prob = 1;
        cout << prob << endl;
        return;
    } else if (amb == 0 and apos != 0) {
        prob = 0;
        cout << prob << endl;
        return;
    }
    
    int r = count(b.begin(), b.end(), '+') - count(b.begin(), b.end(), '-');
    int diff = apos - r;
    
    if ((amb + diff) & 1) {
        prob = 0;
        cout << prob << endl;
        return;
    }
    
    int u = (amb + diff) / 2;
    int v = amb - u;
    
    if (u < 0 or v < 0) {
        prob = 0;
        cout << prob << endl;
        return;
    }
    
    ld q = pow(2, amb);
    ld p = nCr(amb, u);
    prob = p / q;
    cout << prob << endl;
}

int32_t main() {
    fastio
    
    int t = 1;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= t; i++) {
        solve();
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

The optimized program removes unnecessary headers, unused macros, simplifies calculations, and uses a more efficient algorithm for calculating the binomial coefficient. These optimizations can improve the program's running time and reduce memory usage.
