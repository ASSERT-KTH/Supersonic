To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes many unnecessary header files. We can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines many unnecessary macros that are not used. We can remove them to improve code readability.

3. Remove unused variables: The variables `bpos` and `diff` are declared but not used in the program. We can remove them to reduce memory usage.

4. Optimize the calculation of `nCr`: The function `nCr` calculates the combination value using a precomputed 2D array. However, this approach is not efficient for large values of `n` and `r`. We can optimize this calculation using a formula to reduce the time complexity.

5. Optimize the calculation of `prob`: The calculation of `prob` can be optimized by simplifying the formula and avoiding unnecessary calculations. We can use a simplified formula to calculate `prob` directly without calculating `p` and `q` separately.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#pragma comment(linker, "/stack:200000000")
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
#pragma GCC target("sse,sse2,sse3,ssse3,sse4,avx,avx2")
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  string a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  double prob = 0.0;
  int apos = 0;
  for (auto i : a) {
    apos += i == '+';
    apos -= i == '-';
  }
  int amb = count(b.begin(), b.end(), '?');
  int diff = apos - count(b.begin(), b.end(), '+');
  if (amb == 0 and diff == 0) {
    prob = 1.0;
    cout << prob << endl;
    return;
  } else if (amb == 0 and diff != 0) {
    prob = 0.0;
    cout << prob << endl;
    return;
  }
  int u = (amb + diff) / 2;
  int v = amb - u;
  if ((amb + diff) & 1 or (u < 0 or v < 0)) {
    prob = 0.0;
    cout << prob << endl;
    return;
  }
  prob = 1.0 / pow(2, amb) * tgamma(amb + 1) / (tgamma(u + 1) * tgamma(v + 1));
  cout << setprecision(15) << fixed << prob << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int t = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= t; i++) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. We removed unnecessary header files `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, `<ext/pb_ds/detail/standard_policies.hpp>`, and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`.

2. We removed unnecessary macros and unused variables to improve code readability and reduce memory usage.

3. We optimized the calculation of `nCr` by using the `tgamma` function from the `<cmath>` library. This function calculates the gamma function of a number, which can be used to calculate the factorial of a number. We simplified the calculation of `prob` by directly using the simplified formula.

4. We removed the `initialize` function and the precomputed 2D array `l` as they were not used in the program.

5. We removed the unnecessary `fastio` macro and replaced it with the `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` to improve input/output performance.

6. We removed the unnecessary file input/output operations and error file redirection.

Overall, these optimizations improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
