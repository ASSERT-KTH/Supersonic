Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and namespaces.

The program includes several unnecessary headers and namespaces. We can remove them to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unused macros.

The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove them to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

Step 3: Optimize the nCr function.

The nCr function uses a 2D array to store the values of binomial coefficients. We can optimize this function by calculating the binomial coefficients on the fly instead of storing them in a 2D array. This will reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Simplify the logic for calculating the probability.

The logic for calculating the probability can be simplified by removing unnecessary conditions and calculations. We can simplify the code to reduce running time.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int nCr(int n, int r) {
    int res = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= r; i++) {
        res *= (n - i + 1);
        res /= i;
    }
    return res;
}

void solve() {
    string a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    int apos = 0;
    for (auto i : a) {
        apos += i == '+';
        apos -= i == '-';
    }
    int bpos = 0, amb = 0;
    for (auto i : b)
        amb += i == '?';
    int diff = 0;
    int r = 0;
    for (auto i : b) {
        r += i == '+';
        r -= i == '-';
    }
    diff = apos - r;
    if (amb == 0 and diff == 0) {
        cout << 1 << endl;
        return;
    } else if (amb == 0 and diff != 0) {
        cout << 0 << endl;
        return;
    }
    int u = (amb + diff) / 2;
    int v = amb - u;
    if ((amb + diff) & 1 or (u < 0 or v < 0)) {
        cout << 0 << endl;
        return;
    }
    ld q = pow(2, amb);
    ld p = nCr(amb, u);
    ld prob = p / q;
    cout << prob << endl;
}

int main() {
    int t = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= t; i++) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```
