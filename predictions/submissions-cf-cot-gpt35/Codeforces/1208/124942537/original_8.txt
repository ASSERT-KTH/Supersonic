Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers and standard namespace

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a large number of headers, many of which are unnecessary for this program. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

Also, it is a good practice to avoid using the `using namespace std` directive as it pollutes the global namespace. We can remove this line and use the `std::` prefix for standard library types.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

The program includes several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

Step 3: Optimize loop conditions

In the `rep` macro, the loop condition `a < c` is inclusive, which means the loop will run one extra time. We can change the condition to `a <= c` to make it exclusive and avoid unnecessary iterations.

Step 4: Optimize memory usage

The program uses an array `a` to store the input numbers. However, the size of the array is determined at runtime based on the input value of `n`. This can lead to excessive memory usage for large values of `n`. We can use a `std::vector` instead, which can dynamically resize itself as needed.

Step 5: Optimize the algorithm

The program uses a nested loop to check all possible subarrays of the input array and find the minimum length of a subarray that contains all distinct elements. This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2).

We can optimize the algorithm by using a sliding window approach. Instead of checking all possible subarrays, we can maintain a window that contains all distinct elements. We can use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the boundaries of the window. Initially, both pointers are at the start of the array.

We will iterate the `right` pointer until we find a window that contains all distinct elements. Then, we will update the minimum length if necessary. After that, we will increment the `left` pointer to shrink the window and continue the process.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) as we process each element only once.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary headers and standard namespace.
2. Remove unnecessary macros.
3. Optimize loop conditions in the `rep` macro.
4. Use `std::vector` instead of an array for input numbers.
5. Optimize the algorithm using a sliding window approach.
