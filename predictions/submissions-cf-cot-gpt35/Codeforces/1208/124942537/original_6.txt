Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files

The program includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard header file and is not necessary for this program. We can remove this header file.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

The program defines several macros for convenience, but they are not used in the program. We can remove these macros to improve the code readability.

Step 3: Optimize the loop

The program uses a nested loop to find the minimum length of a subarray. However, we can optimize this loop to reduce the number of iterations.

Instead of using a nested loop, we can use two pointers to keep track of the subarray. We can move the right pointer forward until we find a subarray that contains all unique elements. Then, we can move the left pointer forward until the subarray no longer contains all unique elements.

By using this optimized approach, we can reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time of the program.

Step 4: Use a smaller data type

The program uses the `ll` data type for variables that do not require such a large data type. We can replace the `ll` data type with a smaller data type to reduce memory usage.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

void solve() {
  std::unordered_map<int, int> m;
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
    m[a[i]]++;
  }
  if (m.size() == n) {
    std::cout << 0 << "\n";
    return;
  }
  int mi = INT_MAX;
  std::unordered_map<int, int> temp;
  int left = 0, right = 0;
  while (right < n) {
    temp[a[right]]++;
    while (temp.size() == (right - left + 1)) {
      mi = std::min(mi, right - left + 1);
      temp[a[left]]--;
      if (temp[a[left]] == 0) {
        temp.erase(a[left]);
      }
      left++;
    }
    right++;
  }
  std::cout << mi << "\n";
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

Step 1: We removed the unnecessary header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`.

Step 2: We removed the unnecessary macros `rep`, `vec`, `vecl`, `vecp`, `umap`, `uset`, `sti`, `qui`, `pb`, `so`, `sov`, `co`, `col`, `endl`, `fi`, `se`, `all`, and `MOD`.

Step 3: We optimized the loop by using two pointers (`left` and `right`) to keep track of the subarray. We moved the right pointer forward until we found a subarray that contains all unique elements. Then, we moved the left pointer forward until the subarray no longer contained all unique elements. This optimized approach reduced the number of iterations and improved the running time of the program.

Step 4: We replaced the `ll` data type with the `int` data type for variables that do not require such a large data type, such as `n` and `mi`. This reduced the memory usage of the program.
