Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files and definitions.
- The program includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard header file and is not necessary for this program.
- The program defines multiple macros that are not used in the program.

Step 2: Avoid using `using namespace std;`.
- It is considered a good practice to avoid using `using namespace std;` in order to prevent naming conflicts.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary data types and container typedefs.
- The program defines multiple typedefs for data types and containers, such as `ll`, `vec`, `vecl`, etc. These typedefs are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 4: Optimize the loop for calculating the minimum length.
- Currently, the program uses a nested loop to calculate the minimum length. For each index `i`, it iterates from `i` to `n` to find the minimum length. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2).
- We can optimize this by using a two-pointer approach. We maintain two pointers `i` and `j`, and a temporary map `temp` to keep track of the frequency of elements in the current subarray.
- We initialize `i` and `j` to 0, and iterate until `j` reaches `n`. In each iteration, we add `a[j]` to `temp` and increment `j`.
- If `temp` has the same size as the remaining elements in the array (`n - j`), we update the minimum length and remove `a[i]` from `temp`. Then, we increment `i`.
- This approach reduces the time complexity to O(n).

Step 5: Optimize memory usage.
- Currently, the program uses an array `a` of size `n` and an unordered map `m` to store the frequency of elements. This results in a space complexity of O(n).
- We can optimize the memory usage by using a single unordered map `m` to store the frequency of elements. Instead of storing the elements in an array, we can directly read the elements from the input and update the frequency in `m`.
- This approach reduces the space complexity to O(k), where k is the number of unique elements in the input array.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <climits>

void solve() {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> m;
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    int mi = INT_MAX;
    int uniqueCount = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int num;
        std::cin >> num;
        m[num]++;
        
        if (m[num] == 1) {
            uniqueCount++;
        }
        
        while (uniqueCount == i + 1) {
            mi = std::min(mi, i + 1);
            int numToRemove = a[i - mi + 1];
            m[numToRemove]--;
            if (m[numToRemove] == 0) {
                uniqueCount--;
            }
            mi = std::min(mi, i + 1);
        }
    }

    if (mi == INT_MAX) {
        std::cout << 0 << "\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << mi << "\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);

    int t = 1;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimized program:

- The unnecessary header files and macros have been removed.
- The program no longer uses `using namespace std;`.
- The unnecessary typedefs have been removed.
- The loop for calculating the minimum length has been optimized using a two-pointer approach.
- The memory usage has been optimized by using a single unordered map `m` to store the frequency of elements and directly reading the elements from the input.
