The given program calculates the number of paths in a grid from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, such that the XOR of the values along the path is equal to a given value k.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<unordered_map>`, which are not required for this program. We can remove these includes.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Optimize input/output: The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output, which can be slower than other methods like `scanf` and `printf`. We can modify the program to use `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output.

4. Avoid unnecessary map operations: The program uses a map `mp` to store the XOR values and their frequencies. However, the map operations can be slow. We can optimize this by using a simple array instead of a map to store the frequencies.

5. Use a more efficient data type: The program uses `long long` for the grid values and XOR calculations. However, for this problem, the grid values are given as integers and the XOR calculations can be done using integers. We can modify the program to use `int` instead of `long long` for these calculations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

const int N = 29;
int k, grid[N][N];
int mp[N][N][1 << 20];
int n, m;

int main() {
  freopen("in.txt", "r", stdin);
  scanf("%d %d %d", &n, &m, &k);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++)
      scanf("%d", &grid[i][j]);
  int ans = 0;
  int num = (n + m - 2 + 1) / 2;
  for (int i = 0; i < (1 << num); i++) {
    int row = 1, col = 1;
    int x = grid[row][col];
    for (int j = 0; j < num; j++) {
      if (i & (1 << j))
        row++;
      else
        col++;
      x ^= grid[row][col];
    }
    mp[row][col][x]++;
  }
  num = n + m - 2 - num;
  for (int i = 0; i < (1 << num); i++) {
    int row = n, col = m;
    int x = grid[row][col];
    for (int j = 0; j < num; j++) {
      if (i & (1 << j))
        row--;
      else
        col--;
      if (row < 1 || col < 1)
        break;
      x ^= grid[row][col];
    }
    if (row >= 1 && col >= 1) {
      x ^= grid[row][col];
      ans += mp[row][col][x ^ k];
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. We removed unnecessary includes like `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<unordered_map>`.

2. We removed unnecessary macros like `endl`, `all()`, `allr()`, `RT()`, `watch()`, `sz()`, `PI`, and `EPS`.

3. We modified the input/output to use `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output.

4. We replaced the `map<ll, int>` with a 3D array `mp[N][N][1 << 20]` to store the frequencies of XOR values.

5. We changed the data type of `k`, `grid`, and `x` from `long long` to `int` since they are given as integers and the XOR calculations can be done using integers.
