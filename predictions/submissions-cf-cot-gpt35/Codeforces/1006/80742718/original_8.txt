Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers and macros

The program includes some unnecessary headers and macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these to simplify the code.

Step 2: Optimize input/output operations

The program currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. However, these operations are relatively slow compared to other methods. We can optimize the input/output operations by using `scanf` and `printf` instead.

Step 3: Optimize the loop for calculating `ans`

The loop for calculating `ans` can be optimized by using bit manipulation instead of iterating through all possible combinations. This will greatly reduce the number of iterations and improve the performance of the program.

Step 4: Use a smaller data type for the `mp` map

The `mp` map currently uses `ll` as the key, which is not necessary since the values of `x` are calculated using the XOR operation and will always be within the range of an `int`. We can change the data type of the key to `int` to save memory.

Step 5: Optimize the loop for calculating `mp`

The loop for calculating `mp` can be optimized by removing unnecessary checks and calculations. We can break the loop early if the `row` or `col` becomes less than 1.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

const int N = 29;
int k, n, m;
int grid[N][N];
map<int, int> mp[N][N];

int main() {
    freopen("in.txt", "r", stdin);

    scanf("%d %d %d", &n, &m, &k);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
            scanf("%d", &grid[i][j]);
        }
    }

    int ans = 0;
    int num = (n + m - 2 + 1) / 2;
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << num); i++) {
        int row = 1, col = 1;
        int x = grid[row][col];
        for (int j = 0; j < num; j++) {
            if (i & (1 << j)) {
                row++;
            }
            else {
                col++;
            }
            x ^= grid[row][col];
        }
        mp[row][col][x]++;
    }

    num = n + m - 2 - num;
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << num); i++) {
        int row = n, col = m;
        int x = grid[row][col];
        for (int j = 0; j < num; j++) {
            if (i & (1 << j)) {
                row--;
            }
            else {
                col--;
            }
            if (row < 1 || col < 1) {
                break;
            }
            x ^= grid[row][col];
        }
        if (row >= 1 && col >= 1) {
            x ^= grid[row][col];
            ans += mp[row][col][x ^ k];
        }
    }

    printf("%d\n", ans);

    return 0;
}
```
