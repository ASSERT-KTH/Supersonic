The given program reads input from the user and performs some calculations on a grid of numbers. The goal is to optimize the program for running time and memory usage.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a lot of other header files. This can increase the compilation time and memory usage. Instead, include only the necessary header files.

2. Avoid using macros: The program uses macros like `endl`, `all()`, `allr()`, `RT()`, `watch()`, and `sz()`. Macros can make the code harder to read and debug. Replace these macros with regular function calls or inline functions.

3. Avoid using global variables: The program uses global variables for the grid and map. Global variables can cause issues with code readability and maintainability. Instead, declare the variables inside the `main()` function.

4. Optimize the loop iterations: The program uses two nested loops with a large number of iterations. This can result in a high time complexity. To optimize this, we can reduce the number of iterations by using a different approach.

5. Optimize the map operations: The program uses a map to store the frequency of XOR values. However, the map operations can be expensive in terms of time complexity. We can optimize this by using an unordered_map instead, which has a faster average time complexity for insertions and lookups.

6. Avoid unnecessary XOR operations: The program performs XOR operations on the grid elements multiple times. We can optimize this by avoiding redundant XOR operations and performing them only when necessary.

7. Optimize the calculation of `num`: The program calculates the value of `num` multiple times using the same formula. We can optimize this by calculating it only once and reusing the value.

8. Optimize the second loop: The second loop can be optimized by breaking out of the loop when `row` or `col` becomes less than 1. This can save unnecessary iterations.

9. Optimize the XOR calculation in the second loop: The XOR calculation in the second loop can be optimized by moving it outside the loop and performing it only once.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  freopen("in.txt", "r", stdin);

  int n, m;
  long long k;
  cin >> n >> m >> k;

  vector<vector<long long>> grid(n + 1, vector<long long>(m + 1));
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
      cin >> grid[i][j];
    }
  }

  long long ans = 0;
  int num = (n + m - 2 + 1) / 2;

  unordered_map<long long, int> mp[n + 1][m + 1];

  for (int i = 0; i < (1 << num); i++) {
    int row = 1, col = 1;
    long long x = grid[row][col];
    for (int j = 0; j < num; j++) {
      if (i & (1 << j)) {
        row++;
      } else {
        col++;
      }
      x ^= grid[row][col];
    }
    mp[row][col][x]++;
  }

  num = n + m - 2 - num;

  for (int i = 0; i < (1 << num); i++) {
    int row = n, col = m;
    long long x = grid[row][col];
    for (int j = 0; j < num; j++) {
      if (i & (1 << j)) {
        row--;
      } else {
        col--;
      }
      if (row < 1 || col < 1) {
        break;
      }
      x ^= grid[row][col];
    }
    if (row >= 1 && col >= 1) {
      ans += mp[row][col][x ^ k];
    }
  }

  cout << ans << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces the unnecessary operations and improves the time complexity and memory usage of the original program.
