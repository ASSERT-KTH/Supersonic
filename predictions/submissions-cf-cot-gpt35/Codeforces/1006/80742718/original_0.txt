The given program calculates the number of paths in a grid that have a bitwise XOR value equal to k. The program uses a brute force approach by generating all possible paths and checking their XOR values.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes many unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<unordered_map>`. We can remove these header files as they are not used in the program.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs that are not used. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code.

4. Optimize the loop limits: The program uses a loop with a fixed limit of (1 << num) to generate all possible paths. However, we can optimize the loop limits based on the grid size. Instead of using (1 << num), we can use min(n, m) as the loop limit. This will reduce the number of iterations in the loop and improve the program's running time.

5. Use unordered_map instead of map: The program uses a map to store the XOR values and their frequencies. However, using an unordered_map instead of a map can improve the program's running time, as unordered_map has a faster average time complexity for insertions and lookups.

6. Remove unnecessary XOR operations: The program performs unnecessary XOR operations in the second loop. We can remove these XOR operations to simplify the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

const int N = 29;
int n, m;
long long k, grid[N][N];
unordered_map<long long, int> mp[N][N];

int main() {
    freopen("in.txt", "r", stdin);
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    cin >> n >> m >> k;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++)
            cin >> grid[i][j];

    long long ans = 0;
    int num = (n + m - 2 + 1) / 2;
    int limit = min(n, m);

    for (int i = 0; i < limit; i++) {
        int row = 1, col = 1;
        long long x = grid[row][col];
        for (int j = 0; j < num; j++) {
            if (i & (1 << j))
                row++;
            else
                col++;
            x ^= grid[row][col];
        }
        mp[row][col][x]++;
    }

    num = n + m - 2 - num;
    for (int i = 0; i < limit; i++) {
        int row = n, col = m;
        long long x = grid[row][col];
        for (int j = 0; j < num; j++) {
            if (i & (1 << j))
                row--;
            else
                col--;
            if (row < 1 || col < 1)
                break;
            x ^= grid[row][col];
        }
        if (row >= 1 && col >= 1) {
            ans += mp[row][col][x ^ k];
        }
    }

    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we can significantly improve the program's running time and memory usage.
