Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers and can slow down the compilation process. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers like `<cstdio>`, `<cstring>`, and `<cmath>`.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines typedefs for `ull` and `ll`, but they are not used anywhere. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code.

3. Optimize the way numbers are read from input: The `read` function reads a number from input character by character. This can be slow for large input. We can replace it with the `scanf` function, which is faster.

4. Optimize the way the prime numbers are calculated: The `euler` function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to calculate prime numbers. However, it can be optimized by using an array of booleans instead of an array of integers. This will reduce the memory usage.

5. Optimize the way the answer array is calculated: The `ans` array is calculated using a loop and the `!vis` condition. We can optimize this loop by using a prefix sum approach. Instead of calculating `ans[i]` based on `ans[i-1]`, we can calculate it based on `ans[i-1] + 1` if `vis[i]` is true and `ans[i-1]` otherwise.

6. Optimize the binary search: The binary search in the while loop can be optimized by using a more efficient way to calculate the middle index. Instead of `(r + l) / 2`, we can use `l + (r - l) / 2` to avoid integer overflow.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <cmath>

const int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const double PI = acos(-1);
const double eps = 1e-8;

#define pii pair<int, int>
#define X first
#define Y second
#define lowbit a &(-a)

using namespace std;

const int maxn = 1e6 + 10;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;

int prime[maxn];
bool vis[maxn];
int ans[maxn];

void euler(int n) {
  memset(vis, 0, sizeof(vis));
  for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!vis[i])
      prime[++prime[0]] = i;
    for (int j = 1; j <= prime[0] && i * prime[j] < n; ++j) {
      vis[i * prime[j]] = true;
      if (i % prime[j] == 0)
        break;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  euler(maxn - 9);
  vis[1] = 1;

  for (int i = 2; i < maxn; ++i) {
    ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + (int)(!vis[i]);
  }

  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);

  while (t--) {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);

    if (n <= 3) {
      printf("%d\n", n);
      continue;
    }

    int l = 1, r = prime[0];
    while (l + 1 < r) {
      int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
      if ((ll)prime[mid] * prime[mid] <= (ll)n)
        l = mid;
      else
        r = mid;
    }

    printf("%d\n", ans[n] - ans[prime[l]] + 1);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program should have improved running time and reduced memory usage compared to the original program.
