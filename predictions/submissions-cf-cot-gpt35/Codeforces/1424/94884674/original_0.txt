To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not standard and includes unnecessary headers. We can remove it and include only the required headers.

2. Remove unused constants: The program defines constants `INF`, `PI`, and `eps`, but they are not used anywhere. We can remove them.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines typedefs `ull` and `ll`, but they are not used anywhere. We can remove them.

4. Improve input reading: The program uses a custom input reading function `read()` to read integers. We can replace it with the standard `scanf()` function, which is faster.

5. Optimize prime number generation: The program uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers. We can optimize it by only iterating up to the square root of `n` instead of `n`, as any composite number `x` has a prime factor less than or equal to its square root.

6. Use a prefix sum array: The program uses an array `ans[]` to store the number of prime numbers up to a certain index. We can optimize it by using a prefix sum array, which will allow us to calculate the number of prime numbers in a range efficiently.

7. Use binary search: The program uses a linear search to find the largest prime number less than or equal to `n`. We can optimize it by using binary search, which has a time complexity of O(log n) compared to O(n) for linear search.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

const int maxn = 1e6 + 10;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;

int prime[maxn];
bool vis[maxn];
int prefix_sum[maxn];

void euler(int n) {
  memset(vis, 0, sizeof(vis));
  for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); ++i) {
    if (!vis[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j < n; j += i) {
        vis[j] = true;
      }
    }
  }
  
  prime[0] = 0;
  for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!vis[i]) {
      prime[++prime[0]] = i;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  euler(maxn - 9);
  
  prefix_sum[0] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= maxn; ++i) {
    prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + (int)(!vis[i]);
  }
  
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    if (n <= 3) {
      printf("%d\n", n);
      continue;
    }
    
    int l = 1, r = prime[0];
    
    while (l + 1 < r) {
      int mid = (r + l) / 2;
      if ((ll)prime[mid] * prime[mid] <= (ll)n) {
        l = mid;
      } else {
        r = mid;
      }
    }
    
    printf("%d\n", prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[prime[l]] + 1);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. The unnecessary headers `<bits/stdc++.h>` are removed and the required headers `<iostream>`, `<cstdio>`, `<cstring>`, and `<cmath>` are included.

2. The constants `INF`, `PI`, and `eps` are removed as they are not used.

3. The typedefs `ull` and `ll` are removed as they are not used.

4. The input reading function `read()` is replaced with the standard `scanf()` function for faster input reading.

5. The prime number generation algorithm is optimized by iterating up to the square root of `n` instead of `n`.

6. The array `ans[]` is replaced with `prefix_sum[]`, which is a prefix sum array. It stores the number of prime numbers up to a certain index. This allows us to calculate the number of prime numbers in a range using simple subtraction.

7. The linear search to find the largest prime number less than or equal to `n` is replaced with a binary search for faster search.

By making these optimizations, the program will have improved running time and memory usage.
