This program is finding the number of prime numbers less than or equal to a given number. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate the prime numbers and stores the counts in the `ans` array.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of library headers, which can slow down compilation and increase memory usage. We can remove this line and only include the necessary headers (`<cstdio>`, `<cstring>`, and `<algorithm>`) for this program.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The typedefs `ull` and `ll` are not used in the program. We can remove these lines.

3. Change the `memset` call to `std::fill`: The `memset` function is used to set the `vis` array to all `0`s. However, it can be replaced with the `std::fill` function from the `<algorithm>` header, which is more readable and efficient.

4. Simplify the prime number generation loop: The loop `for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i)` can be simplified to `for (int i = 2; i * i < n; ++i)` to reduce the number of iterations. This is because if `i` is greater than the square root of `n`, then `i * i` will be greater than `n`.

5. Remove unnecessary check for `n <= 3` in the while loop: The if condition `if (n <= 3)` can be removed from the while loop, as the binary search loop will handle the case when `n` is less than or equal to 3.

6. Use `mid = l + (r - l) / 2` instead of `mid = (r + l) / 2`: This change ensures that the binary search does not overflow when `l` and `r` are large numbers.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <algorithm>

const int maxn = 1e6 + 10;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
int prime[maxn];
bool vis[maxn];
int ans[maxn];

void euler(int n) {
  std::fill(vis, vis + n, false);
  for (int i = 2; i * i < n; ++i) {
    if (!vis[i])
      prime[++prime[0]] = i;
    for (int j = 1; j <= prime[0] && i * prime[j] < n; ++j) {
      vis[i * prime[j]] = true;
      if (i % prime[j] == 0)
        break;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  euler(maxn - 9);
  vis[1] = true;
  for (int i = 1; i <= maxn; ++i)
    ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + (int)(!vis[i]);

  int t;
  std::scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    std::scanf("%d", &n);
    int l = 1, r = prime[0];
    while (l + 1 < r) {
      int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
      if ((long long)prime[mid] * prime[mid] <= (long long)n)
        l = mid;
      else
        r = mid;
    }
    std::printf("%d\n", ans[n] - ans[prime[l]] + 1);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
