The given program calculates the value of `ans` by iterating over an array `adj` and counting the number of occurrences of each element using a `map`. The program also performs some calculations on the `adj` array based on the `val` array.

To optimize the program, we can eliminate the use of the `map` and directly calculate the number of occurrences of each element in the `adj` array. We can achieve this by using an array of counters instead of a `map`. 

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove the line `map<ull, int> mp;` since we will not be using a `map` anymore.

2. Declare a new array `counter` of size `n` to store the count of occurrences of each element in the `adj` array.

3. Modify the loop in the `solve` function as follows:
   - Remove the line `ans += mp[adj[i]]++;`.
   - Add the line `++counter[adj[i]];` to increment the count of `adj[i]` in the `counter` array.

4. Modify the loop after the second input loop as follows:
   - Remove the line `adj[i] += val[i];`.
   - Add the line `++counter[i];` to increment the count of `i` in the `counter` array.

5. Modify the loop before `solve()` as follows:
   - Replace the line `solve();` with `ans = 0;` to reset the value of `ans` before each call to `solve()`.

6. Modify the loop after `solve()` as follows:
   - Replace the line `cout << ans;` with `cout << accumulate(counter, counter + n, 0LL);` to calculate the sum of all elements in the `counter` array and output it as the result.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define ar array
#define ull unsigned ll
mt19937_64 rng(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
const int mxN = 1e6;
int n, m;
ull val[mxN], adj[mxN];
ll ans;
void solve() {
  ll counter[mxN] = {0}; // New array to store counts
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    ++counter[adj[i]]; // Increment count of adj[i]
}
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    val[i] = rng();
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v, --u, --v;
    adj[u] += val[v];
    adj[v] += val[u];
  }
  ans = 0; // Reset ans before each call to solve()
  solve();
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    adj[i] += val[i];
  ++counter[i]; // Increment count of i
  solve();
  cout << accumulate(counter, counter + n, 0LL); // Calculate sum of all elements in counter
  return 0;
}
```

By directly calculating the count of occurrences of each element in the `adj` array using an array of counters, we eliminate the need for a `map` and improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
