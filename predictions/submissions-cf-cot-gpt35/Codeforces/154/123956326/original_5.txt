Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros.

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which may slow down compilation and increase memory usage. We can replace it with the specific headers that are actually needed.

The macros `ll`, `ar`, and `ull` are not used in the program. We can remove them to make the code cleaner.

Step 2: Use a faster random number generator.

The current program uses `mt19937_64` as the random number generator. While this is a high-quality random number generator, it may not be the fastest option. We can switch to a faster random number generator, such as `rand()`.

Step 3: Use a more efficient container for the map.

The program uses a `map` to store the count of each element in `adj`. However, a `map` has a logarithmic time complexity for insertions and lookups. We can switch to an `unordered_map`, which has an average constant time complexity for these operations.

Step 4: Optimize the loop in the `solve()` function.

The loop in the `solve()` function currently iterates over each element in `adj` and updates the count in the `map`. However, we can optimize this loop by using a range-based for loop and directly accessing the elements of `adj`. This can improve performance by reducing the number of pointer dereferences.

Step 5: Optimize the loop in the `main()` function.

The loop in the `main()` function currently iterates over each element in `val` and adds it to the corresponding element in `adj`. However, we can optimize this loop by using a range-based for loop and directly accessing the elements of `adj`. This can improve performance by reducing the number of pointer dereferences.

Step 6: Optimize the final loop in the `main()` function.

The final loop in the `main()` function currently iterates over each element in `adj` and adds `val[i]` to it. However, we can optimize this loop by using a range-based for loop and directly accessing the elements of `adj`. This can improve performance by reducing the number of pointer dereferences.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <random>

const int mxN = 1e6;

int n, m;
unsigned long long val[mxN], adj[mxN];
long long ans;

void solve() {
  std::unordered_map<unsigned long long, int> mp;
  for (auto x : adj)
    ans += mp[x]++;
}

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cin >> n >> m;

  std::random_device rd;
  std::mt19937 rng(rd());

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    val[i] = rng();

  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    std::cin >> u >> v, --u, --v;
    adj[u] += val[v];
    adj[v] += val[u];
  }

  solve();

  for (auto& x : adj)
    x += val[&x - adj];

  solve();

  std::cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
