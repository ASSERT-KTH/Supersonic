To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not necessary and can increase the compilation time. We can remove it.

2. Remove unused variable: The variable `m` is declared but not used in the program. We can remove it.

3. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates `rng()` for each `val[i]` and adds it to `adj[i]` twice. We can calculate `rng()` once and store it in a variable, and then use that variable to add to `adj[i]` and `val[i]` separately.

4. Remove unnecessary type aliases: The program defines type aliases `ll`, `ar`, and `ull`, which are not used. We can remove them.

5. Avoid unnecessary use of `map`: The program uses a `map` to count the occurrences of `adj[i]`, but we can optimize this by using a simpler array since `adj[i]` is a non-negative integer. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <random>
#include <chrono>
using namespace std;

mt19937_64 rng(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
const int mxN = 1e6;
int n;
unsigned long long val[mxN], adj[mxN];
long long ans;

void solve() {
  int mp[mxN] = {0};
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    ans += mp[adj[i]]++;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cin >> n;
  unsigned long long rngVal = rng();
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    val[i] = rngVal;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v, --u, --v;
    adj[u] += val[v];
    adj[v] += val[u];
  }
  solve();
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    adj[i] += val[i];
  solve();
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:
1. Removed unnecessary includes: The unnecessary `<bits/stdc++.h>` include was removed.

2. Removed unused variable: The variable `m` was removed since it was not used in the program.

3. Avoided unnecessary calculations: Instead of calculating `rng()` for each `val[i]`, we calculate it once and store it in the `rngVal` variable. This reduces the number of calculations and improves performance.

4. Removed unnecessary type aliases: The type aliases `ll`, `ar`, and `ull` were removed since they were not used in the program.

5. Avoided unnecessary use of `map`: Instead of using a `map` to count the occurrences of `adj[i]`, we use a simpler array `mp` initialized with zeros. Since `adj[i]` is a non-negative integer, we can use its value as an index in the array `mp` to count the occurrences. This reduces memory usage and improves performance.
