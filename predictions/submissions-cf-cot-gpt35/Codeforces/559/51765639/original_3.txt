The given program seems to be a geometry-related program that calculates the total number of triangles formed by three given sides. Here are the step-by-step optimizations that can be done to improve the program:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not recommended. Instead, include only the necessary headers. In this case, we only need `<iostream>` and `<cmath>`.

2. Remove unnecessary type definitions: The program defines many typedefs for various types, which are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines many macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

4. Remove unnecessary inline functions: The program defines many inline functions that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

5. Remove unnecessary operators overloading: The program overloads operators << for various types, which are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

6. Simplify the main function: The main function can be simplified by removing unnecessary debugging code and renaming variables for better readability.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

const double PI = acos(-1);

double TriangleAreaWithSide(double a, double b, double c) {
  double s = (a + b + c) / 2;
  double area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c));
  return area;
}

int main() {
  double a[6];
  for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }
  double ang = (PI * 120.0) / 180.0;
  double x1 = sqrt(a[0] * a[0] + a[1] * a[1] - 2.0 * a[0] * a[1] * cos(ang));
  double x2 = sqrt(a[2] * a[2] + a[3] * a[3] - 2.0 * a[2] * a[3] * cos(ang));
  double x3 = sqrt(a[4] * a[4] + a[5] * a[5] - 2.0 * a[4] * a[5] * cos(ang));
  double A4 = TriangleAreaWithSide(x1, x2, x3);
  double ar = TriangleAreaWithSide(1, 1, 1);
  int tottri = static_cast<int>(A4 / ar);
  std::cout << tottri << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program removes unnecessary includes, typedefs, macros, inline functions, and operators overloading. It also simplifies the main function for better readability.
