Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files
The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. Since the program does not use all the headers included in `<bits/stdc++.h>`, we can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unused typedefs and aliases
The program includes a large number of typedefs and aliases that are not used. These can be safely removed to improve code readability and reduce memory usage.

Step 3: Replace macros with inline functions
The program uses a number of macros for common operations like checking equality, comparing floating-point numbers, etc. These macros can be replaced with inline functions to improve code readability and avoid potential issues with macro expansion.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary functions
The program includes a number of functions that are not used. These functions can be safely removed to reduce code size and improve runtime.

Step 5: Optimize the calculation of triangle areas
The program calculates the areas of triangles using the formula `(a*b/2)*sin(ang)`, where `a` and `b` are the sides of the triangle and `ang` is the angle between them. This formula can be simplified to `a*b*sin(ang)/2` to avoid unnecessary multiplication and division.

Step 6: Simplify the calculation of side lengths
The program calculates the lengths of sides using the formula `sqrt(a^2 + b^2 - 2*a*b*cos(ang))`, where `a` and `b` are the sides of the triangle and `ang` is the angle between them. This formula can be simplified using the law of cosines to `sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + 2*a*b*cos(ang))` to avoid the subtraction operation.

Step 7: Optimize the calculation of total triangles
The program calculates the total number of triangles by summing the areas of individual triangles and dividing by the area of a reference triangle. Since the area of the reference triangle is always 1, this division operation can be eliminated.

Optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

const double PI = acos(-1);

double TriangleAreaWithSide(double a, double b, double ang) {
  return a * b * sin(ang) / 2;
}

double TriangleAreaWithSides(double a, double b, double c) {
  double s = (a + b + c) / 2;
  return sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c));
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  double a[6];
  for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  double ang = (PI * 120.0) / 180.0;
  double A1 = TriangleAreaWithSide(a[0], a[1], ang);
  double A2 = TriangleAreaWithSide(a[2], a[3], ang);
  double A3 = TriangleAreaWithSide(a[4], a[5], ang);

  double x1 = sqrt(a[0]*a[0] + a[1]*a[1] + 2*a[0]*a[1]*cos(ang));
  double x2 = sqrt(a[2]*a[2] + a[3]*a[3] + 2*a[2]*a[3]*cos(ang));
  double x3 = sqrt(a[4]*a[4] + a[5]*a[5] + 2*a[4]*a[5]*cos(ang));

  double A4 = TriangleAreaWithSides(x1, x2, x3);
  double ar = TriangleAreaWithSides(1, 1, 1);

  int tottri = (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4);
  cout << tottri << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
