To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended and may slow down the compilation process. We can remove this and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs that are not used in the code. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

4. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines several inline functions that are not used in the code. We can remove these functions to simplify the code.

5. Remove unnecessary debug statements: The program defines a debug macro that is not used in the code. We can remove this macro to simplify the code.

6. Simplify calculations: The program performs some unnecessary calculations. We can simplify these calculations to improve the performance.

7. Optimize input and output: The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output. We can use faster input and output methods (`scanf` and `printf`) to improve the performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

#define PI 3.14159265358979323846

double TriangleAreaWithSide(double a, double b, double c) {
    double s = (a + b + c) / 2;
    double area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c));
    return area;
}

int main() {
    double a[6];
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        scanf("%lf", &a[i]);
    }
    double ang = (PI * 120.0) / 180.0;
    double x1 = sqrt(a[0] * a[0] + a[1] * a[1] - 2.0 * a[0] * a[1] * cos(ang));
    double x2 = sqrt(a[3] * a[3] + a[2] * a[2] - 2.0 * a[3] * a[2] * cos(ang));
    double x3 = sqrt(a[4] * a[4] + a[5] * a[5] - 2.0 * a[4] * a[5] * cos(ang));
    double A4 = TriangleAreaWithSide(x1, x2, x3);
    double ar = TriangleAreaWithSide(1, 1, 1);
    int tottri = static_cast<int>((A4 / ar) + 0.5);
    printf("%d\n", tottri);
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The program originally included `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This is not recommended and may slow down the compilation process. We removed this include and included only the necessary headers (`iostream` and `cmath`).

2. Removed unnecessary typedefs: The program originally defined several typedefs that were not used in the code. We removed these typedefs to simplify the code.

3. Removed unnecessary macros: The program originally defined several macros that were not used in the code. We removed these macros to simplify the code.

4. Removed unnecessary functions: The program originally defined several inline functions that were not used in the code. We removed these functions to simplify the code.

5. Removed unnecessary debug statements: The program originally defined a debug macro that was not used in the code. We removed this macro to simplify the code.

6. Simplified calculations: The program originally performed some unnecessary calculations. We simplified these calculations to improve the performance. Specifically, we removed the unnecessary multiplications and divisions by 2.0 and replaced them with direct calculations.

7. Optimized input and output: The program originally used `cin` and `cout` for input and output. We replaced these with faster input and output methods (`scanf` and `printf`) to improve the performance. We also used `static_cast` to convert the floating-point result of `A4 / ar` to an integer, and added 0.5 before the conversion to round the result to the nearest integer.
