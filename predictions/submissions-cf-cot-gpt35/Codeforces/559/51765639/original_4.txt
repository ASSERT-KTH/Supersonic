The given program includes a lot of unnecessary code and includes too many header files. Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes all standard library header files. However, this is not recommended as it increases compile time and may cause conflicts. Instead, include the necessary header files individually.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program includes typedefs for various types such as `ll`, `vi`, `vl`, etc. These typedefs are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program includes various macros such as `PB`, `F`, `S`, `MP`, etc. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

4. Remove unnecessary inline functions: The program includes various inline functions that are not used in the program and can be removed.

5. Remove unnecessary operator overloads: The program includes operator overloads for `<<` for various types such as `pair`, `vector`, `set`, etc. These overloads are not used in the program and can be removed.

6. Remove unnecessary debugging macros and functions: The program includes debugging macros and functions such as `dbg`, `faltu`, `timeStamp`, etc. These debugging utilities are not used in the program and can be removed.

7. Remove unnecessary variable and function declarations: The program includes variable declarations such as `dx4`, `dx8`, `dy4`, `dy8`, `eps`, `inf`, `infLL`, `MOD`, etc. These variables are not used in the program and can be removed. Similarly, the program includes function declarations such as `cmp`, `to_s`, etc. These functions are not used in the program and can be removed.

8. Optimize the calculation of `tottri`: The calculation of `tottri` can be optimized by removing the division by `ar`. Since `ar` is always equal to 0.4330127018922193 (approximately), we can multiply `A1 + A2 + A3 + A4` by `(1 / ar)` instead of dividing by `ar`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

const double PI = acos(-1);

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  double a[6];
  for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  double ang = (PI * 120.0) / 180.0;
  double A1 = ((a[0] * a[1]) / 2) * sin(ang);
  double A2 = ((a[2] * a[3]) / 2) * sin(ang);
  double A3 = ((a[4] * a[5]) / 2) * sin(ang);
  double x1 = sqrt(a[0] * a[0] + a[1] * a[1] - (2.0 * a[0] * a[1] * cos(ang)));
  double x2 = sqrt(a[3] * a[3] + a[2] * a[2] - (2.0 * a[3] * a[2] * cos(ang)));
  double x3 = sqrt(a[4] * a[4] + a[5] * a[5] - (2.0 * a[4] * a[5] * cos(ang)));
  double A4 = sqrt((x1 + x2 + x3) * (x1 + x2 - x3) * (x1 - x2 + x3) * (-x1 + x2 + x3)) / 4;
  double tottri = (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4) * (1 / 0.4330127018922193);
  cout << tottri << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes all the unnecessary code and focuses on the main calculation. It also improves the readability of the code by removing unnecessary typedefs and macros.
