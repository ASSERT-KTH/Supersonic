To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes all the standard library headers. Since this program does not use all the headers, we can remove this line and include only the required headers.

2. Remove unnecessary type definitions: The program defines several type aliases (`typedef`) that are not used in the program. We can remove these type definitions to reduce unnecessary code.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros (e.g., `PB`, `F`, `S`, `MP`, `endl`, `all`, `rall`, `sz`, etc.) that are not used in the program. We can remove these macros to reduce unnecessary code.

4. Remove unnecessary inline functions: The program defines several inline functions (e.g., `checkBit`, `setBit`, `resetBit`, etc.) that are not used in the program. We can remove these inline functions to reduce unnecessary code.

5. Remove unnecessary utility functions: The program defines several utility functions (e.g., `to_s`, `operator<<`, `faltu`, etc.) that are not used in the program. We can remove these utility functions to reduce unnecessary code.

6. Remove unnecessary constants: The program defines several constants (e.g., `eps`, `inf`, `infLL`, etc.) that are not used in the program. We can remove these constants to reduce unnecessary code.

7. Remove unnecessary debug statements: The program defines a `dbg` macro and a `timeStamp` macro for debugging purposes. Since these macros are not used in the program, we can remove them to reduce unnecessary code.

8. Remove unnecessary comments: The program includes several commented lines that are not used in the program. We can remove these commented lines to reduce unnecessary code.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    double a[6];
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    double ang = (M_PI * 120.0) / 180.0;
    double A1 = ((a[0] * a[1]) / 2) * sin(ang);
    double A2 = ((a[2] * a[3]) / 2) * sin(ang);
    double A3 = ((a[4] * a[5]) / 2) * sin(ang);
    double x1 = sqrt(pow(a[0], 2) + pow(a[1], 2) - (2.0 * a[0] * a[1] * cos(ang)));
    double x2 = sqrt(pow(a[3], 2) + pow(a[2], 2) - (2.0 * a[3] * a[2] * cos(ang)));
    double x3 = sqrt(pow(a[4], 2) + pow(a[5], 2) - (2.0 * a[4] * a[5] * cos(ang)));
    double A4 = sqrt((x1 + x2 + x3) * (x1 + x2 - x3) * (x1 - x2 + x3) * (-x1 + x2 + x3)) / 4;
    double ar = sqrt(3) / 4;
    int tottri = (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4) / ar;
    cout << tottri << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimized program removes unnecessary code and simplifies some calculations. However, it is important to note that the optimizations made in this program may not have a significant impact on the overall performance, as the program is relatively small and does not have any computationally intensive operations.
