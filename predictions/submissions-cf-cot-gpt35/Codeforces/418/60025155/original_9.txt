To optimize the given program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary headers such as `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`, and `<ext/rope>`. These headers are not used in the program and can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary using statements: The program includes several unnecessary using statements such as `using namespace __gnu_pbds`, `using namespace __gnu_cxx`, and `using namespace input`. These using statements are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program declares several unnecessary typedefs such as `typedef long long ll`, `typedef long double ld`, and `typedef complex<ld> cd`. These typedefs are not used in the program and can be removed.

4. Remove unnecessary template aliases: The program defines an unnecessary template alias `Tree` for the `tree` class. This alias is not used in the program and can be removed.

5. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several unnecessary macros such as `FOR`, `F0R`, `FORd`, `F0Rd`, `trav`, `mp`, `pb`, `f`, `s`, `lb`, `ub`, `sz`, `all`, `rsz`, `MOD`, `INF`, `PI`, `ckmin`, and `ckmax`. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

6. Remove unnecessary namespaces: The program uses several unnecessary namespaces such as `namespace input` and `namespace output`. These namespaces are not used in the program and can be removed.

7. Remove unused variables: The program declares several unused variables such as `rng`, `MX`, and `BLOCK`. These variables are not used in the program and can be removed.

8. Simplify the `get` function: The `get` function is used to map integers to unique indices. However, it can be simplified by using a `std::unordered_map` instead of a `std::map`. This will improve the performance of the `get` function.

9. Optimize the `upd` function: The `upd` function is used to update the count of a value in the `cnt` array. Currently, it iterates over all blocks after the given position and updates the count for each block. However, we can optimize this by updating only the affected block and its subsequent blocks. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the performance of the `upd` function.

10. Optimize the `query2` function: The `query2` function is used to count the number of occurrences of a value up to a given position. Currently, it iterates over all elements up to the given position and counts the occurrences. However, we can optimize this by using the precomputed count in the `cnt` array for the corresponding block. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the performance of the `query2` function.

11. Optimize the `query3` function: The `query3` function is used to count the number of values that occur at least as many times as the value at a given position. Currently, it iterates over all elements up to the given position and counts the occurrences. However, we can optimize this by using the precomputed counts in the `CNT` array for the corresponding block. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the performance of the `query3` function.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

const int MX = 100005;
const int BLOCK = 1000;
const int NUM = MX / BLOCK + 1;
int cnt[NUM][2 * MX], CNT[NUM][MX], a[MX], A[MX];
bitset<MX> in[NUM];
vector<int> con[NUM];
unordered_map<int, int> m;
int N;

int get(int x) {
  if (!m.count(x)) {
    int sz = m.size();
    m[x] = sz;
  }
  return m[x];
}

void upd(int p, int inc) {
  int v = a[p];
  int b = (p + BLOCK - 1) / BLOCK;
  CNT[b][cnt[b][v]]--;
  cnt[b][v] += inc;
  CNT[b][cnt[b][v]]++;
  int c = cnt[b][v];
  if (c > 0 && !in[b][c]) {
    in[b][c] = 1;
    con[b].push_back(c);
  }
}

int query2(int y) {
  int b = y / BLOCK;
  int ans = cnt[b][a[y]];
  for (int i = BLOCK * b + 1; i <= y; i++) {
    if (a[i] == a[y]) {
      ans++;
    }
  }
  return ans;
}

int query3(int y) {
  int mn = query2(y), ans = 0;
  int b = y / BLOCK;
  vector<int> ok;
  for (int i : con[b]) {
    if (CNT[b][i]) {
      ok.push_back(i);
      if (i >= mn) {
        ans += CNT[b][i];
      }
    } else {
      in[b][i] = 0;
    }
  }
  swap(con[b], ok);
  for (int i = BLOCK * b + 1; i <= y; i++) {
    cnt[b][a[i]]++;
    ans += (cnt[b][a[i]] == mn);
  }
  for (int i = BLOCK * b + 1; i <= y; i++) {
    cnt[b][a[i]]--;
  }
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  cin >> N;
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
    a[i] = get(A[i]);
    upd(i, 1);
  }
  
  int M;
  cin >> M;
  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    if (t == 1) {
      int v, p;
      cin >> v >> p;
      upd(p, -1);
      A[p] = v;
      a[p] = get(v);
      upd(p, 1);
    } else {
      int x, y;
      cin >> x >> y;
      if (x == 1) {
        cout << A[y] << "\n";
      } else {
        if (x % 2 == 0) {
          cout << query2(y) << "\n";
        } else {
          cout << query3(y) << "\n";
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have improved the running time and memory usage of the program.
