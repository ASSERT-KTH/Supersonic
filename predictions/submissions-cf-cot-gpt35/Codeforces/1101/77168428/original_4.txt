To optimize the given program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes almost all standard library headers. This can result in increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers that are actually used in the program.

2. Avoid unnecessary macro definitions: The program defines macros such as `fs`, `sc`, `all`, `rall`, `pb`, `MP`, `sz`, `fastio`, and `sqr`. These macros can make the code less readable and harder to understand. We can remove these macros and use the standard library functions and operations directly.

3. Replace `map<int, int>` with `vector<int>`: The program uses a `map<int, int>` to store intermediate results. However, since the keys are consecutive integers, we can use a `vector<int>` instead, which will have better performance in terms of both time and memory usage.

4. Optimize the `get` function: The `get` function is used to find the prime factors of a given number. We can optimize this function by using a more efficient algorithm such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers up to the square root of the given number. Then, we can iterate over these prime numbers and check if they divide the given number.

5. Use a `struct` instead of separate variables: The program uses separate variables `x` and `y` to store the two maximum values. We can use a `struct` to encapsulate these variables and simplify the code.

6. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the sum of `x` and `y` multiple times. We can calculate the sum only when needed, instead of recalculating it in each iteration.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

const int N = 2e5 + 100;

struct max2 {
  int x = 0, y = 0;
  max2() {}
  void rlx(int z) {
    if (z >= x) {
      y = x;
      x = z;
    } else if (z >= y) {
      y = z;
    }
  }
  int sum() { return x + y; }
};

vector<int> g[N], val(N), d(N), primes;
vector<vector<int>> dp(N);
int ans = 0;

vector<int> get(int x) {
  vector<int> ret;
  for (auto p : primes) {
    if (p * p > x) {
      break;
    }
    if (x % p == 0) {
      ret.push_back(p);
      while (x % p == 0) {
        x /= p;
      }
    }
  }
  if (x != 1) {
    ret.push_back(x);
  }
  return ret;
}

void dfs(int v, int p) {
  vector<int> cur = get(val[v]);
  vector<max2> t(cur.size());
  for (auto u : g[v]) {
    if (u == p) {
      continue;
    }
    dfs(u, v);
    for (int i = 0; i < cur.size(); i++) {
      int x = cur[i];
      if (dp[u][x] == 0) {
        continue;
      }
      t[i].rlx(dp[u][x]);
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < cur.size(); i++) {
    int x = cur[i];
    ans = max(ans, t[i].sum() + 1);
    dp[v][x] = t[i].x + 1;
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
    if (d[i] == 0) {
      d[i] = i;
      primes.push_back(i);
    }
    for (auto x : primes) {
      if (x > d[i] || x * i >= N) {
        break;
      }
      d[x * i] = x;
    }
  }

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> val[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0, a, b; i < n - 1; i++) {
    cin >> a >> b;
    a--;
    b--;
    g[a].push_back(b);
    g[b].push_back(a);
  }
  dfs(0, -1);
  cout << ans << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: Removed the `<bits/stdc++.h>` include and included only the necessary headers `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<map>`.

2. Avoided unnecessary macro definitions: Removed the unnecessary macro definitions.

3. Replaced `map<int, int>` with `vector<int>`: Replaced the `map<int, int>` with `vector<vector<int>>` to store the intermediate results. This will have better performance in terms of both time and memory usage.

4. Optimized the `get` function: Used a more efficient algorithm to find prime numbers up to the square root of the given number. Then, checked if these prime numbers divide the given number.

5. Used a `struct` instead of separate variables: Used a `struct` to encapsulate the variables `x` and `y` and simplify the code.

6. Avoided unnecessary calculations: Calculated the sum of `x` and `y` only when needed, instead of recalculating it in each iteration.
