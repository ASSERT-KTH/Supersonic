The given program can be optimized by removing unnecessary code and using a more efficient data structure.

1. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros `sz`, `all`, `rall`, and `dbg` are not used in the program. They can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers like `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, and `<queue>`.

3. Remove unused variables: The variable `dp` is declared but not used in the program. It can be removed.

4. Use `reserve` for vector: Instead of resizing the vector `a` to size `n + 1`, we can use `reserve` to allocate memory for `n + 1` elements in advance.

5. Use `priority_queue` instead of `queue`: Since we always want to process the largest element in the queue, using a `priority_queue` instead of a regular `queue` can improve performance.

6. Use a different approach to calculate the sum: Instead of using a loop with a queue, we can calculate the sum directly using a formula based on the given pattern. This will eliminate the need for a queue and reduce the time complexity.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized C++ program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<ll> a;
  a.reserve(n + 1);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ll num;
    cin >> num;
    a.push_back(num);
  }

  sort(a.begin(), a.end(), greater<ll>());

  ll sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum += (ll)(i / 3 + 1) * a[i];
  }

  cout << sum;

  return 0;
}
```
