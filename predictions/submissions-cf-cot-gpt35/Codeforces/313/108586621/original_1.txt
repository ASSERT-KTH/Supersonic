Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and definitions.
- The `bits/stdc++.h` include is not necessary and can be removed.
- The `sz`, `all`, `rall`, and `dbg` macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 2: Optimize the sorting algorithm.
- Currently, the program uses the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` library to sort the array `a`. This sorting algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n).
- Since the array `a` is already sorted in ascending order, we can optimize the sorting algorithm by removing the sorting step altogether.

Step 3: Optimize the queue implementation.
- The program uses a `queue` to process the elements of the array `a` in a specific order.
- However, the queue implementation used in the program is not efficient. It adds unnecessary elements to the queue and does not make use of the sorted nature of the array `a`.
- We can optimize the queue implementation by using a simple loop instead of a queue. The loop will process the elements of the array `a` in the required order.

Step 4: Optimize the sum calculation.
- The current program calculates the sum of the elements of the array `a` by adding each element to the variable `sum` one by one.
- We can optimize the sum calculation by using the mathematical formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `sum = (n / 2) * (first + last)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the series, `first` is the first element, and `last` is the last element.
- In this case, `n` is equal to the number of elements in the array `a`, `first` is equal to `a[1]`, and `last` is equal to `a[n]`.

Step 5: Update the comments and generate the optimized program.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<ll> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }

  sort(a.begin(), a.end());

  ll sum = (n / 2) * (a[0] + a[n-1]);

  cout << sum;
}
```
