To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation time. We can replace it with the specific headers that are actually used in the program.

2. Avoid using macros for function-like operations: The `sz`, `all`, and `rall` macros are used to calculate the size of a container, and to get iterators for the beginning and end of a container. Instead of using macros, we can use inline functions or templates, which are more type-safe and easier to debug.

3. Remove the `dbg` macro: The `dbg` macro is used for debugging purposes, but it is not necessary for the optimized program. We can safely remove it.

4. Replace `typedef` with `using`: The `typedef` syntax can be replaced with the more modern `using` syntax for type aliases.

5. Use `reserve` for the vector: Since the size of the vector `a` is known before inserting elements, we can use the `reserve` function to allocate memory for the vector upfront, avoiding unnecessary reallocations.

6. Use a `priority_queue` instead of a `queue`: Since we are pushing elements in descending order, it is more efficient to use a `priority_queue` (implemented as a binary heap) instead of a `queue` (implemented as a deque).

7. Replace the `for` loop with a `while` loop: Instead of using a `for` loop to push elements into the queue, we can use a `while` loop with a counter to push a fixed number of elements into the queue.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

const int N = 2e6 + 6;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<ll> a;
  a.reserve(n + 1);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ll x;
    cin >> x;
    a.push_back(x);
  }

  sort(a.begin(), a.end(), greater<ll>());

  int root = n - 1;
  ll sum = 0;
  priority_queue<int> q;
  q.push(n);

  while (!q.empty()) {
    int top = q.top();
    q.pop();

    sum += a[top - 1];
    if (top == 1)
      break;

    q.push(top);
    int count = min(root, 3);
    root -= count;
    while (count--)
      q.push(root--);
  }

  cout << sum;

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary headers: The program now only includes the necessary headers `iostream`, `vector`, `queue`, and `algorithm`.

2. Avoided using macros for function-like operations: The `sz`, `all`, and `rall` macros are replaced with the `size`, `begin`, and `end` functions respectively.

3. Removed the `dbg` macro: The `dbg` macro is no longer used in the optimized program.

4. Replaced `typedef` with `using`: The `typedef` syntax is replaced with the `using` syntax for type aliases.

5. Used `reserve` for the vector: The `a` vector now uses the `reserve` function to allocate memory upfront for `n + 1` elements.

6. Used a `priority_queue` instead of a `queue`: The `queue` is replaced with a `priority_queue` to store the elements in descending order.

7. Replaced the `for` loop with a `while` loop: The `for` loop for pushing elements into the queue is replaced with a `while` loop that uses a counter to push a fixed number of elements into the queue.
