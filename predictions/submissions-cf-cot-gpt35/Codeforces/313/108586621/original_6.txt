To optimize the given program, I would make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#define` macros for `sz()`, `all()`, `rall()`, and `dbg()`. These macros are not used in the program and can be safely removed.

2. Replace the `vector<ll> a(n + 1)` with a simple array `ll a[N]`. This will save memory by not dynamically allocating memory for the vector.

3. Instead of using a `queue<int> q` to process the elements, I will use a simple loop with a variable `top` to keep track of the current element being processed. This will avoid the overhead of using a queue and improve performance.

4. Instead of pushing elements into the queue in each iteration of the loop, I will directly increment the `top` variable by 3. This will eliminate the need for the `root` variable and simplify the logic.

5. Finally, I will remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and the unused `dp` array.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int N = 2e6 + 6;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  ll a[N];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  sort(a, a + n);

  ll sum = 0;
  int top = n - 1;
  while (top >= 0) {
    sum += a[top];
    if (top == 0)
      break;
    top -= 3;
  }
  cout << sum;
}
```
