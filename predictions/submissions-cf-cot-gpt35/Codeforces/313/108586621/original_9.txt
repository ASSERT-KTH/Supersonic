Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove it.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
The program defines several macros (`sz`, `all`, `rall`, `dbg`) that are not used in the program. We can remove them.

Step 3: Optimize input/output streams
The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output, which can be slow for large inputs/outputs. We can optimize this by adding the following line at the beginning of the program:
```
std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
std::cin.tie(NULL);
```

Step 4: Optimize memory usage
The program uses a vector `a` of size `n+1`, which can be quite large. We can reduce the memory usage by changing it to a vector of size `n` and shifting the indices by 1.

Step 5: Optimize the loop for pushing elements into the queue
The program pushes `root--` into the queue three times in each iteration of the loop. We can optimize this by pushing `root` into the queue once and then decrementing it by 3.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<long long> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());

  int root = n - 1;
  long long sum = 0;
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(n);
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int top = q.front();
    q.pop();
    sum += a[top-1];
    if (top == 1)
      break;
    q.push(top);
    root -= 3;
    q.push(root);
  }
  cout << sum;
}
```
