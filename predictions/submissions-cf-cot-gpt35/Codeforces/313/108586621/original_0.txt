Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes the entire standard library, which is unnecessary for this program. We can remove this line.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

The `sz`, `all`, `rall`, and `dbg` macros are not used in the program. We can remove these macros.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary typedefs

The `ll` and `ull` typedefs are not used in the program. We can remove these typedefs.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary constant

The `N` constant is not used in the program. We can remove this constant.

Step 5: Optimize sorting

The `sort(all(a))` call sorts the entire vector `a`, which is unnecessary. We can optimize the sorting by using `partial_sort` to only sort the first `n` elements of `a`.

Step 6: Optimize queue initialization

The `q.push(n)` call initializes the queue with a single element `n`. We can optimize this by initializing the queue with a range of elements from `n` to `1` using the `queue` constructor.

Step 7: Optimize sum calculation

The sum is currently calculated by adding each element of `a` one by one. We can optimize this by calculating the sum directly using a mathematical formula, which would reduce the time complexity.

Step 8: Remove unnecessary break

The `break` statement inside the while loop is unnecessary as the loop condition will naturally exit when the queue is empty. We can remove this `break` statement.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<long long> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  partial_sort(a.begin(), a.begin() + n, a.end(), greater<long long>());

  long long sum = 0;
  queue<int> q(n);
  for (int i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
    sum += a[i-1];
    for (int j = 1; j <= 3 && i - j >= 1; j++) {
      q.push(i - j);
    }
  }

  cout << sum << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
