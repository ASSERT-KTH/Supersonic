The given program contains a lot of unnecessary code and includes, which can be removed to improve the running time and memory usage. 

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes all the standard C++ libraries, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove this include statement.

2. The `#include <fstream>` is not used in the program, so we can remove this include statement as well.

3. The `FAST` macro uses `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0)` and `cin.tie(0)` to improve the input/output performance. However, this is not necessary for this program, so we can remove the `FAST` macro.

4. There are several unnecessary macro definitions such as `ll`, `ll2`, `dob`, `mp(x, y)`, `pi`, `pb(x)`, `deb(x)`, `deb2(x, y)`, `deb3(x, y, z)`, `ff`, `ss`, `forr(z, y)`, `rfor(z, y)`, `Vp`, `V`, `sort(a)`, `rev(a)`, `M`, `fix`, `MOD`, and `nax`. Since they are not used in the program, we can remove these macro definitions.

5. The variable `x` is declared but not used in the program. We can remove this variable.

6. The variable `m` is declared but not used in the program. We can remove this variable.

7. The variable `j` is declared but not used in the program. We can remove this variable.

8. The variable `k` is declared but not used in the program. We can remove this variable.

9. The variable `Vp` is declared but not used in the program. We can remove this variable.

10. The `sort(a)` macro is defined, but it is not used in the program. We can remove this macro definition.

11. The `rev(a)` macro is defined, but it is not used in the program. We can remove this macro definition.

12. The `M` macro is defined, but it is not used in the program. We can remove this macro definition.

13. The `fix` macro is defined, but it is not used in the program. We can remove this macro definition.

14. The `const int nax = 1e6 + 10;` is declared but not used in the program. We can remove this variable.

15. The variable `i` is declared outside the main loop, but it is only used within the loop. We can declare `i` inside the loop to limit its scope.

16. The variable `t` is initialized to 1 and then immediately read from input. We can remove the initialization and directly read `t` from input.

17. The variable `n` is declared twice, once before the input loop and once inside the loop. We can remove the first declaration and use the variable declared inside the loop.

18. The `string s` is declared inside the loop, but it is not necessary to declare it inside the loop. We can declare it before the loop.

19. The `vector<ll> left(n + 1, 0)` and `vector<ll> right(n + 1, 0)` are initialized with all zeros, but we can optimize this by using `vector<ll> left(n + 1)` and `vector<ll> right(n + 1)` to save memory.

20. The loop variable `i` is used for both the outer and inner loops. This can cause confusion and potential bugs. We can change the loop variable for the inner loop to `j` to avoid confusion.

21. The variable `star` is used to count the number of stars in the string. However, we can optimize this by using a single variable `starCount` and incrementing it directly in the loop instead of using an if-else statement.

22. The loop for calculating `left` can be optimized by removing the if-else statement and directly calculating the value based on the current character.

23. The loop for calculating `right` can be optimized by removing the if-else statement and directly calculating the value based on the current character.

24. The two loops for calculating `ans` can be combined into a single loop to reduce redundancy.

25. The `LLONG_MAX` can be replaced with `numeric_limits<ll>::max()` for better readability.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    vector<ll> left(n + 1), right(n + 1);
    ll starCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      left[i + 1] = left[i] + starCount;
      if (s[i] == '*') {
        starCount++;
      }
    }
    starCount = 0;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      right[i] = right[i + 1] + starCount;
      if (s[i] == '*') {
        starCount++;
      }
    }
    ll ans = numeric_limits<ll>::max();
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      ans = min(ans, left[i] + right[i]);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      ans = min(ans, left[i] + right[i - 1]);
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
