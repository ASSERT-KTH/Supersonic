The given program calculates the minimum number of stars needed to be added in a string to make it balanced. The original program uses a vector to store the number of stars on the left and right of each position in the string. Then it calculates the minimum number of stars needed at each position to make the string balanced.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<fstream>` which are not used. We can remove them.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary variable declarations: The program declares several variables that are not used. We can remove them to reduce memory usage.

4. Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`: Using `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout` can improve the input/output speed.

5. Use `vector.reserve()` to allocate memory: The program uses vectors to store the number of stars on the left and right of each position. We can use `vector.reserve()` to preallocate memory for these vectors, reducing the number of reallocations and improving performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    int t;
    scanf("%d", &t);
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        scanf("%d", &n);
        string s;
        cin >> s;

        vector<int> left, right;
        left.reserve(n + 1);
        right.reserve(n + 1);

        int star = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s[i] == '.') {
                left.push_back(left.back() + star);
            } else {
                star++;
                left.push_back(left.back());
            }
        }

        star = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] == '.') {
                right.push_back(right.back() + star);
            } else {
                star++;
                right.push_back(right.back());
            }
        }

        int ans = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            ans = min(ans, left[i] + right[i]);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ans = min(ans, left[i] + right[i - 1]);
        }

        printf("%d\n", ans);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we have removed unnecessary code and made small modifications to improve performance. The program now uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output, and preallocates memory for the vectors `left` and `right` using `reserve()`. These optimizations should result in faster execution and reduced memory usage.
