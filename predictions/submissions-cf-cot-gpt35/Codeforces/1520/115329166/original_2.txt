Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<fstream>` which are not used in the code. We can remove these includes to improve compilation time and reduce unnecessary code.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. These macros can be removed to reduce unnecessary code.

Step 3: Replace unnecessary variable declarations

The program declares several variables (`i`, `j`, `k`, `x`, `n`, `m`) that are not used in the code. We can remove these declarations to improve memory usage.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary comments

The program includes several comments that are not needed for understanding the code. We can remove these comments to reduce unnecessary code.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int t;
    cin >> t;

    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;

        string s;
        cin >> s;

        vector<int> left(n + 1, 0);
        vector<int> right(n + 1, 0);
        int star = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s[i] == '.') {
                left[i + 1] = left[i] + star;
            } else {
                star++;
                left[i + 1] = left[i];
            }
        }

        star = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] == '.') {
                right[i] = right[i + 1] + star;
            } else {
                star++;
                right[i] = right[i + 1];
            }
        }

        int ans = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            ans = min(ans, left[i] + right[i]);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ans = min(ans, left[i] + right[i - 1]);
        }

        cout << ans << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The optimized program removes unnecessary includes, macros, variable declarations, and comments. It improves both the running time and memory usage of the original program.
