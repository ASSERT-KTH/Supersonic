The given program seems to be solving a dynamic programming problem. However, there are a few optimizations that can be made to improve its performance:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes many unnecessary header files that are not being used. Removing these header files will improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Use a more efficient data structure for `dp` and `lazy` arrays: Currently, the program uses arrays to store the dynamic programming values and lazy propagation values. However, using a `vector` instead of an array can improve memory usage and allow for dynamic resizing if needed.

3. Initialize `dp` and `lazy` vectors with the required size: The program initializes `dp` and `lazy` vectors with a fixed size of 2,000,000. However, the actual size required depends on the value of `n`. Initializing these vectors with the exact required size will reduce memory usage.

4. Use a constant for `1e18`: The program uses the value `1e18` multiple times. Instead of computing this value every time, it can be assigned to a constant variable.

5. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The program makes unnecessary function calls to the `push` function. By removing these calls, we can reduce the number of function calls and improve performance.

6. Optimize the loop in the `solve` function: The loop in the `solve` function can be optimized to reduce unnecessary function calls and improve performance.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")
#pragma GCC target("sse,sse2,sse3,ssse3,sse4,popcnt,abm,mmx,avx,tune=native")
#pragma comment(linker, "/stack:200000000")
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

const int INF = 1e18;

vector<int> dp;
vector<int> lazy;

void push(int id, int l, int r) {
  dp[id] = min(dp[id], lazy[id]);
  if (l != r) {
    lazy[id << 1] = min(lazy[id << 1], lazy[id]);
    lazy[id << 1 | 1] = min(lazy[id << 1 | 1], lazy[id]);
  }
  lazy[id] = INF;
}

void upd(int id, int l, int r, int lq, int rq, int val) {
  push(id, l, r);
  if (l > r || l > rq || r < lq)
    return;
  if (lq <= l and r <= rq) {
    lazy[id] = min(lazy[id], val);
    push(id, l, r);
    return;
  }
  int mid = (l + r) >> 1;
  upd(id << 1, l, mid, lq, rq, val);
  upd(id << 1 | 1, mid + 1, r, lq, rq, val);
  dp[id] = min(dp[id << 1], dp[id << 1 | 1]);
}

int get(int id, int l, int r, int lq, int rq) {
  push(id, l, r);
  if (l > r || l > rq || r < lq)
    return INF;
  if (lq <= l and r <= rq)
    return dp[id];
  int mid = (l + r) >> 1;
  return min(get(id << 1, l, mid, lq, rq),
             get(id << 1 | 1, mid + 1, r, lq, rq));
}

void solve() {
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  int m = 2 * n;

  dp.resize(m + 1, INF);
  lazy.resize(m + 1, INF);

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (i == 1)
      upd(1, 1, m, i, i, i);
    else
      upd(1, 1, m, i, i, get(1, 1, m, i - 1, i - 1) + i);
    
    if (i <= k + 1 && s[i - 1] == '1')
      upd(1, 1, m, i + 1, i + k, i);
    else if (s[i - 1] == '1' && i >= k + 2) {
      int gg = get(1, 1, m, i - k - 1, i);
      upd(1, 1, m, i - k, i + k, gg + i);
    }
  }
  
  cout << get(1, 1, m, n, n) << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int test = 1;
  while (test--) {
    solve();
  }
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary header files: The program only requires `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<map>` header files. The other header files are not needed and have been removed.

2. Used `vector` for `dp` and `lazy` arrays: Instead of using fixed-size arrays, `dp` and `lazy` arrays have been replaced with `vector` containers. This allows for dynamic resizing and reduces memory usage.

3. Initialized `dp` and `lazy` vectors with the required size: The vectors are now initialized with the exact required size of `m + 1` instead of a fixed size of 2,000,000. This reduces memory usage.

4. Used a constant for `1e18`: The value `1e18` has been assigned to the constant variable `INF`. This avoids computing the value multiple times and improves performance.

5. Avoided unnecessary function calls: Unnecessary function calls to the `push` function have been removed. This reduces the number of function calls and improves performance.

6. Optimized the loop in the `solve` function: The loop in the `solve` function has been optimized to avoid unnecessary function calls. The logic for updating `dp` and `lazy` values has been simplified and optimized. This improves the overall performance of the program.
