Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files.

The program includes many header files that are not used in the code. These unnecessary header files can be removed to improve the compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives.

The program includes several preprocessor directives that are not used in the code. These directives can be removed to improve the compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 3: Optimize the sieve function.

The sieve function is used to calculate the smallest prime factor for each number up to MAXN. However, it can be optimized by skipping even numbers and starting the loop from 3 instead of 2. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the performance of the function.

Step 4: Optimize the getfactor function.

The getfactor function is used to calculate the prime factors of a given number. However, it can be optimized by using a while loop instead of a for loop. This will avoid unnecessary iterations and improve the performance of the function.

Step 5: Optimize the power function.

The power function is used to calculate the power of a number. However, it can be optimized by using a binary exponentiation algorithm instead of a naive approach. This will reduce the number of multiplications and improve the performance of the function.

Step 6: Optimize the gcd function.

The gcd function is used to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers. However, it can be optimized by using the Euclidean algorithm instead of a recursive approach. This will reduce the number of function calls and improve the performance of the function.

Step 7: Optimize the inverse function.

The inverse function is used to calculate the modular inverse of a number. However, it can be optimized by using the extended Euclidean algorithm instead of a naive approach. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the performance of the function.

Step 8: Optimize the ncr function.

The ncr function is used to calculate the binomial coefficient. However, it can be optimized by calculating the factorials and inverse factorials once and reusing them in each calculation. This will avoid unnecessary calculations and improve the performance of the function.

Step 9: Optimize the push function.

The push function is used to update the lazy values in the segment tree. However, it can be optimized by checking if the lazy value is already smaller than the current value. This will avoid unnecessary updates and improve the performance of the function.

Step 10: Optimize the upd function.

The upd function is used to update the segment tree. However, it can be optimized by checking if the current segment is completely outside the query range. This will avoid unnecessary updates and improve the performance of the function.

Step 11: Optimize the get function.

The get function is used to query the segment tree. However, it can be optimized by checking if the current segment is completely outside the query range. This will avoid unnecessary queries and improve the performance of the function.
