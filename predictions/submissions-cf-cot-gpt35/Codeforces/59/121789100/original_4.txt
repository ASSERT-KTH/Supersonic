Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Avoid using the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library: The `bits/stdc++.h` library includes all the standard C++ libraries, which can increase the compilation time and memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary standard libraries.

2. Avoid unnecessary namespace usage: Instead of using the entire `std` namespace, we can use specific namespaces for the required functions and classes.

3. Use a more appropriate data type: The variable `i` is declared as `short`, which is a 16-bit signed integer. However, using `int` would be more appropriate and could potentially improve performance.

4. Avoid unnecessary variable assignments: The variable `i` is assigned twice unnecessarily. We can initialize it directly in the for loop declaration.

5. Optimize the counting of lowercase characters: Instead of using a loop to count the number of lowercase characters, we can utilize the `count_if` function from the `<algorithm>` library. This function allows us to count the number of elements in a range that satisfy a given condition.

6. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The `transform` function is called twice with the same parameters. We can avoid this redundancy by storing the result of the first `transform` call and using it later if needed.

7. Optimize the transformation of characters: Instead of transforming the entire string to lowercase and then transforming it to uppercase (or vice versa), we can directly modify the characters in the string using the `toupper` and `tolower` functions.

8. Reduce memory usage: The original program does not utilize much memory. However, we can further reduce memory usage by avoiding unnecessary string copies and using in-place transformations.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::string s;
  std::cin >> s;

  int lowercaseCount = std::count_if(s.begin(), s.end(), [](char c) {
    return c > 96;
  });

  if (lowercaseCount < s.size() - lowercaseCount)
  {
    std::transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), ::toupper);
  }
  else
  {
    std::transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), ::tolower);
  }

  std::cout << s;

  return 0;
}
```
