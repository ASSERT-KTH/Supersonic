The given program counts the number of lowercase letters in a given string and then converts the string to either all uppercase or all lowercase letters based on the count of lowercase letters.

To optimize this program for running time and memory usage, we can eliminate the need for counting the lowercase letters separately. Instead, we can directly iterate over the characters of the string and convert them to either uppercase or lowercase based on their ASCII values.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cctype>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string s;
  cin >> s;

  for (char& c : s) {
    if (islower(c)) {
      c = toupper(c);
    } else {
      c = tolower(c);
    }
  }

  cout << s;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization:

1. We remove the unnecessary include of `<bits/stdc++.h>` and include only the required headers `<iostream>` and `<cctype>`.

2. We replace the `short` data type with `char` for the loop variable `i` as it is sufficient for our purpose.

3. Instead of counting the lowercase letters separately, we use the `islower` function from `<cctype>` to check if a character is lowercase.

4. We use a range-based for loop to directly iterate over the characters of the string `s` and convert them to uppercase or lowercase using the `toupper` and `tolower` functions from `<cctype>`.

5. We remove the unnecessary variable `i` and the calculation `i = s.size() - t` as it is no longer needed.

By directly iterating over the characters and performing the conversion, we eliminate the need for counting and comparing the lowercase letter count separately, resulting in a more optimized program.
