The given program takes a string as input, counts the number of lowercase characters in the string, and then converts the string to either uppercase or lowercase based on the count.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header. This header includes a large number of other headers, which can increase compilation time and memory usage.

2. Instead of using the `string` class, we can use a character array to store the input string. This can reduce memory usage as we don't need the extra overhead of the `string` class.

3. Instead of iterating over the characters of the string using the `size()` function in each iteration of the loop, we can store the size of the string in a variable before the loop. This can improve performance by avoiding a function call in each iteration.

4. Instead of using the `transform` function twice, we can use a single `transform` function call with a custom lambda function. This can reduce the number of function calls and improve performance.

5. We can also remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` statement to avoid importing the entire `std` namespace into the global namespace.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  constexpr int MAX_LENGTH = 1000000;
  char s[MAX_LENGTH];
  std::cin >> s;

  int t = 0;
  int size = strlen(s);
  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    if (s[i] > 96)
      t++;
  }
  
  if (t < size - t) {
    std::transform(s, s + size, s, [](unsigned char c) { return std::toupper(c); });
  } else {
    std::transform(s, s + size, s, [](unsigned char c) { return std::tolower(c); });
  }

  std::cout << s;
  return 0;
}
```
