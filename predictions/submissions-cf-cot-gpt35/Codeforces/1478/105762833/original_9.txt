Optimization:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can significantly increase the compilation time and memory usage. We can remove this include statement and include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid unnecessary copying: The `log_c` function copies the elements of the container `c` to `std::clog`, which can be avoided to reduce memory usage. Since this function is not used in the program, we can remove it.

3. Avoid unnecessary conversions: The `sz` function converts the size of a container to an integer, which is unnecessary. We can remove this function and use the `size()` member function directly.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program initializes the `tab` vector with a size of `10 * d + d`, but then it uses `sz(tab)` multiple times in the loops. We can store the size in a variable before the loops to avoid unnecessary calculations.

5. Avoid unnecessary iterations: The program uses nested loops to update the `tab` vector. However, it updates the vector for all possible combinations of indices, even though some combinations are not necessary. We can optimize this by breaking the innermost loop when `k + j * l` exceeds the size of the `tab` vector.

6. Avoid unnecessary comparisons: The program checks whether `ak` is greater than or equal to `sz(tab)` and whether `tab[ak]` is true. We can optimize this by first checking if `ak` is less than `sz(tab)` and then accessing `tab[ak]` directly.

7. Optimize input/output: The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output, which can be slower compared to other input/output methods. We can use `scanf` and `printf` functions from the C standard library for faster input/output.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_SIZE = 100001;

void solve() {
  int n, d;
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &d);

  vector<bool> tab(10 * d + d);
  for (int k = 0; k < tab.size(); ++k) {
    tab[k] = k % 10 == d || (k / 10) == d;
  }

  for (int k = 0; k < tab.size(); ++k) {
    if (tab[k]) {
      for (int j = 0; j < tab.size(); ++j) {
        if (tab[j]) {
          for (int l = 0; l < tab.size(); ++l) {
            if (k + j * l >= tab.size()) {
              break;
            }
            tab[k + j * l] = true;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
    int ak;
    scanf("%d", &ak);
    printf("%s\n", (ak < tab.size() && tab[ak]) ? "YES" : "NO");
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);

  int test_sample_count;
  scanf("%d", &test_sample_count);

  while (test_sample_count--) {
    solve();
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- I removed the unnecessary includes and function definitions to reduce the memory usage.
- I replaced the unnecessary conversions and copying with simpler and more efficient alternatives.
- I optimized the loops to avoid unnecessary iterations and comparisons.
- I replaced the input/output operations with faster alternatives from the C standard library.
