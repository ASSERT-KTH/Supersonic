The given program is a solution to a coding problem. It takes multiple test cases as input and for each test case, it checks if a given number `ak` satisfies a certain condition based on the values in the `tab` vector.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a non-standard header and includes a large number of headers. We can remove this include and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused macros: The `forn` and `all` macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Remove unused functions: The `log_c` function is not used in the program and can be removed.

4. Optimize the `tab` vector initialization: Currently, the `tab` vector is initialized with a size of `10 * d + d` and then all the elements are set based on certain conditions. We can optimize this initialization by using a boolean array instead of a vector and setting the values directly without using nested loops.

5. Optimize the inner loop: The innermost loop in the program can be optimized by removing the check `k + j * l < sz(tab)` and directly accessing the elements of the `tab` array without checking the index.

6. Replace `std::endl` with `"\n"`: Using `std::endl` flushes the output stream, which can be a performance bottleneck. We can replace it with `"\n"` to improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

const string eol = "\n";

void solve() {
  int n, d;
  cin >> n >> d;
  
  bool tab[100 * d + d];
  for (int k = 0; k < 100 * d + d; ++k) {
    tab[k] = k % 10 == d || (k / 10) == d;
  }

  for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
    int ak;
    cin >> ak;
    cout << (ak >= 100 * d + d || tab[ak] ? "YES" : "NO") << eol;
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);

  int test_sample_count;
  cin >> test_sample_count;
  
  while (test_sample_count--) {
    solve();
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program improves the initialization of the `tab` array and the inner loop, resulting in better running time and memory usage.
