The given program is a C++ program that calculates the distance between two nodes in a tree. The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to calculate the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes. It then uses the LCA to calculate the distance between the two nodes.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the "bits/stdc++.h" header file, which includes a large number of standard library header files. This can increase the compilation time and memory usage. Instead, we can include only the necessary header files such as `<iostream>`, `<algorithm>`, and `<set>`.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros such as `ll`, `fast`, `mp`, `pb`, `mem1`, `mem0`, and `file`. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Replace `set` with `vector`: The program uses a set data structure to store the adjacency list of each node. However, a set is not necessary for this task as the program does not require the nodes to be stored in a sorted order. We can replace the set with a vector to improve the performance.

4. Avoid redundant calculations: The program calculates the LCA and distance between two nodes multiple times, even when they have already been calculated. We can optimize this by storing the LCA and distance in variables and reusing them when needed.

5. Use a more efficient data structure for storing the LCA: The program uses a 2D array to store the LCA of each node. This requires O(n^2) space, which can be memory-intensive for large trees. We can optimize this by using a more efficient data structure such as a binary lifting algorithm or a sparse table.

6. Avoid redundant DFS calls: The program makes multiple DFS calls to calculate the size of each subtree and find the centroid of the tree. These DFS calls can be avoided by modifying the DFS function to return the size of each subtree and the centroid directly.

7. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The program makes unnecessary function calls to update the distances and calculate the answer. We can optimize this by updating the distances and calculating the answer directly in the main loop.

8. Use a more efficient algorithm for updating distances: The program uses a recursive function to update the distances between nodes. This can be inefficient for large trees. We can optimize this by using an iterative algorithm such as a breadth-first search (BFS).

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized program:
