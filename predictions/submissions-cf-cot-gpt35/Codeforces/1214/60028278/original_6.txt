This program is solving a maze problem using DFS (Depth First Search). It checks if there is a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the maze.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes unnecessary header files like `<algorithm>`, `<cstring>`, `<map>`, and `<vector>`. Since these header files are not being used in the program, we can remove them.

2. Remove unnecessary global variables: The program declares unnecessary global variables `ans` and `q`. Since they are not being used, we can remove them.

3. Use pass-by-reference for the `dfs` function: The `dfs` function is currently using pass-by-value for the `x` and `y` parameters. We can optimize this by using pass-by-reference to avoid unnecessary copying of variables.

4. Use a visited array instead of a map: The program uses a map `vis` to keep track of visited cells in the maze. However, a simple boolean array can be used instead, which will save memory and improve performance.

5. Use a faster input/output mechanism: The program currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output. However, these functions are slower compared to the C standard input/output functions `scanf` and `printf`. We can modify the program to use `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

const int maxn = 1e6 + 5;
int n, m;
string mz[maxn];
bool vis[maxn];

bool dfs(int& x, int& y) {
  if (x >= n || y >= m || mz[x][y] == '#' || vis[x * m + y])
    return false;
  if (x == n - 1 && y == m - 1)
    return true;
  if (x || y)
    vis[x * m + y] = true;
  return dfs(++x, y) || dfs(--x, ++y);
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    char str[1005];
    scanf("%s", str);
    mz[i] = str;
  }
  int x = 0, y = 0;
  if (!dfs(x, y))
    printf("0");
  else {
    vis[0] = false;
    if (!dfs(x, y))
      printf("1");
    else
      printf("2");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary header files, global variables, and uses pass-by-reference for the `dfs` function. It also uses a boolean array instead of a map for tracking visited cells. Additionally, it uses `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output.
