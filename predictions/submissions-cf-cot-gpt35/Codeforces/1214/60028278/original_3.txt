Explanation:

1. The algorithm uses a depth-first search (DFS) to find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid. The grid is represented by a 2D array "mz" of size n x m, where '#' represents an obstacle and '.' represents an empty cell.

2. The DFS function checks if a cell is out of bounds, contains an obstacle, or has already been visited. If any of these conditions are met, the function returns false. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself on the neighboring cells until it reaches the bottom-right corner or finds no valid path.

3. The main function reads the input, calls the DFS function, and prints the result.

Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files such as <algorithm>, <cstring>, <map>, <stdio.h>, and <vector>. Since these header files are not used in the program, they can be removed to reduce unnecessary compile time and memory usage.

2. Replace "string" with "char": The grid cells are represented as strings of length 1. Instead of using strings, we can use characters (char) to represent the cells, which will reduce the memory usage.

3. Use a 2D array instead of a vector of strings: The grid "mz" can be represented as a 2D character array instead of a vector of strings. This will reduce the memory overhead of storing each string object.

4. Remove unnecessary "vis" array: The "vis" array is used to mark visited cells. However, it is not necessary to use this array since the DFS function can directly check if a cell has been visited by checking if it is out of bounds or contains an obstacle.

5. Change the DFS function to return early: Currently, the DFS function continues to explore all possible paths even after finding a valid path. We can modify the DFS function to return early as soon as a valid path is found, which will improve the running time.

6. Replace cin/cout with scanf/printf: The program uses cin/cout for input/output, which can be slower than scanf/printf for large input/output. We can replace cin/cout with scanf/printf to improve the running time.

Optimized Code:

```
#include <stdio.h>

const int maxn = 1005;
int n, m;
char mz[maxn][maxn];

bool dfs(int x, int y) {
  if (x >= n || y >= m || mz[x][y] == '#')
    return false;
  if (x == n - 1 && y == m - 1)
    return true;
  return dfs(x + 1, y) || dfs(x, y + 1);
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%s", mz[i]);
  }
  if (!dfs(0, 0))
    printf("0");
  else {
    if (!dfs(0, 0))
      printf("1");
    else
      printf("2");
  }
  return 0;
}
