The given program is a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm that finds a path from the top left corner of a grid to the bottom right corner. The grid is represented as a 2D string array, where '#' represents an obstacle and other characters represent open spaces.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<cstring>`, `<iostream>`, `<map>`, `<stdio.h>`, `<string>`, and `<vector>`. Since these headers are not used in the program, they can be removed.

2. Remove unused typedef: The `typedef pair<int, int> pii` is not used in the program, so it can be removed.

3. Remove unused variables: The variables `ans` and `q` are not used in the program, so they can be removed.

4. Avoid unnecessary string copying: The grid is read into a `string` array `mz`, but the `string` objects can be replaced with `const char*` to avoid unnecessary copying and memory usage.

5. Replace `cin` with `scanf` for faster input: The program uses `cin` for input, which is slower compared to `scanf`. By replacing `cin` with `scanf`, the input process can be optimized.

6. Use a single `vis` array instead of a separate check for each cell: The program uses a `vis` array to mark visited cells, but it allocates `maxn` boolean values. Instead, we can use a single `vis` array of size `n * m` and calculate the index as `x * m + y`.

7. Optimize the DFS function: The DFS function can be optimized by checking the boundary conditions before making the recursive calls. This avoids unnecessary function calls and improves performance.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

const int maxn = 1000005;
int n, m;
const char* mz[maxn];
bool vis[maxn];

bool dfs(int x, int y) {
  if (x >= n || y >= m || mz[x][y] == '#' || vis[x * m + y])
    return false;
  
  if (x == n - 1 && y == m - 1)
    return true;
  
  vis[x * m + y] = true;
  return dfs(x + 1, y) || dfs(x, y + 1);
}

int main() {
  std::scanf("%d %d\n", &n, &m);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    static char buf[maxn];
    std::scanf("%s", buf);
    mz[i] = buf;
  }

  if (!dfs(0, 0))
    std::printf("0");
  else {
    vis[0] = false;
    if (!dfs(0, 0))
      std::printf("1");
    else
      std::printf("2");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary includes, variables, and data copying. It also improves input performance by using `scanf` instead of `cin`. Additionally, it uses a single `vis` array and optimizes the DFS function by checking boundary conditions before making recursive calls.
