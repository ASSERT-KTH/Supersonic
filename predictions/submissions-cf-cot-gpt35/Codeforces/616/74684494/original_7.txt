The given program is a solution to a problem that finds the longest subarray with at most k distinct elements in an array of integers. The program uses a sliding window approach to solve the problem.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<algorithm>` header file, but there is no use of any algorithm functions. We can remove this header file.

2. Replace C-style arrays with std::vector: The program uses C-style arrays for `x` and `freq`. We can replace them with `std::vector` to have dynamic size and better memory management.

3. Initialize vectors with the required size: Instead of initializing `freq` with a fixed size of 1000000, we can initialize it with the maximum possible number of distinct elements (k) to reduce memory usage.

4. Avoid unnecessary variable declarations: Variables `rf` and `lf` are not used for any calculations. We can remove them.

5. Avoid redundant calculations: The variable `mx` is used to track the maximum length of the subarray. We can avoid calculating `r - l + 1` twice by storing it in a separate variable.

6. Use prefix increment operators: Instead of using `++l`, `c--`, and `l++`, we can use the prefix increment operators `++` to improve performance.

7. Optimize the output: Instead of using `printf` twice, we can use a single `printf` statement with proper formatting.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n, k;
  std::cin >> n >> k;

  std::vector<int> x(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> x[i];

  std::vector<int> freq(k + 1, 0);
  int l = 0, r = 0;
  int c = 0;
  int maxLen = 0;
  int start = 0, end = 0;

  while (r < n) {
    if (freq[x[r]] == 0)
      c++;
    freq[x[r]]++;

    if (c <= k) {
      int len = r - l + 1;
      if (len > maxLen) {
        maxLen = len;
        start = l;
        end = r;
      }
    }

    while (c > k) {
      freq[x[l]]--;
      if (freq[x[l]] == 0)
        c--;
      l++;
    }

    r++;
  }

  std::cout << start + 1 << " " << end + 1 << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have reduced memory usage, eliminated redundant calculations, and improved the overall efficiency of the program.
