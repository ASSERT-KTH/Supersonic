Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
The program includes the `<algorithm>` header, but it does not use any functions from this header. Therefore, we can remove the `#include <algorithm>` line.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary global variables
The program declares several global variables that are not needed. Specifically, the variables `l`, `rf`, `lf`, and `mx` can be removed. We can initialize the `l` variable inside the loop, and the `rf`, `lf`, and `mx` variables can be replaced with local variables inside the loop.

Step 3: Optimize the array size
The program declares an array `freq` with a size of 1000000, but the maximum value of `x[i]` is not specified. We can optimize the size of the `freq` array by finding the maximum value of `x[i]` and using that as the size. This will reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Replace `scanf` with `cin`
The program uses `scanf` for input, but we can use `cin` instead, which is generally faster and more convenient.

Step 5: Replace `printf` with `cout`
The program uses `printf` for output, but we can use `cout` instead, which is generally faster and more convenient.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  
  vector<int> x(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> x[i];
  
  vector<int> freq(*max_element(x.begin(), x.end()) + 1, 0);
  int l = 0, r = 0;
  int rf = 0, lf = 0;
  int mx = 0;
  int c = 0;
  
  while (r < n) {
    freq[x[r]]++;
    if (freq[x[r]] == 1) {
      c++;
    }
    if (c <= k) {
      if (r - l + 1 > mx) {
        rf = r;
        lf = l;
      }
      mx = max(mx, r - l + 1);
    }
    while (c > k) {
      if (freq[x[l]] == 1)
        c--;
      freq[x[l]]--;
      l++;
    }
    r++;
  }
  
  cout << lf + 1 << " " << rf + 1;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- I removed the unnecessary `<algorithm>` header since it is not used in the program.
- I removed the unnecessary global variables `l`, `rf`, `lf`, and `mx` and replaced them with local variables inside the loop.
- I optimized the size of the `freq` array by finding the maximum value of `x[i]` and using that as the size.
- I replaced `scanf` with `cin` for input and `printf` with `cout` for output.
- I used a `vector` instead of an array for `x` and `freq` to better handle dynamic sizes.
