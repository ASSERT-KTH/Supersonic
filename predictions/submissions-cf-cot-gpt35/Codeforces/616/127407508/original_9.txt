Optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes:
   - The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can increase the compilation time and memory usage. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using the `using namespace std` statement:
   - It's generally considered a good practice to avoid using the `using namespace std` statement, as it can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for the standard library functions and types.

3. Remove the unnecessary `using ll = long long;` statement:
   - The `ll` type is not used anywhere in the program, so we can remove it.

4. Avoid using global variables:
   - The `cnt` array is declared as a global variable, which is not necessary. We can declare it inside the `main` function.

5. Avoid unnecessary constant variable:
   - The `MOD` constant is defined but not used in the program. We can remove it.

6. Use a more efficient data structure for counting occurrences:
   - Currently, the program uses an array `cnt` to count the occurrences of each element. We can optimize this by using an `unordered_map` instead, which has a more efficient lookup and insertion time complexity.

7. Use range-based for loop for input:
   - Instead of using a traditional for loop to input the elements of the vector `a`, we can use a range-based for loop, which is more concise and reduces the chance of off-by-one errors.

8. Optimize the inner loop:
   - The inner loop is used to find the longest subarray with at most `k` distinct elements. We can optimize this by using a sliding window approach. Instead of incrementing `j` one by one, we can update `j` to the position where the subarray becomes invalid in constant time.

9. Avoid unnecessary comparisons in the inner loop:
   - The condition `if (--cnt[a[i]] == 0)` updates the length of the subarray, but it can be avoided by moving the decrement outside of the inner loop.

10. Optimize the output:
    - Instead of printing the output immediately, we can store the indices in variables and print them at the end. This will improve the performance by reducing the number of output operations.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);

  int n, k;
  std::cin >> n >> k;

  std::vector<int> a(n);
  for (auto &it : a)
    std::cin >> it;

  std::unordered_map<int, int> cnt;

  int idx1 = -1, idx2 = -1, leng = 0;
  int j = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (; j < n; j++) {
      if (++cnt[a[j]] == 1)
        leng++;

      if (leng > k) {
        --cnt[a[j--]];
        leng--;
        break;
      }
    }

    if (j - i > idx2 - idx1) {
      idx1 = i;
      idx2 = j;
    }

    --cnt[a[i]];
    leng--;
  }

  std::cout << idx1 + 1 << ' ' << idx2 << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```
