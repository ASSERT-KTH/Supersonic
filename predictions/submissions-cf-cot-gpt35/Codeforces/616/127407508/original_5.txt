Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file inclusion

The program includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a large number of standard C++ headers. In this program, only `<iostream>` is used. Therefore, it is unnecessary to include `<bits/stdc++.h>`. We can remove this inclusion.

Step 2: Optimize input/output operations

The program currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations. These operations are slower compared to other methods such as `scanf` and `printf`. We can optimize the input/output operations by using `scanf` and `printf` instead.

Step 3: Optimize the loop for counting the length

The program uses two nested loops to count the length of the subarray. However, we can optimize this by using a sliding window approach. Instead of iterating over the subarray from the beginning each time, we can maintain two pointers `i` and `j` to represent the start and end of the subarray. We can move these pointers efficiently to calculate the length.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary variable initialization

The variables `idx1`, `idx2`, and `leng` are initialized to -1, 0, and 0 respectively. However, since their values are updated within the loop, the initial values are unnecessary. We can remove the initializations.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int N = 1200300;

int cnt[N];

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
  
    int n, k;
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);
  
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);
  
    int idx1 = 0, idx2 = 0, leng = 0;
    int i = 0, j = 0;
  
    while (j < n) {
        if (++cnt[a[j]] == 1)
            leng++;
      
        if (leng > k) {
            if (--cnt[a[i]] == 0)
                leng--;
            i++;
        }
      
        if (j - i > idx2 - idx1) {
            idx1 = i;
            idx2 = j;
        }
      
        j++;
    }
  
    printf("%d %d\n", idx1 + 1, idx2);
  
    return 0;
}
```
