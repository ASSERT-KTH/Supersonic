The given C++ program finds the longest subarray with at most k distinct elements. The program uses an array `cnt` to count the occurrences of each element in the subarray, and keeps track of the length of the subarray using the variable `leng`. The program iterates through the array `a` twice, once with the outer loop variable `i` and once with the inner loop variable `j`. The program updates the variables `idx1` and `idx2` to store the indices of the longest subarray found so far.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary. We can remove this include statement.

2. Remove unnecessary constant variable: The program defines a constant variable `MOD`, but it is not used anywhere. We can remove this variable.

3. Use a constant reference in the range-based for loop: The program uses a range-based for loop to read elements from the vector `a`. However, it uses a non-constant reference `it` instead of a constant reference. We can change `auto &it` to `const auto &it` to avoid unnecessary copying.

4. Use a more efficient data structure for counting occurrences: The program uses an array `cnt` to count the occurrences of each element. However, since the elements are integers, we can use a `std::unordered_map` instead. This will reduce the memory usage and improve the running time for large values of `n`.

5. Avoid unnecessary decrement and increment operations: The program uses `++cnt[a[j]]` to increment the count of `a[j]` and `--cnt[a[j]]` to decrement the count. However, we can avoid these operations by initializing the counts to zero before the loop and directly updating the counts using `cnt[a[j]]++` and `cnt[a[i]]--`.

6. Use a single loop instead of nested loops: The program uses nested loops to iterate through the array `a`. We can optimize this by using a single loop and updating the indices `i` and `j` accordingly. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);

  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;

  vector<int> a(n);
  for (const auto &it : a)
    cin >> it;

  unordered_map<int, int> cnt;
  int idx1 = -1, idx2 = -1, leng = 0;
  int j = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (++cnt[a[i]] == 1)
      leng++;

    if (leng > k) {
      if (--cnt[a[j]] == 0)
        leng--;
      j++;
    }

    if (j - i > idx2 - idx1) {
      idx1 = i;
      idx2 = j;
    }
  }

  cout << idx1 + 1 << ' ' << idx2 << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program uses a `std::unordered_map` instead of an array for counting occurrences, avoids unnecessary increment and decrement operations, and uses a single loop instead of nested loops. These modifications improve the running time and reduce the memory usage of the program.
