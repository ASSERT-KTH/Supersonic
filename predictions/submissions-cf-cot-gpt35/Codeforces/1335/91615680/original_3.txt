The given program has a nested loop structure. The outer loop runs 't' times and the inner loop runs 'n' times for each iteration of the outer loop. The inner loop reads 'n' integers and increments the corresponding element in the 'arr' array. Then, the program counts the number of non-zero elements in the 'arr' array and finds the largest element. If the count is equal to the largest element, it decrements the largest element by 1. Finally, it prints the minimum of the count and the largest element.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the 'using namespace std;' line and prefix the standard library functions and types with 'std::'.

2. Instead of declaring the 'arr' array inside the outer loop, we can declare it before the loop. This avoids unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation in each iteration of the outer loop.

3. Instead of using a range-based for loop to iterate over the 'arr' array, we can use a regular for loop with an index variable. This allows us to break out of the loop early if we encounter a non-zero element.

4. Instead of keeping track of 'temp' to count the number of non-zero elements, we can directly update 'maks' while counting the elements.

5. Instead of decrementing 'maks' by 1 if 'temp' is equal to 'maks', we can decrement it by 1 before comparing 'temp' and 'maks'.

6. Instead of using 'std::endl' to output a newline character, we can use the '\n' character, which is more efficient.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int t, n, x;
  std::cin >> t;
  
  int arr[200001] = {0};
  
  while (t--) {
    std::cin >> n;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> x;
      arr[x]++;
    }
    
    int maks = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 200001; i++) {
      if (arr[i]) {
        maks = arr[i];
        break;
      }
    }
    
    if (maks > 0) {
      maks--;
    }
    
    std::cout << std::min(n, maks) << '\n';
  }
}
```

This optimized program reduces unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations, uses a more efficient loop structure, and avoids unnecessary comparisons and operations.
