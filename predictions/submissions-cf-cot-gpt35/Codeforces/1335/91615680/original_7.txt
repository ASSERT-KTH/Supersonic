The given program reads an integer 't' as the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer 'n' and then 'n' more integers. It counts the frequency of each integer using an array 'arr' and prints the minimum of the number of unique integers and the maximum frequency of any integer.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Instead of using an array of size 200001 to count the frequency of each integer, we can use a hash map. This will reduce the memory usage and allow us to handle larger input values.

2. We can remove the loop that initializes the frequency array to 0 for each test case. It is not necessary because the hash map will be created for each test case and automatically initialized.

3. We can remove the 'temp' variable because it is used to count the number of unique integers. We can directly use the size of the hash map for this purpose.

4. We can remove the 'maks' variable because it is used to keep track of the maximum frequency of any integer. Instead, we can iterate over the hash map and update the maximum frequency on the fly.

5. We can remove the if condition to check if 'temp' is equal to 'maks'. This condition is not necessary because we are updating 'maks' on the fly.

6. We can remove the 'min' function and directly print the minimum of the size of the hash map and the maximum frequency.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t, n, x;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    unordered_map<int, int> freq;
    cin >> n;
    while (n--) {
      cin >> x;
      freq[x]++;
    }
    int maxFreq = 0;
    for (auto it : freq) {
      maxFreq = max(maxFreq, it.second);
    }
    cout << min((int)freq.size(), maxFreq) << endl;
  }
}
```
