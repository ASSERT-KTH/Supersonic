The given program is a C++ program that takes an integer `t` as input representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` as input representing the size of an array. It then takes `n` integers as input and performs some calculations to determine the output for each test case.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of header files, some of which may not be required. We can remove this include statement and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Avoid unnecessary operations: The program uses a set and a map to count the frequency of each element in the array. However, we can achieve the same result using a single unordered_map. This will reduce the number of operations and improve the running time of the program.

4. Avoid unnecessary clearing of containers: The program clears the set and map after each test case. However, since these containers are re-initialized in each iteration of the loop, the clear operations are unnecessary and can be removed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    int t;
    cin >> t;

    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;

        vector<int> v(n);
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> v[i];
            freq[v[i]]++;
        }

        int maxFreq = 0;
        unordered_set<int> uniqueVals;

        for (auto it : freq) {
            maxFreq = max(maxFreq, it.second);
            uniqueVals.insert(it.first);
        }

        if (n >= 2 && uniqueVals.size() == n) {
            cout << 1 << endl;
        } else if (uniqueVals.size() > maxFreq) {
            cout << maxFreq << endl;
        } else {
            cout << uniqueVals.size() - 1 << endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:
1. Removed unnecessary header files to minimize the number of included files and reduce compile time.
2. Removed unnecessary macros to simplify the code and improve readability.
3. Replaced the set and map containers with an unordered_map to count the frequency of elements in the array in a more efficient way.
4. Avoided unnecessary clearing of the set and map containers after each test case as they are re-initialized in each iteration of the loop.
