To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The given program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not necessary and can increase the compilation time. Instead, we can include only the required headers like `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<set>`, and `<map>`.

2. Avoid using macros: The given program uses macros for various purposes like loops, printing debug information, etc. Macros can lead to unexpected behavior and can make the code difficult to read and debug. We can replace the macros with inline functions or regular code.

3. Avoid unnecessary container copies: The program creates a vector `v` to store the input elements and then copies the elements to a set `s` and a map `m`. This involves unnecessary copying and can increase the memory usage. Instead, we can directly insert the elements into the set and map while reading the input.

4. Use iterators instead of range-based loops: The program uses range-based loops (`for (auto x : v)`) to iterate over the elements of `v`. This creates a copy of each element, which is unnecessary and can slow down the program. We can use iterators to iterate over the elements without making copies.

5. Avoid unnecessary clearing of containers: The program clears the set `s` and the map `m` at the end of each test case. Since these containers are re-initialized in each iteration of the outer loop, clearing them is unnecessary.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    set<int> s;
    map<int, int> m;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int x;
      cin >> x;
      s.insert(x);
      m[x]++;
    }

    int M = -1;
    for (auto it = m.begin(); it != m.end(); ++it) {
      M = max(M, it->second);
    }

    if (n >= 2 && m.size() == n) {
      cout << 1 << endl;
      continue;
    }

    if (s.size() > M) {
      cout << M << endl;
    } else if (s.size() == M) {
      cout << M - 1 << endl;
    } else {
      cout << s.size() << endl;
    }
  }
}
```
