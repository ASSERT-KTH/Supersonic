The given program calculates the maximum number of distinct elements that can be selected from an array. The program uses a set to store the unique elements and a map to count the frequency of each element. It then calculates the maximum frequency and compares it with the size of the set to determine the maximum number of distinct elements.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage. We can remove this line and include the necessary headers individually.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Avoid unnecessary copying: The program uses a range-based for loop to iterate over the elements of the vector `v`. However, this creates a copy of each element, which can be avoided by using a reference instead. This can improve the performance and reduce memory usage.

4. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The program calls `s.insert(x)` and `m[x]++` in separate loops to insert elements into the set and map. We can combine these operations into a single loop to avoid unnecessary function calls and improve efficiency.

5. Avoid unnecessary clearing of containers: The program calls `s.clear()` and `m.clear()` at the end of each test case. Since these containers are re-initialized in the next iteration of the loop, we can remove these calls to improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    vector<int> v(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> v[i];
    }
    
    set<int> s;
    map<int, int> m;
    
    int M = -1;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      s.insert(v[i]);
      m[v[i]]++;
      M = max(M, m[v[i]]);
    }
    
    if (n >= 2 && m.size() == n) {
      cout << 1 << endl;
    } else if (s.size() > M) {
      cout << M << endl;
    } else {
      cout << s.size() << endl;
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program improves the running time and memory usage by removing unnecessary operations and simplifying the code.
