The given program seems to be implementing a grid-based game. To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header includes many other headers and can significantly increase compile time. Instead, include only the necessary headers for the program.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;` as it can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.

3. Replace the usage of `pair<int, int>` with `std::array<int, 2>` for better performance and readability.

4. Use more descriptive variable names to improve code readability.

5. Initialize the `grille` and `proc` arrays using a loop instead of `fill_n`.

6. Remove the unnecessary `++tps` before the loop.

7. Instead of using `go[lig][col] = {0, 0}` to indicate an invalid move, we can use a null pointer or a special value to save memory.

8. Use a more efficient loop for `compBloc` to avoid unnecessary checks.

9. Avoid re-computing the same value in the `comp` function by using a temporary variable.

10. Avoid re-computing the same values in the `compBloc` function by using a temporary variable.

11. Avoid re-computing the same values in the `getFin` function by using a temporary variable.
