The given program is a simulation of a grid-based game. It takes the input of the grid size, grid layout, and a series of game commands. The program uses a recursive function `comp()` to calculate the next position of a cell based on its current position and direction. It also uses a function `getFin()` to find the final position of a cell after it moves through the grid.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not required. We can remove it.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: It is generally considered bad practice to use `using namespace std;` in C++ programs as it can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for standard library types and functions.

3. Use precomputed constants: The program uses constants `maxLig`, `maxCol`, `maxReq`, and `sqr` to define the maximum number of rows, columns, requests, and the square size. We can replace these constants with precomputed values to avoid unnecessary calculations.

4. Optimize the `comp()` function: The `comp()` function is called recursively to calculate the next position of a cell. However, it can be optimized by using an iterative approach instead of recursion. This will eliminate the overhead of function calls and improve performance.

5. Optimize the `getFin()` function: The `getFin()` function is used to find the final position of a cell after it moves through the grid. We can optimize this function by storing the final positions of cells in a separate array during the preprocessing step. This will eliminate the need for the while loop in the `getFin()` function and improve performance.

6. Optimize the `compBloc()` function: The `compBloc()` function is used to calculate the next positions of cells in a block of rows. We can optimize this function by removing the nested loop and using a single loop to calculate the positions for all cells in a block.

7. Avoid unnecessary calls to `compBloc()`: The `compBloc()` function is called multiple times in the main loop, even when it is not necessary. We can optimize this by tracking the last block processed and only calling `compBloc()` when the current row belongs to a new block.

8. Avoid unnecessary use of `pii` and `pair<int, int>`: The program uses the `pii` and `pair<int, int>` types to represent pairs of integers. We can replace these types with `std::pair<int, int>` to avoid unnecessary typedefs.
