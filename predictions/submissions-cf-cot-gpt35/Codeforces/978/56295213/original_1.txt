The given program seems to be solving a scheduling problem. It takes input of `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of time slots and `m` is the number of tasks. Each task has a start time, end time, and a number of people required to complete the task.

The program creates a schedule, where each time slot is assigned a task number if it is available. If a task requires more people than available in a time slot, the program outputs -1.

To optimize this program, I would make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We only need `<iostream>` and `<vector>` for this program.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program has a lot of unnecessary macros like `ll`, `pb`, `mp`, `pll`, `INF`, `PI`, `MOD`, `fir`, `sec`, `all`, and `mem`. We can remove them as they are not used in the program.

3. Replace `using namespace std` with necessary `using` statements: Using `using namespace std` is generally considered bad practice. We can replace it with specific `using` statements for `std::vector` and `std::cout`.

4. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The program creates a 2D vector `a` of size `(m+1) x 4`. However, only `m` rows are used. We can reduce the size of the vector to `m x 4` to avoid unnecessary memory allocation.

5. Replace array initialization with `std::fill`: The program initializes the `sch` array with zeros using `sch[n + 1] = {0}`. We can replace it with `std::fill(sch, sch + n + 1, 0)` to avoid unnecessary array initialization.

6. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The program sorts the `a` vector based on the start time of the tasks. However, the tasks are already in order, so sorting is not necessary.

7. Use range-based for loop: The program uses a traditional for loop to iterate over the tasks in the `a` vector. We can use a range-based for loop to simplify the code.

8. Use a single loop for assignment: The program uses two nested loops to assign task numbers to time slots. We can simplify it by using a single loop and a counter variable to keep track of the number of available slots.

9. Optimize the output: The program outputs the task numbers for each time slot. We can optimize it by storing the task numbers in a separate vector and using `std::copy` to print the output.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);

  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;

  std::vector<std::vector<int>> a(m, std::vector<int>(4));
  std::vector<int> sch(n + 1, 0);

  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i][1] >> a[i][0] >> a[i][2];
    sch[a[i][0]] = m + 1;
    a[i][3] = i + 1;
  }

  // Assign task numbers to time slots
  int cnt = 0;
  std::vector<int> taskNumbers;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cnt = a[i][2];
    for (int j = a[i][1]; j < a[i][0]; j++) {
      if (!sch[j]) {
        cnt--;
        sch[j] = a[i][3];
        if (cnt == 0)
          break;
      }
    }
    if (cnt != 0) {
      std::cout << -1;
      return 0;
    }
    taskNumbers.push_back(a[i][3]);
  }

  // Print the task numbers for each time slot
  std::copy(taskNumbers.begin(), taskNumbers.end(),
            std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, " "));

  return 0;
}

```
