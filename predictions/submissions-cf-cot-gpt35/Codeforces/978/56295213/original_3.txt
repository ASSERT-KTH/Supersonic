The given program seems to be a solution to a scheduling problem. It takes input values for the number of tasks (n) and the number of intervals (m), and then it assigns each interval to a task based on some conditions. Finally, it prints out the assignment of intervals to tasks.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not standard and includes many unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Use `vector<int>` instead of `vector<ll>`: The program uses a 2D vector `a` of type `vector<vector<ll>>`, where `ll` is a long long int. However, it seems that `int` would suffice for this program, so we can change the type of `a` to `vector<vector<int>>`.

4. Use `vector<int>` instead of `ll sch[]`: The program uses an array `sch` of type `ll` to store the assignment of intervals to tasks. We can change the type of `sch` to `vector<int>`, which provides more flexibility and efficiency.

5. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: The program uses `push_back` to add elements to vectors. However, `emplace_back` can be more efficient in terms of memory usage, so we can replace `push_back` with `emplace_back` where applicable.

6. Use `sort` with custom comparator: The program uses `sort` to sort the intervals based on some conditions. We can provide a custom comparator to `sort` instead of sorting the entire 2D vector `a`. This will improve the sorting performance.

7. Use `cout` once instead of multiple times: The program uses multiple `cout` statements to print the assignment of intervals to tasks. We can concatenate the output into a single string and then print it using a single `cout` statement. This can improve the output performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;

  vector<vector<int>> a(m + 1, vector<int>(4, 0));
  vector<int> sch(n + 1, 0);

  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    cin >> a[i][1] >> a[i][0] >> a[i][2];
    sch[a[i][0]] = m + 1;
    a[i][3] = i;
  }

  sort(a.begin() + 1, a.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
    return a[1] < b[1];
  });

  string output;

  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    int cnt = a[i][2];
    for (int j = a[i][1]; j < a[i][0]; j++) {
      if (!sch[j]) {
        cnt--;
        sch[j] = a[i][3];
        if (!cnt)
          break;
      }
    }
    if (cnt) {
      output = "-1";
      break;
    }
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    output += to_string(sch[i]) + " ";
  }

  cout << output;

  return 0;
}
```
