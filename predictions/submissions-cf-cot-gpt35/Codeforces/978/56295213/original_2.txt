Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files.

The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file includes a lot of other header files, which can increase the compilation time and memory usage. We should only include the necessary header files.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary preprocessor macros.

The preprocessor macros `ll`, `pb`, `mp`, `pll`, `INF`, `PI`, `MOD`, `fir`, `sec`, `all`, `mem`, and `IOS` are not used in the program. We should remove them to simplify the code.

Step 3: Optimize input and output operations.

The `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(NULL)` statements are used to optimize input and output operations. However, they are not necessary in this program because there are no performance-critical input or output operations. We can remove these statements.

Step 4: Optimize memory allocation.

The `vector<vector<ll>> a(m + 1, vector<ll>(4, 0))` statement creates a 2D vector with `(m+1)` rows and 4 columns, and initializes all elements to 0. However, we don't need to initialize the elements to 0 because we will overwrite them later. We can remove the initialization part to optimize memory allocation.

Step 5: Optimize sorting.

The `std::sort` function is used to sort the vector `a` based on the first column. However, the sorting operation is not necessary because we can iterate through the vector `a` in its original order. We can remove the sorting operation to optimize the running time.

Step 6: Optimize the inner loop.

The inner loop is used to assign values to the `sch` array. However, we can optimize the loop by using a counter variable instead of checking the value of `cnt` in every iteration. We can break the loop when the counter reaches 0.

Step 7: Optimize the output loop.

The loop that prints the values of the `sch` array can be simplified by using a range-based for loop instead of a traditional for loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;

  std::vector<std::vector<int>> a(m + 1, std::vector<int>(4));
  std::vector<int> sch(n + 1);

  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i][1] >> a[i][0] >> a[i][2];
    sch[a[i][0]] = m + 1;
    a[i][3] = i;
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    int cnt = a[i][2];
    for (int j = a[i][1]; j < a[i][0]; j++) {
      if (!sch[j]) {
        cnt--;
        sch[j] = a[i][3];
        if (!cnt)
          break;
      }
    }
    if (cnt) {
      std::cout << -1;
      return 0;
    }
  }

  for (int val : sch)
    std::cout << val << " ";

  return 0;
}
```
