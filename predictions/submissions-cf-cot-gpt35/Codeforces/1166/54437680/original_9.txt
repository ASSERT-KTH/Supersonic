To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not a standard C/C++ header file. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard header files for the program.

2. Remove unnecessary macro definitions: The program has several macro definitions that are not used. Removing these unnecessary macro definitions can improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

3. Remove unnecessary type definitions: The program defines several type aliases, such as `ll`, `ld`, `vll`, `vii`, etc., which are not used. Removing these unnecessary type definitions can simplify the code.

4. Remove unnecessary constant definition: The program defines the constant `MOD`, but it is not used. Removing this constant definition can reduce unnecessary code.

5. Remove unnecessary function parameter: The `findbestr` function takes `n` as a parameter, but it is not used. We can remove this parameter to simplify the function.

6. Simplify binary search implementation: The `findbestr` function implements a binary search, but it can be simplified. We can remove the unnecessary `if (l == r)` condition and simplify the comparisons in the `if` statement. Additionally, we can use the standard `lower_bound` function instead of manually implementing the binary search.

7. Remove unnecessary input/output file handling: The program includes code for file input/output, but it is not used. We can remove this code to simplify the program.

8. Use `std::abs` instead of ternary operator: Instead of using the ternary operator to calculate the absolute value of `inp`, we can use the `std::abs` function from the standard library.

9. Simplify loop conditions: The loop conditions in the `for` loops can be simplified. We can use the range-based `for` loop instead of the traditional `for` loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int findbestr(const std::vector<int>& arr, int i) {
  int elem = arr[i];
  auto it = std::lower_bound(arr.begin() + i + 1, arr.end(), 2 * elem);
  return std::distance(arr.begin(), it);
}

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int inp;
    std::cin >> inp;
    arr[i] = std::abs(inp);
  }
  std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
  int l = 0, count = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    l = findbestr(arr, i);
    count += i - l;
  }
  std::cout << count;
  return 0;
}
```
