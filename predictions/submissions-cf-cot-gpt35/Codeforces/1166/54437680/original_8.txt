Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and using statements

The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a non-standard header file and is not recommended. It includes a lot of unnecessary standard library headers. We can replace it with the necessary standard library headers.

The program also includes a bunch of unnecessary `using` statements. We can remove them.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

The program defines a bunch of unnecessary macros. We can remove them and use the actual types and functions directly.

Step 3: Simplify the binary search

The `findbestr` function uses a binary search to find the first element greater than `2 * elem`. However, the implementation is unnecessarily complex. We can simplify it by using the `lower_bound` function from the standard library.

Step 4: Optimize the loop

The loop in the main function can be optimized. Currently, it iterates over all elements and for each element, it finds the first element greater than `2 * elem` using binary search. This can be optimized by using a two-pointer approach.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary input/output file handling

The program includes code to read input from a file and write output to a file. We can remove this code as it is not necessary for the optimization.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> arr(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int inp;
        cin >> inp;
        arr[i] = inp > 0 ? inp : -inp;
    }
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

    int l = 0, count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        while (2 * arr[l] < arr[i])
            l++;
        count += i - l;
    }

    cout << count;

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. Removed unnecessary includes and using statements.
2. Removed unnecessary macros and used the actual types and functions directly.
3. Simplified the `findbestr` function by using `lower_bound`.
4. Optimized the loop by using a two-pointer approach.
5. Removed unnecessary input/output file handling.
