The given C++ program performs the following steps:

1. Reads an integer `n` from the user.
2. Reads `n` integers from the user and stores them in a vector `arr`.
3. Sorts the elements of the `arr` vector in ascending order.
4. Initializes variables `l` and `count` as 0.
5. Iterates over the elements of `arr` and counts the number of pairs `(i, l)` where `2 * arr[l] < arr[i]` and increments `count` accordingly.
6. Prints the value of `count`.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file which is not necessary. We can remove it and include only the necessary header files.
2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines a lot of unnecessary macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.
3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines unnecessary typedefs for various types. We can remove them to simplify the code.
4. Remove unnecessary using statement: The program includes a using statement for the whole `std` namespace. We can remove it to avoid polluting the global namespace.
5. Remove unnecessary freopen calls: The program includes freopen calls to redirect standard input and output. We can remove them as they are not needed.
6. Optimize the findbestr function: The findbestr function uses a binary search to find the index of the first element in the arr vector that is greater than 2 * elem. However, this binary search can be simplified by using the lower_bound function from the algorithm library. We can replace the binary search code with a single line of code using lower_bound.
7. Use prefix increment instead of postfix increment: The program uses the postfix increment operator (i++) in the for loop, which creates a temporary copy of the variable i. We can use the prefix increment operator (++i) instead to avoid this unnecessary copy.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int inp;
    std::cin >> inp;
    arr[i] = std::abs(inp);
  }
  std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
  int l = 0, count = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    l = std::lower_bound(arr.begin() + l, arr.end(), 2 * arr[i]) - arr.begin();
    count += i - l;
  }
  std::cout << count;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. The unnecessary header files, macros, typedefs, and using statement have been removed to simplify the code and avoid unnecessary code bloat.
2. The freopen calls have been removed as they are not needed.
3. The findbestr function has been replaced with a single line of code using lower_bound, which simplifies the binary search and improves readability.
4. The prefix increment operator (++i) has been used instead of the postfix increment operator (i++) in the for loop to avoid unnecessary copies of the loop variable.
