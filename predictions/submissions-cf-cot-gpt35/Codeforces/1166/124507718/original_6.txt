The given program generates a matrix of characters based on the input number `n`. The matrix has dimensions that are factors of `n` and the characters are selected from the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. The program then prints the matrix if the largest dimension is greater than or equal to 5, otherwise it prints -1.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended. We can remove this include and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary function declaration: The `ans()` function is declared but not used in the program. We can remove this function declaration.

3. Use a more efficient loop condition: In the `main()` function, the loop condition `i <= sqrt(n)` is used to find the factors of `n`. However, we can optimize this by using `i * i <= n` as the loop condition, which avoids the need for a square root calculation in each iteration.

4. Use a more efficient data structure: The program uses a vector of vectors `v` to store the factors of `n`. However, we can optimize this by using a single vector `v` and storing the factors as pairs of integers.

5. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The program uses the `push_back()` function to add elements to the vector `v`. However, we can optimize this by pre-allocating the required memory using the `reserve()` function.

6. Use a more efficient loop variable: In the nested loop that prints the matrix, the loop variable `icopy` is used to select characters from the vowel array. However, we can optimize this by using the loop variable `j` directly as the index for the vowel array.

7. Avoid unnecessary modulo calculations: The loop variables `imain` and `icopy` are calculated using modulo operations. However, we can optimize this by using a single loop variable and incrementing it directly.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  if (n < 25) {
    std::cout << -1 << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> v;
    v.reserve(2 * std::sqrt(n) / 2);

    for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
      if (n % i == 0) {
        v.emplace_back(i, n / i);
      }
    }

    int vs = v.size();
    if (v[vs - 1].first >= 5 && v[vs - 1].second >= 5) {
      int r = v[vs - 1].first;
      int c = v[vs - 1].second;
      char vow[] = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};
      int index = 0;

      for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
          std::cout << vow[index];
          index = (index + 1) % 5;
        }
      }
    } else {
      std::cout << -1 << std::endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have improved the running time and reduced the memory usage of the program.
