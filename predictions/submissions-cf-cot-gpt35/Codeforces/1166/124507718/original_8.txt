Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a large number of other header files. This can increase the compilation time and memory usage. Since the program does not use any specific headers from this file, we can remove it.

Step 2: Optimize the loop for finding factors

The program uses a loop to find all the factors of a given number `n`. Currently, it checks all numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` to find the factors. However, we can optimize this loop by only checking numbers up to the square root of `n/2`, as any factor greater than `n/2` would have already been found. This will reduce the number of iterations in the loop.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary vector initialization

The program creates a vector `v` to store the factors of `n`. However, it does not need to initialize the vector with a specific size. Since the number of factors is not known in advance, we can directly push the factors into the vector without initializing it.

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary vector copying

The program uses a vector `tempv` to store the factors `i` and `n/i`. However, instead of copying the elements from `tempv` to `v`, we can directly push `i` and `n/i` into `v` using the `emplace_back` function. This will avoid unnecessary copying of elements.

Step 5: Avoid unnecessary calculations

The program checks if the last factor in the vector `v` is at least 5 in both dimensions. However, we can optimize this check by directly checking if `r` and `c` are both greater than or equal to 5. This will avoid unnecessary indexing and comparisons.

Step 6: Avoid unnecessary character array

The program uses a character array `vow` to store the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. Instead of using a character array, we can directly use string literals to print the vowels. This will simplify the code and avoid unnecessary memory usage.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

bool ans(int arr[], int m, int n) {
  if (m == 0)
    return false;
  if (arr[0] == 1 || arr[m - 1] == n)
    return true;
  int c = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
    if (arr[i] == arr[i - 1] + 1)
      c++;
    else
      c = 1;
    if (c == 3) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  if (n < 25)
    cout << -1 << endl;
  else {
    vector<vector<int>> v;
    for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt(n/2); i++) {
      if (n % i == 0) {
        v.emplace_back(i, n / i);
      }
    }
    int vs = v.size();
    if (vs > 0 && v[vs - 1][0] >= 5 && v[vs - 1][1] >= 5) {
      int r = v[vs - 1][0];
      int c = v[vs - 1][1];
      for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
          cout << "aeiou"[i % 5];
        }
      }
    } else {
      cout << -1 << endl;
    }
  }
}
```
