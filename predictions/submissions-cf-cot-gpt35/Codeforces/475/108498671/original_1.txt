The given C/C++ program calculates the number of subarrays that have a given greatest common divisor (GCD). It uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible subarrays and calculates the GCD using a precomputed sparse table.

To optimize the program, we can modify the way the GCD is calculated for each subarray. Instead of using the sparse table to calculate the GCD for each subarray, we can use a more efficient algorithm that calculates the GCD in constant time.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the `st` array and the `get` function, as they are no longer needed.

2. Instead of calculating the GCD using the sparse table, we can calculate it directly using the `gcd` function.

3. Modify the loop that calculates the number of subarrays to use a sliding window approach. Instead of iterating over all possible subarrays, we can maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`, that define the current subarray. We initialize both pointers to 0 and iterate over the array once. At each iteration, we increment `right` and update the GCD using the `gcd` function. If the GCD is equal to the target GCD, we increment the count of subarrays by `right - left + 1`. Then, we increment `left` until the GCD is no longer equal to the target GCD.

4. Modify the loop that reads the queries to use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf` for better performance.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int gcd(int a, int b) {
  if (b == 0) {
    return a;
  }
  return gcd(b, a % b);
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  int a[100100];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  map<int, long long> ans;
  int left = 0;
  int right = 0;
  int current_gcd = a[0];
  
  while (right < n) {
    if (current_gcd % a[right] != 0) {
      current_gcd = gcd(current_gcd, a[right]);
      right++;
    } else {
      ans[current_gcd] += right - left + 1;
      current_gcd /= a[left];
      left++;
    }
  }
  
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    cout << ans[x] << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program removes the need for the sparse table and uses a more efficient algorithm to calculate the GCD. It also uses `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf` for better performance.
