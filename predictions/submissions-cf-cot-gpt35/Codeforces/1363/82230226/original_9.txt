Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files
The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not a standard C++ header file. It includes a large number of other header files, which can increase the compilation time and memory usage. Since the program does not use any specific header files, we can remove this line.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macro definitions
The program defines two macros `max(a, b)` and `min(a, b)`, which are already provided by the C++ standard library as `std::max` and `std::min`. We can remove these macro definitions and use the standard library functions directly.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary function `init()`
The `init()` function is not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary input/output optimizations
The program includes input/output optimizations using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`. These optimizations are not necessary for this program and can be removed.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary file redirection code
The program includes code to redirect input and output to files using `freopen()`. This code is not necessary and can be removed.

Step 6: Optimize the loop condition
The loop condition `for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)` can be optimized to `for (i = 1; i < n; i++)` to avoid the unnecessary subtraction operation.

Step 7: Optimize the if condition
The if condition `if (n == 1 || adj[x].size() == 1 || n % 2 == 0)` can be optimized to `if (adj[x].size() <= 1 || n % 2 == 0)` to avoid the unnecessary comparison with 1.

Step 8: Optimize the output statement
The output statement `cout << "Ayush\n"` and `cout << "Ashish\n"` can be replaced with a single statement `cout << ((n % 2 == 0 || adj[x].size() <= 1) ? "Ayush\n" : "Ashish\n")` to avoid multiple output statements.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    int t;
    cin >> t;

    while (t--) {
        int n, x;
        cin >> n >> x;

        vector<vector<int>> adj(n + 1);

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int a, b;
            cin >> a >> b;
            adj[a].push_back(b);
            adj[b].push_back(a);
        }

        cout << ((adj[x].size() <= 1 || n % 2 == 0) ? "Ayush\n" : "Ashish\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
