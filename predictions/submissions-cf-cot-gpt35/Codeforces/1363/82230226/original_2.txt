Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file inclusion.

The program includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard C++ header file. It includes all the standard library headers and some additional ones. Since we don't use all of them, we can remove this line and include the specific headers that are required.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macro definitions.

The program defines macros for `ll`, `ull`, `max`, and `min`, but these macros are not used in the program. We can remove these macro definitions to simplify the code.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary clearing of vector elements.

The function `init()` clears all elements of the `adj` vector, but this is not necessary because the vector is cleared at the beginning of each iteration of the main loop. We can remove the `init()` function.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary file I/O operations.

The program includes code to read input from a file and write output to a file using `freopen()`. However, these operations are not required for the optimization task. We can remove these lines of code.

Step 5: Optimize the conditional statement.

The conditional statement `if (n == 1 || adj[x].size() == 1 || n % 2 == 0)` can be optimized by reordering the conditions. If `n` is 1, then the first condition will evaluate to true and the remaining conditions won't be checked. We can rearrange the conditions to check the most likely conditions first.

Step 6: Optimize the loop variables.

The loop variable `i` is used only within the for loop and does not need to be defined outside the loop. We can move the declaration of `i` inside the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

vector<int> adj[100005];

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int n, x;
    cin >> n >> x;

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      int a, b;
      cin >> a >> b;
      adj[a].push_back(b);
      adj[b].push_back(a);
    }

    if (n == 1 || adj[x].size() == 1 || n % 2 == 0) {
      cout << "Ayush\n";
    } else {
      cout << "Ashish\n";
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      adj[i].clear();
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
