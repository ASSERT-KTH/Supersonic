Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not necessary and can slow down the compilation process. We can remove it and include only the necessary header files.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

The program defines two macros `max` and `min`. However, these macros are not used in the program. We can remove them.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary function

The program defines a function `init()` which clears the adjacency list `adj`. However, this function is not necessary as the adjacency list is already cleared at the beginning of each test case iteration. We can remove this function.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary input/output file redirection

The program includes code to redirect input and output to files. However, this is not necessary for optimization. We can remove this code.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary variables

The program defines several variables that are not used. We can remove these variables to optimize memory usage.

Step 6: Optimize the condition check

The program has a condition check `if (n == 1 || adj[x].size() == 1 || n % 2 == 0)` inside the while loop. This condition can be simplified by checking if `adj[x].size() <= 1` because if `adj[x].size()` is 0 or 1, the condition will be true.

Step 7: Optimize the output statement

The program outputs "Ayush" or "Ashish" based on the condition check. We can optimize the output statement by using a ternary operator to directly output the result without using if-else.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int n, x;
    cin >> n >> x;

    vector<vector<int>> adj(n + 1);

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      int a, b;
      cin >> a >> b;
      adj[a].push_back(b);
      adj[b].push_back(a);
    }

    cout << ((adj[x].size() <= 1 || n % 2 == 0) ? "Ayush\n" : "Ashish\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
```
