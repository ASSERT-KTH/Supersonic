Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros.

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes all standard headers, which can increase the compilation time and memory usage. We should only include the necessary headers.

The `max` and `min` macros can be replaced with their corresponding functions to avoid any potential issues.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary function and variable declarations.

The `init` function is not used in the program, so we can remove it.

Step 3: Optimize the adjacency list initialization.

The current implementation initializes the adjacency list for each test case, even though it is not necessary. We can move the initialization outside the while loop and reuse the same adjacency list for all test cases.

Step 4: Optimize the condition checking.

The condition `n % 2 == 0` is unnecessary because it is always true. Since `n` is the number of nodes in the graph, it will always be even according to the problem statement.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary input/output file handling.

The `freopen` calls for input and output files are unnecessary for this optimization task. We can remove them.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define ll long long int

vector<ll> adj[100005];

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    ll t;
    cin >> t;

    ll n, x;
    for (ll i = 0; i < t; i++) {
        cin >> n >> x;
        ll a, b;
        for (ll j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
            cin >> a >> b;
            adj[a].push_back(b);
            adj[b].push_back(a);
        }
        if (adj[x].size() == 1) {
            cout << "Ayush\n";
        } else {
            cout << "Ashish\n";
        }
        for (ll j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            adj[j].clear();
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```
