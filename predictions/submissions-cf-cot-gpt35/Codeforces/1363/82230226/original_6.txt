The given program has a few areas that can be optimized:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes all standard library headers. This can be replaced with the necessary headers only, which in this case are `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for finding maximum and minimum values. These can be replaced with the standard library functions `std::max` and `std::min`.

3. Avoid using `std::endl`: The program uses `std::endl` to end lines, which flushes the output buffer. This can be replaced with the newline character `'\n'` to improve performance.

4. Avoid using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: This line disables the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve performance for large I/O operations. However, it is not necessary in this program as there is no heavy I/O.

5. Avoid clearing the entire vector in the `init()` function: The `init()` function clears the `adj` vector completely in each iteration of the main loop. This is not necessary as the vector will be overwritten in the next iteration. We can remove the `init()` function and clear the vector directly before the loop.

6. Remove unnecessary input/output file redirection: The program includes code for input and output file redirection using `freopen()`. This can be removed if not needed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

#define ll long long int

vector<ll> adj[100005];

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    
    ll t;
    cin >> t;
    
    while (t--) {
        ll n, x;
        cin >> n >> x;
        
        for (ll i = 0; i < 100005; i++) {
            adj[i].clear();
        }
        
        ll a, b;
        for (ll i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            cin >> a >> b;
            adj[a].push_back(b);
            adj[b].push_back(a);
        }
        
        if (n == 1 || adj[x].size() == 1 || n % 2 == 0) {
            cout << "Ayush\n";
        } else {
            cout << "Ashish\n";
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary code and maintains the same functionality as the original program. It should run faster and use less memory.
