Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers and using statements.

The program includes unnecessary headers and using statements that are not used in the program. We can remove them to improve the compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros.

The program defines several macros that are not used in the program. We can remove them to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary global variables.

The program defines several global variables that are not used in the program. We can remove them to reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary functions.

The program defines several functions that are not used in the program. We can remove them to reduce memory usage.

Step 5: Simplify variable declarations.

The program declares variables using unnecessary data types. We can simplify the variable declarations to reduce memory usage.

Step 6: Remove unnecessary loops.

The program contains several loops that are not necessary. We can remove them to improve the running time.

Step 7: Simplify conditional statements.

The program contains several conditional statements that can be simplified. We can simplify them to improve the running time.

Step 8: Simplify the main loop.

The main loop of the program can be simplified by removing unnecessary branches and combining conditions. We can simplify it to improve the running time.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    vector<ll> v(n);
    ll d = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> v[i];
      d ^= v[i];
    }

    int ans = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; i++) {
      if ((d ^ v[i - 1]) == 0 && (d ^ v[i]) == 0) {
        ans = 1;
        break;
      }
    }

    if (ans) {
      cout << "YES" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "NO" << endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
