To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and can be slow to compile. We can remove this include and instead include the necessary standard headers that are actually used in the program.

2. Remove unnecessary using statements: The program includes several using statements for types that are not used in the program. We can remove these unnecessary using statements to improve compile time.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the program. We can remove these unnecessary macros to improve compile time and reduce the complexity of the code.

4. Remove unnecessary template functions: The program defines several template functions that are not used in the program. We can remove these unnecessary template functions to improve compile time and reduce the complexity of the code.

5. Optimize the `solve` function: The `solve` function can be optimized by removing the unnecessary call to `each(i, a)` in the loop that calculates the value of `cur`. Instead, we can directly iterate over the elements of `a` using a traditional `for` loop to improve performance.

6. Optimize the `pr` function: The `pr` function can be optimized by using `cout` and `endl` instead of `'\n'` to improve performance.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
typedef vector<ll> vl;

int n, k;
vl a;

void solve(int tc) {
  cin >> n;
  k = 2;
  a.resize(n);
  ll x = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    x ^= a[i];
  }
  if (x == 0) {
    cout << "YES" << endl;
    return;
  }
  int cnt = 0;
  ll cur = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cur ^= a[i];
    if (cur == x) {
      ++cnt;
      cur = 0;
    }
  }
  cout << (cnt & 1 && cnt > k ? "YES" : "NO") << endl;
}

int main() {
  int TC;
  cin >> TC;
  for (int i = 1; i <= TC; i++) {
    solve(i);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary includes, using statements, macros, and template functions. It also optimizes the `solve` function and the `pr` function. Overall, these optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
