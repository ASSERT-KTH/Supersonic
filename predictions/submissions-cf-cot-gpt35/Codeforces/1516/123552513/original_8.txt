To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a large number of other header files. This can increase the compilation time and memory usage. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary using statements: The program includes several using statements for different data types and containers. Since we are not using all of them, we can remove the unnecessary ones to reduce the size of the symbol table.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

4. Optimize the loop for calculating the XOR value: The program calculates the XOR of all the elements in the array `a` by iterating over each element and performing the XOR operation. Instead, we can optimize this by using the `accumulate` function from the `<numeric>` header, which can perform the XOR operation on all the elements in the array in a single line.

5. Optimize the loop for counting the number of subarrays: The program uses a loop to iterate over each element in the array `a` and check if the XOR value becomes equal to `x`. Instead of using a loop, we can use the `count` function from the `<algorithm>` header to count the number of occurrences of `x` in the array `a`.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int TC;
    cin >> TC;

    for (int i = 1; i <= TC; ++i) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;

        vector<long long> a(n);
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            cin >> a[j];
        }

        long long x = accumulate(a.begin(), a.end(), 0, bit_xor<long long>());

        if (x == 0) {
            cout << "YES\n";
            continue;
        }

        int cnt = count(a.begin(), a.end(), x);

        if (cnt & 1 && cnt > 2) {
            cout << "YES\n";
        } else {
            cout << "NO\n";
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. We removed the unnecessary header files to reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

2. We removed the unnecessary using statements to reduce the size of the symbol table.

3. We removed the unnecessary macros to simplify the code.

4. We used the `accumulate` function to calculate the XOR value of all the elements in the array in a single line, which is more efficient than using a loop.

5. We used the `count` function to count the number of occurrences of `x` in the array `a`, which is more efficient than using a loop.
