Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes.
- The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not standard and includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary using statements.
- The program includes a lot of unnecessary `using` statements. We can remove the ones that are not used in the code.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary macros.
- The program defines a lot of unnecessary macros. We can remove the ones that are not used in the code.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary functions from the IO namespace.
- The IO namespace includes some unnecessary functions that are not used in the code. We can remove those functions.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary variables.
- The `MOD` and `MX` variables are defined but not used in the code. We can remove them.

Step 6: Optimize the solve function.
- The solve function can be optimized by removing unnecessary variables and simplifying the logic.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;
using vl = vector<ll>;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  
  int TC;
  cin >> TC;
  
  while (TC--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    vl a(n);
    ll x = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> a[i];
      x ^= a[i];
    }
    
    if (x == 0) {
      cout << "YES\n";
      continue;
    }
    
    int cnt = 0;
    ll cur = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cur ^= a[i];
      if (cur == x) {
        ++cnt;
        cur = 0;
      }
    }
    
    cout << (cnt & 1 && cnt > 2 ? "YES" : "NO") << "\n";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
