To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes a large number of unnecessary header files. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unused typedefs: The program includes several typedefs (`ll`, `db`, `pi`, `pl`, `pd`, `vi`, `vl`, `vd`, `vpi`, `vpl`, `vpd`) that are not used anywhere in the code. We can remove these typedefs to reduce unnecessary code.

3. Remove unused macros: The program includes several macros (`f`, `s`, `rsz`, `pb`, `lb`, `ub`, `sz`, `all`, `rall`, `FOR`, `F0R`, `ROF`, `R0F`, `each`) that are not used anywhere in the code. We can remove these macros to reduce unnecessary code.

4. Optimize loop variable types: The program uses `int` as the loop variable type in several loops. Since the loop variables are compared with `sz(x)` which returns an `int`, we can change the loop variable type to `size_t` which is the type returned by `sz()` to avoid unnecessary type conversions.

5. Optimize loop iteration: The program uses range-based for loops (`each(i, a)`) to iterate over the elements of a vector. However, these loops create a copy of each element, which can be avoided by using references (`&i`) instead.

6. Optimize input/output functions: The program uses custom input/output functions (`re()`, `pr()`) that are not necessary. We can replace these functions with standard input/output functions (`cin`, `cout`) to reduce unnecessary code.

7. Remove unused variables: The program declares the variables `dx`, `dy`, `OO`, `MOD`, `MX` which are not used anywhere in the code. We can remove these variables to reduce unnecessary code.

After making these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);

    int TC;
    std::cin >> TC;

    for (int i = 1; i <= TC; ++i) {
        int n, k;
        std::cin >> n;
        k = 2;

        std::vector<long long> a(n);
        long long x = 0;

        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            std::cin >> a[j];
            x ^= a[j];
        }

        if (x == 0) {
            std::cout << "YES\n";
            continue;
        }

        int cnt = 0;
        long long cur = 0;

        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            cur ^= a[j];
            if (cur == x) {
                ++cnt;
                cur = 0;
            }
        }

        std::cout << (cnt & 1 && cnt > k ? "YES" : "NO") << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary code and improves the efficiency of the original program.
