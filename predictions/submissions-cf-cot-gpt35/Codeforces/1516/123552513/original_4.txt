Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a lot of standard library headers. However, this can slow down compilation time and increase memory usage. Since the program does not use all of the included headers, we can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unused type aliases

The program defines several type aliases (e.g., `using ll = long long`, `using db = long double`). However, these type aliases are not used in the program. We can remove these lines to simplify the code.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary macros

The program defines several macros (e.g., `#define f first`, `#define s second`). However, these macros are not used in the program. We can remove these lines to simplify the code.

Step 4: Optimize `sz(x)` function

The `sz(x)` function is used to get the size of a container `x`. However, the implementation of this function is incorrect. The correct implementation should be `return (int)x.size();`. We can modify the `sz(x)` function to use the correct implementation.

Step 5: Optimize `each(i, x)` function

The `each(i, x)` function is used to iterate over the elements of a container `x`. However, the implementation of this function is inefficient. It uses a reference to iterate over the elements, which can lead to unnecessary memory overhead. We can modify the `each(i, x)` function to use a const reference instead.

Step 6: Optimize `pr(vector<T>& x)` function

The `pr(vector<T>& x)` function is used to print the elements of a vector `x`. However, the implementation of this function is inefficient. It uses a loop to print each element, which can be slow for large vectors. We can modify the `pr(vector<T>& x)` function to use the `copy` algorithm to print the elements.

Step 7: Optimize `solve(int tc)` function

The `solve(int tc)` function is the main function that solves the problem. There are a few optimizations that can be made in this function:

- Remove the `k` variable and the line `k = 2` since `k` is not used in the program.
- Remove the `cnt` variable and the line `int cnt = 0` since `cnt` is only used to check if `cnt` is odd and greater than `k`. We can simplify this check to `cnt > 0` since `cnt` is incremented by 1 whenever `cur` is equal to `x`.
- Replace the `cur` variable with a boolean flag `found` to indicate if `cur` is equal to `x`. This eliminates the need to use the XOR operator for each element in the loop.

Step 8: Remove unused variables

The program defines several unused variables (e.g., `pd`, `vpl`). We can remove these lines to simplify the code.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int n;
vector<long long> a;

void solve(int tc) {
  cin >> n;
  a.resize(n);
  long long x = 0;
  for (auto& i : a) {
    cin >> i;
    x ^= i;
  }
  if (x == 0) {
    cout << "YES" << endl;
    return;
  }
  bool found = false;
  for (auto& i : a) {
    if (found) {
      found = false;
    } else if (i == x) {
      found = true;
    }
  }
  cout << (found ? "YES" : "NO") << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);

  int TC;
  cin >> TC;
  for (int i = 1; i <= TC; ++i) {
    solve(i);
  }

  return 0;
}
```
