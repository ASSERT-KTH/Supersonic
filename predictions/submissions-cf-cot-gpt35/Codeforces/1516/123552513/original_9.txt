Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes all the standard C++ headers. This can result in slower compilation times and increased memory usage. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unused aliases and typedefs
The program includes several alias declarations using `using` and `typedef` statements. These aliases are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 3: Optimize input/output operations
The program uses custom input/output functions `re` and `pr` which are not necessary. Instead, we can use the standard input/output functions `cin` and `cout` for better performance.

Step 4: Optimize loop iterations
The program uses range-based for loops (`each`) to iterate over the elements of a container. However, these loops create a copy of each element, which can be inefficient for large containers. Instead, we can use index-based for loops to iterate over the elements without creating copies.

Step 5: Optimize bitwise operations
The program uses the XOR operator (`^`) to calculate the XOR of all elements in the array. However, this can be optimized by calculating the XOR in a single pass using a loop.

Step 6: Optimize conditionals
The program uses multiple conditional statements to check if the XOR value is equal to 0 and to determine the number of consecutive XOR values equal to the XOR value. We can optimize these conditionals to reduce the number of comparisons and improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);

  int TC;
  cin >> TC;

  for (int i = 1; i <= TC; ++i) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int k = 2;
    vector<long long> a(n);

    long long x = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
      cin >> a[j];
      x ^= a[j];
    }

    if (x == 0) {
      cout << "YES\n";
      continue;
    }

    int cnt = 0;
    long long cur = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
      cur ^= a[j];
      if (cur == x) {
        ++cnt;
        cur = 0;
      }
    }

    cout << (cnt & 1 && cnt > k ? "YES" : "NO") << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- Removed unnecessary headers.
- Removed unused aliases and typedefs.
- Replaced custom input/output functions with standard input/output functions.
- Replaced range-based for loops with index-based for loops.
- Calculated the XOR value in a single pass using a loop.
- Optimized conditionals to reduce the number of comparisons.
