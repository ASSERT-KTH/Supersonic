The given program has a lot of unnecessary code and includes numerous unused libraries. It also contains a large number of macros that make the code difficult to read and understand. In addition, there are unnecessary debugging statements and functions that are not used in the main program. These can be removed to optimize the program for running time and memory usage.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary library includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`, which are not used in the main program. These can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program contains a large number of macros that are not used in the main program. These macros should be removed to simplify the code and improve readability.

3. Remove unnecessary debugging statements: The program contains a `debug` function that is used for debugging purposes. These statements should be removed to improve the running time of the program.

4. Remove unused functions: The program contains several functions that are not used in the main program. These functions should be removed to optimize the program for memory usage.

5. Simplify the main program: The main program can be simplified by removing unnecessary variables and using simpler logic. The program can be modified to directly find the longest prefix of the given string `s` that is also a suffix of `s`. This can be done by using the Z algorithm to calculate the Z values for the string `s`. Then, we can iterate over the Z values from the end of the string and find the longest value that matches the condition `i + z[i] == n`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This will give us the length of the longest prefix that is also a suffix of `s`. We can then output the substring of `s` with this length as the result.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

vector<int> Z(string s) {
  int n = s.size();
  vector<int> z(n);
  for (int i = 1, l = 0, r = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i <= r)
      z[i] = min(r - i + 1, z[i - l]);
    while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[z[i] + i]) {
      ++z[i];
    }
    if (i + z[i] - 1 > r) {
      l = i;
      r = i + z[i] - 1;
    }
  }
  return z;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  string p = "Just a legend";
  int n = s.size();
  vector<int> z = Z(s);
  set<int> ss;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    ss.insert(z[i]);
  
  int ans = -1;
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    ss.erase(ss.find(z[i]));
    if (i + z[i] == n) {
      auto it = ss.lower_bound(z[i]);
      if (it != ss.end() && *it >= z[i]) {
        ans = max(ans, z[i]);
      }
    }
  }
  
  if (ans == -1)
    cout << p;
  else
    cout << s.substr(0, ans);
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program removes unnecessary code and simplifies the logic to improve running time and memory usage.
