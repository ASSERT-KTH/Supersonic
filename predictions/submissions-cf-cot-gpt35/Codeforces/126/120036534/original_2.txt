Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files and namespaces.
- The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not recommended in competitive programming because it includes a large number of header files, increasing compilation time. We can include only the necessary header files instead.
- The program includes the `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>` header files, but they are not used in the program. We can remove them.
- The program uses the `std` and `__gnu_pbds` namespaces, but only the `std` namespace is used. We can remove the `using namespace __gnu_pbds;` line.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary template aliases and functions.
- The program defines the `minpq` template alias, but it is not used. We can remove it.
- The program defines the `make_unique` function, but it is not used. We can remove it.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary debug printing functions.
- The program defines several debug printing functions, but they are not used. We can remove them.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary macros.
- The program defines several macros, such as `ll`, `ull`, `precise`, `endl`, `ld`, `pi`, `fo`, `tol`, `tou`, `all`, `pb`, `mt`, `lb`, `ub`, `mkp`, `tr`, `rtr`, `gcd`, `pq`, `fr`, `sc`, `sz`, `T`, `rep`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `bitcount`, `printn`, `prints`, `OS`, and `printclock`. None of these macros are used in the program. We can remove them.

Step 5: Optimize the `Z` function.
- The `Z` function calculates the Z-array of a string, which is used to find the longest prefix of the string that is also a suffix. The function can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm or the Z-algorithm with linear time complexity.
- However, since the `Z` function is not used in the program, we can remove it.

Step 6: Optimize the main logic.
- The main logic of the program can be optimized by removing unnecessary operations and variables.
- The program calculates the Z-array of the input string `s` and stores it in the vector `z`. It then creates a multiset `ss` to store the elements of `z`. The program then iterates over `z` in reverse order and checks if there is a prefix of `s` that is also a suffix. This can be done by checking if the current element of `z` is in `ss`. If it is, the program updates the answer.
- However, this approach is inefficient because it iterates over `z` in reverse order and performs a search operation in the multiset for each element. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of `s`.
- We can optimize the main logic by using a more efficient algorithm. One possible approach is to use the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to find the longest prefix of `s` that is also a suffix. This can be done by calculating the failure function of `s` and finding the maximum value in the failure function array. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and does not require the use of a multiset.
- Another approach is to use the Z-algorithm to find the longest prefix of `s` that is also a suffix. This can be done by calculating the Z-array of `s` and finding the maximum value in the Z-array. This approach also has a time complexity of O(n) and does not require the use of a multiset.
- Since the program does not specify which approach to use, we will choose the simpler approach of using the Z-algorithm.

Here is the optimized program:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    
    string p = "Just a legend";
    int n = s.size();
    
    vector<int> z(n);
    
    for (int i = 1, l = 0, r = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i <= r)
            z[i] = min(r - i + 1, z[i - l]);
        while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[z[i] + i]) {
            ++z[i];
        }
        if (i + z[i] - 1 > r) {
            l = i;
            r = i + z[i] - 1;
        }
    }
    
    int ans = -1;
    
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (i + z[i] == n) {
            ans = max(ans, z[i]);
        }
    }
    
    if (ans == -1)
        cout << p;
    else
        cout << s.substr(0, ans);
    
    return 0;
}
```
