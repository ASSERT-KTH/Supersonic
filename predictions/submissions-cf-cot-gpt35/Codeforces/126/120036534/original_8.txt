The given program is a C++ program that finds the longest proper suffix of a string `s` which is also a prefix of `s`.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes unnecessary header files `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. We can remove these includes as they are not used in the program.

2. Remove unused function `make_unique`: The program defines a function `make_unique` but it is not used anywhere in the program. We can remove this function to optimize the program.

3. Remove debugging code: The program includes a lot of debugging code that prints debug information to the standard error stream. We can remove all the debugging code to optimize the program.

4. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the program. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

5. Optimize the `Z` function: The program defines a function `Z` that calculates the Z-array of a string. We can optimize this function by removing unnecessary variables and optimizing the loop.

6. Optimize the main logic: The program finds the longest proper suffix of a string `s` which is also a prefix of `s`. We can optimize this logic by removing unnecessary variables and simplifying the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

vector<int> Z(string s) {
    int n = s.size();
    vector<int> z(n);
    for (int i = 1, l = 0, r = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i <= r)
            z[i] = min(r - i + 1, z[i - l]);
        while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[z[i] + i]) {
            ++z[i];
        }
        if (i + z[i] - 1 > r) {
            l = i;
            r = i + z[i] - 1;
        }
    }
    return z;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    string s;
    cin >> s;

    string p = "Just a legend";
    int n = s.size();
    vector<int> z = Z(s);
    multiset<int> ss;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        ss.insert(z[i]);

    int ans = -1;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        ss.erase(ss.find(z[i]));
        if (i + z[i] == n) {
            auto it = ss.lower_bound(z[i]);
            if (it != ss.end() && *it >= z[i])
                ans = max(ans, z[i]);
        }
    }

    if (ans == -1)
        cout << p;
    else
        cout << s.substr(0, ans);

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The unnecessary includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>` are removed from the program.

2. Removed unused function `make_unique`: The unused function `make_unique` is removed from the program.

3. Removed debugging code: All the debugging code is removed from the program.

4. Removed unused macros: The unused macros are removed from the program.

5. Optimized the `Z` function: The `Z` function is optimized by removing unnecessary variables and optimizing the loop.

6. Optimized the main logic: The main logic is optimized by removing unnecessary variables and simplifying the loop.
