Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
- The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which may not be necessary for this program. We can remove it and only include the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
- The `mod` macro is defined but not used in the program. We can remove it.
- The `rep` macro is defined but not used in the program. We can remove it.
- The `rep1` macro is defined but not used in the program. We can remove it.
- The `endl` macro is defined but not used in the program. We can remove it.
- The `is_pot` macro is defined but not used in the program. We can remove it.
- The `PI` macro is defined but not used in the program. We can remove it.
- The `degreesToRadians` macro is defined but not used in the program. We can remove it.
- The `radiansToDegrees` macro is defined but not used in the program. We can remove it.
- The `epsilon` macro is defined but not used in the program. We can remove it.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary typedefs
- The `ll` typedef is defined but not used in the program. We can remove it.
- The `ld` typedef is defined but not used in the program. We can remove it.

Step 4: Optimize the `power` function
- The `power` function is used to calculate the power of a number modulo `p`. We can optimize it by using the binary exponentiation algorithm. This algorithm reduces the number of multiplication operations required to calculate the power. Instead of multiplying the base `x` `y` times, we can square the base and halve the exponent at each step.
- We can modify the `power` function to take advantage of the optimization. This will improve the running time of the program.

Step 5: Optimize the `divisors` function
- The `divisors` function calculates all the divisors of a given number `n` using trial division. However, we can optimize it by finding divisors in pairs. For each divisor `i`, if `n` is divisible by `i`, then the other divisor will be `n / i`. This way, we only need to iterate up to the square root of `n` and find divisors in pairs.
- We can modify the `divisors` function to use this optimization. This will improve the running time of the program.

Step 6: Optimize the main logic
- The main logic of the program can be optimized by reducing the number of unnecessary calculations and using more efficient data structures.
- We can modify the main logic to use a single loop instead of two loops. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time of the program.
- We can also replace the `map<int, int>` with a simple array to store the values. This will reduce the memory usage of the program.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

const int mod = 1000000007;

int power(int x, int y, int p) {
  int res = 1;
  x = x % p;
  if (x == 0)
    return 0;
  while (y > 0) {
    if (y & 1)
      res = (res * x) % p;
    y = y >> 1;
    x = (x * x) % p;
  }
  return res;
}

vector<int> divisors(int n) {
  vector<int> v;
  for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
    if (n % i == 0) {
      if (n / i == i)
        v.push_back(i);
      else {
        v.push_back(i);
        v.push_back(n / i);
      }
    }
  }
  return v;
}

void solve() {
  int x, y;
  cin >> x >> y;
  if (y % x != 0) {
    cout << 0 << endl;
    return;
  }
  if (y / x == 1) {
    cout << 1 << endl;
    return;
  }
  int sum = y / x;
  int ans = power(2, sum - 1, mod);
  ans = (ans - 1 + mod) % mod;
  vector<int> div = divisors(sum);
  sort(div.begin(), div.end());
  int mp[1000005] = {0};
  for (int i = 0; i < div.size(); i++) {
    int cur = power(2, div[i] - 1, mod);
    vector<int> div1 = divisors(div[i]);
    for (int p : div1) {
      cur = (cur - mp[p] + mod) % mod;
    }
    mp[div[i]] = (cur - 1 + mod) % mod;
    ans = (ans - (cur - 1) + mod) % mod;
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
