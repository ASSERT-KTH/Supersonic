The given program performs a breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list using vectors. It counts the number of connected components in the graph where each component has the property that the number of nodes is equal to the number of edges.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not necessary. We can include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<queue>`.

2. Avoid global variables: The variables `nn` and `ne` are unnecessary as global variables. We can move them inside the `bfs` function.

3. Remove redundant statements: The line `vis[u] = true;` is redundant because `vis[u]` is already set to `true` before entering the `while` loop.

4. Use `emplace` instead of `push`: Instead of using `q.push(p);`, we can use `q.emplace(p);` to avoid creating unnecessary copies of integers.

5. Use a range-based `for` loop: Instead of using an index-based `for` loop, we can use a range-based `for` loop to iterate over the elements of `v[u]`.

6. Use `reserve` to optimize memory allocation: We can use the `reserve` function to preallocate memory for the vectors `v` and `vis` based on the input size.

7. Avoid unnecessary assignments: The line `u = q.front();` is unnecessary because `u` is already assigned the value of `q.front()` in the previous iteration.

8. Use `scanf` instead of `iostream` for input: The program uses `scanf` for input, which is generally faster than using `iostream`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m, a, b, c = 0;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  
  vector<vector<int>> v(n + 1);
  vector<bool> vis(n + 1, false);
  
  while (m--) {
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    v[a].push_back(b);
    v[b].push_back(a);
  }
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (!vis[i]) {
      int nn = 0, ne = 0;
      vis[i] = true;
      queue<int> q;
      q.emplace(i);
      
      while (!q.empty()) {
        int u = q.front();
        q.pop();
        nn++;
        
        if (v[u].size() == 2)
          ne++;
        
        for (int p : v[u]) {
          if (!vis[p]) {
            vis[p] = true;
            q.emplace(p);
          }
        }
      }
      
      if (nn == ne)
        c++;
    }
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", c);
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should result in improved running time and reduced memory usage compared to the original program.
