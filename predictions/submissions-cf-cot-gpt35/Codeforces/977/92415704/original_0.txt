The given program is using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to count the number of connected components in an undirected graph. The program initializes a vector of vectors `v` to represent the adjacency list of the graph and an array `vis` to keep track of visited nodes. It then iterates over all nodes and performs a BFS from each unvisited node. If the number of nodes visited in the BFS is equal to the number of edges visited (`nn == ne`), it increments a counter `c`. Finally, it prints the value of `c`.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables `nn` and `ne` are not needed outside the `bfs` function. We can remove them from the global scope and declare them as local variables inside the function.

2. Use `bool` instead of `int` for `vis` array: Since the `vis` array is used only for marking visited nodes, we can change its data type from `int` to `bool`. This will reduce memory usage.

3. Remove unnecessary check for `v[u].size() == 2`: The condition `v[u].size() == 2` is checked for every node in the BFS. Since we are only interested in counting the number of nodes and edges, we don't need to check the size of the adjacency list. We can remove this condition.

4. Use range-based for loop: Instead of using a traditional for loop to iterate over the elements of `v[u]`, we can use a range-based for loop. This will simplify the code and make it easier to read.

5. Use `scanf` with format specifier `%*d` to ignore input: In the input loop, we are only interested in reading the values of `a` and `b`, and we don't need to store them. We can use the format specifier `%*d` to ignore the input.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> v[200010];
bool vis[200010];

void bfs(int u) {
  int nn = 0, ne = 0;
  vis[u] = true;
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(u);
  while (!q.empty()) {
    u = q.front();
    q.pop();
    nn++;
    vis[u] = true;
    for (int p : v[u]) {
      if (!vis[p]) {
        vis[p] = true;
        q.push(p);
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n, m, c = 0;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  while (m--) {
    scanf("%*d %*d");
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (!vis[i]) {
      bfs(i);
      if (nn == ne)
        c++;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", c);
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have reduced the memory usage and improved the readability of the code.
