Step 1: Avoid using unnecessary headers
The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not a standard header and includes unnecessary headers. We can replace it with the specific headers that are actually required by the program.

Step 2: Optimize the use of the vector
The program uses a vector of vectors `v` to represent an adjacency list. However, this can be optimized by using a more memory-efficient data structure. Instead of using a vector of vectors, we can use a vector of unordered sets. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance when searching for elements.

Step 3: Optimize the use of the vis array
The program uses a boolean array `vis` to keep track of visited nodes. However, this array is not necessary as we can check if a node is visited by checking if it exists in the queue. This will eliminate the need for the `vis` array and reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Optimize the use of the queue
The program uses a queue to perform a breadth-first search. However, we can optimize this by using a deque instead of a queue. This will allow us to efficiently remove elements from both ends of the deque, resulting in a faster search.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <deque>
using namespace std;

vector<unordered_set<int>> v;
int nn, ne;

void bfs(int u) {
  nn = 0, ne = 0;
  deque<int> q;
  q.push_back(u);
  while (!q.empty()) {
    u = q.front();
    q.pop_front();
    nn++;
    if (v[u].size() == 2)
      ne++;
    for (int p : v[u]) {
      if (q.count(p) == 0) {
        q.push_back(p);
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int i, n, m, a, b, c = 0;
  cin >> n >> m;
  v.resize(n + 1);
  for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> a >> b;
    v[a].insert(b);
    v[b].insert(a);
  }
  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (v[i].empty()) {
      c++;
    } else if (v[i].size() == 1) {
      bfs(i);
      if (nn == ne)
        c++;
    }
  }
  cout << c << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. The unnecessary header `<bits/stdc++.h>` is replaced with the required headers `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<unordered_set>`, and `<deque>`.
2. The vector of vectors `v` is replaced with a vector of unordered sets to optimize memory usage.
3. The boolean array `vis` is removed as it is not necessary.
4. The queue is replaced with a deque to optimize the breadth-first search.
5. The `scanf` function is replaced with the `cin` function for input and the `printf` function is replaced with the `cout` function for output.
6. The program now checks for nodes that are isolated (size 0) and nodes that have only one neighbor (size 1) separately, which allows us to avoid unnecessary BFS calls for isolated nodes.
