The given program seems to have unnecessary macros and includes that are not used in the program. These macros and includes can be removed to simplify the program.

The use of the "bits/stdc++.h" header is discouraged as it includes all standard library headers, which can lead to longer compilation times. Instead, we can include the necessary headers individually.

The program also uses a lot of unnecessary macros and typedefs. These can be removed to improve code readability.

The "solve" function can be made static as it is only used within the main function.

The "res" vector can be initialized with the expected size to avoid unnecessary reallocation.

The "solve" function can be modified to take the necessary input as parameters instead of reading from cin.

The "solve" function can be modified to return the result instead of printing it directly, allowing for better separation of concerns.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

typedef long long int ll;

void dfs(ll node, ll par, ll pre, ll ppre, vector<ll>& init, vector<ll>& goal, vector<ll>& res) {
  if (ppre) {
    init[node] ^= 1;
  }
  if (init[node] != goal[node]) {
    res.push_back(node);
    ppre ^= 1;
  }
  for (auto v : g[node]) {
    if (v == par)
      continue;
    dfs(v, node, ppre, pre, init, goal, res);
  }
}

vector<ll> solve(ll n, vector<pair<ll, ll>>& edges, vector<ll>& init, vector<ll>& goal) {
  vector<ll> res;
  vector<vector<ll>> g(n + 1);
  for (auto& edge : edges) {
    ll a = edge.first, b = edge.second;
    g[a].push_back(b);
    g[b].push_back(a);
  }
  dfs(1, 0, 0, 0, init, goal, res);
  return res;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  ll n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<pair<ll, ll>> edges(n - 1);
  for (ll i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    cin >> edges[i].first >> edges[i].second;
  }

  vector<ll> init(n + 1), goal(n + 1);
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> init[i];
  }
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> goal[i];
  }

  vector<ll> res = solve(n, edges, init, goal);

  cout << res.size() << endl;
  for (auto v : res) {
    cout << v << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
