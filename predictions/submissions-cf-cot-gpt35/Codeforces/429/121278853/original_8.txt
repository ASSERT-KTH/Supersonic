The given program is quite lengthy and contains unnecessary macros and includes. 

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not recommended and can be replaced with specific includes such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, etc.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs that are not used in the code. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code.

4. Use standard naming conventions: The program uses non-standard naming conventions for variables and functions. We can rename these to follow standard naming conventions.

5. Optimize the `dfs` function: The `dfs` function is called recursively and performs some unnecessary operations. We can optimize this function to reduce time and memory usage.

6. Remove unnecessary output statements: The program prints some unnecessary output statements. We can remove these to simplify the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int MAX = 100100;
int n, init[MAX], goal[MAX], ans;
vector<int> g[MAX], res;

void dfs(int node, int par, int pre, int ppre) {
  if (ppre) {
    init[node] ^= 1;
  }
  if (init[node] != goal[node]) {
    ans++;
    res.push_back(node);
    ppre ^= 1;
  }
  for (auto v : g[node]) {
    if (v == par) {
      continue;
    }
    dfs(v, node, ppre, pre);
  }
}

void solve() {
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    g[a].push_back(b);
    g[b].push_back(a);
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> init[i];
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> goal[i];
  }
  dfs(1, 0, 0, 0);
  cout << ans << endl;
  for (auto v : res) {
    cout << v << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
