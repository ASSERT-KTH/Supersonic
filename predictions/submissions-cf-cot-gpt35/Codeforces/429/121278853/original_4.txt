The given program has several areas where optimization can be done:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the header `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not standard and includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this header and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused macros: There are several macros defined in the program that are not used. We can remove these unused macros to improve readability.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: There are several typedefs defined in the program that are not used. We can remove these unnecessary typedefs to improve readability.

4. Use pass-by-reference instead of pass-by-value: The `dfs` function is currently passing parameters by value. We can modify it to pass parameters by reference to avoid unnecessary copying.

5. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: The program uses `push_back` to insert elements into vectors. Using `emplace_back` can be more efficient as it avoids the construction of temporary objects.

6. Avoid unnecessary modulo operations: The `mul`, `add`, and `sub` functions perform modulo operations unnecessarily. We can remove these modulo operations to improve performance.

7. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The `mpow` function performs unnecessary calculations in the loop. We can optimize this loop to reduce the number of calculations.

8. Use iterators instead of range-based loops: The program uses range-based loops to iterate over vectors. Using iterators can be more efficient, especially when the vectors are large.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long int ll;

ll n, init[100100], goal[100100], ans;
vector<ll> g[100100];
vector<ll> res;

void dfs(ll node, ll par, ll& ppre) {
  if (ppre) {
    init[node] ^= 1;
  }
  if (init[node] != goal[node]) {
    ans++;
    res.emplace_back(node);
    ppre ^= 1;
  }
  for (auto it = g[node].begin(); it != g[node].end(); ++it) {
    if (*it == par) {
      continue;
    }
    dfs(*it, node, ppre);
  }
}

void solve() {
  cin >> n;
  for (ll i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    ll a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    g[a].emplace_back(b);
    g[b].emplace_back(a);
  }
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> init[i + 1];
  }
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> goal[i + 1];
  }
  ll ppre = 0;
  dfs(1, 0, ppre);
  cout << ans << endl;
  for (auto it = res.begin(); it != res.end(); ++it) {
    cout << *it << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  solve();
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary headers, macros, and typedefs. It also modifies the `dfs` function to pass parameters by reference and uses `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`. Unnecessary modulo operations and calculations are also removed. Finally, iterators are used instead of range-based loops for better efficiency.
