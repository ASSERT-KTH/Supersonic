Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header file: The code includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not necessary and can be removed.

2. Use `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout`: The `cin` and `cout` streams are slower than `scanf` and `printf` for input/output operations. By using `scanf` and `printf`, we can improve the performance of the program.

3. Use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the sum: Instead of iterating over the array twice (once to calculate the sum and once to find the minimum element), we can calculate the sum and find the minimum element in a single pass over the array.

4. Remove unnecessary variable and condition: The variable `test` is not needed, as the loop can be controlled directly using the condition `test--`. Additionally, the condition `if (n > 1)` is not necessary, as the loop will not be entered if `n` is less than or equal to 1.

5. Use `float` instead of `double` for precision: Since the required precision is up to 8 decimal places, using `float` instead of `double` will save memory.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int test;
    scanf("%d", &test);
    while (test--) {
        int n;
        scanf("%d", &n);
        int arr[n];
        long long int sum = 0;
        int min = INT_MIN;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
            sum += arr[i];
            if (arr[i] > min)
                min = arr[i];
        }
        float ans = float((sum - min) / (n - 1)) + min;
        printf("%.8f\n", ans);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
