The given program calculates the average of an array of integers by excluding the smallest element. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of elements in the array and the array itself. It then calculates the sum of the array elements and finds the smallest element. Finally, it calculates the average by excluding the smallest element and prints the result.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:
1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary. We can remove it.
2. Avoid using variable-length arrays: The program uses a variable-length array `arr[n]` to store the array elements. Variable-length arrays are not supported in standard C++. We can use `std::vector` instead, which provides dynamic array-like functionality.
3. Optimize calculation of the sum: Instead of calculating the sum using a loop, we can use `std::accumulate` function from the `<numeric>` header to calculate the sum in a more concise and efficient way.
4. Optimize finding the smallest element: Instead of checking each element and updating the smallest element, we can use the `std::min_element` function from the `<algorithm>` header to find the smallest element in the array.
5. Avoid unnecessary type conversions: The program converts the result of the average calculation to a `double` using explicit type casting. Instead, we can perform the calculation in `double` precision from the beginning by dividing the sum by `n` as a `double`.
6. Avoid unnecessary precision setting: The program sets the precision of the output using `std::setprecision` function. Since we are already using `double` precision for the average calculation, we can remove this setting.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

int main() {
  int test;
  std::cin >> test;
  while (test--) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<int> arr(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> arr[i];
    }
    if (n > 1) {
      double sum = std::accumulate(arr.begin(), arr.end(), 0);
      double min = *std::min_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
      double ans = (sum - min) / (n - 1) + min;
      std::cout << ans << std::endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
