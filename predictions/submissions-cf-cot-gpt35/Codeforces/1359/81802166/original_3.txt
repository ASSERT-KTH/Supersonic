Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes headers that are not used. We can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary typedefs
The program defines typedefs for long long int, unsigned long long int, and long double. However, these typedefs are not used in the program. We can remove them to reduce memory usage.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary using statements
The program includes using statements for the pb_ds associative container and tree policy, but they are not used in the program. We can remove them to reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary macros
The program defines macros for various operations, such as push_back, pop_back, etc. However, these macros are not used in the program. We can remove them to reduce memory usage.

Step 5: Replace unnecessary function calls with their actual implementations
The program defines various functions, such as accumulate, max_element, etc., using the all(v) macro. These functions can be replaced with their actual implementations to improve performance.

Step 6: Replace unnecessary variables with their actual values
The program defines constants, such as mod2 and mod, using macros. These constants can be replaced with their actual values to improve performance.

Step 7: Remove unused variables and functions
The program defines variables and functions that are not used. We can remove them to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

long long power(long long x, long long y, long long p) {
  long long res = 1;
  x = x % p;
  while (y > 0) {
    if (y & 1)
      res = (res * x) % p;
    y = y >> 1;
    x = (x * x) % p;
  }
  return res;
}

long long maxSubArraySum(vector<long long>& a, long long F) {
  long long max_so_far = INT_MIN, max_ending_here = 0;
  long long size = a.size();
  long long M = -31;
  for (long long i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    M = max(M, a[i]);
    max_ending_here = max_ending_here + a[i];
    if ((max_so_far < max_ending_here) and (M == F))
      max_so_far = max_ending_here;
    if (max_ending_here < 0 or M > F)
      max_ending_here = 0, M = -31;
  }
  return max_so_far;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  long long T = 1;
  while (T--) {
    long long n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<long long> a(n);
    for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
    }
    long long R = 0;
    for (long long i = -30; i < 31; i++) {
      R = max(R, (maxSubArraySum(a, i) - i));
    }
    cout << R << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
