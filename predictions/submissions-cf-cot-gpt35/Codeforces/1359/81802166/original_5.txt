1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary header files, such as `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. These headers are not used in the program and can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs, such as `lli`, `ulli`, and `ldb`. These typedefs are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Avoid using `using namespace` directive: The program uses the `using namespace` directive for both `__gnu_pbds` and `std` namespaces. It is generally considered a good practice to avoid using the `using namespace` directive to prevent potential naming conflicts. Instead, it is better to use the namespace explicitly where needed.

4. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros, such as `pb`, `popb`, `pf`, `popf`, `si`, `be`, `en`, `le`, `acc`, `F`, `S`, `INF`, `forz`, `fore`, `rforz`, `rforzm`, `deci`, `high`, `highll`, `parity`, `ctz`, `lb`, `ub`, `er`, `maxe`, `mine`, `mod2`, `kira`, and `rang`. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

5. Avoid global variables: The program declares several global variables, such as `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a`. It is generally considered a good practice to avoid using global variables and instead pass them as function arguments or use local variables.

6. Avoid unnecessary function declarations: The program declares several inline functions, such as `power`, `modadd`, `modmul`, and `modi`. These functions are not used in the program and can be removed.

7. Use range-based for loop: The program uses a traditional for loop to iterate over the elements of the vector `a`. It is more concise and readable to use a range-based for loop instead.

8. Avoid unnecessary if condition: The `md` function unnecessarily checks if `x` is greater than or equal to 0. Since the function is only used with positive values, this condition can be removed.

9. Use const reference for function parameter: The `maxSubArraySum` function takes `F` as a parameter, but it is not modified within the function. It is better to pass `F` as a const reference to avoid unnecessary copy.

10. Remove unused variable: The `size` variable is not used in the `maxSubArraySum` function and can be removed.

11. Use const reference for read-only variables: The `i` variable in the range-based for loop within the `maxSubArraySum` function is only used for read-only purposes. It is better to declare it as a const reference to avoid unnecessary copy.

12. Use `auto` keyword for type deduction: The `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here` variables in the `maxSubArraySum` function have their types explicitly declared as `lli`, but they can be deduced automatically using the `auto` keyword.

13. Use prefix increment operator: The program uses the postfix increment operator (`i++`) in the range-based for loop within the `maxSubArraySum` function. It is more efficient to use the prefix increment operator (`++i`) when the value of the incremented variable is not used.

14. Remove unnecessary return statement: The `run_time` function has a return statement at the end, but it is not necessary as the function has a void return type. The return statement can be removed.

15. Use `std::max_element` instead of custom max function: The `maxSubArraySum` function uses a custom max function to find the maximum element in the vector `a`. It is more efficient and readable to use the `std::max_element` function from the `<algorithm>` header.

16. Use `std::accumulate` instead of custom accumulate function: The `acc` macro uses a custom accumulate function to calculate the sum of elements in a vector. It is more efficient and readable to use the `std::accumulate` function from the `<numeric>` header.

17. Avoid unnecessary type casting: The `max_so_far` variable in the `maxSubArraySum` function is explicitly casted to `lli(INT_MIN)`, but it is not necessary as `INT_MIN` is already of type `lli`.

18. Remove unnecessary comments: The program has a comment indicating the end of the code, but it can be removed as it is not necessary.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

typedef long long int lli;

lli maxSubArraySum(const std::vector<lli>& a, const lli& F) {
    lli max_so_far = std::numeric_limits<lli>::min();
    lli max_ending_here = 0;
    lli M = -31;
    for (const auto& num : a) {
        M = std::max(M, num);
        max_ending_here = std::max(max_ending_here + num, 0LL);
        if ((max_so_far < max_ending_here) && (M == F))
            max_so_far = max_ending_here;
        if (max_ending_here < 0 || M > F)
            max_ending_here = 0, M = -31;
    }
    return max_so_far;
}

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    std::cin.tie(0);
    std::cout.tie(0);

    lli T = 1;
    while (T--) {
        lli n;
        std::cin >> n;
        std::vector<lli> a(n);
        for (auto& num : a)
            std::cin >> num;
        lli R = 0;
        for (lli i = -30; i < 31; i++) {
            R = std::max(R, maxSubArraySum(a, i) - i);
        }
        std::cout << R << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
