The given program has some unnecessary code and inefficient functions that can be optimized.

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes some unnecessary headers that are not used in the code. We can remove these includes to improve the compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines some typedefs that are not used. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code and improve readability.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines some macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code and improve readability.

4. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines some inline functions that are not used. We can remove these functions to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

5. Simplify the maxSubArraySum function: The maxSubArraySum function can be simplified by removing unnecessary variables and conditions.

6. Simplify the main function: The main function can be simplified by removing unnecessary variables.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

long long maxSubArraySum(vector<long long>& a, long long F) {
    long long max_so_far = INT_MIN, max_ending_here = 0;
    long long size = a.size();
    long long M = -31;
    for (long long i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        M = max(M, a[i]);
        max_ending_here = max_ending_here + a[i];
        if ((max_so_far < max_ending_here) && (M == F))
            max_so_far = max_ending_here;
        if (max_ending_here < 0 || M > F)
            max_ending_here = 0, M = -31;
    }
    return max_so_far;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    cout.tie(nullptr);
    
    long long T = 1;
    while (T--) {
        long long n;
        cin >> n;
        vector<long long> a(n);
        for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }
        long long R = 0;
        for (long long i = -30; i < 31; i++) {
            R = max(R, (maxSubArraySum(a, i) - i));
        }
        cout << R << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The program originally included some unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. These headers were not used in the code, so they were removed to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Removed unnecessary typedefs: The program originally defined some typedefs, such as `lli` and `ulli`, which were not used in the code. These typedefs were removed to simplify the code and improve readability.

3. Removed unnecessary macros: The program originally defined some macros, such as `pb`, `popb`, `pf`, `popf`, etc., which were not used in the code. These macros were removed to simplify the code and improve readability.

4. Removed unnecessary functions: The program originally defined some inline functions, such as `power`, `modadd`, `modmul`, etc., which were not used in the code. These functions were removed to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

5. Simplified the maxSubArraySum function: The maxSubArraySum function originally had some unnecessary variables and conditions. These unnecessary parts were removed to simplify the function and improve efficiency.

6. Simplified the main function: The main function originally had some unnecessary variables, such as `k`, which were not used in the code. These unnecessary variables were removed to simplify the code.
