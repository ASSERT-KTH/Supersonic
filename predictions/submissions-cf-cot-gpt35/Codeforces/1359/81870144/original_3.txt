To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down compilation. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused macros: There are several macros defined in the program that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove unused typedefs: Several typedefs are defined but not used. We can remove them to reduce unnecessary code.

4. Remove unused constants: The constants `R`, `tx`, `ty`, and `rev_to` are defined but not used. We can remove them to reduce unnecessary code.

5. Use `reserve` for map: The `dp` map is resized in each iteration of the outer loop. We can optimize this by using the `reserve` function to allocate memory for the map in advance, reducing memory reallocations.

6. Optimize loop conditions: The loop conditions for the inner loops can be optimized to avoid unnecessary iterations. For example, instead of iterating from -30 to 30, we can iterate from `max(-30, a[i])` to 30.

7. Optimize variable types: The variables `ans` and `j` can be declared as `ll` instead of `int` to avoid unnecessary type conversions.

8. Remove unnecessary ternary operator: The ternary operator in the line `ans = max(ans, (dp[i][j] ? dp[i][j] - j : 0));` can be simplified by removing the ternary operator and directly subtracting `j` from `dp[i][j]` if `dp[i][j]` is nonzero.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);

  ll n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<ll> a(n);
  for (auto &z : a)
    cin >> z;

  vector<map<ll, ll>> dp(n + 1);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    dp[i + 1].reserve(61);
    for (int j = max(-30, (int)a[i]); j <= 30; j++) {
      ll to = max(a[i], (ll)j);
      dp[i + 1][to] = max(dp[i + 1][to], dp[i][j] + a[i]);
    }
  }

  ll ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = -30; j <= 30; j++) {
      ans = max(ans, dp[i][j] - j);
    }
  }

  cout << ans << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should have improved running time and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
