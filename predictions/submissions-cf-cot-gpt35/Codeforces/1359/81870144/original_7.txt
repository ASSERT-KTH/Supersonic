The given program is a dynamic programming solution to a problem. It uses a nested loop to iterate through the elements of an array and calculates the maximum sum of elements from a given index to the end of the array, subject to a condition that the current element must be greater than or equal to a certain value.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can significantly increase the compilation time and memory usage. We can remove this header and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary debug code: The program includes a debug class that is used for debugging purposes. This class is not used in the actual program logic and can be removed to improve the performance.

4. Optimize the nested loops: The program uses two nested loops to iterate through the elements of the array. However, the inner loop iterates from -30 to 30, even though the array elements are integers. We can optimize this loop by iterating from the minimum element of the array to the maximum element of the array.

5. Optimize the access to the dp array: The program uses a map to store the dynamic programming values. This can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and access time. We can optimize this by using a 2D array instead of a map, where the first dimension represents the index and the second dimension represents the maximum value.

6. Optimize the calculation of the ans variable: The program calculates the maximum value of dp[i][j] - j for all i and j. However, this can be simplified by calculating the maximum value of dp[i][j] directly.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int N = 1e5 + 1;
long long dp[N][61];

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (auto &z : a)
    cin >> z;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int mn = *min_element(a.begin() + i, a.end());
    for (int j = mn; j <= 30; j++) {
      dp[i + 1][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - mn] + a[i]);
    }
  }

  long long ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    ans = max(ans, dp[i][30]);
  }

  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Optimization Steps:
1. Removed unnecessary headers.
2. Removed unused macros.
3. Removed unnecessary debug code.
4. Optimized the nested loops by iterating from the minimum element to the maximum element of the array.
5. Optimized the access to the dp array by using a 2D array instead of a map.
6. Optimized the calculation of the ans variable by directly calculating the maximum value of dp[i][j].
