Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros
- The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This is not necessary and can be replaced with the specific headers that are actually used in the program.
- The `#define LOCAL` macro is not used and can be removed.
- The `#define sim` macro is not used and can be removed.
- The `#define ris` macro is not used and can be removed.
- The `#define dor` macro is not used and can be removed.
- The `#define eni(x)` macro is not used and can be removed.
- The `#define debug` struct and related macros are not used and can be removed.
- The `#define imie(...)` macro is not used and can be removed.
- The `#define vi_a` macro is not used and can be removed.
- The `#define p_b` macro is not used and can be removed.
- The `#define ld` macro is not used and can be removed.
- The `#define pll` macro is not used and can be removed.
- The `#define pii` macro is not used and can be removed.
- The `#define m_p` macro is not used and can be removed.
- The `#define getfiles` macro is not used and can be removed.
- The `#define pw(x)` macro is not used and can be removed.
- The `#define rall(x)` macro is not used and can be removed.
- The `#define len(a)` macro is not used and can be removed.
- The `#define rep(x, l, r)` macro is not used and can be removed.
- The `ld eps` variable is not used and can be removed.
- The `const ll pi` variable is not used and can be removed.
- The `ll inf` variable is not used and can be removed.
- The `ll mod2` variable is not used and can be removed.
- The `ll mod1` variable is not used and can be removed.
- The `ll sqr(ll a)` function is not used and can be removed.
- The `ll qb(ll a)` function is not used and can be removed.
- The `ll gcd(ll a, ll b)` function is not used and can be removed.
- The `ll binpow(ll a, ll b, ll mod)` function is not used and can be removed.
- The `ll binmult(ll a, ll b, ll mod)` function is not used and can be removed.
- The `const ll R` variable is not used and can be removed.
- The `const ll tx[2]` array is not used and can be removed.
- The `const ll ty[2]` array is not used and can be removed.
- The `const char rev_to[4]` array is not used and can be removed.

Step 2: Remove unused variables and functions
- The `n` variable is only used to read input and can be removed.
- The `vector<ll> a` variable is only used to read input and can be removed.

Step 3: Optimize the nested loops
- The program uses two nested loops to iterate over all pairs `(i, j)` where `i` goes from `0` to `n` and `j` goes from `-30` to `30`. However, the `dp` array is only accessed for indices `i+1` and `j`, so the loops can be modified to iterate from `1` to `n+1` and from `0` to `31` respectively. This will avoid unnecessary checks and improve performance.

Step 4: Optimize the computation of `ans`
- The computation of `ans` can be optimized by removing the conditional check `(dp[i][j] ? dp[i][j] - j : 0)`. Since `dp[i][j]` is always non-negative, we can simply compute `ans` as `max(ans, dp[i][j] - j)`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  vector<map<int, long long>> dp(n + 1);
  long long ans = 0;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= 30; j++) {
      int to = max(a[i-1], j);
      dp[i][to] = max(dp[i][to], dp[i-1][j] + a[i-1]);
      ans = max(ans, dp[i][to] - j);
    }
  }
  
  cout << ans << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes unnecessary includes, macros, variables, and functions. It also optimizes the nested loops and the computation of `ans` to improve the running time and memory usage.
