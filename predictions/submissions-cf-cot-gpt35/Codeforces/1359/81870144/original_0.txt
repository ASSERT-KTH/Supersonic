The given program calculates the maximum sum of a subsequence of the given array `a` with a small modification. The modification is that the maximum sum is calculated by subtracting the index value `j` from the sum `dp[i][j]` if it is positive.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes a lot of unnecessary header files. We can remove it and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unused macros: The program has many unused macros like `LOCAL`, `vi_a`, `p_b`, etc. We can remove them to improve readability.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program typedefs `ll` as `int` and `ld` as `long double`, but these typedefs are not used anywhere. We can remove them.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the square and cube of a number using the `sqr` and `qb` functions respectively. However, these calculations are not needed in the given program. We can remove these functions.

5. Remove unused variables: The program declares variables `pi` and `pll` but they are not used anywhere. We can remove them.

6. Avoid unnecessary map initialization: The program initializes a map `dp` with a fixed size of `N`. However, only a subset of the map is used in the program. We can remove the map initialization and use a dynamic map instead.

7. Optimize the inner loop: The inner loop iterates over the range `[-30, 30]`. However, the values of `j` that are less than the maximum value of `a[i]` will never contribute to the maximum sum. We can optimize the inner loop by starting it from `a[i]` instead of `-30`.

8. Optimize the outer loop: The outer loop iterates over the range `[0, n]`. However, the values of `i` that are greater than the maximum index `n` will never contribute to the maximum sum. We can optimize the outer loop by starting it from `1` and ending it at `n`.

9. Optimize the calculation of the maximum sum: The program calculates the maximum sum by iterating over all the values of `dp[i][j]` and subtracting `j` if it is positive. However, we can optimize this calculation by keeping track of the maximum sum directly in the inner loop.

10. Remove unnecessary output: The program prints the time taken for execution using `cerr`. We can remove this output as it is not necessary.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (auto &z : a)
    cin >> z;

  map<int, long long> dp;
  long long ans = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    map<int, long long> temp;
    for (auto it = dp.begin(); it != dp.end(); ++it) {
      int j = it->first;
      int to = max(a[i], j);
      temp[to] = max(temp[to], it->second + a[i]);
      ans = max(ans, temp[to] - to);
    }
    dp = temp;
  }

  cout << ans;

  return 0;
}
```
