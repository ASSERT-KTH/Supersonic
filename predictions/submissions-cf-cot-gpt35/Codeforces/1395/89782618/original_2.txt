The given program calculates the minimum OR value of all possible combinations of elements from two arrays `a` and `b`. It uses a recursive function `recurse()` and a dynamic programming table `dp` to store the calculated results.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes unnecessary header files `algorithm`, `bitset`, and `limits`. Since these headers are not used in the code, we can remove them.

2. Use pass-by-reference for the vectors: The vectors `a`, `b`, and `dp` are currently passed by value to the `recurse()` function. To avoid unnecessary copying of these vectors, we can pass them by reference.

3. Use `const` references for unmodified vectors: The vectors `a` and `b` are not modified inside the `recurse()` function. We can change their references to `const` references to indicate that they are not modified.

4. Optimize the loop in the `recurse()` function: The `for` loop in the `recurse()` function iterates over all elements of the `b` array. However, since the OR operation is commutative, we can optimize this loop by iterating over the `a` array instead. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

5. Optimize the `dp` table initialization: The `dp` table is currently initialized with `-1` values. Since we are using `numeric_limits<int>::max()` as the initial value of `answer`, we can initialize the `dp` table with this value instead. This will eliminate the need for checking `-1` in the recursive function.

6. Use `emplace_back()` instead of `push_back()`: In the `main()` function, the vectors `a` and `b` are populated using `push_back()`. To optimize memory usage, we can use `emplace_back()` instead, which constructs the elements directly in the vector, avoiding unnecessary copies or moves.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int recurse(const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b, vector<vector<int>>& dp,
            int index = 0, int OR = 0) {
  if (index == a.size()) {
    return OR;
  }
  if (dp[index][OR] != numeric_limits<int>::max()) {
    return dp[index][OR];
  }
  int answer = numeric_limits<int>::max();
  for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); ++i) {
    int ret = recurse(a, b, dp, index + 1, OR | (a[index] & b[i]));
    answer = min(answer, ret);
  }
  return dp[index][OR] = answer;
}

int main(int argc, char const* argv[]) {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  vector<int> a, b;
  a.reserve(n);
  b.reserve(m);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int num;
    cin >> num;
    a.emplace_back(num);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    int num;
    cin >> num;
    b.emplace_back(num);
  }
  vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(1 << 9, numeric_limits<int>::max()));
  cout << recurse(a, b, dp) << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
