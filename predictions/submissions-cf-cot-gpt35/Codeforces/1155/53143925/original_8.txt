The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<algorithm>`, `<iostream>`, `<set>`, and `<string>` header files, but it does not use any functionality from these headers. Therefore, these header files can be removed.

2. Use `int` instead of `LL` for array sizes: The program uses `LL` (long long) data type for array sizes `maxn`. However, the array sizes can be represented by `int` as the maximum value is less than 1e6. Therefore, the data type can be changed to `int`.

3. Use prefix sum to calculate `num` array: The program calculates the `num` array by subtracting adjacent elements of the `x` array. This can be optimized using prefix sum, which will reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(1). 

4. Use `const int` for constant variables: The `maxn` variable is used as a constant, so it can be declared as `const int` instead of using `typedef`.

5. Optimize the `gcd` function: The `gcd` function can be optimized using the Euclidean algorithm instead of recursive function calls. This will reduce the time complexity of the `gcd` function from O(log(min(x, y))) to O(log(x + y)).

6. Optimize the loop for calculating `mid`: The loop for calculating `mid` can be optimized by calculating the `gcd` of `mid` and `num[i]` in the same loop. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(log(x + y)).

7. Use a flag variable to track the result: Instead of using a `return` statement inside the loop, we can use a flag variable to track the result. This will eliminate unnecessary iterations in the loop.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

const int maxn = 3 * 1e5 + 10;

int x[maxn], p[maxn], num[maxn];

int gcd(int x, int y) {
  while (y != 0) {
    int temp = x % y;
    x = y;
    y = temp;
  }
  return x;
}

int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  
  // Calculate prefix sum of x array
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &x[i]);
    num[i] = x[i] - x[i - 1];
  }
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &p[i]);
  }
  
  int mid = num[2];
  
  // Calculate gcd of mid and num[i]
  for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    mid = gcd(mid, num[i]);
  }
  
  int flag = 0;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    if (mid % p[i] == 0) {
      printf("YES\n");
      printf("%d %d\n", x[1], i);
      flag = 1;
      break;
    }
  }
  
  if (flag == 0) {
    printf("NO\n");
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
