Step 1: Avoid unnecessary includes
The program includes the `<algorithm>`, `<set>`, `<string>`, and `<vector>` headers, but none of them are used in the code. So we can remove these unnecessary includes to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Optimize the `gcd` function
The `gcd` function is used to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. However, it is implemented using recursive calls, which can be inefficient for large numbers. We can optimize the `gcd` function using the iterative Euclidean algorithm, which is more efficient.

Step 3: Optimize the loop for calculating `mid`
The loop for calculating `mid` can be optimized by starting from `i = 2` instead of `i = 3`. This is because `mid` is initially set to `num[2]`, so there is no need to include `num[1]` in the loop.

Step 4: Use a more optimal data type for `maxn`
The data type `LL` is defined as `long long`, which may be excessive for the size of `maxn`. Since `maxn` is used as the size of arrays, we can use `int` instead of `LL` to save memory.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int gcd(int x, int y) {
  while (y != 0) {
    int temp = y;
    y = x % y;
    x = temp;
  }
  return x;
}

const int maxn = 300010;
int x[maxn], p[maxn], num[maxn];

int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &x[i]);
    num[i] = x[i] - x[i - 1];
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &p[i]);
  }
  int mid = num[2];
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    mid = gcd(mid, num[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    if (mid % p[i] == 0) {
      printf("YES\n");
      printf("%d %d\n", x[1], i);
      return 0;
    }
  }
  printf("NO\n");
  return 0;
}
```
