To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<algorithm>`, `<iostream>`, `<set>`, and `<string>` header files, which are not required for the given code. We can remove these header files to reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove unused variables: The variable `flag` is declared but never used in the code. We can remove this variable to improve the readability of the code.

3. Use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The program currently uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output. However, using `cin` and `cout` from the `<iostream>` header is generally faster and more convenient. We can replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` respectively.

4. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: The program uses `push_back` to add elements to the `p` vector. However, using `emplace_back` is more efficient as it avoids unnecessary copying or moving of elements.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long LL;
const int maxn = 3 * 1e5 + 10;
LL x[maxn], p[maxn], num[maxn];

LL gcd(LL x, LL y) {
    return y == 0 ? x : gcd(y, x % y);
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cin >> x[i];
        num[i] = x[i] - x[i - 1];
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        cin >> p[i];
    }

    LL mid = num[2];
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        mid = gcd(mid, num[i]);
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        if (mid % p[i] == 0) {
            cout << "YES" << endl;
            cout << x[1] << " " << i << endl;
            return 0;
        }
    }

    cout << "NO" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

These modifications should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
