To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<algorithm>`, `<iostream>`, `<set>`, and `<string>` header files, but none of them are actually used in the program. We can remove them to reduce unnecessary overhead.

2. Remove unnecessary typedef: The program defines `LL` as a typedef for `long long`, but it is not used anywhere in the program. We can remove this typedef to simplify the code.

3. Use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The program currently uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations. However, `cin` and `cout` are generally faster and more convenient to use in C++. We can modify the program to use `cin` and `cout` instead.

4. Optimize the gcd calculation: The program calculates the gcd of `mid` and `num[i]` for each `i` from 3 to `n`. We can optimize this calculation by using the gcd property that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b). By calculating the gcd iteratively, we can reduce the number of gcd calculations and improve the efficiency of the program.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int maxn = 3 * 1e5 + 10;
long long x[maxn], p[maxn], num[maxn];

long long gcd(long long x, long long y) {
  return y == 0 ? x : gcd(y, x % y);
}

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    cin >> x[i];
    num[i] = x[i] - x[i - 1];
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
    cin >> p[i];
  }

  long long mid = num[2];
  for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i) {
    mid = gcd(mid, num[i]);
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
    if (mid % p[i] == 0) {
      cout << "YES" << endl;
      cout << x[1] << " " << i << endl;
      return 0;
    }
  }

  cout << "NO" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
