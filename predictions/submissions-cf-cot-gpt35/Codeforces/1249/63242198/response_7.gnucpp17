Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header file: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not a standard C/C++ header file and is generally not recommended. It is better to include only the required header files for the program.

2. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(NULL)`: By default, C++ synchronizes the C++ standard streams with the standard C streams, which can cause a performance overhead. By disabling this synchronization, we can improve the input/output performance.

3. Replace `short` with `int` for loop variables: Using `int` for loop variables instead of `short` can improve performance, as `int` is generally more efficient to work with.

4. Avoid creating a dynamic array `int v[n]`: Instead of using a dynamic array, we can use a `std::vector<int>` to store the input values. This will allow us to avoid manual memory management and simplify the code.

5. Use `std::vector` instead of C-style array for `v`: Using `std::vector` instead of a C-style array can provide better memory management and improve performance.

6. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(NULL)`: By disabling the synchronization of C++ standard streams with the standard C streams, we can further improve the input/output performance.

7. Avoid unnecessary `std::endl`: Using `std::endl` flushes the output buffer, which can be an expensive operation. Instead, we can use `'\n'` to print a newline character.
