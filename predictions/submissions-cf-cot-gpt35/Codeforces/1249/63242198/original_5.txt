The given program reads an integer q, followed by q sets of integers. For each set, it checks if there are any adjacent numbers that differ by exactly 1. If such adjacent numbers exist, it sets f to 2; otherwise, it remains 1. Finally, it prints the value of f for each set.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes unnecessary libraries. Instead, include only the necessary headers.

2. Use `std::vector` instead of an array to store the numbers. This will allow us to dynamically allocate memory and avoid stack overflow issues.

3. Avoid sorting the numbers. Since we only need to check if there are adjacent numbers that differ by exactly 1, we can iterate through the vector and check adjacent elements without sorting.

4. Use `bool` data type for f instead of `int` since it only needs to store two values.

5. Minimize the number of calls to `std::endl` by using `'\n'` instead.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);

  short q;
  std::cin >> q;
  
  while (q--) {
    short n;
    std::cin >> n;
    
    std::vector<int> v(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      std::cin >> v[i];
    
    bool f = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      if (std::abs(v[i + 1] - v[i]) == 1) {
        f = true;
        break;
      }
    }
    
    std::cout << (f ? 2 : 1) << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
