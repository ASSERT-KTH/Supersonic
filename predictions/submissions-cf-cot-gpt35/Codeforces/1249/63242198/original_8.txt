The given program can be optimized in several ways:

1. Remove unnecessary header file: The program includes the header file `bits/stdc++.h`, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can increase the compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. We can remove this line and only include the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std`: This statement brings all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can cause naming conflicts and make the code harder to understand. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for the standard library functions and types.

3. Avoid dynamic memory allocation: The program uses dynamic memory allocation for the array `v`. This can be avoided by using a fixed-size array or a container with automatic memory management.

4. Optimize the loop for checking consecutive elements: The loop checks if any two consecutive elements in the sorted array have a difference of 1. Instead of using the `abs` function, we can directly compare the difference with 1 and break the loop early if such a pair is found.

5. Optimize the loop for sorting the array: Instead of sorting the entire array, we can use a partial sorting algorithm to find the minimum and maximum elements. This can reduce the time complexity of the sorting step.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  short q;
  std::cin >> q;
  for (short i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    short n, f = 1;
    std::cin >> n;
    int v[n];
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
      std::cin >> v[j];
    
    // Find the minimum and maximum elements
    int min_element = *std::min_element(v, v + n);
    int max_element = *std::max_element(v, v + n);

    // Check if there is a pair with a difference of 1
    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
      if (v[j + 1] - v[j] == 1) {
        f = 2;
        break;
      }
    }
    std::cout << f << std::endl;
  }
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. The unnecessary header `bits/stdc++.h` is removed.
2. The `using namespace std` statement is removed.
3. The dynamic memory allocation for the array `v` is replaced with a fixed-size array.
4. The loop for checking consecutive elements is optimized to directly compare the difference with 1.
5. The loop for sorting the array is replaced with `std::min_element` and `std::max_element` functions to find the minimum and maximum elements.
