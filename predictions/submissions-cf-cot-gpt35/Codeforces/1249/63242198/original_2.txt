The given program reads an integer `q` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers into an array `v`. It then sorts the array `v`, and checks if there are any adjacent elements with an absolute difference of 1. If such elements exist, it sets `f` to 2; otherwise, it remains 1. Finally, it prints the value of `f` for each test case.

To optimize this program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Replace the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with specific header files that are needed for this program. This will reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

2. Use a more efficient data type for the array `v`. Since the array elements are integers, we can use `int` instead of `short` for `n` and `j`, and `int` instead of `short` for the array `v`.

3. Instead of sorting the entire array `v`, we can modify the loop to check if adjacent elements have an absolute difference of 1 while reading the input. If such elements are found, we can break the loop and set `f` to 2 immediately. This will avoid unnecessary sorting and improve the running time.

4. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation by declaring the array `v` outside the loop. Since the maximum size of `v` is not known in advance, we can use dynamic memory allocation (`new` and `delete`) to allocate memory for `v`.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    int n, f = 1;
    cin >> n;
    int* v = new int[n];
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      cin >> v[j];
      if (j > 0 && abs(v[j] - v[j - 1]) == 1) {
        f = 2;
        break;
      }
    }
    cout << f << endl;
    delete[] v;
  }
}
```

This optimized program reduces memory usage by using dynamic memory allocation and improves running time by avoiding unnecessary sorting.
