Step 1: Avoid using "bits/stdc++.h" header
The first optimization we can make is to avoid using the "bits/stdc++.h" header. This header includes all the standard library headers, which can increase the compilation time and memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Avoid using dynamic array
The program currently uses a dynamic array "v" to store the input values. Dynamic arrays can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and can lead to potential memory leaks. Instead of using a dynamic array, we can use a vector, which is a dynamic array in the C++ standard library and provides better memory management.

Step 3: Use a more efficient sorting algorithm
The program currently uses the "sort" function to sort the input values. The "sort" function in the C++ standard library uses the quicksort algorithm, which has an average time complexity of O(n log n). However, since we only need to check if there are adjacent elements with a difference of 1, we can use a different sorting algorithm with a better worst-case time complexity, such as counting sort or radix sort.

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary calculations
The program currently uses the "abs" function to calculate the absolute difference between adjacent elements. However, since we only need to check if the difference is equal to 1, we can avoid using the "abs" function and directly compare the elements.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  short q;
  std::cin >> q;
  
  for (short i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    short n, f = 1;
    std::cin >> n;
    
    std::vector<int> v(n);
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
      std::cin >> v[j];
    
    std::sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    
    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
      if (v[j + 1] - v[j] == 1) {
        f = 2;
        break;
      }
    }
    
    std::cout << f << std::endl;
  }
}
```
