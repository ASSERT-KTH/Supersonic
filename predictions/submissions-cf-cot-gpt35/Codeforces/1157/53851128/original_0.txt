Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
- The program includes several unnecessary header files such as `<algorithm>`, `<deque>`, `<iostream>`, `<list>`, `<map>`, `<queue>`, and `<set>`.
- These header files are not used in the program and can be removed to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
- The program defines several unnecessary macros such as `pb`, `eb`, `ins`, `es`, `fi`, `se`, `bg`, `ed`, `ep`, `vl`, `sl`, `pll`, `msl`, `mpll`, `smx`, `smn`, `rep`, `repn`, `lgi`, `sgi`, `lb`, `ub`, `mod`, `in`.
- These macros are not used in the program and can be removed to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary typedef
- The program typedefs `ll` as `long long int`, but `ll` is not used in the program.
- This typedef can be removed to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Optimize input and output functions
- The program uses a generic input function `gi` and a generic output function `_po` to handle input and output.
- These functions can be replaced with standard C++ input and output operations (`cin` and `cout`) to improve runtime and reduce memory usage.

Step 5: Optimize the main logic
- The main logic of the program can be optimized by removing unnecessary operations and using more efficient data structures and algorithms.
- Instead of using a `multiset` to store the remainders of `vb` elements modulo `n`, we can use a `vector` to store the counts of each remainder.
- We can then iterate over `va` and for each element `i`, find the minimum remainder in `vb` that gives the smallest sum with `i` modulo `n`.
- This can be done by iterating over the possible remainders in ascending order and selecting the first non-zero remainder as the optimal choice.
- After selecting the optimal remainder, we subtract its count by 1 and add `i` modulo `n` to the result vector `vc`.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  vector<int> va(n), vb(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> va[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> vb[i];
  }
  
  vector<int> remainder_counts(n, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    remainder_counts[vb[i] % n]++;
  }
  
  vector<int> vc;
  for (int i : va) {
    int min_remainder = -1;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
      if (remainder_counts[j] > 0) {
        min_remainder = j;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (min_remainder != -1) {
      vc.push_back((min_remainder + i) % n);
      remainder_counts[min_remainder]--;
    }
    else {
      vc.push_back((vb[0] + i) % n);
      remainder_counts[0]--;
    }
  }
  
  for (int i : vc) {
    cout << i << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```
