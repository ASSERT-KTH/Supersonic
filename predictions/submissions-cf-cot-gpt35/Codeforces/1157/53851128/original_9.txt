Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: There are several header files included in the program that are not used. We can remove them to reduce the compile time and memory usage.

2. Remove unused macros: There are several macros defined in the program that are not used. We can remove them to reduce the memory usage.

3. Replace unnecessary containers: The program uses a `deque`, `list`, and `multiset`. However, these containers are not necessary for the given task. We can replace them with more efficient containers like `vector` and `set` to improve the performance.

4. Use range-based for loop: The program uses a traditional for loop to iterate over the elements of the container. We can replace it with a range-based for loop to simplify the code and improve readability.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program performs unnecessary calculations in the loop. We can optimize it by avoiding unnecessary calculations and using precomputed values.

6. Simplify code: The program contains complex code that can be simplified to improve readability and maintainability.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

typedef long long int ll;

int main() {
    ll n;
    std::cin >> n;

    std::vector<ll> va(n), vb(n);
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cin >> va[i];
    }

    for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cin >> vb[i];
    }

    std::set<ll> stb;
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        stb.insert(vb[i] % n);
    }

    std::vector<ll> vc;
    for (auto i : va) {
        auto it = stb.lower_bound((n - i) % n);
        if (it != stb.end() && (*it + i) % n < (*stb.begin() + i) % n) {
            vc.push_back((*it + i) % n);
            stb.erase(it);
        } else {
            vc.push_back((*stb.begin() + i) % n);
            stb.erase(stb.begin());
        }
    }

    for (auto i : vc) {
        std::cout << i << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. Removed unnecessary header files: Removed the unnecessary header files included in the program.

2. Removed unused macros: Removed the unused macros to reduce the memory usage.

3. Replaced unnecessary containers: Replaced `deque`, `list`, and `multiset` with `vector` and `set` since they are more efficient for the given task.

4. Used range-based for loop: Replaced the traditional for loop with a range-based for loop to simplify the code and improve readability.

5. Avoided unnecessary calculations: Optimized the code inside the loop by avoiding unnecessary calculations and using precomputed values.

6. Simplified code: Simplified the code to improve readability and maintainability.
