The given program is written in C++ and includes a lot of unnecessary macros and headers. These macros and headers can be removed to simplify the code and improve its readability. 

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the unnecessary macros and headers. These include all the macros starting with "__" and the headers that are not used in the code.

2. Replace the unnecessary macros with their actual values in the code. For example, replace `pb` with `push_back` and `ed` with `end()`.

3. Replace the unnecessary typedef `typedef long long int ll` with `using ll = long long int`.

4. Remove the unnecessary template function `in` as it is not being used in the code.

5. Replace the unnecessary template function `fs` with `sort` function.

6. Remove the unnecessary template function `mod` as it is not being used in the code.

7. Remove the unnecessary template function `_po` as it is not being used in the code.

8. Remove the unnecessary template function `po` as it is not being used in the code.

9. Remove the unnecessary template function `gi` as it is not being used in the code.

10. Remove the unnecessary template function `gi` with multiple arguments as it is not being used in the code.

11. Replace the unnecessary template function `lgi` with `cin` for reading input.

12. Replace the unnecessary template function `sgi` with `cin` for reading input.

13. Replace the unnecessary template function `fs` with `sort` function.

14. Remove the unnecessary template function `gcd` as it is not being used in the code.

15. Replace the unnecessary template function `in` with `find` function.

16. Replace the unnecessary template function `in` with `find` function.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  vector<long long int> va, vb;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    long long int t;
    cin >> t;
    va.push_back(t);
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    long long int t;
    cin >> t;
    vb.push_back(t);
  }
  
  multiset<long long int> stb;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    stb.insert(vb[i] % n);
  }
  
  vector<long long int> vc;
  for (auto i : va) {
    auto it = stb.lower_bound((n - i) % n);
    if (it != stb.end() && (*it + i) % n < (*stb.begin() + i) % n) {
      vc.push_back((*it + i) % n);
      stb.erase(it);
    } else {
      vc.push_back((*stb.begin() + i) % n);
      stb.erase(stb.begin());
    }
  }
  
  for (auto i : vc) {
    cout << i << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
