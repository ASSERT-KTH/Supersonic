The given program calculates the length of the longest subarray in an array such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the subarray is equal to the GCD of the entire array.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard header and includes a large number of other headers. We can remove this include and only include the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros, such as `pb`, `ppb`, `rep`, `repr`, `yes`, `no`, and `dbg`, which are not used in the code. We can remove these macros as they are not needed.

3. Optimize the `build_tree` function: The `build_tree` function builds a segment tree to store the GCD of subarrays. Currently, it builds the segment tree recursively using a divide and conquer approach. However, we can optimize it by using an iterative approach to build the segment tree bottom-up. This will reduce the function call overhead and improve the performance.

4. Optimize the `query` function: The `query` function calculates the GCD of a given range in the segment tree. Currently, it uses recursion to traverse the segment tree. We can optimize it by using an iterative approach to traverse the segment tree. This will reduce the function call overhead and improve the performance.

5. Remove unnecessary variables and calculations: The program uses several variables and calculations that are not necessary. For example, the `g` variable is used to store the GCD of the entire array, but it is only used once in the loop. We can calculate the GCD directly inside the loop without using the `g` variable. Similarly, the `temp` variable is used to store the length of the current subarray, but it can be calculated directly inside the loop without using the `temp` variable.

6. Use `const` qualifier for read-only variables: The program uses several variables that are read-only and should not be modified. We can add the `const` qualifier to these variables to improve code clarity and potentially allow the compiler to perform additional optimizations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int N = 4e5 + 5;

std::vector<int> seg_tree(4 * N + 5, 0);
int a[N];

void build_tree(int n) {
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    seg_tree[n + i] = a[i];
  }
  for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    seg_tree[i] = std::__gcd(seg_tree[i * 2], seg_tree[i * 2 + 1]);
  }
}

int query(int l, int r, int n) {
  int res = 0;
  for (l += n, r += n; l <= r; l /= 2, r /= 2) {
    if (l % 2 == 1) {
      res = std::__gcd(res, seg_tree[l++]);
    }
    if (r % 2 == 0) {
      res = std::__gcd(res, seg_tree[r--]);
    }
  }
  return res;
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
    a[i + n] = a[i];
  }
  build_tree(2 * n);
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int l = i + 1, r = 2 * n, cnt = 0;
    if (a[i] == query(i + 1, i + 1, 2 * n)) {
      continue;
    }
    while (l <= r) {
      int mid = (l + r) / 2;
      int x = query(i + 1, mid, 2 * n);
      int y = std::__gcd(x, a[i]);
      if (y == query(i + 1, mid, 2 * n)) {
        ans = std::max(ans, mid - l + 1 + cnt);
        r = mid - 1;
      } else {
        a[i] = std::__gcd(a[i], x);
        cnt += mid - l + 1;
        l = mid + 1;
      }
    }
  }
  std::cout << ans << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces unnecessary function call overhead, eliminates unused code, and simplifies variable usage. It should have better performance in terms of running time and memory usage compared to the original program.
