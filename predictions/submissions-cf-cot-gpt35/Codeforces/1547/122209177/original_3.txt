The given program is a C++ program that calculates the length of the longest subarray with a gcd equal to the gcd of the entire array.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not necessary and can be replaced with specific include statements for the required libraries.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for common operations like `pb`, `ppb`, `yes`, `no`, `dbg`, which are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary variable initialization: The program initializes the `seg_tree` vector with a size of `4 * N + 5` and initializes each element to 0. However, this initialization is not necessary as the vector will be populated during the `build_tree` function.

4. Remove unnecessary recursion in `build_tree` function: The `build_tree` function uses recursion to build the segment tree. We can optimize this by using an iterative approach instead of recursion. This will reduce the function call overhead and improve the performance.

5. Remove unnecessary variable assignment in `solve` function: The `solve` function initializes `ans` and `g` variables with 0. However, these variables are immediately overwritten in the subsequent code. We can remove these initializations to simplify the code.

6. Replace division with bitshift: The code uses division by 2 to calculate the mid index in some places. We can replace this division with a right shift operation (`>> 1`) to improve performance.

7. Use prefix increment instead of postfix increment: The code uses postfix increment (`i++`) in the `rep` macro. We can replace it with prefix increment (`++i`) to avoid the overhead of creating a temporary copy of the variable.

8. Use a more efficient algorithm for binary search: The code uses a binary search algorithm to find the right index in the `query` function. However, this algorithm can be optimized further by using a more efficient approach like the two-pointer technique.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized code is as follows:
