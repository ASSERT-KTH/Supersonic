The given program calculates the maximum length of a subarray such that the GCD of all its elements is equal to the GCD of the entire array.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes all the standard library headers. This can slow down the compilation process. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for commonly used operations such as pushing back elements to a vector, popping back elements from a vector, and printing "YES" and "NO". These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Use `int` instead of `long long int` for array indices: The program uses `long long int` for array indices, which is unnecessary. We can use `int` instead to save memory.

4. Remove unnecessary global variables: The program declares a global vector `seg_tree` and array `a` with a fixed size. These variables are only used in the `build_tree` function and can be declared as local variables inside the `build_tree` function.

5. Optimize the `build_tree` function: The `build_tree` function is used to build a segment tree for the array `a`. Currently, it uses recursion to build the tree. We can optimize this function by using an iterative approach instead of recursion.

6. Optimize the `query` function: The `query` function is used to find the GCD of a subarray in the segment tree. Currently, it uses recursion to traverse the tree. We can optimize this function by using an iterative approach instead of recursion.

7. Remove unnecessary variable initialization: The variable `ans` is initialized with 0 at the beginning of the `solve` function, but it is immediately updated inside the loop. We can remove the initialization statement.

8. Use prefix sum technique to calculate GCDs: The program uses the `__gcd` function to calculate the GCD of each subarray. Instead, we can use the prefix sum technique to pre-calculate the GCDs of all prefixes of the array `a`. This will eliminate the need to make repeated calls to the `query` function.

9. Optimize the loop to find the maximum length: The loop that finds the maximum length of the subarray can be optimized by using a binary search instead of iterating over all possible subarrays. This will reduce the time complexity of the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int N = 4e5 + 5;

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b) {
        a %= b;
        swap(a, b);
    }
    return a;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);

    int t;
    cin >> t;

    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;

        vector<int> a(2 * n + 1);
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
            a[i + n] = a[i];
        }

        vector<int> prefix_gcd(2 * n + 1);
        prefix_gcd[1] = a[1];
        for (int i = 2; i <= 2 * n; i++) {
            prefix_gcd[i] = gcd(prefix_gcd[i - 1], a[i]);
        }

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int g = prefix_gcd[i + n] / a[i];
            int l = i + 1, r = 2 * n, temp = 1, cnt = 0;
            while (l <= r) {
                int mid = (l + r) / 2;
                int x = prefix_gcd[mid];
                int y = gcd(x, a[i]);
                if (y == g) {
                    temp = mid - i + 1 + cnt;
                    r = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    a[i] = gcd(a[i], x);
                    cnt += mid - i + 1;
                    l = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            ans = max(ans, temp);
        }

        cout << ans << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
