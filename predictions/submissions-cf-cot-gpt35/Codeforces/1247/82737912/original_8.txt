The given program is a C++ program that solves a dynamic programming problem. It calculates the number of paths from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell of a grid, with some restrictions on movements.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not necessary. We can remove it.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program has several macros defined, but they are not used. We can remove them.

3. Remove unnecessary `freopen` statements: The program includes the `__` macro that redirects the standard input and output streams to files. We can remove it.

4. Optimize the nested loops: The program uses nested loops to iterate over the grid cells. However, the loops are not optimized. We can optimize them by changing the loop conditions and loop increments.

5. Optimize the calculations: The program uses some complex calculations to update the dynamic programming table. We can simplify the calculations by using intermediate variables and reducing the number of operations.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int mod = 1000000007;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;

  vector<string> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }

  vector<vector<vector<long long>>> dp(n + 1,
                                       vector<vector<long long>>(m + 1,
                                                                 vector<long long>(2, 0)));

  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    for (int j = m - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
      if (i == n - 1 || j == m - 1) {
        if (i == n - 1 && j == m - 1) {
          dp[i][j][0] = dp[i][j][1] = (arr[i][j] == 'R' ? 0 : 1);
        } else if (arr[i][j] != 'R') {
          dp[i][j][0] = dp[i + 1][j][0] + dp[i][j + 1][1];
          dp[i][j][0] %= mod;
          dp[i][j][1] = dp[i][j][0];
        }
      } else {
        long long val1 = dp[i + 1][j + 1][1][0] - dp[n - (i + 1)][j + 1][1][0] +
                         dp[i + 1][j + 1][1][1] - dp[i + 1][m - (j + 1)][1][1];
        long long val2 = dp[i + 1][j + 1][1][0] - dp[n - (i + 1)][j + 1][1][0] +
                         dp[i + 1][j + 1][1][1] - dp[i + 1][m - (j + 1) + 1][1][1];

        dp[i][j][0] = (val1 + 2 * mod) % mod;
        dp[i][j][1] = (val2 + 2 * mod) % mod;
      }

      dp[i][j][0] = (dp[i][j][0] + dp[i + 1][j][1][0]) % mod;
      dp[i][j][1] = (dp[i][j][1] + dp[i][j + 1][1][1]) % mod;
    }
  }

  cout << dp[0][0][0][1] << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary header files: The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file is not necessary and has been removed.

2. Removed unnecessary macros: The macros defined in the original program are not used and have been removed.

3. Removed unnecessary `freopen` statements: The `__` macro that redirects the standard input and output streams to files has been removed.

4. Optimized the nested loops: The nested loops have been optimized by changing the loop conditions and loop increments. The loops now iterate in reverse order, starting from the bottom-right cell and moving towards the top-left cell.

5. Optimized the calculations: The calculations to update the dynamic programming table have been simplified by using intermediate variables. The calculations now use the intermediate variables `val1` and `val2` to reduce the number of operations.

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
