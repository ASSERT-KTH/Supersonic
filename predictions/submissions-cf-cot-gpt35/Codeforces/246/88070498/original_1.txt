Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers that are being used.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
The program defines several macros that are not being used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

Step 3: Optimize the unordered_map usage
The program uses an unordered_map to store the colors and their corresponding members. However, during the iteration, it uses the size of the map to compare with the current maximum size. Instead of using an unordered_map, we can use a vector of pairs to store the colors and their corresponding members. This will eliminate the need for the inner loop and improve the overall performance.

Step 4: Optimize the mp map usage
Inside the outer loop, the program creates a new unordered_map `mp` for each color. Instead of creating a new map for each color, we can reuse the same map and clear it at the beginning of each iteration. This will save memory allocation and deallocation time.

Step 5: Optimize the calculation of mxColor
The program calculates the `mxColor` by comparing the size of `mp` with `mx` and the current `color.first` with `mxColor`. Instead of comparing the sizes and colors separately, we can calculate the `mxColor` directly based on the size of `mp` and only update it if the size is greater than `mx`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  vector<int> a(n + 1);
  vector<vector<int>> vk(n + 1);
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    vk[a[i]].push_back(i);
  }
  
  vector<vector<int>> ad(n + 1);
  
  while (m--) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    ad[u].push_back(v);
    ad[v].push_back(u);
  }
  
  int mx = 0, mxColor = INT_MAX;
  
  unordered_map<int, bool> mp;
  
  for (auto color : vk) {
    mp.clear();
    
    for (auto member : color.second) {
      for (auto &neighbour : ad[member]) {
        if (a[neighbour] != a[member])
          mp[a[neighbour]] = true;
      }
    }
    
    if (mp.size() > mx) {
      mx = mp.size();
      mxColor = color.first;
    }
  }
  
  cout << mxColor;
  
  return 0;
}
```
