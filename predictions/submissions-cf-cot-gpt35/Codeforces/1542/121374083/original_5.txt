The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a large number of headers. This can increase the compilation time and may not be necessary for this program. We can remove this header and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused typedefs: The program defines `ull` and `ll` typedefs, but they are not used anywhere in the program. We can remove these typedefs to improve readability.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines many macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

4. Optimize the loop: The program uses a while loop to check if a certain condition is satisfied. However, the loop can be optimized by using a for loop and calculating the maximum power of `a` that is less than or equal to `n`. This can reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time.

5. Simplify the if-else conditions: The if-else conditions in the `solve` function can be simplified to make the code more readable.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized program would look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void solve() {
    long long n, a, b;
    std::cin >> n >> a >> b;

    if ((n % b == 1 || n % b == a || b == 1) || (a == 1 && n % b == 1)) {
        std::cout << "YES\n";
    } else {
        long long temp = 1;
        bool flag = false;

        for (long long i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            if (temp == n || (n - temp) % b == 0) {
                flag = true;
                break;
            }

            if (temp > n / a) {
                break;
            }

            temp *= a;
        }

        if (flag) {
            std::cout << "YES\n";
        } else {
            std::cout << "NO\n";
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int t;
    std::cin >> t;

    for (int tc = 1; tc <= t; tc++) {
        solve();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary headers, typedefs, and macros, simplifies the conditions, and optimizes the loop to improve the running time and memory usage.
