The given program seems to be solving a problem using a brute force approach. It checks various conditions and performs multiple calculations to determine whether a certain condition is met or not.

To optimize the program, we can simplify the logic and reduce the number of calculations. Here are the steps for optimization:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can increase the compilation time. Instead, include only the required headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program includes several macros that are not used. Remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program includes typedefs for `ull` and `ll` types, but they are not used. Remove them to simplify the code.

4. Remove unnecessary vector and iterator functions: The program includes macros for vector and iterator functions, but they are not used. Remove them to simplify the code.

5. Simplify the logic inside the `solve()` function: The logic inside the `solve()` function can be simplified by reducing the number of conditions and calculations. We can modify the logic as follows:

   a. If `a` is equal to 1, check if `n % b` is equal to 1. If true, output "YES", otherwise output "NO".

   b. If `b` is equal to 1, output "YES".

   c. Otherwise, calculate `temp` as `a` raised to the power of `k`, where `k` is the maximum power such that `temp <= n`. If `n - temp` is divisible by `b`, output "YES", otherwise output "NO".

6. Remove unnecessary loop and flag variable: Instead of using a loop to calculate `temp`, we can calculate it directly using the `pow()` function from the `<cmath>` header. This eliminates the need for the `temp` variable and the loop. We can also remove the `flag` variable as it is not needed anymore.

7. Remove unnecessary input of the number of test cases: The program takes input for the number of test cases, but it is always set to 1. Remove this input to simplify the code.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

void solve() {
  long long n, a, b;
  std::cin >> n >> a >> b;

  if (a == 1) {
    if (n % b == 1) {
      std::cout << "YES\n";
    } else {
      std::cout << "NO\n";
    }
  } else if (b == 1 || n % b == 1 || n % b == a) {
    std::cout << "YES\n";
  } else {
    long long temp = std::pow(a, std::log(n) / std::log(a));
    if ((n - temp) % b == 0) {
      std::cout << "YES\n";
    } else {
      std::cout << "NO\n";
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

By simplifying the logic and removing unnecessary calculations, we have optimized the program for running time and memory usage.
