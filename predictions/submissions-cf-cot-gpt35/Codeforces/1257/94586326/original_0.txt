Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary. We can remove this header.

Step 2: Remove unused macros

The program defines some macros `endl`, `rep`, `all`, `F`, `S`, `debug1`, `debug2`, and `debug3`. However, these macros are not used in the program. We can remove these macros.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary variable declarations

The program declares a `val` variable inside the loop, but it is not used anywhere. We can remove this variable declaration.

Step 4: Optimize the loop

The program uses a nested loop to calculate the minimum result. However, we can optimize this loop by calculating the minimum result inside the first loop itself. This way, we don't need to store all the values in a vector and iterate over them again.

Step 5: Optimize the map

The program uses a map to store the values and their positions. However, we can optimize this by using an unordered_map instead of a map. This will reduce the time complexity of accessing elements from O(log n) to O(1).

Step 6: Optimize the output

The program uses `endl` to flush the output after every line. However, `endl` is slower than `"\n"` as it flushes the output buffer. We can replace `endl` with `"\n"` to improve the performance.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

typedef long long int ll;

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  unordered_map<ll, ll> m;
  ll minres = LLONG_MAX;
  
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ll val;
    cin >> val;
    if (m.count(val) > 0) {
      ll prevIndex = m[val];
      if (i - prevIndex > 0) {
        minres = min(minres, i - prevIndex + 1);
      }
    }
    m[val] = i;
  }
  
  if (minres == LLONG_MAX) {
    cout << -1 << "\n";
  } else {
    cout << minres << "\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
