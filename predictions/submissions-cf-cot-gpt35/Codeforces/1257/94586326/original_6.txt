Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and using statements.
- The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this and include only the necessary headers.
- The program uses `using namespace std` which is considered bad practice. We should remove this and use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary typedefs and macros.
- The program typedefs `long long int` as `ll`, but it is not used anywhere. We can remove this typedef.
- The program defines macros for `endl`, `rep`, `all`, `F`, `S`, and `debug` which are not used. We can remove these macros.

Step 3: Optimize the loop in the `solve` function.
- Currently, the program uses a nested loop to iterate over the elements of the map. This nested loop has a time complexity of O(n^2). We can optimize this by using iterators to iterate over the map and vector elements. This will reduce the time complexity to O(n).
- Instead of using the `auto` keyword to iterate over the map, we can use `const auto&` to avoid unnecessary copying of the map elements.

Step 4: Optimize the search for minimum result.
- Currently, the program initializes `minres` with `LLONG_MAX` and checks if it is still `LLONG_MAX` at the end to determine if there is no solution. We can optimize this by initializing `minres` with `n+1` instead, which is guaranteed to be greater than any valid result. This way, we can remove the check for `LLONG_MAX` at the end.

Step 5: Optimize input/output operations.
- Currently, the program uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations, which are slower than other methods such as `scanf` and `printf`. We can optimize this by using `scanf` and `printf` instead.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <vector>

void solve() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  std::map<int, std::vector<int>> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int val;
    scanf("%d", &val);
    m[val].push_back(i + 1);
  }
  int minres = n + 1;
  for (const auto& x : m) {
    const std::vector<int>& v = x.second;
    if (v.size() > 1) {
      for (size_t i = 1; i < v.size(); i++) {
        if ((v[i] - v[i - 1]) > 0) {
          minres = std::min(minres, v[i] - v[i - 1] + 1);
        }
      }
    }
  }
  if (minres == n + 1) {
    printf("-1\n");
  } else {
    printf("%d\n", minres);
  }
}

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
