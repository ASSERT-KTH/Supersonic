Step 1: Removing unnecessary includes and macros.

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and can slow down the compilation process. It is better to include only the necessary standard headers. Similarly, the macros `all(x)`, `ll`, `pii`, `piii`, `sz(x)`, `f`, `s`, `m_p`, and `pw(x)` are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 2: Removing unnecessary variables.

The variables `M` and `toy` are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 3: Simplifying the loop condition in the `precalc()` function.

The loop condition `i < N` in the `precalc()` function can be simplified to `i * i < N` to reduce the number of iterations.

Step 4: Optimizing the prime factorization loop.

Instead of iterating through all numbers from `2 * i` to `N` in steps of `i`, we can iterate through all numbers from `i * i` to `N` in steps of `i`. This optimization reduces the number of iterations and improves the performance of the program.

Step 5: Using a more efficient data structure for `is` array.

The `is` array is used to mark whether a number is prime or not. Instead of using a boolean array, we can use a bitset to reduce memory usage.

Step 6: Removing redundant checks in the main loop.

The main loop in the `main()` function checks if `val[i] != 1` before incrementing `cnt[i]`. Since `val[i]` is always equal to 1 at this point, the check is redundant and can be removed.

Step 7: Using `scanf` and `printf` for input/output.

Using `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations can be slower than using `scanf` and `printf`. We can replace `cin` with `scanf` and `cout` with `printf` in the `main()` function.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

const int N = 5e6 + 2;
int val[N];
bitset<N> is;
int cnt[N];
long long pref[N];

const long long to = sqrt(N) + 1;

void precalc() {
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    val[i] = i;
  }
  for (int i = 2; i * i < N; i++) {
    if (is[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i * i; j < N; j += i) {
      is[j] = 1;
      while (val[j] % i == 0) {
        val[j] /= i;
        cnt[j]++;
      }
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cnt[i] += (val[i] != 1);
  }
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    pref[i] = pref[i - 1] + cnt[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  precalc();
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
    printf("%lld\n", pref[a] - pref[b]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces the memory usage by using a bitset for the `is` array and improves the running time by optimizing the prime factorization loop. It also uses `scanf` and `printf` for input/output operations, which can be faster than using `cin` and `cout`.
