Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can bloat the compiled code and slow down the compilation process. Since the program does not actually use all of the included headers, we can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

The program uses several macros for convenience, but they are not necessary and can be replaced with their actual code. This will slightly reduce the overhead of macro expansion.

Step 3: Replace `int` with `bool` for `is` array

The `is` array is used to mark whether a number is prime or not. Instead of using `int`, we can use `bool` which will reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Replace `int` with `char` for `val` array

The `val` array is used to store the factorization of numbers. Since the maximum value of `val` is `N`, we can use `char` instead of `int` to reduce memory usage.

Step 5: Remove unused variables

The variables `pii`, `piii`, and `M` are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 6: Replace `cout` with `printf` in the main loop

Using `cout` for printing can be slower than `printf`. Since the program only needs to print integers, we can replace `cout << pref[a] - pref[b] << '\n'` with `printf("%lld\n", pref[a] - pref[b])`.

Step 7: Optimize the prime factorization loop

The current prime factorization loop iterates from 2 to `to` and then checks whether each number is prime. We can optimize this loop by using a sieve-like approach. Instead of checking whether each number is prime, we can directly calculate the prime factorization of each number.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>

const int N = 5e6 + 2;
const int to = sqrt(N) + 1;

std::vector<char> val(N);
std::vector<int> cnt(N);
std::vector<long long> pref(N);

void precalc() {
  for (int i = 2; i < to; i++) {
    if (val[i] != 0)
      continue;
    for (int j = i; j < N; j += i) {
      val[j]++;
      cnt[j]++;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (val[i] == 0) {
      val[i] = 1;
      cnt[i]++;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    pref[i] = pref[i - 1] + cnt[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);

  precalc();

  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int a, b;
    std::cin >> a >> b;
    printf("%lld\n", pref[a] - pref[b]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
