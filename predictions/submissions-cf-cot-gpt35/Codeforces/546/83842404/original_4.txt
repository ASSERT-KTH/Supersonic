To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not standard and may include unnecessary dependencies. We can remove this include and only include the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Optimize the prime number calculation: The program uses the sieve of Eratosthenes to calculate the prime factors of numbers up to `N`. However, it calculates the prime factors for all numbers up to `N`, even though we only need to calculate them for the given range of numbers `a` to `b`. We can modify the prime factor calculation to only calculate the prime factors for the range `a` to `b`.

4. Optimize the prefix sum calculation: The program calculates the prefix sum of the prime factors for all numbers up to `N`. However, we only need to calculate the prefix sum for the given range of numbers `a` to `b`. We can modify the prefix sum calculation to only calculate the prefix sum for the range `a` to `b`.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

const int N = 5e6 + 2;

vector<int> val(N, 0);
vector<bool> is(N, false);
vector<int> cnt(N, 0);
vector<long long> pref(N, 0);

void precalc(int a, int b) {
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        val[i] = i;
    }
  
    int to = sqrt(b) + 1;
    for (int i = 2; i < to; i++) {
        if (is[i]) {
            continue;
        }
        int j = max(i * i, (a / i) * i);
        if (j < a) {
            j += i;
        }
        while (j <= b) {
            if (val[j] % i == 0) {
                val[j] /= i;
                cnt[j]++;
            }
            j += i;
        }
    }
  
    for (int i = a; i <= b; i++) {
        if (val[i] != 1) {
            cnt[i]++;
        }
    }
  
    for (int i = a; i <= b; i++) {
        pref[i] = pref[i - 1] + cnt[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
  
    int t;
    cin >> t;
  
    while (t--) {
        int a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;
      
        precalc(a, b);
      
        cout << pref[b] - pref[a - 1] << '\n';
    }
  
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The program originally included the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not standard and may include unnecessary dependencies. I replaced it with the necessary headers `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<cmath>`.

2. Removed unnecessary macros: The program defined several macros (`all(x)`, `ll`, `pii`, `piii`, `sz(x)`, `f`, `s`, `m_p`, `pw(x)`) that were not used in the code. I removed these macros to simplify the code.

3. Optimized the prime number calculation: The program originally calculated the prime factors for all numbers up to `N`, even though we only needed to calculate them for the given range of numbers `a` to `b`. To optimize this, I modified the prime factor calculation to only calculate the prime factors for the range `a` to `b`. I used the sieve of Eratosthenes to find the prime factors and stored them in the `val` and `cnt` vectors.

4. Optimized the prefix sum calculation: The program originally calculated the prefix sum of the prime factors for all numbers up to `N`, even though we only needed to calculate the prefix sum for the given range of numbers `a` to `b`. To optimize this, I modified the prefix sum calculation to only calculate the prefix sum for the range `a` to `b`. I used the `pref` vector to store the prefix sum.

By making these optimizations, we can improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
