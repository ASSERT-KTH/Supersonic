The given program calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n, multiplies it by d, and then subtracts k from the result. If the result is greater than 0, it prints the result; otherwise, it prints 0.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the unnecessary calculation of the sum of numbers from 1 to n. Instead, we can directly calculate the sum using the formula n*(n+1)/2.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int d = 0;
  std::cin >> d;
  long k = 0;
  std::cin >> k;
  long n = 0;
  std::cin >> n;
  n = (n * (n + 1)) / 2; // Calculate the sum using the formula directly
  n *= d; // Multiply the sum by d
  std::cout << ((n - k) > 0 ? (n - k) : 0); // Print the result directly without using if-else
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

- Removed unnecessary includes: The `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<stdio.h>` headers are not needed and have been removed.
- Replaced `using namespace std;` with `std::` prefix: Using the `std::` prefix instead of `using namespace std;` avoids polluting the global namespace.
- Replaced `cout` and `cin` with `std::cout` and `std::cin` respectively: Using the `std::` prefix makes it clear that these functions are part of the `std` namespace.
- Removed calculation of the sum using a loop: Instead of calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to n using a loop, we can directly calculate it using the formula n*(n+1)/2.
- Removed unnecessary assignment of n to n * d: Instead of assigning n to n * d separately, we can directly multiply n by d.
- Replaced if-else statement with a ternary operator: Instead of using an if-else statement to check if the result is greater than 0 and print the result accordingly, we can use a ternary operator to achieve the same result in a more concise way.
