The given program calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n, multiplies it by d, and then subtracts k from it. If the result is negative, it prints 0, otherwise, it prints the resulting value.

To optimize the program, we can eliminate unnecessary calculations and use a more efficient approach.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int d, k, n;
  std::cin >> d >> k >> n;

  long long sum = 1LL * n * (n + 1) / 2 * d;

  std::cout << std::max(sum - k, 0LL);

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:
1. Removed unnecessary header files: `bits/stdc++.h` and `stdio.h` were not used in the program, so they were removed.
2. Removed unnecessary `using namespace std;`: It is considered a bad practice to use the entire `std` namespace, so it was removed.
3. Removed unnecessary variable initialization: `long k = 0;` and `long n = 0;` were unnecessary as they were immediately overwritten by the input values. So, the initialization was removed.
4. Changed variable types: Since the sum of numbers from 1 to n can be large, we changed the type of `sum` to `long long` to prevent overflow.
5. Combined calculations: Instead of calculating `n * (n + 1) / 2` and then multiplying it by `d`, we combined the calculations into a single expression for better efficiency.
6. Replaced if-else statement with std::max: Instead of using an if-else statement to check if the result is negative, we used `std::max` to get the maximum of the calculated value and 0. This simplifies the code and makes it more readable.
