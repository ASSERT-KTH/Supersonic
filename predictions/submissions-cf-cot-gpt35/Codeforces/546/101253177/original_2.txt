The given program calculates the sum of natural numbers from 1 to n, multiplies it by d, and then subtracts k from the result. If the result is positive, it is printed; otherwise, 0 is printed.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes both `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<stdio.h>`. We only need `<bits/stdc++.h>` for `cin`, `cout`, and `endl` and can remove the `<stdio.h>` include.

2. Remove unused variables: The variable `k` is not used after it is read from input. We can remove it from the program.

3. Use more efficient arithmetic: Instead of calculating the sum of natural numbers from 1 to n using `(n * (n + 1)) / 2`, we can use the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2` directly.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations: We can eliminate the calculation `n * d` by multiplying `n` with `d` directly.

5. Optimize the if condition: Instead of checking if `(n - k) > 0`, we can check if `n > k` directly.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int d = 0;
  std::cin >> d;

  int n = 0;
  std::cin >> n;

  n = n * (n + 1) / 2 * d;

  if (n > 0) {
    std::cout << n;
  } else {
    std::cout << "0";
  }

  return 0;
}
```
