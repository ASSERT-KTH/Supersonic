Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes both `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<stdio.h>`, which is unnecessary. We can remove the `<stdio.h>` include since it is not used in the program.

Step 2: Optimize the input and output operations
The program uses `cin` for input and `cout` for output. These operations can be slow, especially when performing a large number of input/output operations. We can optimize this by using `scanf` and `printf` functions instead, which are generally faster.

Step 3: Simplify the calculation
The program calculates `(n * (n + 1)) / 2` and then multiplies it by `d`. We can simplify this calculation to `n * (n + 1) * d / 2`.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary variables
The variable `k` is not used in any further calculations. We can remove it since it is not needed.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int d, n;
  scanf("%d", &d);
  scanf("%d", &n);
  
  long long result = (1LL * n * (n + 1) * d) / 2;
  
  if (result > 0) {
    printf("%lld", result);
  } else {
    printf("0");
  }

  return 0;
}
```
