The given program takes three inputs `d`, `k`, and `n` from the user, performs some calculations, and prints the result. To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<stdio.h>` header files, which are not required for this program. We can remove these header files.

2. Remove unused variable: The variable `long k` is declared but not used in the program. We can remove this variable.

3. Simplify the calculation: The calculation `n = n * (n + 1) / 2` can be simplified by directly calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.

4. Optimize the condition: The condition `(n - k) > 0` can be optimized by removing the subtraction operation and checking if `n` is greater than `k` directly.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int d, n;
  std::cin >> d >> n;

  n = (n * (n + 1)) / 2 * d;

  if (n > k) {
    std::cout << n - k;
  } else {
    std::cout << "0";
  }

  return 0;
}
```
