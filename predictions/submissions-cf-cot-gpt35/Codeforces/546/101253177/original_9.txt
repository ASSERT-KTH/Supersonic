Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header file is not required.
   - The `#include <stdio.h>` header file is also not needed.
   - These header files are not used in the program and can be safely removed.

2. Remove unnecessary variable initialization:
   - The variables `k` and `n` are initialized to 0 before reading their values from input. This is not required because their values will be overwritten by the input values.

3. Simplify the calculation of `n`:
   - The calculation `n = n * (n + 1) / 2` can be simplified to `n = (n * (n + 1)) / 2`.
   - This avoids unnecessary multiplication and division operations.

4. Print output directly instead of using conditional statement:
   - Instead of using an `if-else` statement to check if `(n - k) > 0` and then print the result, we can directly print the result of `n - k`.
   - This avoids the need for an additional conditional statement.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int d;
  std::cin >> d;

  long k;
  std::cin >> k;

  long n;
  std::cin >> n;

  n = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
  n *= d;

  std::cout << std::max(n - k, 0L);
}
```
