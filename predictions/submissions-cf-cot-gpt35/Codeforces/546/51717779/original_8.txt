This program calculates the total cost of buying w items with a price that increases by k units per item. It then checks if the total cost is less than or equal to n and outputs either 0 or the difference between the total cost and n.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the loop and the unnecessary calculation of the total cost.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header. This header is not standard and includes many unnecessary libraries.

2. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` statement. It's better to explicitly specify the namespace to avoid any potential naming conflicts.

3. Remove the declaration of `int_least64_t k` and replace it with a regular `int` since the range of values does not require a 64-bit integer.

4. Remove the declaration of `dem` and calculate the total cost directly using the formula `(w * (w + 1) / 2) * k`.

5. Change the condition in the if statement to `dem > n` to make it more intuitive.

6. Instead of using an if-else statement to output the result, use the ternary operator to directly output the result.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int k, n, w;
    std::cin >> k >> n >> w;
    
    int dem = (w * (w + 1) / 2) * k;
    std::cout << (dem > n ? dem - n : 0);
    
    return 0;
}
```
