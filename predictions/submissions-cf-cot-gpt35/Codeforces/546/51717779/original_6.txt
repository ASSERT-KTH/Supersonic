Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header file includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can increase the compilation time and memory usage. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Optimize the loop

In the original program, the loop iterates from 1 to w and calculates `dem += i * k` for each iteration. However, we can optimize this loop by using the arithmetic sum formula. The sum of the first w natural numbers can be calculated as `(w * (w + 1)) / 2`. By multiplying this sum with k, we can directly calculate the value of `dem` in constant time.

Step 3: Simplify the conditional statement

The conditional statement `if (dem <= n)` can be simplified by directly calculating the difference between `dem` and `n` and printing the result.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int_least64_t k, n, w;
  cin >> k >> n >> w;

  int_least64_t sum = (w * (w + 1)) / 2;
  int_least64_t dem = sum * k;

  cout << max(0ll, dem - n);

  return 0;
}
```
