The given program calculates the total cost of buying w items, each costing an increasing amount starting from k, and then checks if the total cost is greater than n. If it is, it subtracts n from the total cost and prints the result. Otherwise, it prints 0.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the loop and the unnecessary calculation of the total cost. Instead, we can directly calculate the total cost using a mathematical formula. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove it.

2. Calculate total cost using a formula: We can calculate the total cost using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of the first w natural numbers can be calculated as (w * (w + 1)) / 2. Multiplying it by k will give us the total cost of buying w items.

3. Remove unnecessary variable and loop: Since we can calculate the total cost directly, we don't need the `dem` variable and the for loop. We can remove them.

4. Simplify the conditional statement: Instead of checking if `dem` is greater than `n` and then subtracting `n` from `dem`, we can directly calculate the difference between `dem` and `n`. This will simplify the conditional statement.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int_least64_t k, n, w;
  cin >> k >> n >> w;

  int_least64_t dem = (w * (w + 1) / 2) * k;

  cout << max(0LL, dem - n);

  return 0;
}
```
