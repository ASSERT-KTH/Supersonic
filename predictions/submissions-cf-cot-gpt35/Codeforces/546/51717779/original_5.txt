Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a header file that includes a lot of other standard library header files. It is not necessary for this program as it only requires `iostream` and `cstdint` headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary variable type

The variable `dem` is declared as `int_least64_t`, which is an unnecessary data type for this program. It can be changed to `int` to save memory.

Step 3: Use a mathematical formula to optimize the loop

Instead of iterating from 1 to `w` and calculating `i * k` in each iteration, we can use a mathematical formula to calculate the sum directly. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula `(first_term + last_term) * number_of_terms / 2`.

Step 4: Simplify the if-else statement

The if-else statement can be simplified by removing the else block and combining the two cout statements into one.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint>

int main() {
  int k, n, w;
  std::cin >> k >> n >> w;

  int dem = (w * (w + 1) / 2) * k;

  std::cout << std::max(0, dem - n);

  return 0;
}
```
