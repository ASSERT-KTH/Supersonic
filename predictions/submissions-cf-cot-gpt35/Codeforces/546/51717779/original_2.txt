Explanation of the optimization steps:
1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended because it includes a large number of headers, which can increase the compile time and memory usage unnecessarily. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`.
2. Use more appropriate data types: The program uses `int_least64_t` for `k`, which is not necessary. We can use `int` instead, as the range of values for `k` is not specified.
3. Modify the loop to eliminate unnecessary multiplications: The loop iterates from 1 to `w` and accumulates `i * k` in `dem`. However, instead of multiplying `i` with `k` in each iteration, we can calculate the sum of the first `w` natural numbers and multiply it by `k`. This can be done using the formula `(w * (w + 1) / 2) * k`.
4. Remove unnecessary if-else statement: The program checks whether `dem` is less than or equal to `n` and prints either 0 or `dem - n` accordingly. However, we can eliminate the if-else statement by directly calculating `max(dem - n, 0)`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int k, n, w;
  cin >> k >> n >> w;

  int dem = (w * (w + 1) / 2) * k;
  cout << max(dem - n, 0);

  return 0;
}
```
