The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<algorithm>` header files which are not used in the program. These can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor macros: The program defines macros `M`, `D`, and `PI`, but none of them are used. These can be removed.

3. Change the input loop condition: The program uses a `while` loop with the condition `tests-- > 0`. However, the value of `tests` is always 1 and this loop will only run once. We can replace this loop with a single iteration of the `for` loop to make it more readable.

4. Use a vector instead of an array: The program uses an array `a[x]` to store counts. However, using a vector will allow us to dynamically resize it based on the value of `x`.

5. Use `reserve` instead of `max`: The program uses `max(2 * q, q + 100)` to determine the size of the set. Instead, we can use `reserve` to preallocate memory for the set to avoid frequent reallocations.

6. Use `emplace_hint` instead of `erase` and `insert`: The program uses `s.erase(z)` and `s.insert(i)` inside the loop. We can use `emplace_hint` to directly insert the new element while erasing the old one in a single operation.

7. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates `y % x` multiple times. We can calculate it once and store it in a variable to avoid redundant calculations.

8. Avoid unnecessary output: The program prints `*(s.begin())` at each iteration, even though it only needs to be printed once at the end. We can move this outside the loop to improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int tests = 1;
  for (int t = 0; t < tests; t++) {
    int q, x;
    cin >> q >> x;
    
    vector<int> a(x, 0);
    set<int> s;
    s.reserve(2 * q);
    for (int i = 0; i < 2 * q; i++)
      s.emplace_hint(s.end(), i);
    
    int minElement = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
      int y;
      cin >> y;
      
      int mod = y % x;
      int z = a[mod] * x + mod;
      
      s.erase(z);
      a[mod]++;
      minElement = *s.begin();
    }
    
    cout << minElement << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program improves the running time and memory usage by eliminating unnecessary operations and using more efficient data structures.
