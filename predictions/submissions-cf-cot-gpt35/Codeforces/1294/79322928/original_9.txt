The main issue with the given program is the use of a set and its operations within the main loop. The set operations, such as insertion and deletion, have a time complexity of O(log n), which can significantly slow down the program for large values of q. 

To optimize the program, we can replace the set with a vector and maintain a separate index to keep track of the minimum element. This way, we can perform constant time operations for insertion and deletion.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary headers and macros.
2. Replace the set with a vector and initialize it with numbers from 0 to max(2 * q, q + 100).
3. Create a variable `minIndex` to store the index of the minimum element in the vector.
4. Inside the while loop, update `minIndex` if the current element being removed is the minimum element.
5. Instead of using `s.erase(z)`, swap the element at `z` with the last element in the vector and reduce the size of the vector by 1.
6. Print the value at `minIndex` as the minimum element.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int tests = 1;
  while (tests-- > 0) {
    int q, x;
    cin >> q >> x;
    
    vector<int> a(x, 0);
    vector<int> v(max(2 * q, q + 100));
    int minIndex = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++)
      v[i] = i;
      
    while (q-- > 0) {
      int y;
      cin >> y;
      int z = a[y % x] * x + y % x;
      
      if (z == minIndex) {
        swap(v[z], v.back());
        v.pop_back();
        minIndex = *min_element(v.begin(), v.end());
      } else {
        swap(v[z], v.back());
        v.pop_back();
      }
      
      a[y % x]++;
      
      cout << v[minIndex] << endl;
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

By replacing the set with a vector and maintaining a separate index, the optimized program should have improved running time and memory usage.
