Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes all the standard library headers. This can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. We can remove this header and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary pragmas: The program contains `#pragma` directives for GCC optimization. These pragmas may not have a significant impact on the performance of the program and can be removed.

3. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these unused macros to simplify the code.

4. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs for common types like `ll`, `ld`, `pll`, etc. These typedefs are not used in the code and can be removed.

5. Remove unused functions: The program defines several functions like `fileio()`, `output()`, etc. that are not used in the code. We can remove these unused functions.

6. Optimize input/output: The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output. These stream objects are synchronized with the C standard I/O streams, which can lead to slower input/output. We can use `scanf` and `printf` instead, which can be faster for large inputs/outputs.

7. Optimize data structures: The program uses sets and multisets for storing data. While these data structures provide efficient insertion and deletion, they have a higher memory overhead compared to arrays or vectors. We can replace the sets and multisets with arrays or vectors to optimize memory usage.

8. Optimize sorting: The program uses `sortall()` macro to sort a container. However, the macro is not used in the code. We can remove this macro.

9. Optimize variable initialization: The program uses macros like `init_vi()` and `init_vll()` to initialize vectors with input values. However, these macros are not used in the code. We can remove these macros.

10. Optimize loop variables: The program uses loop variables like `i`, `j`, `k`, etc. for multiple nested loops. These variables can be reused across different loops to reduce memory usage.

11. Optimize unnecessary output: The program prints the result of each test case in a separate block. We can remove the extra curly braces and print the result immediately after calculating it.

12. Optimize unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the minimum and maximum elements in a container using `MX` and `MN` macros. However, these macros are not used in the code. We can remove these macros.

13. Optimize unnecessary code: The program contains unnecessary code like `#define type tll`. We can remove this line as it is not used in the code.

After applying these optimization steps, the optimized C/C++ program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <tuple>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int t, n, x, y;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    vector<tuple<int, int, int>> a;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
      a.emplace_back(max(x, y), min(x, y), i);
    }
    auto prev = a[0];
    auto best = prev;
    vector<int> res(n);
    for (const auto &person : a) {
      int h, w, i;
      tie(h, w, i) = person;
      if (get<0>(prev) == h) {
        if (get<1>(best) < w && get<0>(best) < h)
          res[i] = get<2>(best) + 1;
        else {
          res[i] = -1;
        }
      } else {
        if (get<1>(best) > get<1>(prev))
          best = prev;
        if (get<1>(best) < w && get<0>(best) < h)
          res[i] = get<2>(best) + 1;
        else
          res[i] = -1;
        prev = person;
      }
    }
    for (const auto &p : res)
      printf("%d ", p);
    printf("\n");
  }
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
