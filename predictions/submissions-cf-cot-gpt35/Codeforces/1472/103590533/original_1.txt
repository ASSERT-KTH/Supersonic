Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files.

The program includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which includes a lot of other standard library headers. This can result in slower compilation times and increased memory usage. We can remove `bits/stdc++.h` and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Optimize I/O operations.

The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations. These operations can be slow, especially when performing a large number of operations. We can improve the I/O performance by disabling synchronization with `stdio` and using a faster I/O method.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary macros.

The program defines a large number of macros, which can make the code harder to read and understand. We can remove the unnecessary macros and replace them with their corresponding values.

Step 4: Optimize data structures.

The program uses several data structures such as `vector`, `set`, and `multiset`. These data structures can be optimized to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

Step 5: Simplify the code.

The code contains unnecessary code blocks and redundant variables. We can simplify the code to make it more readable and efficient.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <tuple>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    set<tuple<int, int, int>> a;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int x, y;
      cin >> x >> y;
      a.insert(make_tuple(max(x, y), min(x, y), i));
    }
    auto prev = (*a.begin());
    auto best = prev;
    vector<int> res(n);
    for (const auto &person : a) {
      int h, w, i;
      tie(h, w, i) = person;
      if (get<0>(prev) == h) {
        if (get<1>(best) < w && get<0>(best) < h)
          res[i] = get<2>(best) + 1;
        else {
          res[i] = -1;
        }
      } else {
        if (get<1>(best) > get<1>(prev))
          best = prev;
        if (get<1>(best) < w && get<0>(best) < h)
          res[i] = get<2>(best) + 1;
        else
          res[i] = -1;
        prev = person;
      }
    }
    for (auto &p : res)
      cout << p << " ";
    cout << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  solve();

  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, unnecessary header files are removed. I/O operations are optimized by disabling synchronization with `stdio` and using a faster I/O method. Unnecessary macros are removed and replaced with their corresponding values. Data structures are optimized to reduce memory usage and improve performance. The code is simplified to make it more readable and efficient.
