The given program is a solution to a coding problem. It takes an input integer `n` followed by `n` more integers, and then performs some operations on the array of integers.

Here is the step-by-step optimization of the program:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not a standard C++ header file. It is better to include only the necessary header files. In this case, we only need `<iostream>` and `<vector>`, so we can remove the `<bits/stdc++.h>` include.

2. Remove unnecessary type definitions: The program defines type aliases for `long long int`, `unsigned long long int`, and `long double`. However, these type aliases are not used in the program. We can remove these type definitions.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the program. We can remove the macros `nl`, `er`, `fast`, `test`, `f0`, `f1`, `pb`, `mp`, `fi`, `se`, `print`, `out`, `Y`, and `N`.

4. Optimize the loop iterations: The program uses a loop to read the input integers and then another loop to perform operations on the array. The second loop iterates from `n` to `1` and performs operations on the array. However, we can optimize this loop by iterating from `1` to `n` in reverse order. This way, we can avoid the `n + 1 - rem` calculations and simplify the logic.

5. Remove unnecessary vector initialization: The program initializes a vector `v` with a size of `n + 1` and sets all elements to `0`. However, this initialization is unnecessary because the program immediately reads the `n` integers and sets the values of the vector elements.

6. Avoid unnecessary vector copying: The program creates a vector `pp` to store pairs of integers and then adds elements to this vector using the `push_back` function. However, we can avoid this extra copying by using the `emplace_back` function instead, which constructs the pair in-place without copying.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> v(n);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
  }

  vector<pair<int, pair<int, int>>> pp;

  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (v[i] > i) {
      int rem = (v[i] - i) % (n + 1);
      pp.emplace_back(1, make_pair(i, n + 1 - rem));
      for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
        v[j] += n + 1 - rem;
      }
    } else {
      pp.emplace_back(1, make_pair(i, i - v[i]));
      for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
        v[j] += i - v[i];
      }
    }
  }

  pp.emplace_back(2, make_pair(n - 1, n));

  cout << pp.size() << "\n";
  for (const auto& i : pp) {
    cout << i.first << " " << i.second.first << " " << i.second.second << "\n";
  }
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary code and improves the loop iterations and vector operations for better running time and memory usage.
