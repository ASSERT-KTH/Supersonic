The given program reads input values from the standard input and performs several operations using a set. The goal is to optimize the program for running time and memory usage.

1. Remove unnecessary includes:
The program includes the `<iostream>` library, but it is not used. We can remove this line to improve compilation time.

2. Remove unnecessary typedef:
The program defines `typedef long long ll`, but it is not used. We can remove this line to simplify the code.

3. Replace `set` with `unordered_set`:
The program uses a set to store unique values. However, a `set` is implemented as a binary search tree, which has a logarithmic time complexity for insertion and lookup operations. We can replace it with an `unordered_set`, which is implemented as a hash table and has an average constant time complexity for these operations.

4. Replace `scanf` with `cin` for input:
The program uses `scanf` to read input values, but it is generally slower than `cin`. We can replace `scanf` with `cin` to improve the input reading performance.

5. Replace `printf` with `cout` for output:
The program uses `printf` to print output values, but it is generally slower than `cout`. We can replace `printf` with `cout` to improve the output printing performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

int BSDK() {
  int n, m, a;
  unordered_set<int> s;
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    cin >> a;
    s.insert(a);
  }
  for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    cin >> a;
    s.insert(a);
  }
  return n + m - s.size();
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    cout << BSDK() << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program replaces the `set` with an `unordered_set`, uses `cin` for input reading, and `cout` for output printing. These changes improve the program's performance in terms of running time and memory usage.
