The given C/C++ program reads integers from the standard input and inserts them into a set. It then calculates the difference between the total number of integers read and the size of the set.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary typedef for `ll` (long long) as it is not used in the program.
2. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `INF` constant as it is not used in the program.
3. Replace the `scanf` and `printf` functions with the faster `cin` and `cout` functions from the `<iostream>` library.
4. Replace the `set<int>` with an `unordered_set<int>` for faster insertion and lookup.
5. Instead of inserting the integers into the set one by one, we can read all the integers from the input, store them in a vector, and then insert the vector elements into the unordered set at once.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int BSDK() {
  int n, m, a;
  unordered_set<int> s;

  cin >> n >> m;

  vector<int> nums(n + m);
  for (int i = 0; i < n + m; i++) {
    cin >> nums[i];
  }

  s.insert(nums.begin(), nums.end());

  return n + m - s.size();
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;

  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    cout << BSDK() << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program uses `cin` and `cout` for faster input/output. It replaces the `set<int>` with an `unordered_set<int>` for faster insertion and lookup. It also reads all the integers from the input at once and inserts them into the unordered set in a single operation.
