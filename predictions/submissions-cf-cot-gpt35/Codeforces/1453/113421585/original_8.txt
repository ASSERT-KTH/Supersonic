This C++ program reads an integer `t` and calls the `BSDK` function `t` times. The `BSDK` function reads two integers `n` and `m`, and then reads `n` and `m` more integers respectively. It inserts the `n` and `m` integers into a set, and then returns the difference between the sum of `n` and `m` and the size of the set.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#include <iostream>` and `using namespace std` statements. Since we are not using any input/output stream functions, we don't need these statements.

2. Change the `typedef long long ll` to `typedef long long int ll` for clarity.

3. Change the `set<int>` to `set<ll>` to match the typedef of `ll`.

4. Replace the `scanf` and `printf` functions with the more efficient `cin` and `cout` functions.

5. Instead of inserting all the integers into the set and then calculating the size of the set, we can use a single loop to count the number of distinct integers. We can use a `unordered_set` instead of a `set` to improve the performance of inserting and checking the existence of elements.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
typedef long long int ll;
#define INF 1000000000

ll BSDK() {
  int n, m, a;
  std::unordered_set<ll> s;
  
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  
  for (int j = 0; j < n + m; j++) {
    std::cin >> a;
    s.insert(a);
  }
  
  return n + m - s.size();
}

int main() {
  int t;
  
  std::cin >> t;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    std::cout << BSDK() << std::endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary statements, uses more efficient input/output functions, and improves the algorithmic complexity of counting distinct integers by using an `unordered_set`.
