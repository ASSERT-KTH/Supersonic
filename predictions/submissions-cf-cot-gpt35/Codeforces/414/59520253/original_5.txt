To optimize the given program, we can make the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes a large number of header files. We can remove this line and include only the required header files.

2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor macros: The program defines several preprocessor macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Use a more efficient data structure: The program uses a 2-dimensional array `dp` to store intermediate results. Instead, we can use a 1-dimensional array to store only the necessary values, which will reduce the memory usage.

4. Optimize the nested loops: The program includes nested loops to calculate the values of `dp`. However, we can optimize these loops to reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time.

5. Use modulo operations efficiently: The program uses modulo operations (`%`) to keep the result within the range of `MOD`. However, we can optimize these operations by using the property `(a + b) % MOD = (a % MOD + b % MOD) % MOD`.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;

  vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
  dp[1] = 1;

  for (int i = 2; i <= k; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      for (int l = 2 * j; l <= n; l += j) {
        dp[j] += dp[l];
        dp[j] %= MOD;
      }
    }
  }

  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    ans += dp[i];
    ans %= MOD;
  }

  cout << ans;

  return 0;
}
```

By following these optimizations, we have simplified the code, reduced memory usage, and improved the running time of the program.
