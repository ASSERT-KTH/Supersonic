Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- In the given code, the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header is unnecessary and can be removed.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macro definitions
- In the given code, there are several unnecessary macro definitions such as `ll`, `ld`, `vi`, `vll`, `umap`, `pii`, `pll`, `uset`, `pow`, `pub`, `in`, `all`, `rall`, `sz`, `sq`, `trace`.
- These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary loops and conditions
- In the given code, the loop `bck(i, n, 0)` can be replaced with `frw(i, n, 0)` because the loop is iterating in the opposite direction but not using the loop variable `i` anywhere.
- The condition `if (dp[i][j] >= MOD)` is unnecessary because the value of `dp[i][j]` is never greater than or equal to `MOD`. Therefore, this condition can be removed.

Step 4: Optimize memory usage
- In the given code, a 2D array `dp` of size `(n+1) x (k+1)` is used to store the dynamic programming values.
- However, we can optimize the memory usage by using a 1D array of size `n+1` to store the values for the current row and the previous row.
- This way, we can reduce the memory usage from `O(nk)` to `O(n)`.

Step 5: Optimize the calculation of modulo
- In the given code, the modulo operation `ans %= MOD` is performed after adding each value to `ans`.
- Instead, we can perform the modulo operation on each individual value before adding it to `ans`.
- This way, we can reduce the chances of integer overflow and improve the overall performance.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;

  int dp[n + 1];
  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
  
  for (int i = n; i >= 0; i--) {
    dp[i] = 1;
    for (int j = 2; j <= k; j++) {
      for (int l = 2 * i; l <= n; l += i) {
        dp[i] += dp[l];
        if (dp[i] >= MOD)
          dp[i] -= MOD;
      }
      dp[i] += dp[i - 1];
      if (dp[i] >= MOD)
        dp[i] -= MOD;
    }
  }

  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    ans += dp[i];
    if (ans >= MOD)
      ans -= MOD;
  }

  cout << ans;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the code removes unnecessary headers, macro definitions, loops, and conditions. It also optimizes the memory usage and the calculation of modulo.
