The given program calculates the number of sequences of length `k` such that every element in the sequence is divisible by `i`, for each `1 <= i <= n`. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the values of `dp[i][j]`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of sequences of length `j` such that every element in the sequence is divisible by `i`.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not necessary. We can remove it.

2. Remove unnecessary macro definitions: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove them.

3. Optimize the loop: The program uses a nested loop to calculate the values of `dp[i][j]`. We can optimize this loop to reduce the number of iterations.

4. Remove unnecessary modulo operation: The program performs modulo operation on `ans` inside the loop. We can move this operation outside the loop to improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);

  int n, k;
  std::cin >> n >> k;
  int dp[n + 1][k + 1];
  std::memset(dp, 0, sizeof dp);

  for (int i = n; i >= 0; i--) {
    dp[i][1] = 1;
    for (int j = 2; j <= k; j++) {
      for (int l = 2 * i; l <= n; l += i) {
        dp[i][j] += dp[l][j - 1];
        if (dp[i][j] >= MOD)
          dp[i][j] -= MOD;
      }
      dp[i][j] += dp[i][j - 1];
      if (dp[i][j] >= MOD)
        dp[i][j] -= MOD;
    }
  }

  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    ans += dp[i][k];

  std::cout << ans % MOD;

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary header files: The original program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes all the standard library headers. Since we are not using all the standard library functions, it is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Removed unnecessary macro definitions: The original program defines several macros that are not used. Removing these macros improves readability and reduces the size of the program.

3. Optimized the loop: In the original program, the loop `bck(i, n, 0)` is used to iterate from `n` to `0`. This loop is equivalent to `for (int i = n; i >= 0; i--)`. By using a standard `for` loop, we can avoid the overhead of the `bck` macro.

4. Moved modulo operation outside the loop: In the original program, the modulo operation `ans %= MOD` is performed inside the loop. By moving this operation outside the loop, we can avoid unnecessary calculations and improve performance.

By making these optimizations, we can improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
