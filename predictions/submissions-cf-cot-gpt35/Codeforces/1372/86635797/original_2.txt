The given program has a lot of unnecessary macros and functions that are not being used. These macros and functions add unnecessary overhead and can be removed to improve the efficiency of the program.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not necessary. Instead, we can include only the required headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: Many of the macros defined in the program are not being used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs that are not being used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

4. Simplify the loop conditions: The loops in the program can be simplified by using a range-based loop instead of an index-based loop. This will make the code more readable and efficient.

5. Use a more efficient algorithm: The current algorithm checks for the number of changes in the array and based on that, determines the answer. This can be simplified by checking only the first and last elements of the array. If either of them is in the correct position, the answer is 1. Otherwise, the answer is 2.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int T;
    cin >> T;

    while (T--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;

        vector<int> a(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }

        int cng = 0;
        if (a[0] != 1 || a[n - 1] != n) {
            cng = 2;
        } else {
            cng = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; ++i) {
                if (a[i] != i + 1) {
                    cng = 1;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        cout << cng << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

By removing unnecessary macros, functions, and simplifying the code, we have optimized the program for both running time and memory usage.
