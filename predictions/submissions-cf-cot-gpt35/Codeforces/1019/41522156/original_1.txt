The given program solves a problem of finding three points in a set of points such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to a given value S.

To optimize the program, I would make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<bitset>`, `<cassert>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdio>`, `<ctime>`, `<iostream>`, `<map>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<sstream>`, `<string>`, `<vector>`. These headers are not used in the program and can be removed to reduce compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines two macros `pb` and `mp`, but these macros are not used anywhere in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Use `constexpr` instead of `#define`: The program defines a macro `B` using `#define`. We can replace this macro with a `constexpr` variable to improve readability and type safety.

4. Initialize arrays with constant values: The program declares several arrays `mod`, `x`, `y`, `Nx`, `Ny`, `A` without initializing their values. We can initialize these arrays with constant values to avoid undefined behavior.

5. Avoid unnecessary floating-point calculations: The program defines several arrays `nx`, `ny`, `a` of type `float`. These arrays are used to store floating-point values, but the calculations in the program only involve integer values. We can change the type of these arrays to `int` to avoid unnecessary floating-point calculations and improve performance.

6. Avoid unnecessary variable assignments: The program assigns values to arrays `nx`, `ny`, `a` in each iteration of the outer loop. Since these arrays are not used later in the program, we can remove these assignments to improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
#pragma GCC target("sse,sse2,sse3,ssse3,sse4,popcnt,abm,mmx,avx,tune=native")

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

constexpr int B = 5;

int mod[B] = {0};
int64_t x[2180] = {0}, y[2180] = {0};
int64_t Nx[2180] = {0}, Ny[2180] = {0};
int64_t A[2180] = {0};

int main() {
  int n;
  int64_t S;
  cin >> n >> S;
  S *= 2L;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> x[i] >> y[i];
  }
  for (int s = 0; s < n; ++s) {
    for (int i = s + 1; i < n; ++i) {
      Nx[i] = x[i] - x[s];
      Ny[i] = y[i] - y[s];
    }
    for (int i = s + 1; i < n; ++i) {
      int64_t Xi = Nx[i], Yi = Ny[i];
      int ind = 0;
      for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
        int64_t t = Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi;
        if (t == S || t == -S) {
          ind += j;
        }
      }
      if (ind > 0) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
          int64_t t = Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi;
          if (t == S || t == -S) {
            cout << "Yes\n";
            cout << x[s] << " " << y[s] << "\n";
            cout << x[i] << " " << y[i] << "\n";
            cout << x[j] << " " << y[j] << "\n";
            return 0;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  cout << "No\n";
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program removes unnecessary includes and macros, initializes arrays with constant values, avoids unnecessary floating-point calculations, and removes unnecessary variable assignments. These modifications improve the program's running time and memory usage.
