The given program looks fine in terms of code style and logic. However, there are a few optimizations that can be made to improve its running time and memory usage.

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary header files. We can remove them to reduce the overhead of loading and processing these headers.

2. Avoid unnecessary data copying: The program uses separate arrays `Nx` and `Ny` to store the differences between `x[i]` and `x[s]` and `y[i]` and `y[s]`, respectively. Instead of copying the values to separate arrays, we can calculate the differences directly when needed.

3. Use `int` instead of `int64` for loop variables: The loop variables `i`, `j`, and `s` in the for loops don't need to be `int64`. They can be safely changed to `int` to save memory.

4. Optimize the inner loop: The inner loop checks for values of `t` that are equal to `S` or `-S` multiple times. We can optimize this by calculating `Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi` only once and storing it in a variable.

5. Use `cout` with `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: By default, `cin` and `cout` are synchronized with C-style I/O functions, which can slow down the program. We can improve the running time by disabling this synchronization using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
#pragma GCC target("sse,sse2,sse3,ssse3,sse4,popcnt,abm,mmx,avx,tune=native")
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

typedef long long int64;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  int64 S;
  cin >> n >> S;
  S *= 2L;

  vector<int64> x(n), y(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> x[i] >> y[i];
  }

  for (int s = 0; s < n; ++s) {
    for (int i = s + 1; i < n; ++i) {
      int64 Xi = x[i] - x[s];
      int64 Yi = y[i] - y[s];

      for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
        int64 t = (x[j] - x[s]) * Yi - (y[j] - y[s]) * Xi;
        if (t == S || t == -S) {
          cout << "Yes\n";
          cout << x[s] << " " << y[s] << "\n";
          cout << x[i] << " " << y[i] << "\n";
          cout << x[j] << " " << y[j] << "\n";
          return 0;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  cout << "No\n";
  return 0;
}
```
