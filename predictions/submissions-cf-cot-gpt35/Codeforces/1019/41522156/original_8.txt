To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several header files that are not used in the code. We can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unused variables: The variables `mod`, `ny`, `a`, and `A` are declared but not used in the code. We can remove these variables to reduce memory usage.

3. Remove unnecessary calculations: The variables `nx` and `ny` are calculated but not used in the code. We can remove these calculations to improve running time.

4. Optimize the inner loop: The inner loop checks for conditions `t == S` and `t == -S` multiple times. We can optimize this loop by calculating `Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi` only once and storing it in a variable. Then, we can check the conditions using this variable.

5. Optimize the outer loop: The outer loop calculates `Nx[i]` and `Ny[i]` for each iteration, even though these values are not used outside the loop. We can move these calculations inside the inner loop to avoid unnecessary calculations.

6. Use a more efficient data type: The variables `Nx` and `Ny` are declared as `int64`, which is an 8-byte integer. However, the values stored in these variables are the differences between `x` and `y` coordinates, which can be represented by a smaller data type. We can change the data type of `Nx` and `Ny` to `int` to reduce memory usage.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
#pragma GCC target("sse,sse2,sse3,ssse3,sse4,popcnt,abm,mmx,avx,tune=native")
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  int S;
  cin >> n >> S;
  S *= 2;
  vector<int> x(n), y(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> x[i] >> y[i];
  }
  for (int s = 0; s < n; ++s) {
    int64_t Xi = x[s], Yi = y[s];
    for (int i = s + 1; i < n; ++i) {
      int64_t t = x[i] - Xi;
      int64_t ind = 0;
      for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
        int64_t t2 = (x[j] - Xi) * (y[i] - Yi) - (y[j] - Yi) * (x[i] - Xi);
        if (t2 == S || t2 == -S) {
          ind += j;
        }
      }
      if (ind > 0) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
          int64_t t2 = (x[j] - Xi) * (y[i] - Yi) - (y[j] - Yi) * (x[i] - Xi);
          if (t2 == S || t2 == -S) {
            cout << "Yes\n";
            cout << x[s] << " " << y[s] << "\n";
            cout << x[i] << " " << y[i] << "\n";
            cout << x[j] << " " << y[j] << "\n";
            return 0;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  cout << "No\n";
  return 0;
}
```
