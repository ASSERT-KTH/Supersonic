The given program solves a problem by checking if there exist three points in a given set such that the area of the triangle formed by them is equal to a given value S.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points multiple times. We can calculate them once and reuse them in the inner loop.

2. Use a more efficient data structure: The program uses arrays to store the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and intermediate values. We can use vectors instead, which can dynamically resize and reduce the memory usage.

3. Use a more efficient algorithm: The current algorithm checks each possible triplet of points and calculates the area to check if it matches the given value S. We can improve the algorithm by using a hashing technique to store the areas of triangles formed by each pair of points. This way, we can check if there exist three points with the desired area in constant time.

Here is the optimized program:

unordered_map<int64, vector<ii>> areas; // Hash map to store areas and corresponding points

int main() {
  int n;
  int64 S;
  cin >> n >> S;
  S *= 2L;
  vector<int64> x(n), y(n); // Use vectors instead of arrays

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> x[i] >> y[i];
  }

  for (int s = 0; s < n; ++s) {
    areas.clear(); // Clear the hash map for each starting point
    for (int i = s + 1; i < n; ++i) {
      int64 Nx = x[i] - x[s], Ny = y[i] - y[s]; // Calculate differences once
      int64 area = Nx * Ny;
      areas[area].push_back({Nx, Ny}); // Store the area and corresponding points
    }
    for (int i = s + 1; i < n; ++i) {
      int64 Xi = x[i] - x[s], Yi = y[i] - y[s]; // Calculate differences once
      int64 target = S - Xi * Yi; // Calculate the target area
      if (areas.count(target)) {
        for (const auto& p : areas[target]) {
          int64 t = p.first * Yi - p.second * Xi;
          if (t == S || t == -S) {
            cout << "Yes\n";
            cout << x[s] << " " << y[s] << "\n";
            cout << x[i] << " " << y[i] << "\n";
            cout << x[s] + p.first << " " << y[s] + p.second << "\n";
            return 0;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  cout << "No\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Replaced arrays `x` and `y` with vectors to dynamically resize based on the input size.

2. Added an unordered map `areas` to store the areas of triangles formed by each pair of points. The key of the map is the area, and the value is a vector of pairs representing the differences in x and y coordinates.

3. Replaced the nested loop to calculate the differences between points and check if they match the target area with a single loop that iterates over the areas stored in the hash map. This reduces the number of calculations and comparisons.

4. Removed the unnecessary calculations in the inner loop by calculating the differences between points once outside the loop.

5. Instead of printing the points directly, we calculate the third point using the stored differences in the hash map.

These optimizations improve both the running time and memory usage of the program.
