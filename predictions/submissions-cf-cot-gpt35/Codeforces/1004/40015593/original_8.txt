The original program reads an integer `n` from the input, then reads `n` integers into the array `cont`. It then initializes a set `st`, and for each element in `cont` starting from the last element, it inserts the element into `st` and stores the size of `st` into the array `cnt`. Finally, it loops through the elements in `cont` from the first element to the second-to-last element, checks if the element has been used before (using the array `used`), marks it as used, and adds the value of `cnt` at the next index to the variable `ans`. `ans` is then printed.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line, as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers.

2. Change the type of `ans` from `long long` to `int`, as the variable is used to store the sum of `cnt[i+1]` which is an `int`. This will save memory usage.

3. Remove the call to `ios::sync_with_stdio(0)` and `cin.tie(0)` as they are not necessary in this program.

4. Remove the unnecessary `memset` call, as it initializes the `used` array to all zeros, which is already the default value for uninitialized arrays.

5. Change the type of the arrays `cont`, `used`, and `cnt` from `int` to `vector<int>`. This will allow us to avoid using the `memset` call and dynamically allocate memory as needed, resulting in better memory usage.

6. Remove the `set<int>` and instead use a `unordered_set<int>` for `st`. This will improve the insertion time complexity from `O(log n)` to `O(1)`.

7. Instead of using a separate `used` array, we can use the `unordered_set<int> st` to check if an element has been used before. If an element is already in `st`, we can skip it and move on to the next element.

8. Change the loop condition in the second loop from `i < n - 1` to `i < n`, as we need to iterate through all elements in `cont`.

9. Instead of using `cout` to print the result, we can use `printf` which is generally faster for output.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n) {
    vector<int> cont(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> cont[i];
    }
    unordered_set<int> st;
    vector<int> cnt(n);
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      st.insert(cont[i]);
      cnt[i] = st.size();
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (st.count(cont[i]) == 0) {
        st.insert(cont[i]);
        ans += cnt[i + 1];
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimized program makes several small modifications to the original program in order to improve its performance. Each modification is explained step by step.
