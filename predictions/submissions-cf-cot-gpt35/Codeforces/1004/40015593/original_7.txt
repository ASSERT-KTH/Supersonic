The given program has a time complexity of O(n^2) because of the nested loop. The first loop iterates over the array `cont` of size n, and the second loop iterates over the array `used` of size n, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2).

To optimize the program, we can eliminate the nested loop and reduce the time complexity to O(n). 

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    std::cin.tie(0);

    int n;
    while (std::cin >> n) {
        std::vector<int> cont(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            std::cin >> cont[i];
        }

        std::unordered_set<int> st;
        std::vector<int> cnt(n);
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            st.insert(cont[i]);
            cnt[i] = st.size();
        }

        std::unordered_set<int> used;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (used.insert(cont[i]).second) {
                ans += cnt[i + 1];
            }
        }

        std::cout << ans << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:
1. Removed unnecessary headers: The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header was removed as it includes unnecessary headers that are not required for this program. Instead, we include only the necessary headers `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<unordered_set>`.

2. Removed unused variables: The variables `m` and `used` were declared but not used in the program. They have been removed.

3. Replaced `set` with `unordered_set`: The `set` container was used to keep track of unique elements. However, `unordered_set` provides faster insertion and lookup times, resulting in improved performance.

4. Removed `memset`: The `memset` function was used to reset the `used` array to 0 before each iteration. However, since we are using `unordered_set`, we no longer need to reset the array. Instead, we use a new `unordered_set` called `used` to keep track of the used elements.

5. Replaced array with vector: The arrays `cont` and `cnt` were replaced with `std::vector` for better memory management and ease of use.

6. Replaced nested loop with unordered_set: The nested loop that checked for used elements and updated the answer was replaced with a single loop that inserts elements into the `used` unordered_set and updates the answer accordingly. This reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).
