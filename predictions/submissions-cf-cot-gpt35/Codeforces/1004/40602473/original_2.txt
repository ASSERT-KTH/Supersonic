Optimization Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
The program includes several unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<cassert>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdio>`, `<cstring>`, `<ctime>`, `<iomanip>`, `<map>`, `<set>`, `<sstream>`, and `<vector>`. Since these headers are not used in the program, we can remove them to reduce the compile time.

Optimization Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
The program defines several unnecessary macros such as `rrep`, `rep`, `sqr`, `all`, and `pb`. Since these macros are not used in the program, we can remove them to simplify the code.

Optimization Step 3: Remove unnecessary typedef
The program typedefs `pair<int, int>` as `ii`, but it is not used in the program. We can remove this typedef.

Optimization Step 4: Simplify variable initialization
The program initializes `b` with `-1`, but it is not necessary. We can remove this initialization since `b` will be updated later in the loop.

Optimization Step 5: Avoid unnecessary loop iteration
The loop `rep(t, T) if (t > 0 && (freq[t] != (t << 2))) break;` can be optimized by starting the loop from `t = 1` instead of `t = 0`, since `freq[0]` will always be 0. This will save one unnecessary iteration.

Optimization Step 6: Optimize the nested loop
The nested loop in the `isvalid` function can be optimized by using a formula to calculate `cfreq` instead of iterating through all elements. This will reduce the time complexity of the nested loop from O(n*m) to O(1).

Optimization Step 7: Remove unnecessary variable initialization
The variables `n`, `m`, and `y` are initialized before the loop, but they can be initialized inside the loop to reduce the number of variables and improve code readability.

Optimization Step 8: Use early return in the `isvalid` function
The `isvalid` function can use early return to exit the function as soon as an invalid condition is encountered. This will prevent unnecessary calculations and improve the overall performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 1000000;
int freq[MAXN];
int cfreq[MAXN];

bool isvalid(int n, int m, int x, int y);

int main() {
  int T;
  cin >> T;

  fill(freq, freq + MAXN, 0);

  int b = -1;
  for (int t = 0; t < T; t++) {
    int k;
    cin >> k;
    freq[k]++;
    b = max(b, k);
  }

  int x = 0;
  for (int t = 1; t < T; t++) {
    if (freq[t] != (t << 2)) {
      x = t;
      break;
    }
  }

  for (int n = 1; n * n <= T; n++) {
    if (T % n == 0) {
      int m = T / n;
      int y = n + m - b - x;
      if (isvalid(n, m, x, y)) {
        cout << n << " " << m << endl;
        cout << x << " " << y << endl;
        return 0;
      } else if (isvalid(m, n, x, y)) {
        cout << m << " " << n << endl;
        cout << x << " " << y << endl;
        return 0;
      }
    }
  }

  cout << -1 << endl;
  return 0;
}

bool isvalid(int n, int m, int x, int y) {
  if (x < 1 || x > n || y < 1 || y > m)
    return false;

  fill(cfreq, cfreq + MAXN, 0);

  x--;
  y--;

  cfreq[abs(x - y)]++;
  cfreq[abs(x - (m - y - 1))]++;
  cfreq[abs(n - x - 1 - y)]++;
  cfreq[abs(n - x - 1 - (m - y - 1))]++;

  for (int i = 0; i < T; i++) {
    if (cfreq[i] != freq[i])
      return false;
  }

  return true;
}
