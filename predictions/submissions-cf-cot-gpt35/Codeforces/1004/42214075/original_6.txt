The given program has two main parts:

1. A loop that runs for a billion iterations, where each iteration increments the loop variable `i` twice and then decrements it by one.
2. Another loop that reads an integer `n` from user input and prints `n % 2` repeatedly.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the first loop that runs for a billion iterations as it doesn't serve any purpose.
2. Simplify the second loop to avoid unnecessary operations.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  printf("%d", n % 2);
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. We removed the unnecessary first loop that doesn't affect the program's behavior. It only increments and decrements the loop variable `i` but doesn't have any effect on other parts of the program.

2. In the second loop, we simplified the logic. Instead of using a decrementing loop counter (`n--`) and an empty loop body (`;`), we directly calculate `n % 2` and print the result. This eliminates the need for an unnecessary loop.
