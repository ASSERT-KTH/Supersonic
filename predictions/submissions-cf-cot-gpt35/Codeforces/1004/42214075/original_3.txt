The given C/C++ program is a bit confusing and seems to have unnecessary code. The first `for` loop does not have any purpose and can be removed. Additionally, the `printf` statement in the second `for` loop can be modified to improve memory usage.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    while (n--) {
        printf("%d", n % 2);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed the unnecessary `#pragma G++ optimize("-O2")`.
2. Removed the first `for` loop as it does not have any purpose.
3. Moved the declaration of `int n` inside the `main` function for better code organization.
4. Changed the `for` loop to a `while` loop for better readability.
5. Removed the empty statement `;` after the second `for` loop.
6. Added a `return 0` statement at the end of the `main` function for completeness.
