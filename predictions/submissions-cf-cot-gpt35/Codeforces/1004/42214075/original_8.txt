The given program has two main parts:

1. A loop that iterates from 1 to 1000000000 and performs some unnecessary operations.
2. A loop that reads an integer `n` from input and prints `n % 2` for `n` number of times.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove the unnecessary operations from the first loop.
2. Replace the second loop with a simple calculation.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#pragma G++ optimize("-O2")
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  // Remove the unnecessary loop
  // for (int i = 1; i <= 1000000000; i++)
  //   i++, i = i - 1;

  // Read the input integer
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);

  // Calculate and print n % 2
  printf("%d", n % 2);

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. We remove the unnecessary loop that performs `i++, i = i - 1` for `i` from 1 to 1000000000. This loop does not have any meaningful purpose and can be removed.
2. We read the input integer `n` using `scanf`.
3. We calculate `n % 2` which gives us the remainder when `n` is divided by 2. This will give us either 0 or 1.
4. We print the result using `printf`.
5. We return 0 to indicate successful program execution.

This optimized program eliminates the unnecessary operations and simplifies the logic, resulting in improved running time and memory usage.
