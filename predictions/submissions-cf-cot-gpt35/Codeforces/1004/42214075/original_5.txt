The given C/C++ program seems to have a few inefficiencies that can be optimized. Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the `#pragma G++ optimize("-O2")` line. This optimization flag is already enabled by default in most modern compilers, so explicitly adding it may not provide any significant benefit.

2. In the first `for` loop, the loop variable `i` is incremented twice in each iteration (`i++` and `i = i - 1`). Since the value of `i` is not used in the loop, this loop can be simplified to a simple loop that runs for a fixed number of iterations.

3. In the second `for` loop, the loop iterates `n` times and prints `n % 2` in each iteration. However, the value of `n` is not used anywhere else in the loop. We can simplify this loop to a loop that runs for a fixed number of iterations.

4. The `main` function does not have a return type specified (`int`). Adding the return type `int` to the `main` function is a good practice.

With these optimizations in mind, here's the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++)
    ;

  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    printf("%d", i % 2);

  return 0;
}
```
