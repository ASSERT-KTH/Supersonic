Step 1: Remove unnecessary optimization pragma

The pragma `#pragma G++ optimize("-O2")` is not necessary and can be removed.

Step 2: Simplify the first loop

The first loop `for (int i = 1; i <= 1000000000; i++) i++, i = i - 1;` does not have any effect and can be removed.

Step 3: Simplify the second loop

The second loop `for (scanf("%d", &n); n--; printf("%d", n % 2)) ;` can be simplified by removing the unnecessary semicolon at the end.

Step 4: Optimize the second loop

The second loop can be optimized further by removing the unnecessary call to `scanf` and replacing it with a constant value of 0.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n = 0;
  while (n--) {
    printf("%d", n % 2);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
