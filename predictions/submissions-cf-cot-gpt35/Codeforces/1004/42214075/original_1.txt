The given program has a couple of areas that can be optimized for running time and memory usage:

1. The first loop is unnecessary and does not contribute to the final result. It can be removed completely.
2. The second loop can be optimized by using a `while` loop instead of a `for` loop.
3. The `printf` statement inside the loop can be modified to print the result without using the format specifier.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#pragma G++ optimize("-O2")
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    while (n--) {
        putchar('0' + (n % 2));
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:
1. The first loop does not have any effect on the program and can be safely removed.
2. The `for` loop can be replaced with a `while` loop to simplify the code and improve readability.
3. The `printf` statement can be replaced with `putchar` to print each character individually, without the need for format specifiers. This reduces the overhead of formatting and improves performance. The character to be printed is calculated by adding `'0'` to the result of `n % 2`, converting the integer to its corresponding character representation.
