Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary optimization pragma: The `#pragma G++ optimize("-O2")` directive is not necessary as we are optimizing the program manually.

2. Remove unused include: The `cstdio` header is not needed in this program, so we can remove it.

3. Simplify the first loop: The first loop is not needed as it does not have any effect on the program's functionality. We can remove it.

4. Optimize the second loop: The second loop can be optimized by removing the unnecessary `printf` call and modifying the loop condition. Instead of decrementing `n` in each iteration, we can directly calculate the value of `n % 2` and store it in a variable. Then, we can print the value after the loop.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  
  int result = n % 2;
  
  printf("%d", result);
  
  return 0;
}
```
