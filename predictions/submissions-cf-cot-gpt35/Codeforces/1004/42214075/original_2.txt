The given C++ program has two parts. The first part is a loop that runs for a very large number of iterations, but it doesn't have any meaningful computation. The second part reads an integer `n` from input and then prints `n % 2` repeatedly until `n` becomes zero.

To optimize this program, we can remove the unnecessary loop in the first part and make some improvements in the second part.

1. First, let's remove the unnecessary loop in the first part. It doesn't have any meaningful computation, so we can simply remove it.

2. In the second part, instead of repeatedly printing `n % 2` until `n` becomes zero, we can calculate `n % 2` once and then print it repeatedly using a while loop.

3. We can also remove the unnecessary `#pragma` directive at the beginning of the program. It's not needed for the optimization.

Here's the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  
  int remainder = n % 2;
  while (n--) {
    printf("%d", remainder);
  }

  return 0;
}
```
