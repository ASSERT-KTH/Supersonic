First, let's analyze the original program and identify areas for optimization:

1. The first loop is unnecessary and does not affect the output of the program. It can be removed.

2. The second loop iterates `n` times, but it only prints `n % 2` on each iteration. Instead of iterating and printing, we can directly calculate `n % 2` and print it `n` times.

3. The program does not include the necessary header files for the `scanf` and `printf` functions. We should include `<cstdio>` for `printf` and `<iostream>` for `scanf`.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary first loop.

2. Calculate `n % 2` once and store it in a variable.

3. Replace the second loop with a simple `for` loop that prints the value of `n % 2` `n` times.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    int remainder = n % 2;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cout << remainder;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

1. We removed the unnecessary first loop because it does not affect the output of the program.

2. Instead of calculating `n % 2` on each iteration of the loop, we calculate it once and store it in the variable `remainder`.

3. We replaced the second loop with a simpler `for` loop that iterates `n` times and prints the value of `remainder` on each iteration.

By making these modifications, we have optimized the program for both running time and memory usage.
