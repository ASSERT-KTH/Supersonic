To optimize the given program, we can eliminate the need for storing the individual values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. Instead, we can directly calculate the sum of each variable as we read the input.

Here are the step-by-step optimizations:

1. Remove the variables `sum_x`, `sum_y`, and `sum_z` as they are no longer needed.

2. While reading the input, add the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` directly to the sum variables.

3. After reading all the inputs, check if the sum of each variable is zero. If so, output "YES"; otherwise, output "NO".

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  int sum_x = 0, sum_y = 0, sum_z = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x, y, z;
    cin >> x >> y >> z;
    sum_x += x;
    sum_y += y;
    sum_z += z;
  }

  if (sum_x == 0 && sum_y == 0 && sum_z == 0) {
    cout << "YES";
  } else {
    cout << "NO";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

By directly calculating the sum of each variable during input, we avoid the need to store individual values and sum them separately. This reduces memory usage and improves running time.
