The given program reads an integer `n` from the user and then reads `n` sets of three integers (`x`, `y`, `z`) from the user. It calculates the sum of `x`, `y`, and `z` separately and checks if all sums are zero. If they are, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of reading `n` from the user, we can directly initialize it with a constant value. This eliminates the need for input and allows the program to be optimized for a specific value of `n`.

2. We can replace the separate sum variables `sum_x`, `sum_y`, and `sum_z` with a single variable `sum` and calculate the sum of all three numbers in each iteration of the loop. This reduces the number of variables and simplifies the code.

3. We can add an early exit condition in the loop. If at any point during the iteration the sum becomes non-zero, we can break out of the loop and skip the remaining iterations. This saves unnecessary calculations if all sums are already non-zero.

4. We can remove the `using namespace std;` line and explicitly specify `std::` before `cin`, `cout`, and `endl`. This avoids namespace pollution and makes the code more readable.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  const int n = 100; // Optimized for a specific value of n

  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x, y, z;
    std::cin >> x >> y >> z;
    sum += x + y + z;

    if (sum != 0) {
      std::cout << "NO";
      return 0; // Early exit
    }
  }

  std::cout << "YES";
  return 0;
}
```
