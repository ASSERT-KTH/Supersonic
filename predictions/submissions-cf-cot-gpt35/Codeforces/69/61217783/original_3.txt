To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` statement. It is considered a best practice to qualify the standard library types and functions with the `std::` prefix.

2. Instead of using separate variables `sum_x`, `sum_y`, and `sum_z` to store the sums, we can use a single variable `sum` to store the cumulative sum of all `x`, `y`, and `z` values. This will reduce the number of variables and simplify the code.

3. We can eliminate the need for the `if` statement by checking the condition inside the `for` loop. If any of the `x`, `y`, or `z` values are non-zero, we can immediately output "NO" and terminate the loop.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x, y, z;
    std::cin >> x >> y >> z;
    sum += x + y + z;
    if (sum != 0) {
      std::cout << "NO";
      return 0;
    }
  }
  std::cout << "YES";
  return 0;
}
```
