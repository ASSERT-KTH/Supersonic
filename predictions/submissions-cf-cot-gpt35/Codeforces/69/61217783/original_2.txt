Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Instead of using separate variables `sum_x`, `sum_y`, and `sum_z` to store the sums, we can use a single `sum` variable to store the sum of all three values. This will reduce the memory usage.

2. We can eliminate the need for the `if` statement by checking if the sum is equal to zero directly in the `cout` statement. This will reduce the number of conditional branches and potentially improve the running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x, y, z;
    cin >> x >> y >> z;
    sum += x + y + z;
  }
  cout << (sum == 0 ? "YES" : "NO");
  return 0;
}
```
