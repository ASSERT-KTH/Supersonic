The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<math.h>`, which are not required for this program. We can remove these includes.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: It is considered a good practice to avoid using `using namespace std;` as it can introduce naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix when using standard library functions and objects.

3. Use a more efficient prime checking algorithm: The current implementation checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number. This can be improved by checking if the number is divisible by 2 or any odd number up to the square root of the number. If a number is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime. We can modify the `isPrime` function to use this more efficient algorithm.

4. Use a vector instead of an array: The program currently uses an array (`int a[n]`) to store the input numbers. Using a vector instead of an array can provide more flexibility in terms of size and memory management. We can modify the program to use a vector instead of an array.

5. Avoid unnecessary map iteration: The program iterates over the map `m` to find the first number with a frequency of 1 and then iterates over the array `a` to find the position of that number. We can optimize this by maintaining the position of each number in the map itself. We can modify the `solve` function to store the position of each number in the map.

6. Use a range-based for loop: Instead of using an iterator to loop over the map, we can use a range-based for loop to iterate directly over the elements of the map.

7. Avoid unnecessary return statements: The `solve` function has a `return;` statement at the end. Since the function has a `void` return type, this statement is not needed and can be removed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <cmath>

bool isPrime(int n) {
  if (n <= 1)
    return false;
  if (n == 2)
    return true;
  if (n % 2 == 0)
    return false;
  for (int i = 3; i <= sqrt(n); i += 2) {
    if (n % i == 0)
      return false;
  }
  return true;
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> a(n);
  std::map<int, int> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x;
    std::cin >> x;
    a[i] = x;
    m[x] = i + 1;
  }
  for (const auto& pair : m) {
    if (pair.second == 1) {
      std::cout << pair.second << std::endl;
      return;
    }
  }
  std::cout << -1 << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program makes the following modifications:

1. Removed unnecessary includes.
2. Removed the `using namespace std;` statement.
3. Modified the `isPrime` function to use a more efficient algorithm.
4. Changed the array `int a[n]` to `std::vector<int> a(n)`.
5. Modified the `solve` function to store the position of each number in the map.
6. Changed the map iteration to use a range-based for loop.
7. Removed the unnecessary `return;` statement in the `solve` function.
