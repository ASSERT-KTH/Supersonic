Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The first step is to remove unnecessary header files. In this case, `bits/stdc++.h` is not needed as it includes a large number of headers, which can increase compilation time and memory usage. We can remove it.

Step 2: Improve prime checking
The `isPrime` function can be optimized by checking for divisibility up to the square root of `n`. However, we can further improve it by checking for divisibility only up to the square root of `n`, and checking only odd numbers. This will reduce the number of iterations in the loop.

Step 3: Use unordered_map instead of map
The use of `map<int, int>` can be replaced with `unordered_map<int, int>`. `unordered_map` typically has faster average lookup time than `map`.

Step 4: Simplify search for non-repeated element
The search for the non-repeated element can be simplified by using `unordered_map` to keep track of the frequency of each element. Then, we can iterate through the array once and check the frequency directly.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary return statements
The return statements at the end of the `solve` function and the `main` function can be removed as they are not necessary.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

bool isPrime(int n) {
  if (n <= 1)
    return false;

  if (n <= 3)
    return true;

  if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0)
    return false;

  for (int i = 5; i * i <= n; i += 6) {
    if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0)
      return false;
  }

  return true;
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  int a[n];
  unordered_map<int, int> m;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    a[i] = x;
    m[x]++;
  }

  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    if (m[a[j]] == 1) {
      cout << j + 1 << endl;
      return;
    }
  }

  cout << -1 << endl;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }

  return 0;
}
```
