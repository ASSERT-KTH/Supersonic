Step 1: Avoid unnecessary header files

The program includes two unnecessary header files: `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<math.h>`. These header files are not used in the program and should be removed.

Step 2: Avoid unnecessary namespace

The program includes the `using namespace std;` statement, which brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to namespace collisions and is generally considered a bad practice. Instead, we can remove this statement and use the `std::` prefix before the standard library functions and objects.

Step 3: Use a more efficient approach to check for prime numbers

The current implementation of the `isPrime` function checks all numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` to determine if `n` is prime. However, we can optimize this by checking only up to `sqrt(n) / 2`. This is because if `n` is divisible by a number greater than `sqrt(n) / 2`, it must also be divisible by a number smaller than `sqrt(n) / 2`. Additionally, we can check if `n` is divisible by 2 separately and then iterate only over odd numbers in the loop.

Step 4: Optimize the search for the first non-repeating element

The current implementation of the `solve` function uses a nested loop to search for the first non-repeating element in the array `a`. However, this can be optimized by using a single loop and updating a variable `index` whenever a non-repeating element is found. This eliminates the need for nested loops and improves the performance.

Step 5: Avoid unnecessary map iteration

The current implementation of the `solve` function iterates over all the elements in the `m` map to find the first non-repeating element. However, we can avoid this iteration by updating the `index` variable directly while populating the map `m`. Whenever a non-repeating element is encountered, we can update the `index` variable with the current index and break the loop.

Step 6: Optimize the input reading

The current implementation of the `solve` function reads the input array `a` and populates the map `m` in separate loops. However, we can optimize this by reading the input array `a` and populating the map `m` simultaneously in a single loop. This eliminates the need for an additional loop and improves the performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <cmath>

bool isPrime(int n) {
  if (n <= 1)
    return false;
  if (n == 2)
    return true;
  if (n % 2 == 0)
    return false;
  for (int i = 3; i <= sqrt(n) / 2; i += 2) {
    if (n % i == 0)
      return false;
  }
  return true;
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  int a[n];
  std::map<int, int> m;
  int index = -1;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x;
    std::cin >> x;
    a[i] = x;
    m[x]++;
    if (m[x] == 1 && isPrime(x)) {
      if (index == -1)
        index = i;
      else if (a[index] > x)
        index = i;
    }
  }

  if (index == -1)
    std::cout << -1 << std::endl;
  else
    std::cout << index + 1 << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program follows the same logic as the original program but incorporates the mentioned optimizations to improve running time and memory usage.
