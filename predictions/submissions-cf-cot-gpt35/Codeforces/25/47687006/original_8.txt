The given program finds the useless roads in a network of cities. A road is considered useless if it connects two cities that are already connected indirectly through other roads. The program uses the disjoint-set data structure (also known as union-find) to efficiently find and merge sets of connected cities.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of header files, most of which are not needed for this program. We can remove this line and only include the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.
2. Avoid using the `namespace std`: Instead of using `using namespace std;` which brings all names from the `std` namespace into the current scope, we can use the `std::` prefix for specific names from the `std` namespace, such as `std::vector` and `std::pair`.
3. Use `reserve` instead of `resize` for `parent` vector: Since we know the size of the `parent` vector in advance, we can use `reserve` instead of `resize` to pre-allocate memory for the vector. This avoids unnecessary reallocations and improves performance.
4. Avoid unnecessary pairs in `uselessRoads` vector: Instead of storing pairs of integers in the `uselessRoads` vector, we can directly store the indices of the roads that are useless. This reduces memory usage and improves performance.
5. Avoid unnecessary checks in `union_sets` function: The `union_sets` function checks if the two sets being merged are already the same before performing the merge. However, since the function is called only for distinct pairs of roads, this check is unnecessary. We can remove the check and directly perform the merge.
6. Use iterators instead of indices in the second loop: Instead of using an index `i` to iterate over the parent vector in the second loop, we can use iterators. This simplifies the code and improves readability.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> parent;
std::vector<int> uselessRoads;
int n, hb, currURoad;

int find_set(int ii) {
  if (ii == parent[ii])
    return ii;
  return parent[ii] = find_set(parent[ii]);
}

void union_sets(int a, int b) {
  int aa = find_set(a);
  int bb = find_set(b);
  parent[bb] = aa;
  if (aa == bb)
    uselessRoads.push_back(bb);
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);
  std::cout.tie(nullptr);
  std::cin >> n;
  parent.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    parent.push_back(i);
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    int rd1, rd2;
    std::cin >> rd1 >> rd2;
    union_sets(rd1 - 1, rd2 - 1);
  }
  std::cout << uselessRoads.size() << '\n';
  hb = -1;
  for (auto it = parent.begin(); it != parent.end(); ++it) {
    if (*it == std::distance(parent.begin(), it)) {
      if (hb == -1)
        hb = *it;
      else {
        std::cout << uselessRoads[currURoad] + 1 << ' '
                  << uselessRoads[currURoad] + 1 << ' ' << hb + 1 << ' '
                  << *it + 1 << '\n';
        currURoad++;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
