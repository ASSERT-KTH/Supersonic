The given program is finding useless roads in a city network. It uses a disjoint set data structure to keep track of the parent of each node and union two sets if they are not already in the same set.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary. We can remove it.

2. Use a fixed-size array instead of a vector for the parent array: Since the number of nodes is known in advance, we can use a fixed-size array instead of a dynamically resizable vector for the parent array. This will reduce memory usage.

3. Avoid unnecessary pair construction: The program uses a vector of pairs to store the useless roads. Instead of constructing a pair for each road, we can store the roads directly as integers.

4. Avoid unnecessary find_set calls: The program calls the `find_set` function twice in the `union_sets` function. We can avoid the second call by assigning the parent of `b` directly to `aa`, since `aa` is the representative of the set.

5. Avoid unnecessary if-else statement in `union_sets`: The program checks if `aa` is equal to `bb` to decide whether to add the roads to the uselessRoads vector. Instead, we can directly add the roads to the vector and handle the case where `aa` is equal to `bb` later.

6. Avoid unnecessary resizing of the parent array: The program resizes the parent vector to the size of `n`. Instead, we can initialize the parent array with a fixed size of `n`.

7. Avoid unnecessary variable initialization: The variable `hb` is unnecessarily initialized to `-1` before the loop. We can directly initialize it inside the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 1000005;
int parent[MAXN];
vector<int> uselessRoads;
int n, currURoad;

int find_set(int ii) {
  if (ii == parent[ii])
    return ii;
  return parent[ii] = find_set(parent[ii]);
}

void union_sets(int a, int b) {
  int aa = find_set(a);
  parent[b] = aa;
  if (aa != b)
    uselessRoads.push_back(a);
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    parent[i] = i;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    int rd1, rd2;
    cin >> rd1 >> rd2;
    union_sets(rd1 - 1, rd2 - 1);
  }
  cout << uselessRoads.size() << '\n';
  currURoad = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (parent[i] == i) {
      int hb = i;
      cout << uselessRoads[currURoad] + 1 << ' ' << i + 1 << ' ' << hb + 1 << ' ' << i + 1 << '\n';
      currURoad++;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These modifications help optimize the program by reducing memory usage and improving runtime performance.
