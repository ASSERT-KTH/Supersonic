The given program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of an array of integers and performs some operations based on the parity of the elements. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum number of operations required.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which is not necessary. We can include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for frequently used constructs like `ll`, `rep`, `ref`, etc. These macros can be replaced with their actual definitions to improve code readability.

3. Remove unnecessary variables and constants: The program defines the constant `inf` and the array `dp`, but they are not used. We can remove them to reduce memory usage.

4. Optimize the GCD calculation: The program calculates the GCD of the array elements using a recursive function. We can replace it with a more efficient algorithm, such as the Euclidean algorithm, to improve the running time.

5. Optimize the dynamic programming loop: The program initializes the `dp` array with `inf` values and then iterates over it to calculate the minimum number of operations. We can optimize this loop by removing unnecessary checks and simplifying the conditions.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int gcd(int a, int b) {
  while (b != 0) {
    int temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
  }
  return a;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }

  int faust = gcd(a[0], a[1]);
  for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
    faust = gcd(faust, a[i]);
  }

  if (faust > 1) {
    cout << "YES" << endl;
    cout << 0 << endl;
    return 0;
  }

  int dp0 = 0;
  int dp1 = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int next_dp0 = min(dp0, dp1);
    if (a[i] % 2 && a[i + 1] % 2) {
      dp0 = dp1;
      dp1 = next_dp0 + 1;
    } else if (a[i] % 2 && a[i + 1] % 2 == 0) {
      dp0 = dp1;
      dp1 = next_dp0 + 2;
    } else if (a[i] % 2 == 0 && a[i + 1] % 2) {
      dp0 = next_dp0;
      dp1 = next_dp0 + 2;
    } else if (a[i] % 2 == 0 && a[i + 1] % 2 == 0) {
      dp0 = next_dp0;
      dp1 = next_dp0 + 2;
    }
  }

  cout << "YES" << endl;
  cout << dp0 << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The program now includes only the necessary headers (`iostream` and `vector`).

2. Removed unnecessary macros: The program replaces the macros with their actual definitions (`#define ll long long` is removed and `rep` and `ref` are replaced with regular for loops).

3. Removed unnecessary variables and constants: The program removes the unused `inf` constant and the `dp` array.

4. Optimized the GCD calculation: The program replaces the recursive GCD function with the more efficient Euclidean algorithm implemented in the `gcd` function.

5. Optimized the dynamic programming loop: The program simplifies the conditions in the loop and calculates the next `dp0` value outside the if-else statements. This reduces the number of checks and simplifies the code.

With these optimizations, the program should have improved running time and reduced memory usage.
