To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of header files, which can slow down the compilation process. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Avoid unnecessary copying of vectors: The line `B = A;` creates a copy of vector `A` in every iteration of the outer loop. This is unnecessary and can be avoided.

3. Avoid unnecessary string operations: The inner loop performs string operations to rotate the strings and check for equality. Instead, we can use a more efficient approach to find the minimum number of rotations required for each string.

4. Use a more efficient data structure: Instead of using a vector of strings, we can use a vector of integers to represent the strings. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  if (n == 1) {
    cout << 0;
    return 0;
  }
  int ans = 1000001;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int counter = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      int rotations = 0;
      int s = A[i];
      while (A[j] != s) {
        int e = A[j] % 10;
        A[j] /= 10;
        A[j] += e * pow(10, counter);
        counter++;
        rotations++;
        if (rotations > 50) {
          cout << -1;
          return 0;
        }
      }
    }
    ans = min(ans, counter);
  }
  cout << ans;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary header file inclusion: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` has been removed, and only the necessary header files `iostream` and `vector` are included.

2. Avoided unnecessary copying of vectors: The line `B = A;` has been removed. Instead, we directly access the elements of vector `A` in the inner loop.

3. Avoided unnecessary string operations: Instead of using string operations to rotate the strings, we directly manipulate the integer values. We extract the last digit of the integer using the modulo operator `%`, divide the integer by 10 to remove the last digit, and then add the last digit multiplied by the appropriate power of 10 to the integer. This effectively rotates the digits of the integer.

4. Used a more efficient data structure: Instead of using a vector of strings, we now use a vector of integers to represent the strings. This reduces memory usage and improves performance, as integer operations are generally faster than string operations.

Overall, these optimizations reduce the running time and memory usage of the program.
