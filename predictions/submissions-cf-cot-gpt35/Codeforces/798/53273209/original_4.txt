The given program seems to be solving a problem where it rotates strings in a vector until they are equal to a specific string. The goal is to find the minimum number of rotations needed to make all the strings in the vector equal.

To optimize the program, we can eliminate the need for the vector `B` and the nested loop by modifying the logic of the program. 

Here's the optimization step by step:

1. Remove the declaration and initialization of `vector<string> B`.
2. Instead of using `B = A` to copy the vector `A` to `B`, we can directly use `A` in the subsequent loop.
3. Remove the nested loop that iterates over `j` and modifies the strings in `B` until they are equal to `s`. Instead, we can use the `find` function to find the first occurrence of `s` in `A[j]`.
4. If `find` returns `string::npos` (indicating that `s` was not found in `A[j]`), we can output -1 and return early.
5. Count the number of rotations needed to make `A[j]` equal to `s` by subtracting the index of `s` in `A[j]` from the length of `A[j]`. Add this count to `counter`.
6. Update the `ans` variable with the minimum value of `ans` and `counter` after each iteration of the outer loop.

Here's the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  vector<string> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  
  if (n == 1) {
    cout << 0;
    return 0;
  }
  
  int ans = 1000001;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string s = A[i];
    
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      size_t pos = A[j].find(s);
      
      if (pos == string::npos) {
        cout << -1;
        return 0;
      }
      
      int count = A[j].length() - pos;
      counter += count;
    }
    
    ans = min(ans, counter);
    counter = 0;
  }
  
  cout << ans;
}
```

This optimized version avoids unnecessary copying of the vector `A` and eliminates the nested loop, resulting in improved runtime and reduced memory usage.
