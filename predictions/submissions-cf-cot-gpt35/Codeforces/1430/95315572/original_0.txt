The given program solves a problem by iterating through two nested loops and performing some calculations. The goal is to find three numbers `i`, `j`, and `z` such that `3*i + 5*j + 7*z = n`.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not needed. We can remove it.

2. Remove unnecessary defines: The program defines `ll`, `endl`, and `MOD`, but they are not used. We can remove these defines.

3. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are declared but not used. We can remove them.

4. Use more descriptive variable names: The variables `n`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are used, but their purpose is not clear. We can use more descriptive variable names to make the code easier to understand.

5. Optimize the nested loops: The outer loop iterates from 0 to 335, and the inner loop iterates from 0 to 210. However, we only need to iterate up to `n/3` and `n/5` respectively, as `3*i` and `5*j` should not exceed `n`. This optimization will reduce the number of iterations.

6. Simplify the calculation of `z`: Instead of dividing `z = n - p` by 7 and checking if `p + z * 7 == n`, we can directly calculate `z = (n - p) / 7`. This will simplify the code and reduce the number of operations.

7. Use a more efficient flag check: Instead of using `flag == true` and `flag == false`, we can directly check `flag` and use a single `break` statement to exit the loop.

8. Avoid unnecessary input/output stream synchronization: The program calls `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` to disable input/output stream synchronization, but it is not necessary in this case. We can remove these lines.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    bool flag = false;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n/3; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= n/5; j++) {
            int p = 3 * i + 5 * j;
            int z = (n - p) / 7;
            if (p + z * 7 == n && z >= 0) {
                cout << i << " " << j << " " << z << endl;
                flag = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (flag) {
            break;
        }
    }

    if (!flag) {
        cout << -1 << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    int tests;
    cin >> tests;

    while (tests--) {
        solve();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have simplified the code, reduced unnecessary calculations, and improved the efficiency of the program.
