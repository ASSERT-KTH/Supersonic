Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
- The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is not necessary and can be removed.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary defines
- The `#define ll long long`, `#define endl "\n"`, and `#define MOD 1000000007` are not used in the code and can be removed.

Step 3: Optimize the nested loops
- The nested loops can be optimized by using a single loop instead.
- We can iterate over the variable `i` from 0 to `n/3` (inclusive) and calculate the values of `j` and `z` based on the value of `i`.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary variables
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not used in the code and can be removed.

Step 5: Use a flag variable to break out of the loop
- Instead of setting the `flag` variable to `true` and then using a separate `if` statement to break out of the loop, we can break out of the loop directly when the condition is met.

Step 6: Simplify the condition for printing the result
- Instead of checking if `z` is greater than or equal to 0, we can check if `z >= 0` in the loop condition itself.

Step 7: Remove unnecessary input and output optimizations
- The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`, `cin.tie(NULL)`, and `cout.tie(NULL)` statements are not necessary and can be removed.

Step 8: Remove unnecessary test case input
- The `int tests = 1; cin >> tests;` statement is not necessary since the code is designed to run for a single test case.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
    long long n;
    cin >> n;

    bool flag = false;

    for (long long i = 0; i <= n / 3; i++) {
        long long p = 3 * i;
        long long z = n - p;
        z = z / 7;

        if (p + z * 7 == n && z >= 0) {
            cout << i << " " << z << " " << z << endl;
            flag = true;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (!flag)
        cout << -1 << endl;
}

int main() {
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```
