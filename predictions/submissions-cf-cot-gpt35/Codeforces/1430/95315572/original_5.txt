The given program finds a solution to the equation 3*i + 5*j + 7*z = n, where i, j, and z are non-negative integers.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a lot of unnecessary standard library headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for `ll`, `endl`, and `MOD`, but they are not used in the program. We can remove these macro definitions.

3. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are declared but not used in the program. We can remove these variables.

4. Improve loop bounds: The outer loop iterates from 0 to 335 and the inner loop iterates from 0 to 210. However, we can optimize the loop bounds based on the equation. Since 3*i + 5*j + 7*z = n, the maximum value of i can be n/3, the maximum value of j can be n/5, and the maximum value of z can be n/7. We can update the loop bounds accordingly.

5. Remove unnecessary calculations: The program calculates `z = z / 7` in each iteration of the inner loop. However, we can move this calculation outside the loop and calculate it only once.

6. Use a flag to break out of the nested loops: The program currently uses a flag variable to break out of the nested loops when a solution is found. We can improve this by using a return statement to immediately exit the function when a solution is found.

7. Remove unnecessary condition: The condition `if (flag == true)` is not necessary. We can directly check the value of the flag variable in the if statement.

8. Optimize input/output streams: The program uses the `cin` and `cout` streams for input and output. However, these streams are slower compared to the standard input/output streams. We can improve the performance by using `scanf` and `printf` functions for input and output.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void solve() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);

  bool flag = false;
  for (int i = 0; i <= n/3; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= n/5; j++) {
      int p = 3 * i + 5 * j;
      int z = (n - p) / 7;
      if (p + z * 7 == n && z >= 0) {
        printf("%d %d %d\n", i, j, z);
        return;
      }
    }
  }

  printf("-1\n");
}

int main() {
  int tests = 1;
  scanf("%d", &tests);

  while (tests--) {
    solve();
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces unnecessary calculations, improves loop bounds, and uses more efficient input/output functions, resulting in improved running time and memory usage.
