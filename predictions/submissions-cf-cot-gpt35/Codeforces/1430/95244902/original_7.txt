The given program calculates and prints a series of pairs of numbers. The pairs are formed in a specific pattern based on the given input value 'a'. The program repeats this process 't' number of times.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives: The program includes several preprocessor directives that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

2. Remove unused typedefs: The program defines several typedefs that are not used. We can remove them to reduce memory usage.

3. Remove unused variables: The variables 'y' and 'pi' are declared but not used in the program. We can remove them to reduce memory usage.

4. Replace unnecessary calculations: The variable 'o' is assigned the value 1 but is not used in the program. We can remove this assignment.

5. Use a more efficient calculation for 'x': Instead of calculating 'x' using the expression `(a + (a - 1) + 1) / 2`, we can simplify it to `(2*a - 1) / 2`. This eliminates the need for unnecessary additions and subtractions.

6. Optimize the loop: The loop starting from `for (i = a - 2; i >= 1; i--)` can be optimized. Instead of recalculating 'x' in each iteration, we can calculate it once before the loop and update it using `x = (x + i + 1) / 2` inside the loop. This reduces the number of calculations and improves performance.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int a;
    cin >> a;

    cout << 2 << endl;

    int x = (2 * a - 1) / 2;
    cout << a << " " << a - 1 << endl;

    for (int i = a - 2; i >= 1; i--) {
      cout << x << " " << i << endl;
      x = (x + i + 1) / 2;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have simplified the code and improved its performance.
