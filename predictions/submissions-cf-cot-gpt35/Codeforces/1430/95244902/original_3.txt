The given program has a lot of unnecessary code and includes many unnecessary header files. Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the "bits/stdc++.h" header file, which includes all standard library headers. This can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers such as iostream, vector, and algorithm.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program has many unnecessary macros, such as the speed(), file(), rep(), and rep1() macros. These macros are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Remove unused typedefs: The program has many typedefs that are not used in the code, such as vi, mi, pll, vll, and st. These typedefs can be removed.

4. Remove unnecessary functions: The program has unnecessary functions such as power(), print(), gcd(), and lcm(). These functions are not used in the code and can be removed.

5. Simplify the calculation of x: The program calculates the value of x in each iteration of the loop. However, the value of x can be simplified to (a + 1) / 2, as the loop iterates from a - 2 to 1.

6. Remove unnecessary output statements: The program prints "2" before each iteration of the loop. This statement can be moved outside the loop to reduce the number of output statements.

7. Optimize the loop: The program uses a loop to print pairs of numbers. However, we can optimize the loop by using a single cout statement. We can calculate the value of y as (a + (a - 1) + 1) / 2 - i and print the pair (x, y).

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);

  int t;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int a;
    cin >> a;

    cout << 2 << endl;

    int x = (a + 1) / 2;
    int y = (a + (a - 1) + 1) / 2;

    cout << a << " " << a - 1 << endl;

    for (int i = a - 2; i >= 1; i--) {
      cout << x << " " << y << endl;
      y = (x + y + 1) / 2;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program removes unnecessary code and simplifies the calculation of x and y. It also optimizes the loop by using a single cout statement to print the pairs of numbers.
