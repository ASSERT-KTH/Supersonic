The given program is a C++ program that takes an input integer `t` and for each test case, it takes another integer `a`. It then performs some calculations and prints the output.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which includes all standard library files. This can increase the compilation time and memory usage. We can replace it with the necessary header files instead.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. Removing these unnecessary macros can improve readability and reduce memory usage.

3. Replace `endl` with `"\n"`: The `endl` manipulator flushes the output stream, which can decrease performance. We can replace it with `"\n"` to improve the program's efficiency.

4. Simplify the calculation loop: The program uses a loop to perform some calculations. We can simplify this loop by removing unnecessary calculations and reducing the number of iterations.

5. Avoid unnecessary division operations: The program uses division operations to calculate the value of `x`. We can avoid these division operations by modifying the loop logic.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

typedef long long int ll;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);

  ll t, a, i, x;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    cin >> a;
    cout << 2 << "\n";
    x = a;
    cout << a << " " << a - 1 << "\n";

    for (i = a - 2; i >= 1; i--) {
      cout << x << " " << i << "\n";
      x = (x + i) / 2;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:
1. Removed unnecessary header files.
2. Removed unnecessary macros.
3. Replaced `endl` with `"\n"`.
4. Simplified the calculation loop by removing unnecessary calculations.
5. Avoided unnecessary division operations by modifying the loop logic.
