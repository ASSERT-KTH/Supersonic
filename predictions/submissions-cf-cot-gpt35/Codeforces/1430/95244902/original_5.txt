The given program has a number of optimization opportunities. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the optimizations:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard header and includes a large number of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs that are not used in the code. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code.

4. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines several unnecessary functions such as `power`, `print`, `gcd`, and `lcm`. We can remove these functions to simplify the code.

5. Optimize the loop: The program uses a loop to print the values of `x` and `i`. However, the loop can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations. Instead of decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration, we can decrement it by 2. This will reduce the number of iterations by half.

6. Remove unnecessary calculations: The program calculates `x` in each iteration of the loop. However, we can calculate `x` only once before the loop and update its value in each iteration.

7. Simplify the calculation of `x`: The program calculates `x` as `(a + (a - 1) + 1) / 2`. This can be simplified to `(2 * a) / 2`, which is equivalent to `a`.

8. Remove unnecessary variables: The program defines several unnecessary variables such as `y` and `o`. We can remove these variables to simplify the code.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  int t, a;
  cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    cin >> a;
    cout << 2 << endl;
    
    int x = a;
    cout << a << " " << a - 1 << endl;
    
    for (int i = a - 2; i >= 1; i -= 2) {
      cout << x << " " << i << endl;
      x = (x + i + 1) / 2;
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces the number of unnecessary calculations and simplifies the code, leading to improved running time and memory usage.
