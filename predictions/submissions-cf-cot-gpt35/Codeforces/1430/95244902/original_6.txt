The given program calculates and prints a sequence of pairs of numbers. The program takes an input `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes an input `a` and generates a sequence of pairs `(x, y)` where `x = (a + (a - 1) + 1) / 2` and `y` is decremented from `a-1` to `1`. The program then outputs `2` followed by the pairs `(a, a-1)` and `(x, y)`.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header which includes all the standard library headers. This can increase compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. We can remove this header and include only the necessary headers.
2. Remove unused macros: The program includes several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.
3. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables `dx` and `dy` are not used in the program. We can remove these variables to reduce memory usage.
4. Optimize the calculation of `x`: The calculation of `x` can be optimized by simplifying the expression `(a + (a - 1) + 1) / 2` to `(2 * a) / 2`, which is equivalent.
5. Optimize the loop: The loop that generates the pairs `(x, y)` can be optimized by using a single loop instead of a loop and a decrementing loop. We can start the loop from `a-1` and decrement `x` within the loop. This eliminates the need for the `i` variable and reduces the number of iterations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);

  int t;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int a;
    cin >> a;

    int x = (2 * a) / 2;
    cout << 2 << endl;
    cout << a << " " << a - 1 << endl;

    for (int y = a - 2; y >= 1; y--) {
      cout << x << " " << y << endl;
      x = (x + y) / 2;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary headers, macros, and variables. It simplifies the calculation of `x` and optimizes the loop that generates the pairs `(x, y)`.
