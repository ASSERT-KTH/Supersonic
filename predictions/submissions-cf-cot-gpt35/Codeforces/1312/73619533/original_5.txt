The given program is a C++ program that solves a dynamic programming problem using a segment tree data structure. The program builds a segment tree to efficiently perform range updates and queries on a given array. It then performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a tree structure and updates the segment tree based on certain conditions.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. We can remove these header files as they are not used in the program.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several unnecessary typedefs, such as `ll`, `pp`, and `ordered_set`. We can remove these typedefs as they are not used in the program.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several unnecessary macros, such as `ld`, `fi`, `se`, `pb`, `all`, `rep`, `sz`, `hell`, and `slld`. We can remove these macros as they are not used in the program.

4. Remove unnecessary global variables: The program defines several unnecessary global variables, such as `t`, `nn`, `maxn`, `N`, `nax`, and `inf`. We can remove these global variables as they are not used in the program.

5. Remove unnecessary vector initialization: The program initializes several unnecessary vectors, such as `good`, `seta`, and `dp`, with default values. We can remove these vector initializations as they are not used in the program.

6. Remove unnecessary function parameters and local variables: The program defines several unnecessary function parameters and local variables, such as `node`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `val`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `c`, and `k`. We can remove these function parameters and local variables as they are not used in the program.

7. Optimize the `build` function: The `build` function builds the segment tree recursively. We can optimize this function by using a loop instead of recursion. This will reduce the function call overhead and improve performance.

8. Optimize the `assign` function: The `assign` function updates a single element in the segment tree. We can optimize this function by removing the unnecessary `lazify` function call and simplifying the conditional statements. This will reduce the number of operations and improve performance.

9. Optimize the `updateRange` function: The `updateRange` function updates a range of elements in the segment tree. We can optimize this function by removing the unnecessary `lazify` function call and simplifying the conditional statements. This will reduce the number of operations and improve performance.

10. Optimize the `query` function: The `query` function queries a range of elements in the segment tree. We can optimize this function by removing the unnecessary `lazify` function call and simplifying the conditional statements. This will reduce the number of operations and improve performance.

11. Optimize the `dfs` function: The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search on a tree structure and updates the segment tree based on certain conditions. We can optimize this function by removing the unnecessary `lazify` function call and simplifying the conditional statements. This will reduce the number of operations and improve performance.

12. Optimize the `solve` function: The `solve` function reads input, initializes variables, and calls the `dfs` function. We can optimize this function by removing the unnecessary `memset` function call and simplifying the conditional statements. This will reduce the number of operations and improve performance.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:
