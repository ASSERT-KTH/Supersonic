The given program can be optimized in several ways:

1. Remove unnecessary header includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended and can slow down the compilation process. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using macros: The program defines several macros (`co`, `ci`, `sf1`, `sf2`, `sf3`, `en`, `coy`, `con`, `For`) that may make the code harder to read and maintain. It is better to avoid using macros and write code using regular function calls and statements.

3. Remove unused variables and unnecessary initializations: The variables `m`, `q`, `r`, and `s` are declared but not used in the program. Also, the variable `fl` is initialized to `1` but it is immediately overwritten with a different value. We can remove these unnecessary variables and initializations.

4. Optimize the loop iterations: The loop `for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)` can be optimized by starting the loop from `0` and checking `i < n` instead of `i <= n`.

5. Use `scanf` instead of `cin` for faster input: The program uses `cin` for input, which can be slower compared to `scanf`. We can replace the input statements with `scanf` for faster input.

6. Avoid unnecessary division operations: The program performs division by `k` in each iteration of the inner loop. We can optimize this by using a temporary variable to store the result of the division and avoid repeated division operations.

7. Avoid unnecessary clearing of the map: The program calls `mp.clear()` at the end of each iteration of the outer loop. Since the map is re-initialized at the beginning of each iteration, we can remove this unnecessary clearing operation.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    scanf("%d", &t);
    while (t--) {
        int n, k;
        scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);

        int a[35];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            scanf("%d", &a[i]);
        }

        map<int, int> mp;
        bool fl = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int p = a[i];
            int j = 0;
            while (p) {
                int rem = p % k;
                if (rem > 1) {
                    fl = false;
                    break;
                }
                if (rem == 1) {
                    if (mp[j] == 1) {
                        fl = false;
                        break;
                    }
                    mp[j] = 1;
                }
                j++;
                p /= k;
            }
            if (!fl) {
                break;
            }
        }

        if (fl) {
            cout << "YES" << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "NO" << endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program improves the running time and memory usage by removing unnecessary operations and using more efficient input/output methods.
