The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file which includes all standard library headers. However, it is not recommended to include this header file as it increases compilation time. We can remove this line and include only the required headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used or can be replaced with their actual code. For example, the `co`, `ci`, `en`, `coy`, `con` macros can be removed and replaced with `cout`, `cin`, `endl`, `"YES"`, `"NO"` respectively.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines `ll` and `i64` as typedefs for `long long int`. These typedefs are not used and can be removed.

4. Use `scanf` instead of `cin` for input: The program uses `cin` to read input, but `cin` is slower than `scanf`. We can replace `cin` with `scanf` for better performance.

5. Optimize the loop iterations: The program uses a loop to iterate over the values of `i` from 1 to `n`. However, the loop can be optimized to iterate from 0 to `n-1` instead.

6. Replace division with right shift: The program uses division operator (`/`) to divide `p` by `k`. Since `k` is a power of 2, we can replace the division with a right shift (`>>`) operation for better performance.

7. Remove unnecessary clearing of map: The program clears the `mp` map at the end of each test case. However, this is not necessary as the map is re-initialized at the beginning of each test case.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    scanf("%d", &t);
    while (t--) {
        int n, k;
        scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);

        int a[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            scanf("%d", &a[i]);
        }

        map<int, int> mp;
        bool fl = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int p = a[i];
            int j = 0;
            while (p) {
                if (p % k > 1) {
                    fl = false;
                    break;
                }
                if (p % k == 1) {
                    if (mp[j] == 1) {
                        fl = false;
                        break;
                    }
                    mp[j] = 1;
                }
                j++;
                p >>= 1;
            }
            if (!fl) {
                break;
            }
        }

        if (fl) {
            cout << "YES" << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "NO" << endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
