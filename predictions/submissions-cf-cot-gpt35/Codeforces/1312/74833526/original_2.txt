The given program has several areas for optimization:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not standard and includes a lot of unnecessary headers. Only include the necessary headers such as `<iostream>` and `<map>`.

2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor macros: The program defines several unnecessary preprocessor macros, such as `sf1`, `sf2`, `sf3`, `co`, `ci`, `en`, `coy`, `con`, and `For`. These macros are not used in the program and can be safely removed.

3. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `cin` and `cout`: The program uses `cin` and `cout` without the `std::` prefix, which can lead to naming conflicts. Replace `cin` with `std::cin` and `cout` with `std::cout`.

4. Avoid using `using namespace std`: Instead of using the entire `std` namespace, it is better to use individual names from the `std` namespace to avoid potential naming conflicts.

5. Optimize the loop for checking if `p % k` is greater than 1: The program checks if `p % k > 1` in a loop. However, since `p` is divided by `k` in each iteration, the program can exit the loop as soon as `p % k > 1` is true. This can be achieved by using a `break` statement.

6. Use `std::vector` instead of a fixed-size array: The program uses a fixed-size array `a` to store the input numbers. However, using a `std::vector` would allow for dynamic resizing and eliminate the need to specify a fixed size.

7. Avoid unnecessary clearing of the map: The program clears the `mp` map after each test case, but this is unnecessary since the map is reinitialized in each iteration of the while loop.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int n, k;
    std::cin >> n >> k;

    std::vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> a[i];
    }

    std::map<int, int> mp;
    bool fl = true;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int p = a[i];
      int j = 0;

      while (p) {
        if (p % k > 1) {
          fl = false;
          break;
        }
        if (p % k == 1) {
          if (mp[j] == 1) {
            fl = false;
            break;
          }
          mp[j] = 1;
        }
        j++;
        p /= k;
      }

      if (!fl) {
        break;
      }
    }

    if (fl) {
      std::cout << "YES\n";
    } else {
      std::cout << "NO\n";
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program eliminates unnecessary preprocessor macros and includes, uses `std::cin` and `std::cout`, replaces the fixed-size array with a `std::vector`, and removes the unnecessary clearing of the map. Additionally, it uses a `bool` variable `fl` instead of `ll` type for efficiency.
