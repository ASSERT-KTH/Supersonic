Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files and using directives.

The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file includes a lot of unnecessary standard library headers, which can increase the compilation time. We can replace it with the necessary headers.

The `using namespace std;` directive pollutes the global namespace with all the names from the `std` namespace. It is generally considered a bad practice. We can remove it and use the `std::` prefix where necessary.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macro definitions.

The program uses several macro definitions that are not necessary and can be replaced with their corresponding code.

The `co` and `ci` macros are used for `cout` and `cin` respectively. We can directly use `std::cout` and `std::cin` instead.

The `sf1`, `sf2`, and `sf3` macros are used for reading input. We can replace them with direct `std::cin` statements.

The `en` macro is used to print a new line. We can replace it with `std::cout << std::endl;`.

The `coy` and `con` macros are used to print "YES" and "NO" respectively. We can replace them with `std::cout << "YES" << std::endl;` and `std::cout << "NO" << std::endl;`.

The `For` macro is used for a loop. We can replace it with a regular `for` loop.

The `br` macro is used to break out of a loop. We can replace it with a regular `break;` statement.

Step 3: Replace unnecessary `map` with a simple array.

The program uses a `std::map` to keep track of the presence of certain values. Since the values are non-negative integers, we can replace the `std::map` with a simple array of boolean values.

Step 4: Optimize the inner loop.

The inner loop checks if the remainder of `p` divided by `k` is greater than 1. If it is, the program sets `fl` to 0 and breaks out of the loop. However, we can optimize this by checking if `p` is odd (i.e., `p % 2 == 1`) before entering the loop. This way, we only need to check the remainder once instead of twice.

Step 5: Optimize the outer loop.

The outer loop initializes `fl` to 1 for each test case. However, we can optimize this by initializing `fl` to 1 outside the loop and only setting it to 0 if necessary. This way, we only need to set `fl` to 1 once instead of for each test case.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define ll long long

std::vector<bool> mp(35);
std::vector<ll> a(35);

int main() {
  ll t;
  std::cin >> t;
  
  ll fl = 1;
  while (t--) {
    mp.assign(35, false);
    
    ll n, k;
    std::cin >> n >> k;
    
    for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      std::cin >> a[i];
    }
    
    for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      ll p = a[i];
      if (p % 2 == 1) {
        fl = 0;
        break;
      }
      ll j = 0;
      while (p) {
        if (p % k > 1) {
          fl = 0;
          break;
        }
        if (p % k == 1) {
          if (mp[j]) {
            fl = 0;
            break;
          }
          mp[j] = true;
        }
        j++;
        p /= k;
      }
      if (fl == 0) {
        break;
      }
    }
    
    if (fl == 1) {
      std::cout << "YES" << std::endl;
    } else {
      std::cout << "NO" << std::endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. Removed unnecessary header files and using directives.
2. Replaced unnecessary macro definitions with their corresponding code.
3. Replaced `std::map` with `std::vector<bool>` to optimize memory usage.
4. Optimized the inner loop by checking if `p` is odd before entering the loop.
5. Optimized the outer loop by initializing `fl` to 1 outside the loop and only setting it to 0 if necessary.
