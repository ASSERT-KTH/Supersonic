To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements:
   - The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not a standard C++ header file. It includes all the standard library header files and some non-standard ones. Instead, we can include only the necessary header files for this program, which are `<iostream>` and `<map>`.
   
2. Remove unnecessary macro definitions:
   - The program defines macros for input/output operations (`co`, `ci`, `sf1`, `sf2`, `sf3`, `en`, `coy`, `con`) which are not used in the program. We can remove them.
   
3. Remove unnecessary typedefs:
   - The program typedefs `ll` and `i64` as `long long int`, but these typedefs are not used. We can remove them.
   
4. Remove unnecessary using statements:
   - The program has a using statement for the `std` namespace, but it is not used. We can remove it.
   
5. Optimize the loop variables:
   - The program uses the loop variable `i` twice, once in the outer loop and once in the inner loop. We can remove the second declaration of `i` and use the existing one.
   
6. Optimize the loop conditions:
   - The loop condition `i <= n` is used twice, once in each loop. We can change it to `i < n` since the loop variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n` (inclusive).
   
7. Optimize the map operations:
   - The program uses a `map` to keep track of the powers of `k`. However, we only need to check if a power of `k` has been seen before or not. We don't need to store the actual power in the map. We can change the map type to `set` and store the powers directly.
   
8. Remove unnecessary map clear operation:
   - The program clears the map at the end of each test case. However, since we are using a set instead of a map, we don't need to clear the set explicitly. We can remove the `mp.clear()` statement.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k;
    std::cin >> n >> k;
    int a[35];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> a[i];
    }
    std::set<int> mp;
    bool fl = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int p = a[i];
      int j = 0;
      while (p) {
        if (p % k > 1) {
          fl = false;
          break;
        }
        if (p % k == 1) {
          if (mp.count(j) == 1) {
            fl = false;
            break;
          }
          mp.insert(j);
        }
        j++;
        p = p / k;
      }
      if (!fl) {
        break;
      }
    }
    if (fl) {
      std::cout << "YES" << std::endl;
    } else {
      std::cout << "NO" << std::endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
