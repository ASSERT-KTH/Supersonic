The given program is a solution to a problem that involves finding a pair of numbers `(sum, mul)` such that `sum` is divisible by `d` and `mul` is the remainder when `mul` is divided by `d`. The program uses a BFS algorithm to find this pair of numbers.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a large number of other header files. Since we are not using all of these header files, we can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program includes several macros such as `SPEED`, `READ`, `WRITE`, etc. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Replace `push_back` with `emplace_back`: The program uses `push_back` to add elements to a vector. The `emplace_back` function can be used instead, which constructs the element in-place, avoiding unnecessary copies or moves.

4. Remove unused variables: The program includes several unused variables such as `mx`, `lnd`, `rnd`, `cnd`, etc. These variables can be removed.

5. Remove unnecessary `typedef`: The program includes `typedef` for `ll` and `lln`, but these types are not used in the program. We can remove these `typedef` statements.

6. Remove unnecessary function: The program includes a `gcd` function, but it is not used in the program. We can remove this function.

7. Replace `queue` with `deque`: The program uses a `queue` to implement BFS. By using a `deque` instead of a `queue`, we can improve the performance of the program.

8. Optimize loop iteration: The program uses a loop from `f` to `10`, where `f` is initially set to `1`. We can optimize this loop by starting `f` from `0` and using a `break` statement to exit the loop when `f` becomes `1`.

9. Remove redundant condition: The program checks if `sum >= 0` before adding it to the queue. Since `sum` is always non-negative, this condition is redundant and can be removed.

10. Optimize print function: The program uses a recursive function to print the numbers. We can optimize this function by using a loop instead of recursion.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

struct pii {
  int ff, sn;
};

vector<vector<int>> vis(6000, vector<int>(600));
vector<vector<pii>> dp(6000, vector<pii>(600));

int s, d;

int bfs() {
  deque<pii> q;
  q.emplace_back(s, 0);
  vis[s][0] = 1;
  pii p;
  int f = 1, mul, sum;
  while (!q.empty()) {
    p = q.front();
    q.pop_front();
    for (int i = f; i < 10; i++) {
      sum = p.ff;
      sum -= i;
      mul = p.sn;
      mul *= 10;
      mul += i;
      mul %= d;
      if (sum == 0 && mul == 0) {
        dp[sum][mul] = make_pair(p.ff, p.sn);
        return 1;
      }
      if (!vis[sum][mul]) {
        vis[sum][mul] = 1;
        q.emplace_back(sum, mul);
        dp[sum][mul] = make_pair(p.ff, p.sn);
      }
    }
    f = 0;
  }
  return 0;
}

void print(int sum, int mul) {
  while (sum != s || mul != 0) {
    cout << dp[sum][mul].ff - sum;
    int temp_sum = dp[sum][mul].ff;
    int temp_mul = dp[sum][mul].sn;
    sum = temp_sum;
    mul = temp_mul;
  }
}

int main() {
  cin >> d >> s;
  if (bfs() == 1) {
    print(0, 0);
  } else {
    cout << -1 << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
