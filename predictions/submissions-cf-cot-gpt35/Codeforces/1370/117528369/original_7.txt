Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a large number of standard C++ headers. This can increase compilation time and memory usage. We can remove this header and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to reduce the size of the code.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary using directive

The program includes a `using namespace std;` directive, which brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to potential naming conflicts. We can remove this directive and use the `std::` prefix for the necessary names.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary variable declarations

The program declares an unused variable `Y` and `N`. We can remove these declarations to reduce memory usage.

Step 5: Avoid unnecessary calculations

The program calculates the least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers using the `lcm` macro. However, this calculation is not needed in the code. We can remove the `lcm` macro and the unused `mod` constant.

Step 6: Avoid unnecessary else statement

The program has an unnecessary else statement inside the for loop. Since the if condition contains a break statement, the else statement will never be executed. We can remove the else statement to simplify the code.

Step 7: Avoid unnecessary continue statement

The program has an unnecessary continue statement inside the for loop. Since there are no statements after the continue statement, we can remove it to simplify the code.

Step 8: Optimize the loop

The program uses a linear loop to find the largest integer `i` such that `i * 2 <= n`. However, we can optimize this loop by directly calculating `i` using integer division (`n / 2`) without the need for a loop. This will greatly improve the running time of the program.

Step 9: Optimize memory usage

The program declares the variable `ans` inside the while loop. However, `ans` is only used within the loop and its value is not needed outside the loop. We can move the declaration of `ans` inside the loop to reduce memory usage.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    int ans = n / 2;
    std::cout << ans << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```
