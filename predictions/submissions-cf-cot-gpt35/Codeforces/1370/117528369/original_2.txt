Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
The program includes the header `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard C++ header. We can remove it since it is not required.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary preprocessor macros
The program defines several preprocessor macros that are not used in the code. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary using namespace statement
The program has a `using namespace std;` statement, which is considered a bad practice. We can remove it and use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary variable declarations
The program declares `ld`, `pll`, `vi`, and `mii` types, but they are not used in the code. We can remove these declarations to reduce memory usage.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary function definitions
The program defines `lcm` and `gcd` functions, but they are not used in the code. We can remove these definitions to reduce memory usage.

Step 6: Remove unnecessary input/output synchronization
The program uses `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`, which is not necessary since the program does not mix C and C++ input/output functions. We can remove this line to improve runtime performance.

Step 7: Remove unnecessary else statement
The `else` statement in the `for` loop is not needed since the `continue` statement will not be executed if the `if` condition is true. We can remove the `else` statement to simplify the code.

Step 8: Initialize the `ans` variable
The `ans` variable is not initialized, which can cause undefined behavior if the `if` condition is not satisfied. We should initialize `ans` to a default value to avoid this issue.

Step 9: Avoid unnecessary multiplication
The `num` variable is calculated as `i * 2`, but we can simplify it by using `i << 1`, which is a bitwise left shift operation equivalent to multiplying `i` by 2.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, ans = -1;
    std::cin >> n;
    for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
      int num = i << 1;
      if (num <= n) {
        ans = i;
        break;
      }
    }
    std::cout << ans << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
