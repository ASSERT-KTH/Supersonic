To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended in production code. We can remove this line and include only the required headers.

2. Remove the unnecessary macro definitions: The program defines several macros which are not used in the code. We can remove these macro definitions to simplify the code.

3. Remove the unnecessary using namespace std: The program uses the `using namespace std` directive, which is not recommended in production code. We can remove this line and use the `std::` prefix where necessary.

4. Remove the unnecessary variable initialization: The variable `ans` is declared without initialization. We can remove this line and initialize `ans` when it is needed.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates `i * 2` in each iteration of the loop. Since `i` is decreasing by 1 in each iteration, we can simply use `i` instead of `i * 2`.

6. Avoid unnecessary if-else statement: The program uses an if-else statement to check if `num` is less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is decreasing by 1 in each iteration, we can directly check if `i` is less than or equal to `n/2`.

7. Avoid unnecessary continue statement: The program uses a continue statement in the else block, which is not needed. We can remove this line to simplify the code.

8. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment: The program uses post-increment (`i++`) in the for loop. Since we are not using the value of `i` after the increment, we can use pre-increment (`++i`) which is slightly faster.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; --i) {
      if (i <= n/2) {
        ans = i;
        break;
      }
    }
    std::cout << ans << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- We removed unnecessary includes, macro definitions, and using namespace directive for simplicity.
- We removed the unnecessary variable initialization for `ans`.
- We simplified the calculations by using `i` instead of `i * 2`.
- We directly checked if `i` is less than or equal to `n/2` instead of using `num`.
- We removed the unnecessary `continue` statement in the else block.
- We used pre-increment (`++i`) instead of post-increment (`i++`) for slightly better performance.
