Optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is a non-standard header file and includes a large number of other header files. Since the program does not use all of the included header files, it is better to include only the necessary header files to reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives: The program uses preprocessor directives such as `readFast` and `LOCAL`, but they are not used in the program. It is better to remove these unused directives to reduce the program size and improve readability.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros such as `fin`, `ll`, `sz`, `all`, `output`, and `LSB`, but they are not used in the program. It is better to remove these unused macros to reduce the program size and improve readability.

4. Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`: The program uses `map` to store the occurrences of integers, but it does not require the elements to be sorted. By using `unordered_map` instead of `map`, we can improve the performance of inserting and accessing elements.

5. Use vectors instead of sets: The program uses `unordered_set` to store the unique integers, but it does not require the elements to be sorted or unique. By using a vector instead of a set, we can improve the performance of inserting and accessing elements.

6. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates `min(a[x] / 2 * 2, l - r)` multiple times in the loop. We can calculate it once and store the result in a variable to avoid redundant calculations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int N = 2e5 + 15;

int main() {
  ifstream fin("date.in.txt");
  int t;
  fin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, l, r, aux;
    fin >> n >> l >> r;
    unordered_map<int, int> a;
    unordered_map<int, int> b;
    vector<int> color;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      fin >> aux;
      if (i <= l) {
        ++a[aux];
      } else {
        ++b[aux];
      }
      if (a[aux] == 1) {
        color.push_back(aux);
      }
    }
    for (int x : color) {
      int elim = min(a[x], b[x]);
      a[x] -= elim;
      l -= elim;
      b[x] -= elim;
      r -= elim;
    }
    if (l < r) {
      swap(l, r);
      swap(a, b);
    }
    int ans = 0;
    int change = 0;
    for (int x : color) {
      change = min(a[x] / 2 * 2, l - r);
      ans += change / 2;
      l -= change;
    }
    ans += (l - r) / 2 + (l + r) / 2;
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: I have removed the `read()` function and replaced it with directly opening the input file using `ifstream`. If you prefer to keep the `read()` function, you can modify the code accordingly.
