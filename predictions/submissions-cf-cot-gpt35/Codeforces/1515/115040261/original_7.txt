Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can be replaced with specific headers that are actually needed.

2. Remove unused macros: The `fin` macro is defined but not used in the program, so it can be removed.

3. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The `sz(x)` macro is defined to get the size of a container, but it is not used in the program. It can be removed.

4. Avoid unnecessary container initialization: The `map<int, int> a` and `map<int, int> b` containers are initialized before each test case, but they are cleared at the end of each test case. Instead of initializing them before each test case, we can clear them at the beginning of each test case to avoid unnecessary initialization.

5. Avoid unnecessary container operations: The `color` container is used to store the unique colors in the input, but it is cleared at the end of each test case. Since it is only used within the current test case, we can move its declaration inside the while loop and clear it at the beginning of each test case to avoid unnecessary container operations.

6. Avoid unnecessary swapping: After counting the occurrences of each color, the program checks if `l < r` and swaps the values of `l` and `r` and the maps `a` and `b` if true. However, this swapping is unnecessary because it doesn't affect the final result. We can remove this swapping step.

7. Avoid unnecessary divisions: In the second loop, the program calculates `change` as `min(a[x] / 2 * 2, l - r)`. Since `a[x]` is an integer, `a[x] / 2 * 2` is equivalent to `a[x]`. We can simplify this calculation to `min(a[x], l - r)` to avoid unnecessary divisions and multiplications.

8. Avoid unnecessary additions: In the second loop, the program calculates `ans` as `ans += change / 2`. Since `change` is already divided by 2, we can simplify this calculation to `ans += change` to avoid unnecessary additions.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

const int N = 2e5 + 15;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    ifstream fin("date.in.txt");
    int t;
    fin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n, l, r, aux;
        fin >> n >> l >> r;
        unordered_map<int, int> a, b;
        unordered_set<int> color;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            fin >> aux;
            if (i <= l) {
                ++a[aux];
            } else {
                ++b[aux];
            }
            color.insert(aux);
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (int x : color) {
            int change = min(a[x], l - r);
            ans += change;
            l -= change;
        }
        ans += (l - r) + (l + r);
        cout << ans << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The unnecessary headers, macros, and function calls have been removed.

2. The containers `a`, `b`, and `color` are now cleared at the beginning of each test case.

3. The `color` container is now declared and cleared inside the while loop.

4. The unnecessary swapping step has been removed.

5. The unnecessary divisions and additions have been simplified.
