The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header file and includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<map>`, `<unordered_set>`, and `<fstream>`.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros (`readFast`, `fin`, `ll`, `sz`, `all`, `output`, `LSB`) that are not used in the program. We can remove these macros to improve readability.

3. Avoid unnecessary map and set operations: The program uses two maps (`a` and `b`) and one unordered set (`color`) to store data. However, these data structures are not necessary. We can use arrays to store the frequencies of elements and avoid using the map and set operations.

4. Optimize the loop: The program uses a loop to iterate over the elements in the color set. However, we can optimize this loop by using an array of colors instead of a set, and iterate over the array instead of the set.

5. Simplify the calculations: The program performs several calculations to update the frequencies and counts. We can simplify these calculations by combining multiple operations into a single line.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

const int N = 2e5 + 15;

int t;
int n, l, r, aux;
int a[N], b[N], color[N];

int main() {
  ifstream fin("date.in.txt");
  fin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    fin >> n >> l >> r;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      fin >> aux;
      if (i <= l) {
        ++a[aux];
      } else {
        ++b[aux];
      }
      color[aux] = 1;
    }
    int ans = 0;
    for (int x = 0; x < N; ++x) {
      if (!color[x]) continue;
      int elim = min(a[x], b[x]);
      a[x] -= elim;
      l -= elim;
      b[x] -= elim;
      r -= elim;
      int change = min(a[x] / 2 * 2, l - r);
      ans += change / 2;
      l -= change;
    }
    ans += (l - r) / 2 + (l + r) / 2;
    cout << ans << '\n';
    fill(a, a + N, 0);
    fill(b, b + N, 0);
    fill(color, color + N, 0);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
