Step 1: Eliminate unnecessary includes and macros.

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of header files, which can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage. We should only include the necessary header files for our program.

The `readFast` macro is not needed and can be removed.

The `fin` macro is not used and can be removed.

The `sz` macro is not used and can be removed.

The `all` macro is not used and can be removed.

The `output` macro can be modified to use a more concise syntax.

The `LSB` macro is not used and can be removed.

Step 2: Use standard input/output streams instead of file streams.

The `read()` macro is not needed and can be removed. We can use `cin` and `cout` directly.

Step 3: Optimize the use of maps and unordered sets.

The maps `a` and `b` and the unordered set `color` can be declared inside the `while` loop instead of outside. This way, they will be automatically cleared at the beginning of each iteration.

Step 4: Optimize the iteration over the color set.

Instead of iterating over the color set using a range-based for loop, we can use iterators to improve performance.

Step 5: Optimize the counting of colors.

Instead of using `++a[aux]` and `++b[aux]` to count the colors, we can use the `insert` function of the maps to avoid unnecessary lookups.

Step 6: Optimize the calculation of the answer.

Instead of calculating `ans` in two separate loops, we can calculate it in a single loop by keeping track of the difference between `l` and `r` and the number of available colors.

Step 7: Remove unnecessary clearing of maps and sets.

Since the maps and sets are declared inside the `while` loop, they will be automatically cleared at the beginning of each iteration. We don't need to manually clear them.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

const int N = 2e5 + 15;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int t;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int n, l, r, aux;
    unordered_map<int, int> a;
    unordered_map<int, int> b;
    unordered_set<int> color;

    cin >> n >> l >> r;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      cin >> aux;
      if (i <= l) {
        a.insert({aux, a[aux] + 1});
      } else {
        b.insert({aux, b[aux] + 1});
      }
      color.insert(aux);
    }

    int ans = 0;
    int diff = l - r;
    int numColors = color.size();

    for (auto it = color.begin(); it != color.end(); ++it) {
      int x = *it;
      int elim = min(a[x], b[x]);
      a[x] -= elim;
      b[x] -= elim;
      diff -= elim;
      numColors -= (a[x] == 0 && b[x] == 0);

      int change = min(a[x] / 2 * 2, diff);
      ans += change / 2;
      diff -= change;
    }

    ans += diff / 2 + (l + r) / 2;
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
