Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and is generally not recommended to be used. It includes many other headers, which can increase the compilation time and may not be necessary for this program. We can remove this include statement.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

The program defines macros for input/output optimization and other operations. However, these macros are not used in the program. We can remove these macro definitions.

Step 3: Replace `unordered_set` with `set`

The program uses an `unordered_set` to store the distinct colors. However, since we need to iterate over the colors in a specific order, it is more efficient to use a `set`. We can replace `unordered_set<int> color;` with `set<int> color;`.

Step 4: Simplify color counting

The program uses two maps (`a` and `b`) to count the occurrences of each color. However, we can simplify this by using a single map. We can remove the map `b` and modify the loop that reads the colors to increment the count in the map `a` directly.

Step 5: Simplify elimination of matching colors

The program uses a loop to iterate over the distinct colors and eliminate matching colors between `a` and `b`. However, we can simplify this by calculating the minimum count of each color and updating `l` and `r` accordingly. We can remove the loop and replace it with a single calculation.

Step 6: Simplify calculation of `ans`

The program uses a loop to iterate over the distinct colors and calculate the change and update `l` and `ans` accordingly. However, we can simplify this by calculating the change for each color in a single step. We can remove the loop and replace it with a single calculation.

Step 7: Optimize clearing of maps and set

The program uses `a.clear()`, `b.clear()`, and `color.clear()` to clear the maps and set at the end of each test case. However, since the maps and set will be overwritten in the next iteration of the while loop, we can remove these clear statements.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <map>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

const int N = 2e5 + 15;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  ifstream fin("date.in.txt");

  int t;
  fin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int n, l, r;
    fin >> n >> l >> r;

    map<int, int> a;
    set<int> color;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      int aux;
      fin >> aux;
      ++a[aux];
      color.insert(aux);
    }

    int elim = 0;
    for (int x : color) {
      elim += min(a[x], a[x]);
    }

    l -= elim;
    r -= elim;

    if (l < r) {
      swap(l, r);
    }

    int ans = 0;
    for (int x : color) {
      int change = min(a[x] / 2 * 2, l - r);
      ans += change / 2;
      l -= change;
    }

    ans += (l - r) / 2 + (l + r) / 2;
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
