Step 1: Avoid using the `pow()` function

The `pow()` function is not efficient for calculating powers of 10. Instead, we can simply assign the value directly to `a[n]`. This will save us unnecessary computation time.

Step 2: Avoid using the `sort()` function

Sorting the entire array is not necessary for finding the maximum count. We can optimize this step by keeping track of the maximum count while iterating through the array.

Step 3: Avoid using unnecessary variables

The variable `last` is not necessary. We can use `i-1` instead to keep track of the last index.

Step 4: Avoid using unnecessary includes

The `algorithm` and `vector` libraries are not being used in the code. We can remove the corresponding include statements.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>
using namespace std;
using ull = unsigned long long;

int main() {
  ull n;
  cin >> n;
  ull a[n];
  for (ull i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  a[n] = 1000000000 + 10;

  ull max_count = 1;
  for (ull i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    if (a[i] - a[i-1] > 5) {
      max_count = max(max_count, i);
    }
  }
  cout << max_count << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
