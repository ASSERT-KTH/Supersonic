The given program can be optimized by using a sliding window approach instead of sorting the array. Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the unnecessary headers `<algorithm>` and `<math.h>`.
2. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;`.
3. Replace the `ull` data type with `unsigned int` as it is sufficient for the given problem constraints.
4. Read the input value of `n`.
5. Initialize a variable `max_count` to 1 and `last` to 0.
6. Create a vector `a` of size `n` and read `n` integers into it.
7. Add `INT_MAX` (from `<climits>`) to the end of the vector `a`.
8. Iterate over the vector `a` from index 0 to `n`:
   - If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[last]` is greater than 5, update `max_count` to the maximum of `max_count` and `i - last` and increment `last` by 1.
9. Print the value of `max_count`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

int main() {
  unsigned int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  unsigned int max_count = 1;
  unsigned int last = 0;
  
  std::vector<unsigned int> a(n);
  for (unsigned int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }
  a.push_back(INT_MAX);
  
  for (unsigned int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (a[i] - a[last] > 5) {
      max_count = std::max(max_count, i - last);
      last += 1;
    }
  }
  
  std::cout << max_count << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program eliminates the need for sorting and improves the running time and memory usage by using a sliding window approach.
