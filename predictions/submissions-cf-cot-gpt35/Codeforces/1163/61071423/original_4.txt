To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary headers that are not used in the code. We can remove them to reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove them to simplify the code and improve readability.

3. Remove unused typedefs: The program defines several typedefs that are not used in the code. We can remove them to simplify the code and improve readability.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the slope and intercept for each pair of points, and then stores them in a set and a map. However, these calculations are not necessary to solve the problem. We can remove these calculations to reduce the running time and memory usage.

5. Use a more efficient formula: The program calculates the number of pairs using the formula `si * (si - 1) / 2`, where `si` is the size of a set. This formula can be optimized to `si * (si - 1) / 2` = `(si * si - si) / 2`, which reduces the number of calculations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

pair<int, int> slope(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
    int tmp1 = x2 - x1, tmp2 = y2 - y1;
    return {tmp1, tmp2};
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    set<pair<int, int>> s;
    map<pair<int, int>, set<pair<int, int>>> mp;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int x, y;
        cin >> x >> y;
        for (const auto& [slope, intercept] : mp) {
            s.insert(slope);
            mp[slope].insert(intercept);
        }
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            auto s1 = slope(x, y, a[j].x, a[j].y);
            s.insert(s1);
            mp[s1].insert({x, y});
        }
    }
    
    long long x = 0;
    for (const auto& [slope, intercepts] : mp) {
        int si = intercepts.size();
        x += 1LL * si * (si - 1) / 2;
    }
    
    long long si = s.size();
    cout << (si * si - si) / 2 - x << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

Note that I have removed the unnecessary code for debugging and the unnecessary functions and operators overloads.
